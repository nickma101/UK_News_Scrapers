Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe UK is imposing visa requirements for all visitors from five nations, with Suella Braverman citing \u201cabuse\u201d of the migration system as a reason.The home secretary said the changes were being made \u201csolely for migration and border security reasons\u201d and insisted it is \u201cnot a sign of poor relations\u201d with Dominica, Honduras, Namibia, Timor-Leste and Vanuatu.In a written statement to MPs on Wednesday, she said Dominica and Vanuatu\u2019s \u201coperation of a citizenship by investment scheme has shown clear and evident abuse\u201d. The two Commonwealth allies have been granting \u201ccitizenship to individuals known to pose a risk to the UK\u201d, she said.Ms Braverman said there had been a \u201csustained and significant increase\u201d in nationals from Namibia and Honduras who had \u201cabused\u201d their right to visit the UK for a limited period without a visa in order to claim asylum.\u201cAs such, Namibians and Hondurans rank first amongst non-visa nationals for asylum claims,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThese high numbers are unsustainable, contributing significantly to operational pressures which have resulted in frontline resource being diverted from other operational priorities.\u201dRecommendedChannel crossings top 14,000 for year so farBlow for Braverman as UK asylum ships \u2018sent back\u2019 after failure to find dockBorder Patrol fails to assess medical needs for children with preexisting conditions, report saysNamibia is another member of the Commonwealth of 56 mainly former British colonies.As for Timor-Leste, Ms Braverman said there had been a \u201csustained increase\u201d in its nationals arriving at the border as \u201cnon-genuine visitors\u201d. She said they often had \u201cthe intention to fraudulently claim EU Settlement Scheme status as dependants or to work illegally in the UK\u201d.Ms Braverman was allowing a four-week transition period for those who hold confirmed bookings to the UK to travel without visas before the new requirements come into force.It comes as the government cracks down on migrants attempting to claim asylum in the UK by crossing the Channel, with the Illegal Migration Bill now poised to become law. It passed its controversial plans to tackle the small boats crisis this week after defeating a final series of Commons challenges by Tory moderates.The provisional number of migrant crossings for 2023 so far is 13,774, which is still lower than the more than 15,000 arrivals recorded this time last year. Overall, 45,755 people made the journey in 2022.The reforms will prevent people from claiming asylum in the UK if they arrive through unauthorised means. The government also hopes the changes will ensure detained people are promptly removed, either to their home country or a third country such as Rwanda, which is currently the subject of a legal challenge.RecommendedBudget 2022: Hunt says UK in recession as he announces huge tax risesJeremy Hunt increases energy windfall tax in budgetJeremy Hunt freezes tax allowances and hits 45p rate payersUN human rights chief Volker Turk and UN high commissioner for refugees Filippo Grandi led outrage at the plans.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeMarks & Spencer has been refused permission to knock down and redevelop its flagship shop on London\u2019s Oxford Street after opposition from Michael Gove.M&S boss Stuart Machin said the decision is \u201cutterly pathetic\u201d and means the company will review its future on the historic shopping street.The Communities Secretary launched a public inquiry into proposals to flatten the 1929 Art Deco building near Marble Arch and replace it with a much larger 10-storey retail and office block last year after the plans had received support from local authorities.On Thursday, the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities confirmed that Mr Gove disagreed with the recommendation from inspectors to approve the plans and had \u201cdecided to refuse permission\u201d.The Government report raised concerns that its public benefits were offset by the potential harm to nearby heritage landmarks and criticised the environmental impact of the redevelopment.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveMr Gove found that additional storeys of offices would be more apparent than the current site and have a \u201csignificantly detrimental impact on the setting of Selfridges\u201d department store nearby.The carbon footprint and failure to reuse some existing resources was also considered a reason for permission to be blocked.In response, M&S chief executive Stuart Machin said: \u201cAfter a two-year process where our proposals were supported at every stage, our investment in 2,000 jobs, building one of the most sustainable buildings in London, improving the public realm and creating a flagship store, is now effectively in the deep freeze.\u201cToday the Secretary of State has ignored his appointed expert David Nicholson who recommended approval of our scheme.\u201cWhen 42 of the 269 shops on what should be our nation\u2019s premier shopping street sit vacant, disregarding the expert opinion and approval of the appointed planning inspector and playing to the gallery by kiboshing the only retail-led regeneration proposal is a short-sighted act of self-sabotage by the Secretary of State and its effects will be felt far beyond M&S and the West End.\u201cThe nation\u2019s fragile economic recovery needs Government to give confidence to sustainable regeneration and investment as well as following due process; in London and across the UK.\u201cToday the Secretary of State has signalled he is more interested in cheap shot headlines than facts and if it weren\u2019t so serious it would be laughable.\u201cWe have been clear from the outset that there is no other viable scheme \u2013 so, after almost a century at Marble Arch, M&S is now left with no choice but to review its future position on Oxford Street on the whim of one man.

He said he had slipped and fell down and damaged his shoulder.\u201dCorrigan\u2019s arm was subsequently placed in a sling, his father said.

That means putting more resources into preventing, investigating and prosecuting fraud \u2013 as well as supporting those who unfortunately become victims.\u201dFigures for overall crime published on Thursday from the ONS Crime Survey for England and Wales for the year ending March 2023 suggest people aged 16 and over experienced 8.7 million offences, down 15% from 10.2 million in a survey for the year ending March 2020.The report measures experiences of crime in the 12 months before interview, meaning the latest survey \u2013 which was conducted between April 2022 and March 2023 \u2013 reflects crimes that could have occurred as far back as April 2021.Estimates from the crime survey suggest there were 391,000 advance fee fraud offences in England and Wales, more than six times the number recorded in the survey for the year to March 2020 (60,000).\n\nTotal fraud has returned to pre-pandemic levels with a 14% decrease in bank and credit account fraud largely offset by a six-fold increase in advance fee fraud... from 60,000 to 391,000 offencesNick Stripe, ONSExperiences of crimes, as measured by the ONS survey, have been on a broad downwards trend since the mid-1990s.Nick Stripe, from the ONS\u2019 Centre for Crime and Justice, said: \u201cSome crime types are returning to their pre-pandemic levels, while others may have been affected by changes in people\u2019s behaviour during the pandemic and the subsequent lifting of social restrictions.\u201cOverall crime continues to be well below levels seen before the pandemic. This is in large part due to sharp falls in theft and criminal damage.\u201cTotal fraud has returned to pre-pandemic levels with a 14% decrease in bank and credit account fraud largely offset by a six-fold increase in advance fee fraud \u2013 where victims are tricked into paying upfront for services or goods that never materialise \u2013 from 60,000 to 391,000 offences.\u201cFor crimes which are well reported and recorded by the police, we can gain additional insight from police data.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeExperts are calling for stronger laws in the UK to protect people from heat stress for when it is too hot to work amid record-breaking heatwaves sweeping the planet from China to Europe and the US.Europe is currently experiencing devastating heat, with temperatures frequently going beyond 40 degrees Celsius in Italy, Spain and Greece, prompting health alerts.The UK currently has a respite from extreme weather as rains have kept temperatures down. But heatwaves are becoming increasingly common in the country, according to the Met Office, as it recorded its hottest June ever this year and smashed all-time temperature records last year. Scientists said heat is going continue to increase until greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels are slashed. Meanwhile, there is also an urgent need to adapt to the \u201cnew normal\u201d.Last year, the British workers\u2019 union GMB called for a \u201ctoo hot to work\u201d law to be passed that ensures workers are not compelled to labour in extreme heat conditions that pose significant health risks.RecommendedEuropean heatwave - latest updates as red alerts and record temperatures continueWhat is the difference between heat exhaustion and heat stroke?Why is there no UK heatwave as Europe swelters during Charon?While Europe has laws in place to determine when conditions become unsuitable for employees, till now there is no temperature limit set for workplaces in the UK. According to health and safety guidelines, workplaces are expected to maintain a \u201ccomfortable\u201d environment for employees. However, since the UK is more prone to extreme cold than heat, these guidelines only specify a lower limit in temperatures, indicating that temperatures in office settings should not dip below 16C.Europe is getting hotter twice as fast as the rest of the world, and several countries already have laws in place.In Germany, the maximum temperature that should be reached in the workplace is 26C.Spain has passed orders to ban outdoor work during heat and in France, employers have to make sure their workers are able to do their jobs under safe conditions, although an upper limit for temperature is not fixed.But with rapidly changing climate and an increased number of hot days, experts have said the issue is not just about having a requirement for an upper limit for temperatures.They have stated that working conditions also need to be accounted for, as some workplaces can be hotter than others.While there are calls for an upper-temperature limit, experts pointed out there isn\u2019t a \u201cone size fits all\u201d solution.\u201cAn arbitrary maximum temperature for a working environment may have an immediate appeal but it is not the solution unions may think it is,\u201d said Martin Williams, head of employment and partner at Mayo Wynne Baxter.\u201cWorking conditions are as variable as working types and there is no \u2018one size fits all\u2019. A kitchen or bakery is likely to reach a higher temperature far quicker than an office, for example.\u201d\u201cMitigating the effects of exposure to heat is what is required and this will depend on the individual and the workplace. It is a health and safety matter where assessment is key.Heatwaves can have significant health impacts on people, from heat strokes to exhaustion, especially on those with pre-existing conditions, often also leading to deaths. The World Health Organisation categorises heatwaves as among the most dangerous of natural hazards.Last year, heatwaves are estimated to have led to over 61,000 deaths in Europe, according to recent findings. While temperatures of 40C and above are usual in the tropics, for the UK and Europe where the population is not used to the extreme heat stress, these temperatures can be fatal. Tina Woods, CEO of Business for Health, a coalition of businesses, highlighted that data from the office for national statistics showed about 2.5 million people were forced out of work because of long-term sickness, adding that taking care of employees needs to be prioritised by businesses.RecommendedWorld\u2019s largest carbon-sucking factory starts operation in Iceland\u2018The climate crisis is a reality\u2019: Africa\u2019s summer of extremesAgainst the odds: The fight to save sea turtles in Ras Baridi\u201cFrom a long-term perspective, businesses need to make adequate adaptations to working arrangements to ensure they do not lose staff to health conditions as average annual temperatures rise,\u201d she said.\u201cWhether this be as simple as reviewing air conditioning and ventilation in the office and increasing flexible working arrangements or introducing health checks for employees, businesses must be placing the health of their employees at the forefront of their business strategy.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b9401851ac331da6c7bff7", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/mps-lindsay-hoyle-speaker-parliament-independent-parliamentary-standards-authority-b2378795.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Calls to end MPs\u2019 direct employment of staff rejected by Parliament reform body", "lead": "The Speaker\u2019s Conference decided against recommending staff be employed centrally, as suggested by many following a series of scandals.", "author": "Sophie Wingate", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 12:34:21", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:28.114926", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-20T12:34:21+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/20/11/d37c8ffcdff19455f49ebf1347ed6e79Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg5OTMxMjYz-2.70691752.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

He hasn\u2019t had to leave everything behind and had to travel with a small backpack.\u201cHe hasn\u2019t been in a room alone having left his family behind. He hasn\u2019t been a refugee trying to find a place to work and no-one is going to give you a permanent job because you are a refugee.\u201cLots of different things are happening at the same time.\u201dMr Mercer said the Government had made \u00a37,100 per person of flexible funding available \u201cto support move-on, including through providing deposits, furniture, rental top-ups and rent advances\u201d.In return for this \u201cgenerous offer\u201d, the minister said, \u201cwe expect families to help themselves\u201d.Bridge to Unity, an organisation which helps refugees arriving in the UK from various countries, questioned why \u2013 after almost two years of people living in hotels \u2013 local authorities and Government officials are making such \u201ca focused and driven effort to find accommodation\u201d in \u201cthe final hour\u201d.Its co-director, Alexandra Kenchington, told PA: \u201cShould these efforts and resources have been called on with such urgency sooner?

We hear from men that their children and their wives cry themselves to sleep every day asking \u2018please tell me you found us a house today?\u2019.\u201dMr Ibrahimi said while Government has provided support, the situation on the ground for refugees to find their own accommodation is challenging.He told PA: \u201cIt is really hard to be honest, it is really hard. For me, who has worked and who can speak the language, who is familiar with the rules, and familiar with the rent in London \u2013 when I try to apply (for a flat) myself it doesn\u2019t work.\u201dHe said for others who might not have the same level of English or who have a big family things are even more challenging.The Local Government Association said councils are \u201chugely concerned\u201d that Afghan families could end up homeless, with the prospect of all those who are still in hotels finding affordable, long-term accommodation in the areas they want to live in \u201cextremely challenging\u201d.It set the task in the context of \u201cincreased demand and acute shortage of housing available across the country, combined with other pressures from across asylum and resettlement schemes\u201d.Asked if he is fearful of homelessness, Mr Ibrahimi said: \u201cI am just living by hope.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeJeremy Vine\u2019s stalker has agreed to pay \u201csubstantial\u201d damages to the broadcaster after targeting him with a \u201churtful and distressing\u201d campaign of harassment, the High Court has been told.Alex Belfield, a former BBC local radio presenter, also wanted to \u201capologise unreservedly\u201d for making \u201cfalse allegations of dishonesty\u201d after settling a civil claim brought by Mr Vine, a judge heard on Thursday.In September, Belfield, then aged 42, was jailed for five years and 26 weeks after being convicted of\u00a0four\u00a0stalking\u00a0charges\u00a0against broadcasters, including the Channel 5 and BBC Radio 2 presenter.He was found guilty after a trial at Nottingham Crown Court of waging a relentless stalking campaign, with Mr Vine subjected to an \u201cavalanche of hatred\u201d.Mr Vine previously launched separate civil legal action against Belfield over his \u201ccampaign of defamation and harassment\u201d, a hearing in London before Mrs Justice Steyn was told.Gervase de Wilde, for Mr Vine, said Belfield had made \u201centirely false\u201d allegations in nine YouTube videos and eight tweets put online between May and August 2020.This included the false claim that Mr Vine was \u201cseriously and demonstrably dishonest\u201d because he had \u201cpublicly and repeatedly lied\u201d about his knowledge of the circumstances in which the BBC gave him \u00a31,000 for a memorial event for radio executive John Myers.Mr Myers, who died in June 2019, was one of Mr Vine\u2019s \u201cclosest friends\u201d, the court was told.Mr de Wilde said that as well as \u201cpublishing defamatory allegations of dishonesty and theft\u201d, Belfield also sought to obtain \u201cprivate information concerning (Mr Vine)\u201d, including the phone numbers of family and friends, \u201cfor the purposes of publishing and disclosing that information online\u201d.Belfield also encouraged members of the public to contact Mr Vine during his broadcasting work and during \u201chis day-to-day life\u201d, the court heard.Mr Vine was left \u201cdeeply distressed\u201d by Belfield\u2019s campaign, Mr de Wilde said, adding that it was \u201cparticularly hurtful and distressing\u201d that it focused on \u201chis honesty in relation to an event arising from the death of his friend, Mr Myers\u201d.\u201cThe defendant\u2019s defamatory allegations struck at the heart of (Mr Vine\u2019s) long-established reputation for integrity and probity in his work as a journalist,\u201d Mr de Wilde said.\u201c(Mr Vine) was also made deeply upset and anxious by the defendant\u2019s harassment of him, and he became concerned for the safety of his family.\u201dMr de Wilde said Belfield had previously \u201cremained defiant\u201d after Mr Vine brought his civil claim, denying liability, referring to the broadcaster as a \u201cliar\u201d in a video and alleging his publications were \u201cchallenging criticism\u201d.But after being convicted by a jury at Nottingham Crown Court in last year\u2019s separate criminal proceedings, Belfield now accepts that \u201cthe defamatory and seriously harmful allegations of dishonesty which he made against (Mr Vine) are entirely false\u201d, Mr de Wilde said.The barrister added: \u201cHe also accepts that the publications for which he was responsible have been found to have amounted to unlawful harassment of (Mr Vine).\u201dMr de Wilde told the hearing that Belfield had \u201cagreed to pay (Mr Vine) substantial damages, as well as his legal costs, and to give undertakings subject to a penal notice in respect of future publications and conduct concerning (Mr Vine)\u201d.Alan Robertshaw, representing Belfield, said the former local radio DJ \u201cnever had any basis at all to make the false allegations of dishonesty against (Mr Vine) for which he was responsible, and nor was there any justification for his harassment of (Mr Vine)\u201d.\u201cHe wishes to apologise unreservedly for the damage and distress caused to (Mr Vine) and his reputation by his publications and express his profound and unreserved regret for all of the harm for which he is responsible,\u201d Mr Robertshaw added.Mr Vine previously labelled Belfield \u201cthe Jimmy Savile of trolling\u201d during the criminal trial, which heard he repeatedly posted or sent abusive messages, videos and emails.Jurors accepted Belfield caused serious alarm or distress to two victims and found him guilty of \u201csimple\u201d stalking in relation to Mr Vine

Perhaps politicians should exercise more caution before issuing condemnations about developing stories? Maybe we should remember to treat any story in The Sun with extreme caution?\u201cAnd given this further example of intrusive prurience, we could all remind ourselves of why there was once widespread agreement about having an independent press regulator with teeth, something the Conservatives once supported, before getting frightened off by powerful press barons.\u201dCulture minister Sir John responded: \u201cWhilst the Secretary of State and I did ask to be kept informed by the BBC, it was a matter for them.\u201cAnd as he has suggested, they have established an inquiry internally to find out whether there are any lessons to be learnt\u2026 The Sun is of course a member of the Independent Press Standards Organisation (Ipso) which does have a code, and if there have been breaches of the code then that is a matter for Ipso to adjudicate.\u201dElsewhere in the debate Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle has weighed in on the BBC proposed cuts to local radio.RecommendedSummer getaway expected to spark \u2018bumper-to-bumper traffic\u2019Tobias Ellwood facing Defence Committee no confidence vote after Taliban remarksCertain types of fraud on rise in wake of pandemic, figures suggestHis comments came after Dame Caroline Dinenage, the Tory chairwoman of the Culture, Media and Sport Committee, raised concerns about the impact of the cuts to \u201cmany of the elderly, vulnerable and isolated people in our communities\u201d.Sir Lindsay interrupted the proceedings to tell MPs there might be \u201cempty studios if we are not careful\u201d, adding: \u201cAnd we certainly don\u2019t want to see the end of Radio Lancashire.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b9401d51ac331da6c7c00b", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/port-of-dover-inrix-nick-powell-wales-england-b2378772.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Summer getaway expected to spark \u2018bumper-to-bumper traffic\u2019", "lead": "Traffic jams are expected on major roads, while the Port of Dover is warning it could take up to two-and-a-half hours to pass through border checks.", "author": "Neil Lancefield", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 10:15:02", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:33.899190", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-20T10:15:02+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/20/11/c25035095a01fc5666fd6ced19c52a0aY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg5OTM0MDc0-2.73057337.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Asked about Mr Pendle\u2019s comments, Mr Lynch said the TSSA is \u201clargely an irrelevance on the railway\u201d and is risking thousands of its members being made redundant.RecommendedTrain strikes: Mick Lynch says companies \u2018brought strikes upon themselves\u2019All the UK strike dates confirmed for July 2023Tony Blair urges BBC to \u2018stand up for itself\u2019 as staff warned over Huw Edwards gossipHe told LBC that Mr Pendle had nothing to do with the negotiation of the deal on offer, which included a five per cent pay rise and no compulsory redundancies until 2025.\u201cPeter Pendle has never worked on the railway. He doesn\u2019t know anything about our industry,\u201d he said.The deal on offer predated Mr Pendle\u2019s appointment, but the TSSA was consistently involved in talks with the Rail Delivery Group acting on behalf of train operating companies. According to the Trades Union Congress, the RMT has 81,199 members, while the TSSA has 17,764.In a scathing attack, Mr Lynch added: \u201cThey decided to surrender in this dispute and give up and therefore thousands of their members will be made redundant if they are not careful.\u201cBut they are largely an irrelevance on the railway these days, they are a very small union.\u201cThey are losing all their members, they\u2019ve got hardly anyone left working on the railway.

So you\u2019d have to question the strategic thinking of our sister union on this issue.\u201dHe added: \"The RMT in their wisdom decided not to sign up ... it\u2019s not for me to tell sister unions how they should conduct their negotiating arrangements...\u201cI just find the situation that we\u2019re in, where we had an agreement, that governed [these changes] \u2013 I mean, we\u2019re opposed to them, but if they\u2019re going to be done they need to be done properly, and with the least damage to the travelling public and people working in the ticket offices.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeTwo convicted terrorists or \u201cterrorist risk\u201d offenders are being released from prison every week, a watchdog has revealed, warning that current monitoring practices are \u201cunsustainable\u201d.A joint report by the prison, probation and police inspectorates said there are not enough senior officials to oversee all 120 inmates due to be freed in the year to March 2024.Several attacks have been committed by previous terror offenders, including the Fishmongers\u2019 Hall stabbings, Streatham rampage and an attack inside HMP Whitemoor, while the 2020 Reading murders were committed by a radicalised violent criminal days after his release from prison.The Independent understands that al-Qaeda-inspired terrorists behind large-scale terror plots thwarted in the 2000s are now being considered for release, alongside Isis supporters and neo-Nazis convicted of lesser offences in recent years.Several court cases and inquests have revealed terrorist networking and radicalisation inside prison, and jail time is believed to have made some offenders even more dangerous.RecommendedTerror threat rising in UK as attackers become \u2018increasingly unpredictable\u2019 and harder to detectUK prisons must not become \u2018terrorist training grounds\u2019 as sentences increased, government warnedStopping terrorists is like \u2018finding needle in a haystack\u2019, Sir Mark Rowley saysThe security services anticipate more attempted terror attacks over the coming months, with the home secretary warning on Tuesday that the threat to Britain was rising as terrorists become \u201cincreasingly unpredictable\u201d.Sources expect the number of prison releases to peak over the coming months, but view the situation as the cost of jailing more terror offenders by disrupting past plots, banning terrorist groups and catching people encouraging attacks and spreading propaganda.MI5 must assess the risk posed by growing numbers of people approaching the end of their sentences, while juggling any monitoring of familiar faces with new subjects of interest and hostile state threats.The watchdog report said the demand was caused by increased terror arrests between 2017 and 2019, when a \u201cchange in both extremist activity and policing tactics\u201d saw more people prosecuted for lower-level terrorist offences.\u201cThis keeps people safe in the short term; however, it means those individuals will be released quicker, having received shorter sentences,\u201d it added. \u201cIt comes at a time when historical cases that involved attack planning and a risk of serious harm are now entering Parole Board windows for release.\u201dJustin Russell, HM chief inspector of probation, said he was \u201cencouraged\u201d by improvements in the monitoring of terror offenders but warned: \u201cThe risk of further terrorist attacks remains, and continued investment and commitment to interagency information sharing is essential.\u201dMan shot dead by police in Streatham attack was convicted terroristMatt Jukes, the head of UK counter-terror policing, has named the release of terror offenders as a key threat. \u201cHistory has taught us to be wary of those individuals both during their time in prison and on release,\u201d he warned in February. Enhanced supervision brought in after a string of terror attacks committed by convicts in 2019 and 2020 mandates that all terror offenders must be considered by the Parole Board before release, and then kept under the highest level of multi-agency monitoring for a year after release.But so-called \u201cterrorist risk offenders\u201d in the pool of 120 inmates may still be released automatically, because they were jailed for crimes falling outside specific terrorism laws and later identified by prison intelligence as a potential terror threat. Mr Russell said the monitoring of terrorists inside prison and after release had improved, with significant investment, new units, improved information-sharing and specialist training.\u201cBut there will be an increase in caseload for the National Security Division [of the probation service] as the longer-sentence prisoners start to get released, and some of the short-term guys are also being released,\u201d he told The Independent. \u201cThat will be a pretty big burden on them if the assumption is that every terrorism risk nominal has to be supervised for at least 12 months at the highest level.\u201dThe report said the model worked when a few dozen terrorists were being released annually, but was \u201cunsustainable\u201d for the number of people now being freed.It recommended a lower level of multi-agency monitoring for some terror offenders, potentially including a large number of young people who were jailed for viewing or sharing propaganda online, rather than planning attacks.Jack Merritt, 25, and Saskia Jones, 23, were murdered by a released terrorist prisoner during the 2019 Fishmongers\u2019 Hall attack (Metropolitan Police)The watchdogs also highlighted issues around the storage of important information and data on terrorists, and said that some offences committed inside prison were not being prosecuted - resulting in \u201cmissed opportunities\u201d to keep dangerous people behind bars.The inspection found that some terrorists were only assessed as a security threat, rather than for potential domestic abuse and child safeguarding risks.Andy Cooke, HM Chief Inspector of Constabulary, said: \u201cThe threat posed by terrorism hasn\u2019t gone away, and so, for the safety of our public and for our national security, efforts in this area cannot subside. \u201cAs we tragically witnessed in 2019 and 2020, mistakes can have devastating consequences, and therefore every agency involved must continue to do everything they can to prevent something similar ever happening again.\u201dA senior Counter Terrorism Policing officer said officers were \u201cabsolutely committed\u201d to improving the management of known terror offenders, and would respond to all the watchdog recommendations.Detective Chief Superintendent Maria Lovegrove said: \u201cKnown terrorist offenders will always pose a potential risk to the safety of the public and we must balance the management of new threats with the challenge this cohort presents. \u201cOur ability to do so is greater with genuine collaboration, and we will continue to build on the foundations outlined in the report in our efforts to protect the public.\u201dA Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: \u201cPublic protection is our number one priority and, as inspectors have noted, the government has significantly improved the work done to keep our streets safe from the threat of terrorism \u2013 including ensuring terror offenders face longer behind bars and increased supervision on release.\u201cWe will always ensure our work to keep the public safe from terrorists is properly resourced.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b9402251ac331da6c7c01b", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/homo-sapiens-wood-stick-weapon-schoningen-b2378210.html", "primaryCategory": "Home News", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Technological secrets from 300,000 BC: How one stick revealed early humans were more skilled than we thought", "lead": "<p>It\u2019s the first time that scientists have proved that pre-Homo-sapiens species of humans had developed sophisticated woodworking skills</p>", "author": "David Keys", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 07:01:38", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:38.054862", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-20T07:01:38+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/19/15/_Sch%C3%B6ningen%20double-pointed%20wooden%20throwing%20stick.png?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Get the free Morning Headlines email for news from our reporters across the worldSign up to our free Morning Headlines email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeNew archaeological research has revealed that now long-extinct pre-modern species of humans were much more technologically skilled than previously thought.Investigations led by a University of Reading archaeologist are showing that thousands of years before our species, <em>Homo sapiens</em>, existed, a now long-vanished early human species had developed sophisticated woodworking techniques.A detailed scientific study of a 300,000 year old wooden projectile (a so-called throwing stick), found at Sch\u00f6ningen near Hanover in Germany, has revealed that the timber (part of a slightly curved spruce branch) was chosen with great care and that it was then de-barked and slowly seasoned (perhaps using gentle heat from a fire).The archaeological investigation also demonstrated that the two ends of the 77 centimetre long projectile were then sharpened \u2013 and that the entire object was then sanded and polished to enhance its aerodynamic capabilities. It probably had a range of around 30 metres - and would have rotated, boomerang-style, when in flight. The very complex research into the Stone Age weapon involved three-dimensional microscopy, CT scanning and infrared spectrometry, to identify subtle surface and internal features. Although lightweight, the high velocity at which the weapon would have been launched would have resulted in deadly high-energy impacts.It\u2019s the first time that scientists have proved that pre-Homo-sapiens species of humans had developed sophisticated woodworking skills.RecommendedNHS \u2018could save \u00a3635m by prescribing time in nature\u2019July dates for DWP payments, benefits, pensions and cost of living top upsAugust dates for DWP payments, benefits, pensions and cost of living top upsSch\u00f6ningen double pointed wooden stick ( )The 300,000 year old prehistoric German throwing stick was abandoned by its Stone Age owners by the side of a now long-vanished lake \u2013 along with more than ten well-made wooden spears, each up to 2.5 metres long.Archaeologists are now, for the first time, carrying out a detailed study of several hundred broken and complete wooden artefacts found at the Sch\u00f6ningen site back in the 1990s. The project, being carried out by the Lower Saxony State Office of Cultural Heritage, is likely to produce a much more detailed understanding of early prehistoric craftwork than has previously been possible. The now long-extinct human species, whose members made the artefacts, is believed to have been an ancestor of our species (Homo sapiens) called Homo heidelbergensis.The spears and other wooden objects had been used by their Stone Age owners to hunt wild horses and red deer as those animals sought water at the edge of the lake. The throwing stick may possibly have been used to catch water birds - or to injure the horses and deer.An artistic reconstruction of how the stick would have been used by early humans (Beno\u00eet Clarys, Universit\u00e4t T\u00fcbingen)It\u2019s not known why the Stone Age Sch\u00f6ningen hunters abandoned so many pieces of hunting equipment. Some may have been discarded because they were broken, but others may have been lost among the tall lakeside reedbeds and in potentially deep mud and murky water.\u201cDiscoveries of wooden tools have revolutionised our understanding of early human behaviours. Amazingly these early humans demonstrated an ability to plan well in advance, a strong knowledge of the properties of wood, and many sophisticated woodworking skills that we still use today,\u201d said Dr Annemieke Milks, the Reading University archaeologist, who has been leading the research on the Sch\u00f6ningen throwing stick.Evidence for pre-Homo-sapiens woodworking is extremely rare.The earliest, albeit indirect, evidence comes from Tanzania. Archaeologists there have unearthed stone tools with evidence that they were used to work wood as early as 1.6 million years ago.Archaeologists also found a very ancient polished wooden willow plank in northern Israel - dated to around 750,000 years ago.Dr Annemieke Milks and colleagues examine the stick (Volker Minkus)The oldest weapon in the world (part of a wooden spear) dates from 400,000 years ago - and was found in Clacton, Essex, in 1911 (and is now on display in London\u2019s Natural History Museum).Another location, which has yielded a very early example of sophisticated wood-working (a spear) is Lehringen near Bremen in Germany. Found in 1948, it had been used to kill a large elephant 125,000 years ago.RecommendedNHS \u2018could save \u00a3635m by prescribing time in nature\u2019July dates for DWP payments, benefits, pensions and cost of living top upsAugust dates for DWP payments, benefits, pensions and cost of living top upsDr Milks\u2019 investigation into the Sch\u00f6ningen throwing stick has just been published in the open access online science journal, PLOS ONE: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287719The 300,000 year old Stone Age weapon is on display at the Forschungsmuseum in Sch\u00f6ningen."}, {"_id": "64b9402251ac331da6c7c01c", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/green-social-prescribing-nhs-report-b2378120.html", "primaryCategory": "Home News", "subCategories": "test", "title": "NHS \u2018could save \u00a3635m by prescribing time in nature\u2019", "lead": "<p>Government survey found 90 per cent of people said being in nature was good for their mental health  </p>", "author": "Maanya Sachdeva", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 07:00:36", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:38.274446", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-20T07:00:36+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2022/04/17/14/hiking%20signs.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Get the free Morning Headlines email for news from our reporters across the worldSign up to our free Morning Headlines email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

The study, published under the title, A Natural Health Service: Improving Lives and Saving Money, found that the amount of money saved in healthcare costs would be greater than the money invested.Environmental engineers Ricardo and the Institute of Occupational Medicine Health analysed five Wildlife Trusts programmes to see how much they benefited the NHS.They found that if just one of them was taken up by everyone likely to do so \u2013 estimated to be about 1.2 million people \u2013 the total healthcare savings would be \u00a3635.6m.Dr Amir Khan, NHS doctor and vice president of The Wildlife Trusts, said: \u201cWhat excites me about this research is that it shows the potential of Wildlife Trusts programmes to work alongside and reduce reliance on NHS services.RecommendedPolls open in triple by-election contest after Tories warned of \u2018tough battle\u2019All the UK strike dates confirmed for July 2023Travel insurers \u2018dealt with one new claim every two minutes typically in 2022\u2019\u201cProgrammes that tackle some of the causes of preventable illnesses: social isolation that can lead to feelings of loneliness or depression, physical inactivity \u2013 which is linked to musculoskeletal problems \u2013 and a lack of skills or prospects leading to economic inactivity.\u201cThe Wildlife Trusts\u2019 programmes can shoulder some of the burden of mainstream NHS services and they should be available to all health professionals, to refer patients to, where appropriate.\u201dA 2017 government survey found that 90 per cent of people said being in green spaces was good for their mental health. In July 2020, then-environment secretary George Eustice announced a \u00a34m investment in \u201cgreen social prescribing\u201d \u2013 schemes involving walking and gardening \u2013 with a view to prevent and treat mental illnesses within communities against the backdrop of the pandemic.

In this case, every \u00a31 invested reduced \u00a31.19 from the NHS cost burden.Another project, called MyPlace by Lancashire Wildlife Trust, brought down healthcare costs by over \u00a37,000 and employment-related costs from mental health by \u00a328,442. For every \u00a31 the NHS invested, it saved more than double the money. Dom Higgins, head of health and education at The Wildlife Trusts, said: \u201cThis new research proves the immense value of nature-based projects for improving individual health and helping to ease the burden on the NHS.\u201dThe Wildlife Trusts is now asking the government to integrate green social prescribing into community health and social care across the country, encourage shared investment from departments working on housing, employment, transport and culture, and support collaborative partnerships between healthcare services and organisations like itself. \u201cNature is an essential part of health and social care, but we are not maximising that potential. Green prescribing works and the more we can develop these kinds of programmes, the greater the benefit to society,\u201d Mr Higgins added.

\u201cimpossible\u201d after they reached the \u00a3150,000 halfway point of their campaign in five months.Teddy Lichten was diagnosed with high-risk neuroblastoma in July 2022, which develops from specialised nerve cells and means there is just a 40% chance he will reach his eighth birthday.In mid-February his parents launched a fundraising campaign which has garnered attention and fundraising action from people within their community of Hassocks, West Sussex, and further afield.The family\u2019s \u00a3300,000 target is required for treatment offered in the US which is unavailable in the UK, and his parents say it needs to be reached before the end of 2023 when Teddy finishes frontline treatment with the NHS.Speaking about reaching the halfway point, Teddy\u2019s mother, Kat Lichten, 34, a marketing professional, told the PA news agency: \u201cWhen we set out to raise up to \u00a3300,000 it seemed an impossible task, but I really believe we can do it now.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow live\u201cIt\u2019s been a long slog to \u00a3150,000 and it\u2019s been incredible to see all the support we\u2019ve had from the community, strangers up and down the county and even abroad as well.\u201cAll my friends were constantly going and checking, so it was one of my friends that texted me and said, \u2018We hit 150k\u2019.\u201dShe said people in the local community have taken on family fun days, quiz nights and some have even done a 100km bike ride, which she said has been \u201cinsane\u201d.Mrs Lichten said that trying to raise such a large sum of money has been a \u201chuge burden\u201d.\u201cWhen your child is diagnosed and you hear that they\u2019ve got a 40% chance of survival, you want to do absolutely anything in your power to better that,\u201d she said.\u201cWe\u2019re in the most stressful period of our lives trying to care for an extremely sick child and we\u2019ve also got a 17-month-old as well, and we\u2019ve also been spearheading a \u00a3300,000 fundraising campaign at the same time.\u201dShe said Teddy is aware that he is \u201cpoorly\u201d and the family has \u201cpointed out posters\u201d with his face on them to promote the campaign, but that he has found solace in playing with trains, which are his \u201cobsession\u201d.\u201cHe loves singing the theme tune of Thomas The Tank Engine and will spend hours playing out little scenarios with the trains,\u201d she said.Mrs Lichten said that when she found out Teddy had cancer it felt \u201clike our whole world imploding\u201d.\u201cWe were scared and confused, and I was angry at the world for making this his fate.\u201dShe added that the treatment protocol for the condition has been \u201cvery, very aggressive\u201d.\u201cTeddy immediately started a four-month regime of chemotherapy, where he was hooked up to chemotherapy drugs for 24 hours a day for seven to 10 days at a time in hospital,\u201d she said.\u201cHis immune system would completely go to pieces each time and he would end up with sepsis and then we\u2019d come back out from hospital just in time to go back in again for him to have his next round.\u201dShe added that he has also had two stem cell transplants and spent last Christmas Eve in intensive care after his first one.\u201cI actually ended up missing our youngest son\u2019s first Christmas because I was in hospital with Teddy,\u201d Mrs Lichten said.If the target is reached, Teddy will be steps closer to accessing a potentially \u201clife-saving\u201d treatment in New York, which \u201cteaches the body to do the work of immunotherapy on its own\u201d and is in the trial stage.\u201cIt\u2019s a cancer vaccine and it\u2019s only available at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Centre in New York,\u201d she said.\u201cImmunotherapy is very effective for neuroblastoma, but it\u2019s only active in the body when it\u2019s being given, so you can give it and then 72 hours after you stop giving it, it\u2019s completely out of the system.\u201dThe \u00a3300,000 target would pay for the family to take eight trips to America over three years.Mrs Lichten said she and her family are working with neuroblastoma charity Solving Kids\u2019 Cancer, who have a campaign running which has called on the Government to look into funding and push for European trials of the drug.\u201cIt can\u2019t be available on the NHS until there has been a randomised phase three trial here in the UK,\u201d she added.\u201cBut that would take about 10 years and about \u00a315 million of investment, so it\u2019s not anywhere near starting.\u201dShe added that the disease returns in almost 50% of children \u2013 sometimes months or years into remission \u2013 and if this happens, fewer than than one in 10 sufferers will survive.RecommendedOxford researcher to watch Barbie as \u2018dessert\u2019 to

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThousands of NHS consultants are on strike across England, causing large-scale disruption to patient care.Consultant doctors and hospital-based dentists are striking for 48 hours from Thursday until 7am on Saturday.Sir Julian Hartley, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents health trusts, told the PA news agency: \u201cThe impact of this strike on patients and services is likely to be the biggest yet.\u201cThe NHS cannot fully function without consultants.\u201dHealth leaders have warned that planned care will come to a \u201cvirtual standstill\u201d, with senior medics providing only emergency Christmas Day-style cover.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveThousands of operations, procedures and appointments have been cancelled and are being rescheduled in the first consultant strike action in a decade.It comes just two days after junior doctors staged a five-day walkout, the longest in the history of the NHS.More than 24,000 consultants voted in the British Medical Association (BMA) ballot for industrial action last month, with the vast majority (20,741 or 86%) voting in favour.The Government has told consultants they will receive a 6% pay rise but the BMA has called this \u201cderisory\u201d and said doctors have seen real-term take-home pay fall by more than a third over the last 14 years.According to the BMA, consultants on a 2003 contract earn a starting salary of \u00a388,364 in basic pay, rising to \u00a3119,133 after around 19 years.The Department of Health said extra payments such as clinical excellence awards and cash for being on call would take the average NHS pay for consultants in 2023/24 to around \u00a3134,000.\n\nThe strikes are also eroding staff morale as well as local employment relations between trusts, hospitals and their staffSir Julian Hartley, NHS ProvidersNHS trusts have been planning how to manage without their most senior doctors, with Christmas Day cover meaning, in many cases, that consultants will be \u201con call\u201d throughout Thursday and Friday.A letter sent to hospital chiefs by the BMA and NHS England earlier this month said care will be provided where there is a risk of serious harm (often called life and limb cover) caused by delaying or deferring procedures due to the strike action.This care may include urgent or time-critical services such as urgent palliative and end-of-life care, dialysis, urgent maternity care, mental health crisis care and critical cancer care, it said.The letter added that consultant strikes are \u201cdifferent to previous rounds of industrial action\u201d because \u201cno other worker can provide cover for consultants, and other staff groups are dependent upon supervision from consultants to be able to work. Almost no activity in a hospital can occur unless it is listed under and supervised by a named consultant.\u201dSir Julian told PA that, as the NHS\u2019s most senior doctors, consultants deliver the most complex care and supervise more junior colleagues.He added: \u201cEight consecutive months of industrial action is significantly hampering trusts\u2019 efforts to meet vital targets including reducing the waiting list for planned care \u2013 now at a record high of 7.47 million.\u201cThe strikes are also eroding staff morale as well as local employment relations between trusts, hospitals and their staff.\u201cWhile the Government has recognised doctors and dentists deserve a pay rise, the figure has not been agreed by the relevant union.\u201cFurther strike action can and must be averted. Both sides need to get round the table and find a way to agree on pay uplift that\u2019s fully funded by the Government.\u201d\n\nThis dispute is not just about one year\u2019s pay settlement, it is about the reality of 14 years of consultant pay falling behind, about our a loss in our pay in real terms of 35% and the broken pay review system that has allowed this to happenDr Vishal Sharma, BMADuring the 48-hour strike, the public is being urged to dial 999 for life-threatening emergencies and to contact NHS 111 online for other health concerns.GP services and pharmacies will be running as normal.Doctors are joining picket lines across England while a rally will be held at the BMA headquarters in central London on Thursday afternoon, attended by its consultants\u2019 committee chair Dr Vishal Sharma.In a statement, Dr Sharma said Health Secretary Steve Barclay had met doctors just once in seven months and had refused further talks on pay.Analysis shows consultant pay has fallen way behind the likes of lawyers, architects and financial advisers, the BMA said.Dr Sharma said: \u201cThis dispute is not just about one year\u2019s pay settlement, it is about the reality of 14 years of consultant pay falling behind, about our a loss in our pay in real terms of 35% and the broken pay review system that has allowed this to happen.\u201cLast week, the Prime Minister described the pay review body\u2019s 6% pay uplift as a \u2018significant pay award, one of the most significant we\u2019ve had in decades\u2019 and yet our profession languishes so far behind tens of thousands of other workers in terms of our pay and working conditions.\u201cConsultants will stand on the picket lines today because we are angry and at rock bottom.

It comes as ministers push to close hundreds of ticket offices in stations across the country amid the biggest strikes in 30 years.RecommendedMore than 100,000 appointments cancelled because of latest junior doctors strikeRail passengers facing further strikes from ThursdayNHS consultants reveal why they are downing stethoscopes to pick up placardsThe TSSA ceased its strikes in February after it came to a deal with employers that included a 5 per cent pay rise and no compulsory redundancies until 2025. But rail operators, backed by the government, have now reneged on the agreement and moved to close ticket offices \u2013 with staff preparing for as many as 2,000 job cuts. Employers say the RMT's refusal to sign up to the deal means it does not stand for the TSSA.\"The bottom line is because of the line that our colleagues are taking, the deal \u2013 which was a good deal \u2013 has been swept away and all these changes are being imposed. So you'd have to question the strategic thinking of our sister union on this issue,\" the TSSA's interim general secretary said.RMT leader Mick Lynch has said he has not met a Government minister since January (Jonathan Brady/PA) (PA Wire)Mr Pendle, a veteran trade unionist who was brought in to steady the TSSA's troubled leadership, added: \"The RMT in their wisdom decided not to sign up ... it's not for me to tell sister unions how they should conduct their negotiating arrangements and I'm sure that the TUC would tell me off if I did. \u201cI just find the situation that we're in, where we had an agreement, that governed [these changes] \u2013 I mean, we're opposed to them, but if they're going to be done they need to be done properly, and with the least damage to the travelling public and people working in the ticket offices. And my view is that that's not happening at the moment.\u201dAs the RMT's 20,000 members prepared to walk out on Thursday, a spokesperson for the union hit back, telling The Independent that \"what other unions want to do is up to them and their members\". \"RMT will never apologise for being a front foot fighting trade union that acts in the interests of its members,\" they said, noting that the union had signed deals in other disputes.The government and rail companies have in recent weeks signalled their intention to close hundreds of ticket offices across the rail network, with a public consultation in England set to run until 26 July.The biggest rail strike in 30 years continues on Thursday (Getty Images)Despite claims that the closures are an opportunity to redeploy staff winto more prominent customer-facing roles, train operators have already written to unions setting out a 45 day consultation period for proposed redundancies.Mr Pendle said he expected that the move would \"almost certainly\" raise the spectre of more industrial action. But he questioned the wisdom of walking out over the issue, adding: \"I mean, there we are, campaigning to keep ticket offices open. Should we go on strike to close the ticket offices that we're trying to keep open? You can see the point.\u201d The RMT's national rail members are to walk out on strike for three days this week: on Thursday 20, Saturday 22 and Saturday 29 July. Members of the Aslef train drivers union are also taking part in an overtime ban from Monday to Saturday this week.The TSSA is currently electing a new permanent general secretary, with Mr Pendle holding the interim role until latest this year when a successor is expected to be in place.It follows the departure of Manuel Cortes, who led the union for 11 years but who has retired amid allegations of sexual harassment. He denies any wrongdoing and apologised for any hurt caused by his behaviour. Mr Pendle joked he was trying to drag his union \"into the into the 19th century\", adding: \"I think we're beginning to look like a proper trade union that's fit for the 21st century going forward.\"An RMT spokesperson said: \"Our members renewed the mandate for strike action for the third time in the dispute with the train operating companies by a vote of nine to one. The pay offer made to us had a whole raft of unacceptable conditions. \"What other unions want to do is up to them and their members.

Here is a glance at the four leaders of those parties.___PEDRO S\u00c1NCHEZPedro S\u00e1nchez, Spain\u2019s prime minister since 2018, is facing reelection with recent ballots and most of polls against him.The Socialist party leader has steered Spain through the COVID-19 pandemic thanks to a successful vaccination program and dealt with an inflation-driven economic downturn made worse by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.RecommendedUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideBut his dependency on fringe parties, including separatist forces from Catalonia and the Basque Country, to keep his minority coalition going and his passing of a slew of liberal-minded laws, may cost him his job.S\u00e1nchez, known for his dashing looks and his progressive credentials that include having more women than men in his Cabinet and a strong environmental policy record, has boosted Spain\u2019s status in Brussels. The 51-year-old is also fluent in English, a skill his predecessors lacked.But the snap election called after the Socialists and their far-left coalition partners took a beating in local and regional elections in May may be an all-or-nothing gamble.S\u00e1nchez has embarked on a flurry of interviews in Spanish media and held rallies across Spain, hoping that he can pull off yet another surprise and stay in office. His chances will depend on mobilizing a demoralized left. A former basketball player and economics professor, S\u00e1nchez and his wife have two daughters.___ALBERTO N\u00da\u00d1EZ FEIJ\u00d3OTipped to lead his right-wing Popular Party to victory, Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o has had a meteoric rise in popularity since he took charge of the party in April, 2022 following an internal feud that toppled his predecessor, Pablo Casado.A former civil servant who won four consecutive regional elections in his native northwest Galicia \u2014 a traditional stronghold for the Popular Party \u2014 Feij\u00f3o was initially portrayed as a moderate. But with elections suddenly called and the far-right Vox party making inroads, he has moved notably to the right, promising to repeal many of the leftist government's laws and being more aggressive in his campaign to unseat Socialist Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez.Feij\u00f3o, 62, has been accused of fudging on whether he will form a coalition with Vox, lying about the Popular Party's record on pensions and trying to play down ties to a Spanish drug trafficker with whom he was photographed sunbathing on a yacht some years ago. Bespectacled and with the look of a bank manager, Feij\u00f3o is heir to the late Manuel Fraga, a fellow Galician and one-time top politician in the former Franco dictatorship. Fraga founded Alianza Popular, the Popular Party's predecessor. Experts speak of Feij\u00f3o's affable manner, sense of humor and talents as an organizer. But others say he demonstrated an irritated and somewhat superior attitude when cornered by one of Spanish television's top journalists, Silvia Intxaurrondo. Feij\u00f3o has also served as director of the state health service and national postal company.He and his partner have one child.___SANTIAGO ABASCALSantiago Abascal, the 47-year-old leader of the far-right Vox party, likes to style himself as an outsider who has arrived on a mission to save Spain's soul.He was a lifelong member of the Spain\u2019s mainstream Popular Party until he broke with the conservatives for what he considered their \u201ccowardly\u201d handling of the separatist movements in Catalonia and his native Basque Country. It was the failed secession bid by Catalonia in 2017 that fueled Vox\u2019s rise. Founded in 2014, it entered Spain\u2019s Parliament in 2019 when tensions in the streets of Barcelona and across Catalonia were still common.Bearded and barrel-chested, Abascal always wears suits while attending Parliament. He embraces the classic, even the kitsch, symbols of traditional Spanish culture.While the country slowly turns away from bullfighting, he and Vox defend it. While most party's hail Spain\u2019s transition to democracy from the dictatorship of Francisco Franco in the late 1970s, Abascal defends the nationalistic values of the regime. While the rest of Spain\u2019s political parties unite against gender violence, Abascal's Vox wants to repeal gender violence laws and slams feminism. Critics also accuse him of fearmongering about unauthorized migration.Add some mild anti-European Union sentiment, and Vox is allied with other far-right movements on the rise in Europe.Abascal is now on the cusp of what would be his greatest victory: becoming a deputy prime minister of Spain and placing some of his other hardline cohorts in ministerial roles. To do so, Vox will likely need to remain the third-largest force in Spain\u2019s Parliament and hope that the Popular Party wins the elections but falls short of an absolute majority. Abascal, who holds a degree in sociology, has four children.___YOLANDA D\u00cdAZThe only woman among the main four candidates in Sunday\u2019s election, Yolanda D\u00edaz, 52, is the daughter of working class, trade union and anti-Franco dictatorship activists. She hails from the small northwestern Galician town of Fene. Cutting a dashing figure with her mane of dyed blond hair and stylish clothes, she has been labor minister and in 2021 became second deputy prime minister to premier Pedro S\u00e1nchez.A labor lawyer by training, she is known for her ability to broker agreements such as the industrial peace deal she forged with unions and business groups, as well negotiating increases in the minimum wage and a special furlough scheme for companies during the coronavirus pandemic.She is consistently ranked as among the country\u2019s most popular politicians.Believing that Podemos has alienated many on the left, she formed a broad civilian movement called Sumar this year that has since managed to bring 15 small leftist parties, including Podemos, under its umbrella.She showed she has a tough side by refusing to include colleague and friend, Equality Minister Irene Montero whose reputation was severely marred by a sexual consent law that inadvertently allowed more than 1,000 convicted sex offenders to have their sentences reduced, and over 100 to gain early release. D\u00edaz's aim is to finish in third place Sunday so that Sumar can help the Socialists form another leftist coalition. Polls place Sumar slightly behind far-right Vox.Sumar proposes more tax for big businesses and the wealthy, a state-funded 20,000-euro payment (about $22,000) for everyone turning 18 to help with studies and measures to help hard-pressed people get to the end of the month.RecommendedSpain's political escape artist Pedro S\u00e1nchez has odds against him yet again in national electionVoting fraud claims spread ahead of Spanish electionSpain's early election could put the far right in power for the first time since Franco___Joseph Wilson and David Brunat contributed from Barcelona, Spain.

and essentials, typically by opting for cheaper alternative brands, according to the ONS.Further to that, 50 per cent of shoppers say they are buying fewer items altogether, 67 per cent say they have

credits, will receive \u00a3900 in instalments from this spring, with the money going directly to bank accounts in three tranches, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has said.There will also be a separate \u00a3150 payment for more than six million people with disabilities and an extra \u00a3300 for over eight million pensioners.Here are the payment windows that have been announced so

can expect in July \u2013 if last year\u2019s record-breaking heatwave is anything to go by \u2013 might not be comfortable for everyone but it will at least greatly reduce the need for having the central heating switched on, which proved such an expense over the course of the winter just gone.The government\u2019s Energy Price Guarantee (EPG) \u2013 introduced by Liz Truss last September to ensure households paid no more than \u00a32,500 for their electricity and gas, with the government subsidising the remainder owed to providers under Ofgem\u2019s Energy Price Cap (EPC) \u2013 was

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe post-pandemic cost of living crisis is continuing to make life difficult in Britain this summer \u2013 even after a degree of stability returned to the international energy market, allowing domestic heating bills to climb down after a long winter of sky-high prices.With inflation lodged stubbornly at 8.7 per cent, new woes have emerged for mortgage holders battling high interest rates and in the shape of bloated prices in the supermarket aisles, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) putting food inflation at 18.4 per cent in May.However, Sainsbury\u2019s chief executive Simon Roberts has said he believes that level is about to start falling as retail sales improve in response to the warmer weather, noting that the price of staple items like bread, butter, milk, pasta and meat fell at his supermarket during the second quarter of the year in response to more favourable trading conditions.That said, the news that supermarkets have been accused of profiteering from \u201crip off\u201d fuel prices on the forecourt, resulting in drivers being made to pay nearly \u00a31bn over the odds for petrol and diesel over the last year, is likely to further demoralise a beleaguered public weary of struggling against the economy.Below, we look at what support is available to households this August.RecommendedJuly dates for DWP cost of

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe polls have opened in three by-elections where defeats would heighten Conservative fears that Rishi Sunak will struggle to lead them to another Commons majority.The Prime Minister braced MPs at a meeting of the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers on the eve of the polls that they face a \u201ctough battle\u201d in what were seen as safe seats for his party.He told them that governing parties rarely win by-elections but urged the MPs to unite in the face of any defeat as he pledged to \u201cthrow everything\u201d at winning the next general election.Labour hopes to snatch Uxbridge and South Ruislip, which was Boris Johnson\u2019s seat until he quit, and Selby and Ainsty \u2013 vacated by his ally Nigel Adams\u2019 resignation.The Liberal Democrats are eying victory in the contest in Somerton and Frome that was triggered by David Warburton quitting after admitting cocaine use amid allegations of sexual harassment.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveLosses for the Tories in all of them would be the first time in 55 years that a government has been defeated in three by-elections on the same day.On Wednesday evening, Mr Sunak was understood to have told his MPs: \u201cIn the coming months, I am going to set out more of what I would do if I had a full term.\u201cI was recently described as a full spectrum modern Conservative and you are going to see that in the programme I lay out.\u201dMr Sunak pledged to show the public \u201cwho is really on their side\u201d, adding: \u201cAnd that is what will propel us to victory.\u201d\n\nI promise you we can do this but we can only do it together as one teamRishi SunakHe was conscious of the battle he will face if voters roundly reject the Tory candidates, but urged MPs to unite ahead of a general election expected next year.\u201cWhen we come back in September we have a choice to make, all of us.

I\u2019ve made my choice, I\u2019m all in with you to win,\u201d Mr Sunak told the meeting.\u201cI promise you we can do this but we can only do it together as one team.\u201dTory backbencher Jonathan Gullis told reporters outside the meeting that the problem is \u201capathetic Conservative voters\u201d rather than the public\u2019s support for Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer.He said Mr Sunak told them \u201cwhat we already know, which is it\u2019s going to be a tough battle\u201d in the by-elections.Tory MPs at the meeting said he did not address suggestions that he could spring a Cabinet reshuffle on Friday in an attempt to reset his premiership.During a visit to Warwickshire, Mr Sunak told reporters asking whether he would shake up his top team that \u201cyou would never expect me to comment on things like that\u201d \u2013 in what was clearly not a denial.He welcomed a fall in the rate of inflation as proof his Government\u2019s plans were working.The Prime Minister\u2019s press secretary acknowledged it would be tough for the Tories to hold the three seats on Thursday.She said: \u201cBy-elections, for incumbent governments, are very difficult, that is the nature of them.\u201cThe election that the Conservative Party is most focused on is the general election.\u201d\n\nThe election that the Conservative Party is most focused on is the general electionPrime Minister's press secretaryMr Johnson held London\u2019s Uxbridge constituency with a 7,000 majority when he was prime minister at the last general election in 2019.Mr Adams secured North Yorkshire\u2019s Selby and Ainsty with a 20,000 majority that night, a similar margin to Mr Warburton\u2019s victory in his Somerset seat.Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said: \u201cToday voters across Somerton and Frome have a chance to send a clear message to the Conservatives that they have failed our country on the NHS, the cost-of-living crisis and protecting our rural communities.RecommendedBBC local journalism strike to hit by-elections coverageBank\u2019s licence could be \u2018revoked\u2019 for banning customers over their political viewsCases of anti-Muslim hate \u2018have more than doubled\u2019 in a decade\u201cIf the Liberal Democrats succeed in overturning this massive 19,000 Conservative majority, it will show voters in Somerset are fed up with being taken for granted by Rishi Sunak and his failing government.\u201dSir Keir\u2019s spokesman downplayed Labour\u2019s chances, saying Uxbridge was not won even during the 1997 landslide victory and Selby would require the party\u2019s best by-election result since the Second World War."}, {"_id": "64b9402451ac331da6c7c026", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/dwp-cost-of-living-payments-b2378629.html", "primaryCategory": "Home News", "subCategories": "test", "title": "August dates for DWP cost of living payments, benefits and pensions", "lead": "<p>Food inflation lodged at 18.4 per cent, ONS warns, but supermarkets expect prices to begin to fall </p>", "author": "Joe Sommerlad", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 06:00:34", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:40.856339", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-20T06:00:34+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/28/00/1c00ddf92c1aa96bc1c27e439124a179Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg3OTUzOTMy-2.34653075.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Get the free Morning Headlines email for news from our reporters across the worldSign up to our free Morning Headlines email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe post-pandemic cost of living crisis is continuing to make life difficult in Britain this summer \u2013 even after a degree of stability returned to the international energy market, allowing domestic heating bills to climb down after a long winter of sky-high prices.With inflation lodged stubbornly at 8.7 per cent, new woes have emerged for mortgage holders battling high interest rates and in the shape of bloated prices in the supermarket aisles, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) putting food inflation at 18.4 per cent in May.However, Sainsbury\u2019s chief executive Simon Roberts has said he believes that level is about to start falling as retail sales improve in response to the warmer weather, noting that the price of staple items like bread, butter, milk, pasta and meat fell at his supermarket during the second quarter of the year in response to more favourable trading conditions.That said, the news that supermarkets have been accused of profiteering from \u201crip off\u201d fuel prices on the forecourt, resulting in drivers being made to pay nearly \u00a31bn over the odds for petrol and diesel over the last year, is likely to further demoralise a beleaguered public weary of struggling against the economy.Below, we look at what support is available to households this August.RecommendedJuly dates for DWP cost of living payments, benefits and pensionsFood bank use is a choice, suggests Veterans Minister Johnny MercerMotorists forced to pay 6p a litre too much as supermarkets accused of using customers as \u2018cash cows\u2019Extra \u00a31,350 of support being paid outDespite the expiration of Rishi Sunak\u2019s Energy Bill Support Scheme at the end of March (an initiative that handed out \u00a3400 in monthly instalments of \u00a366 and \u00a367), millions of households on low incomes will receive further cost of living support from the government this year worth up to \u00a31,350 in total.Eight million eligible means-tested benefits claimants, including people on universal credit, pension credit and tax credits, will receive \u00a3900 in instalments as part of a programme that began this spring, with the money going directly to bank accounts in three tranches, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has said.There will also be a separate \u00a3150 payment for more than six million people with disabilities and an extra \u00a3300 for over eight million pensioners.Here are the payment windows that have been announced so far, with more precise dates expected later in the year:\u00a3301 \u2013 First cost of living payment \u2013 already issued between 25 April and 17 May (or 2 to 9 May for people on tax credits but no other low-income benefits)\u00a3150 \u2013 Disability payment \u2013 during summer 2023\u00a3300 \u2013 Second cost of living payment \u2013 during autumn 2023\u00a3300 \u2013 Pensioner payment \u2013 during winter 2023/4\u00a3299 \u2013 Third cost of living payment \u2013 during spring 2024Bank holiday brings payment schedule changeThe usual state support in the shape of benefits and pensions payments will also be going out in August, although the arrival of the Summer Bank Holiday on Monday 28 means that anyone expecting to receive their money on that date can typically expect it to be paid into their bank accounts one working day earlier (Friday 25, for instance).That applies to anyone expecting to receive any of the following from the DWP in August:Universal creditState pensionPension creditDisability living allowancePersonal independence paymentAttendance allowanceCarer\u2019s allowanceEmployment support allowanceIncome supportJobseeker\u2019s allowanceFor more information on how and when state benefits are paid, please visit the government\u2019s website.Energy Price Guarantee expired as cap loweredThe sweltering weather we can expect to continue into August \u2013 which has already brought the warmest June since records began in 1884 \u2013 might not be comfortable for everyone but it will at least greatly reduce the need for having the central heating switched on, which proved such an expense over the course of the winter just gone.The government\u2019s Energy Price Guarantee (EPG) \u2013 introduced by Liz Truss last September to ensure households paid no more than \u00a32,500 for their electricity and gas, with the government subsidising the remainder owed to providers under Ofgem\u2019s Energy Price Cap (EPC) \u2013 was extended by chancellor Jeremy Hunt in his Budget of 15 March for a further three months.Mr Hunt had reportedly been tempted to increase the EPG to \u00a33,000, a considerably less generous offer that would have eased the burden on the state, but ultimately thought better of it, extending the guarantee into April, May and June.Now that the EPG has finally expired, consumers will once more be paying the EPC rate, which Ofgem set at \u00a32,074 for the third quarter beginning 1 July, a huge fall from the \u00a33,280 it was set at during the second quarter, from which households were shielded by the intervention of the government\u2019s overriding guarantee.That 17 per cent decrease reflects recent drops in wholesale energy prices \u2013 the amount energy firms pay for electricity and gas before supplying it to households \u2013 and, although it is a significant drop from the eye-watering rates of the last two years, the figure remains more than \u00a31,000 a year above pre-pandemic levels.As for what might happen next, consultancy firm Cornwall Insight predicts that July\u2019s fall will be followed by another drop in October, when it expects the typical annual bill to be \u00a31,976.RecommendedBudget 2022: Hunt says UK in recession as he announces huge tax risesJeremy Hunt increases energy windfall tax in budgetJeremy Hunt freezes tax allowances and hits 45p rate payersUnfortunately, it believes the typical bill will then rise again in January 2024 to \u00a32,045 and Cornwall does not expect energy prices to return to pre-Covid levels before the end of the decade at the earliest.It has also warned customers that prices remain subject to wholesale market volatility, with the UK\u2019s reliance on energy imports meaning that geopolitical incidents like the war in Ukraine could continue to have a detrimental impact."},

It passed its controversial plans to tackle the small boats crisis this week after defeating a final series of Commons challenges by Tory moderates.The provisional number of migrant crossings for 2023 so far is 13,774, which is still lower than the more than 15,000 arrivals recorded this time last year.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeTikTok is now the most used single source of news across all platforms for teenagers in the UK, new research from Ofcom has found.The regulator\u2019s News Consumption In The UK 2022/23 report found TikTok is the favoured single news source among 12 to 15-year-olds.TikTok is most popular with young people and used by 28 per cent of teenagers, followed by YouTube and Instagram, both at 25 per cent, according to the figures.But, taking into account all news content across its platforms, the BBC still has the highest reach of any news organisation among this age group \u2013 used by 39 per cent of teenagers.\n\nOver the last 12 months we've seen most major publishers refocus their strategy, partly as otherwise there's more risk of young people seeing unreliable newsNic Newman, Reuters Institute for the Study of JournalismRecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveIt comes after the UK Government banned ministers from using TikTok, which is a Chinese-owned video-sharing app, on their work phones following a security review.The House of Commons and the Lords also cited security concerns as they decided to ban the app across the Palace of Westminster.TikTok, owned by Chinese internet company ByteDance, argues it does not share data with China.However, Beijing\u2019s intelligence legislation requires firms to help the Communist Party when requested.Nic Newman, senior research associate at the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, said there is a big shift taking place in terms of how people consume news and that more publishers have been joining TikTok.He said: \u201cTikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, the people younger people are listening to tend to be influencers, personalities, they film for a range of reasons \u2013 in some instances you have specific news creators, in other cases it\u2019s just personalities, comedians, talking about issues including free school meals.\u201cIn terms of the implications for the industry, one of the things we\u2019ve really seen in the last 12 months is we have publishers who are very reluctant to go into TikTok, but over the last 12 months we\u2019ve seen most major publishers refocus their strategy, partly as otherwise there\u2019s more risk of young people seeing unreliable news.\u201cThat\u2019s more challenging as there\u2019s no business model for TikTok, so it\u2019s very hard.\u201cIt\u2019s just starting to build relationships with young people.\u201cThere\u2019s been surveys that show TikTok is amongst the least trusted platforms, partly as it\u2019s one of the newest.\u201dHe added: \u201cDuring the war in Ukraine we saw young people going to traditional news brands \u2013 but not for very long, it depends what the subject is to some extent.\u201cCovid was a big change because people were at home and people were talking about Covid on TikTok and people had a bit of time.\u201cThat\u2019s a case of very serious news being carried on TikTok.\u201cPassions and celebrity news, that\u2019s a big part of what\u2019s going on with the younger people, but there\u2019s also serious news, that\u2019s the wider big shift.\u201dWhen considering perceptions of trust, teenagers rated traditional sources better than their online counterparts, as BBC One/Two was trusted by 82 per cent of its teenage users, compared to TikTok at 32 per cent, Instagram at 38 per cent, Facebook at 41 per cent and Snapchat at 31 per cent. Twitter was the exception, with a 50 per cent rating on trust, Ofcom found.The news topics of most interest to younger teens generally are \u201csports or sports personalities\u201d (23per cent), \u201cmusic news or singers\u201d (15 per cent), \u201ccelebrities or famous people\u201d (11 per cent), \u201cserious things going on in the UK\u201d (8 per cent) and news about \u201canimals or the environment\u201d (9).Meanwhile, those aged 16-24 are much less likely than the average adult to access news from traditional media sources, such as TV (47 per cent vs 70 per cent), radio (25 per cent vs 40 per cent) and print newspapers (16 per cent vs 26 per cent).Social media platforms dominate the top five most popular news sources among 16-24s. Instagram is the most-used single news source at 44 per cent, followed by Facebook at 33 per cent, Twitter at 31 per cent, and TikTok at 29 per cent. Coming in joint second, BBC One at 33 per cent is the only traditional media source to feature in the top five.But Ofcom said its figures show broadcast TV news maintains its position as the most popular source among adults in the UK, used by 70 per cent, which rises to 75 per cent when broadcast video on-demand news content is included.BBC One remains the most-used news single source across all platforms at 49 per cent, followed by ITV at 34 per cent \u2013 although both channels have seen gradual declines over the past five years as they are down from 62 per cent and 41 per cent respectively.Similarly, Facebook \u2013 the third most popular news source among adults \u2013 is showing signs of decline, from 33 per cent to 30 per cent over the same period.TikTok\u2019s popularity as a source of news for adults is growing, with one in 10 adults saying they use it to keep up with the latest stories \u2013 overtaking BBC Radio 1 and Channel 5, both at 8 per cent for the first time.TikTok, at 55 per cent, along with Instagram, at 53 per cent, is particularly popular among adults for celebrity news. Twitter is the favoured destination for breaking news, with 61 per cent of adults choosing it, and political news, at 45 per cent, while Facebook is the preferred source for local news, at 59 per cent.Among users of the platforms, news sourced via social media is rated lower for trust, accuracy and impartiality than the more traditional sources of news, but is rated moderately well on \u201coffers a range of opinions\u201d, \u201chelps me understand what\u2019s going on in the world today\u201d and being \u201cimportant to me personally\u201d.One in ten (10 per cent) 16-24s claims to consume no news \u2013 twice the figure for all adults.After a long-term decline in the use of print newspapers \u2013 with overall reach of these news brands being supplemented by their digital platforms \u2013 Ofcom\u2019s most recent data shows print newspaper reach was consistent between 2022 and 2023.RecommendedTalk of AI dangers has \u2018run ahead of the technology\u2019, says Nick CleggEurostar passengers can avoid UK passport checks by having faces scanned\u2018Hostile states using organised crime gangs as proxies in the UK\u2019Just over a quarter of adults (26 per cent) accessed news via print newspapers, increasing to 39 per cent when including their online platforms.The Daily Mail/Mail on Sunday and The Guardian/Observer were the most widely-read print and digital news titles overall."}, {"_id": "64b9402651ac331da6c7c02b", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/nigel-farage-banks-andrew-griffith-house-of-lords-mailonline-b2378537.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Banks \u2018could lose licences for banning customers over their political views\u2019", "lead": "It comes after Nigel Farage\u2019s banks accounts were closed by Coutts because his views \u2018did not align with\u2019 the bank\u2019s values.", "author": "Cormac Pearson", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 03:32:01", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:42.283015", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-20T03:32:01+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/20/00/d58628258b3dd28e2c33c4105dd62094Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg5ODk0ODE1-2.73047564.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free Brexit and beyond email for the latest headlines on what Brexit is meaning for the UKSign up to our Brexit email for the latest insight\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Both sides need to get round the table and find a way to agree on pay uplift that\u2019s fully funded by the Government.\u201dDuring the 48-hour strike, the public is being urged to dial 999 for life-threatening emergencies and to contact NHS 111 online for other health concerns.GP services and pharmacies will be running as normal.\n\nI am disappointed the BMA is going ahead with this week\u2019s strike, given the average consultant\u2019s NHS earnings are expected to increase to \u00a3134,000 a yearHealth Secretary Steve BarclayDoctors are expected to line picket lines across England, while a rally will also be held at the BMA headquarters in central London on Thursday afternoon, attended by its consultants\u2019 committee chair Dr Vishal Sharma.In a statement, Dr Sharma said Health Secretary Steve Barclay had met doctors just once in seven months and had refused further talks on pay.Analysis also shows consultant pay has fallen way behind the likes of lawyers, architects and financial advisers, the BMA said.Dr Sharma said: \u201cThis dispute is not just about one year\u2019s pay settlement, it is about the reality of 14 years of consultant pay falling behind, about our a loss in our pay in real terms of 35% and the broken pay review system that has allowed this to happen.\u201cLast week, the Prime Minister described the pay review body\u2019s 6% pay uplift as a \u2018significant pay award, one of the most significant we\u2019ve had in decades\u2019 and yet our profession languishes so far behind tens of thousands of other workers in terms of our pay and working conditions.\u201cConsultants will stand on the picket lines today because we are angry and at rock bottom. We never wanted to be forced into taking this huge step.\u201cThe Government has had seven months to work with us to take our concerns seriously, to listen to us and to find a way to avoid industrial action. Ministers have done absolutely nothing to stop this action taking place.\u201cWe will be on the picket lines today, knowing our pay has flatlined so disastrously, knowing we are undervalued and overworked but also knowing that we remain willing to talk to Steve Barclay as he has the power to halt the strike action by presenting us with a credible offer that we put to our members.\u201dMr Barclay said he hugely valued the work of NHS consultants and had accepted independent pay review body recommendations in full to give the medics a 6% pay rise this year, on top of last year\u2019s 4.5% increase.He added: \u201cThis Government has also reformed pension tax rules for consultants, something the BMA campaigned for over many years.RecommendedTech-savvy UK businesses to invest in AI to replace staff and cut costs \u2013 HSBCRoyal Mint revenues jump as coronation sparks demand for commemorative coinsStudents taking Government\u2019s flagship T-level courses felt \u2018misled\u2019 \u2013 Ofsted\u201cI am disappointed the BMA is going ahead with this week\u2019s strike, given the average consultant\u2019s NHS earnings are expected to increase to \u00a3134,000 a year.\u201cMy door is always open to discuss non-pay issues, but this pay award is final so I urge the BMA to end their strikes immediately.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b9402751ac331da6c7c031", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/prime-minister-tories-mps-rishi-sunak-uxbridge-b2378516.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Tories braced for defeats in triple by-election contest", "lead": "Rishi Sunak warned they face a \u2018tough battle\u2019 as Labour and Lib Dems hope to steal the three seats.", "author": "Sam Blewett", "datePublished": "2023-07-19 23:01:12", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:43.755245", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-19T23:01:12+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/20/00/4fc549d6f1c28100e67b1b036835a19eY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg5ODkxOTIw-2.73048518.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

review found.The number of students who progress to the second year of T-level courses is \u201clow in many providers\u201d \u2013 and many leave before the end of the two-year course, according to the report by the education watchdog.The first T-level courses in England were launched by the Government in September 2020 as technical alternatives to A-levels.A review by Ofsted found that teachers are struggling to teach some T-level content in \u201csufficient depth\u201d, or set work that is \u201cchallenging\u201d.It added that staff are concerned that parents still do not understand T-levels, and that the brand\u2019s reputation has been \u201cdamaged\u201d by problems with exams last year and with delays in rolling out new T-levels.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over

want to addressAmanda Spielman, Ofsted chief inspectorIn March, Education Secretary Gillian Keegan announced that the launch of four new T-levels was being delayed amid concerns about the quality of the qualifications on offer.The two-year T-levels, which are broadly equivalent to three A-levels, were developed to help meet the needs of industry and prepare students for work.But the review, which was commissioned by the Department for Education (DfE), said students\u2019 experiences on T-level courses \u201cvary considerably\u201d.The report said: \u201cAt their best, T-levels provide an opportunity to combine high-quality study of theory with excellent development of practical skills.\u201cAt worst, courses are not at all what students expected, and many students reported being misled and ill-informed about their content and structure.\u201dIt found that in a few providers, no students progressed into the second year of the T-level course \u201cbecause of their poor experience\u201d in the first year.Many students who completed T-level courses moved on to university to study a degree of their choice, but some students were unable to go to their preferred university with the qualification, the report said.\n\nWe have already made good progress to address many of the areas highlighted in the report, but we know further action is neededDepartment for Education spokesmanIn some cases, students who wanted to go to university were left \u201csurprised and disappointed\u201d that T-levels are not always accepted as a valid entry qualification, it found.The report has called on providers to make sure that students receive \u201caccurate information\u201d about T-level courses before they enrol, and staff teaching theoretical content of T-levels are trained effectively.It has urged the DfE to \u201csubstantially raise public awareness\u201d of T-levels and to encourage all universities to accept T-levels \u201cas a valid entry qualification\u201d.Amanda Spielman, chief inspector of Ofsted, said: \u201cAs with many new qualifications, there are some teething issues with T-levels, but in most cases providers and employers seem to be working well together to address them.\u201cHowever, we saw a range of shortcomings which providers and the Department for Education will want to address.\u201cWhen done well, they can be a strong option for learners who prefer a vocational route through education as a path to their intended career.\u201dThe Ofsted report is based on findings from inspector visits to providers offering T-level courses in the 2021/22 academic year, as well as\u00a0in 2022/23.It has also called on the DfE to carefully consider the implications and impact of the planned withdrawal of funding for other similar courses \u201cto ensure that students are not disadvantaged\u201d.David Hughes, chief executive of the Association of Colleges (AoC), said Ofsted\u2019s review \u201cexposes a programme which is complex and therefore running into understandable implementation issues and glitches\u201d.He said: \u201cIt was always going to be like that because curriculum and qualification reforms and changes are extremely difficult to implement across education.\u201dMr Hughes added: \u201cThe risk is too great to shut down funding for qualifications which are working well for learners now in the hope that the new T-levels will be better because we want them to be.\u201cBetter to wait until the new qualifications are working well before we pull the plug on any existing qualifications.\u201dJames Kewin, deputy chief executive of the Sixth Form Colleges Association, said: \u201cToday\u2019s report is clear that T-levels are not yet the gold standard, mass market replacement for BTECs the Government believes them to be.\u201dHe added: \u201cWe all want T-levels to succeed, but not at any cost, and leaving tens of thousands of BTEC students without a pathway to higher education or employment is not a price worth paying.\u201dA DfE spokesman said: \u201cWe commissioned this report from Ofsted to support the rollout of T-levels and we welcome the recognition

The proportion jumps to nearly half of companies who are laser-focused on growth.It comes as more than one million job vacancies were recorded in the latest quarter, according to the Office for National Statistics. Vacancies spiked following the pandemic, driven by a rise in older workers leaving the labour market.But job postings have been steadily dropping as companies are coming under continued cost pressures, leading recruitment activity to slow.More than 60% of companies prioritising tech development want to use it to improve experiences for customers, the report revealed.It comes after telecoms giant BT announced it will be shedding about 10,000 jobs by the end of the decade as it digitises and relies more on automation.In particular, it wants customers to use its website and app for things like account servicing and upgrades, rather than relying on call centres.However, HSBC\u2019s survey revealed that some smaller businesses feel tech innovations are out of reach for them, while large corporations have more access to AI and automation capabilities.Some 38% of small firms said they lacked optimism about the year ahead and were instead focused on staying afloat.Stuart Tait, the head of UK commercial banking at HSBC, said: \u201cWe have seen a huge rise in the number of ambitious and innovative businesses keen to unlock the potential that technology can bring.\u201cWhile technology is not a cure all, it is an enabler to success; it is cause for concern that smaller businesses are struggling to engage and risk being left behind.\u201dRecommendedRoyal Mint revenues jump as coronation sparks demand for commemorative coinsStudents taking Government\u2019s flagship T-level courses felt \u2018misled\u2019 \u2013 OfstedTravel insurers \u2018dealt with one new claim every two minutes typically in 2022\u2019Meanwhile, Hollywood actors have joined picket lines in the US amid the biggest industry strike in 60 years, with unions protesting against decisions by major studios that could see AI tools replace their roles.Screenwriters are also striking amid fears that AI could be used to write or edit scripts."}, {"_id": "64b9402951ac331da6c7c037", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/tanzania-mount-kilimanjaro-tenerife-gwr-limerick-b2378518.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Harpist begins mission to break Guinness World Record on Mount Kilimanjaro", "lead": "Siobhan Brady hopes to break a record she set in 2018 for the highest altitude harp performance.", "author": "Danielle Desouza", "datePublished": "2023-07-19 23:01:00", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:45.261965", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-19T23:01:00+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/20/00/18200732-298cfb65-a544-4928-ac7d-62f6ff548372.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

her favourite moments from training has been reaching the top of Carrauntoohil, the highest mountain in Ireland, in the snow.\u201cThat was the big standout for me\u2026 we were huddling together on

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeLast year travel insurers dealt with a new claim every two minutes typically, according to analysis from the Association of British Insurers (ABI).The number and cost of claims rose significantly, reflecting a return to pre-pandemic travel levels, after lower claims due to the Covid travel restrictions, the ABI said.Travel insurers dealt with 362,000 claims in 2022, surging by 148% compared with 2021.Total claim payouts, at \u00a3352 million, leapt by 230% on the total recorded by the ABI in 2021.Holidaymakers are also being reminded to take details of their insurer with them when they go abroad.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveThe ABI highlighted one significant payout for emergency overseas medical treatment covered by travel insurance, which came to \u00a3250,000.Someone visiting Thailand suffered a serious blood infection needing intensive medical treatment and an air ambulance back to the UK. The total bill, paid by the travel insurer, was \u00a3250,000.In another case, a holidaymaker in Spain needed private medical treatment for a kidney infection. This cost \u00a315,000, covered by travel insurance.It also said that last year there were big rises in cancellation and medical expenses claims.\n\nMost holidaymakers remember their travels for all the right reasons, but for a few it turns into the stuff of nightmaresLouise Clark, ABIThe number of cancellation claims, at 129,000, rose by 75% on 2021. There were 112,000 medical claims, a leap of 235%, with payouts totalling \u00a3197 million.Spain, the United States, Greece and France were the top overseas destinations in 2022 for people making medical claims on their travel insurance.The average travel insurance claim last year was the highest on the ABI\u2019s records going back to 2004, at \u00a3973. The average emergency medical treatment claim was \u00a31,750, also the highest on record.Claim payouts tend to rise with age, with an average claim value of \u00a3571 for holidaymakers aged 36 to 40, rising to \u00a31,950 for holidaymakers aged 71 to 75.Louise Clark, the ABI\u2019s policy adviser, general insurance, said: \u201cMost holidaymakers remember their travels for all the right reasons, but for a few it turns into the stuff of nightmares.\u201cNo one wants to think of anything spoiling their holiday, but if it does, you could be left counting the cost for many years. The risk of falling seriously ill or injured while overseas can be financially horrendous, as well as very stressful. Travel insurance should always be an essential holiday purchase, and never a nice-to-have.\u201dHere are six essential travel insurance tips from the ABI for your summer getaway:1. Make sure it is safe to travel. Check and follow the latest foreign travel advice on gov.uk from the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO). Travelling against it is likely to invalidate your travel insurance.Always follow local health advice, such as dealing with heatwaves. Your travel insurance will apply in the usual way if you need emergency medical treatment due to extreme weather.2. Be honest and open when applying for cover, especially around any pre-existing medical conditions, or medication you may be taking.3. Read your policy, so you understand what you are covered for, and what limits and exclusions apply.4. Take your travel insurer\u2019s emergency helpline contact details, so you can contact them if the worst happens.RecommendedTech-savvy UK businesses to invest in AI to replace staff and cut costs \u2013 HSBCRoyal Mint revenues jump as coronation sparks demand for commemorative coinsStudents taking Government\u2019s flagship T-level courses felt \u2018misled\u2019 \u2013 Ofsted5. Have your EHIC, or get a GHIC, if travelling to Europe. If you hold a current European Health Insurance Card (the EHIC entitles you to access state-provided health care when visiting the EU), this remains valid until its expiry date. After that, or if you do not have an EHIC, you will need to apply in the same way (for free through NHS online) for a Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC). Neither the EHIC or the GHIC is a replacement for travel insurance as it will not cover you for all medical costs, or the cost of emergency repatriation back to the UK.6. Know your rights if facing travel problems. Get as much information as you can, so that, in the event of any travel problems, you know what you are entitled to and from whom. Check if your travel insurance covers travel disruption, which will cover certain non-refundable costs because of specific circumstances (for example, strike or industrial action and airport closures), when other consumer protections do not apply."}, {"_id": "64b9402951ac331da6c7c039", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/rob-burrow-kevin-sinfield-mnd-leeds-leeds-rhinos-b2378517.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Two books inspired by Rob Burrow and Kevin Sinfield\u2019s friendship to be released", "lead": "Sinfield carried his former rugby teammate Burrow, who has MND, over the finish line at a marathon in Leeds so they could complete it together.", "author": "Charlotte McLaughlin", "datePublished": "2023-07-19 23:01:00", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:45.714087", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-19T23:01:00+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/20/00/e800b53729df80d7d8ca0613edf38eaeY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg5ODY1Njc1-2.72167912.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeIreland\u2019s premier said coming to face to face with the horrors inflicted by Russia has convinced him that Ukraine will ultimately emerge from the war victorious.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar pledged to stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes after holding talks with President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv.On a day-long unannounced trip to the Ukrainian capital, Mr Varadkar visited the sites of several atrocities committed in the early weeks of the Russian invasion.He was taken to the church grounds where a mass grave was found and a bridge where fleeing civilians were bombed and laid a soft toy at a memorial for children killed in the conflict, the youngest just two days old.The Taoiseach also participated in a number of other wreath and flower-laying ceremonies to commemorate those who have lost their lives defending Ukraine.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow live\u201cI came face to face with the horror that Russia\u2019s forces have inflicted on civilians here in Ukraine,\u201d he said afterwards.After an hour-long meeting with President Zelensky, Mr Varadkar reiterated Ireland\u2019s support for Ukraine\u2019s accession to the EU and called for the negotiation process to start before the end of the year.He also committed to taking a lead role to set up international tribunals to prosecute crimes committed in Ukraine and to assist in efforts to de-mine vast swathes of Ukrainian land.The Taoiseach made clear that while Ireland was militarily neutral it was not politically neutral, and announced an additional five million euro in humanitarian funding to help respond to the attack on the kakhovka dam and other areas.\u201cPerhaps Russia believes that it can break the resolve of the Ukrainian people, but I know from the way you fought for the past few years, and from my visit here, that it cannot,\u201d he said.\u201cMy visits to the sites of these atrocities this morning, and my meeting here in Kyiv, has confirmed to me that Russia will not succeed, and Russia cannot be allowed to succeed.\u201cThis is the 21st century and the idea that national boundaries can be changed by violence, or the democratically elected governments can be overthrown by foreign invasion, must perish.\u201cWe need to make sure that Ukraine succeeds, that it wins this war, so that no other country gets attacked.\u201cIf Russia thinks that targeting civilians and essential infrastructure will discourage Ukraine\u2019s friends, including Ireland, well, it\u2019s wrong.\u201dHe added: \u201cWe will stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes. Ukraine will prevail and Ukraine will be rebuilt.\u201dMr Varadkar also revealed that an investigation is under way into an image of a drone downed in Ukraine which had a \u201cMade In Ireland\u201d stamp on it.Asked how such a part could potentially have got into Russian hands, Mr Varadkar said: \u201cWe don\u2019t believe any Irish companies have evaded sanctions, but there are third parties that find ways around the sanctions, and it\u2019s really important that we crack down on that and we do take it very seriously.\u201dMr Zelensky thanked the people of Ireland for taking in tens of thousands of Ukrainian refugees since the Russian invasion began.\u201cThis is a significant moral support to our nation,\u201d he said.\u201cYou\u2019ve hosted 86,000 Ukrainian citizens, you\u2019ve provided them with accommodation, with funding, with access to education and health support, this is very important.\u201dMr Zelensky said it was a \u201cfruitful\u201d meeting where they spoke about the sanctions package against Russia, about how to stop Russia producing missiles and Ukraine\u2019s accession to the EU.He also informed Mr Varadkar about the recent Russian attacks on its port cities, including Odesa. He said Russia was targeting residential areas and food infrastructure, which was not only an attack on Ukraine, but on \u201cglobal stability\u201d.\u201cIt\u2019s important that every country of the world which is striving for peace, for normal life, on all continents, it\u2019s important for them to condemn the Russian terror and participate in common efforts to overcome this aggression,\u201d he said.\u201cIreland is participating in such common efforts.\u201dMr Zelensky also said he was \u201cvery grateful\u201d that the Taoiseach began his visit in Kyiv\u2019s suburbs, stating that he had \u201cseen with your own eyes the consequences of the war, the consequences of Russia\u2019s aggression\u201d.After the engagement with the president, Mr Varadkar then met Ukraine\u2019s Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal and the chairman of the Verkhovna Rada parliament, Ruslan Stefanchuk.The Taoiseach\u2019s intensive schedule of engagements began in the early morning when he disembarked from an overnight train from Poland to travel to the Kyiv Oblast region on the northern outskirts of the city.He was taken to the small cities of Bucha and Irpin, where scores of civilians were killed during a period of Russian occupation at the start of the war.In Bucha, Mr Varadkar visited the Church of St Andrew where a mass grave was discovered after Russian soldiers retreated from the area.Inside the building he was shown an exhibition of images of the graphic scenes captured during the exhumation process.Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general Andrei Kostin accompanied the Taoiseach on the visit and explained the work done to collect evidence for war crimes investigations and secure justice for those killed.The Taoiseach\u2019s tour also took him through the village of Horenka, where he was taken to an apartment block that was heavily damaged in a Russian aerial bombardment.The shelling blew a huge hole in the side of the building and the interiors of the apartments that were destroyed are clearly visible.Among the debris was a painting of an old man enjoying a bath, representing the defiance of residents.Horenka is where Irish-born cameraman Pierre Zakrzewski was killed in a Russian attack in March 2022.Mr Zakrzewski, 55, who worked for Fox News, was killed alongside Ukrainian freelance journalist Oleksandra \u201cSasha\u201d Kuvshynova, 24.The Irish premier also visited Moschun, a village that witnessed a pivotal battle in the fight to repel a full-scale invasion of Kyiv.Mr Varadkar laid flowers and observed a moment\u2019s silence to commemorate the Ukrainian fighters, most from the territorial reserves, who were killed in defence of the capital.He also visited a bridge in Irpin where Russian forces bombed civilians fleeing the conflict. The bridge was later blown up by Ukrainian troops in an effort to prevent Russian tanks from entering Kyiv.Later in the morning, Mr Varadkar visited Mikhailivska Square (St Michael\u2019s Square) in central Kyiv, where he watched as two Ukrainian soldiers laid a wreath on behalf of the Irish Government at a ceremony at the Wall of Remembrance of the Fallen for Ukraine.The Taoiseach was then shown the remnants of several Russian tanks and other military vehicles on display in the square.Later in the day, Mr Varadkar met a Ukrainian actor who was assaulted in Dublin last month.Oleksandr Hrekov was attacked in Dublin city centre shortly after performing at the city\u2019s Abbey Theatre.He was part of a Kyiv theatre company that had travelled to Dublin to put on a production of Translations by Irish playwright Brian Friel.

He described how he flew in missions coordinated and supported by British and US commanders to take out terrorists and eliminate drug production networks. When the coalition troops left in August 2021, the pilot was among those dangerously exposed. The Taliban took over their offices and uncovered every detail about him \u2013 his email address, his phone number and where he lived. He waited in hiding in Afghanistan for several months before making the decision to leave his family and find safe refuge. A long journey over land and sea culminated in a dangerous journey across the Channel last November.

His application to the Ministry of Defence\u2019s Afghan Relocation and Assistance Policy was rejected because the government said that his pilot role was not one in which \u201cthe UK\u2019s operations in Afghanistan would have been materially less efficient or materially less successful if a role of that nature had not been performed\u201d.

Mr Griffith said: \u201cIt would be of serious concern if financial services were being denied to anyone exercising their right to lawful free speech.\u201cBusinesses have the right to protect against reputational risks, eg criminal activity, but the privilege of a banking licence in a democracy should imply a duty not to \u2018de-bank\u2019 because you disagree with someone\u2019s views.\u201dAnd home secretary Suella Braverman launched a review of the Home Office\u2019s own diversity policies, saying the row exposed the \u201csinister nature\u201d of the \u201cdiversity, equity and inclusion industry\u201d. \u201cApparently anyone who wants to control our borders & stop the boats can be branded \u2018xenophobic\u2019 & have their bank account closed in the name of \u2018inclusivity\u2019,\u201d she tweeted.

The 40-page document showed the bank raised concerns Mr Farage was \u201cxenophobic and racist\u201d, citing his having retweeted a Ricky Gervais joke and his friendship with Novak Djokovic.Writing in The Daily Telegraph, the former Ukip leader said: \u201cI believe Coutts targeted me on personal and political grounds, for its report reads rather like a pre-trial brief drawn up by the prosecution in a case against a career criminal.\u201dHe called for a BBC reporter to apologise for earlier reporting that his accounts were shut because of a lack of money, and not his political views.Mr Farage said: \u201cWill Simon Jack and BBC News be apologising for their reporting on this story?\u201cThe BBC must correct their original story about me. I will be making a complaint.\u201dIn a statement, Coutts said: \u201cOur ability to respond is restricted by our obligations of client confidentiality. \u201cDecisions to close accounts are not taken lightly and take into account a number of factors including commercial viability, reputational considerations, and legal and regulatory requirements.\u201dBut as well as the PM and home secretary, the bank came under fire from energy secretary Grant Shapps, who said the closure of Mr Farage\u2019s accounts was \u201cabsolutely disgraceful\u201d.

And banks shouldn\u2019t be refusing to open accounts on that basis as well.\u201cYet there is a very long-running problem within this country where banks are misapplying the guidance and rules. And not just closing accounts, but refusing to open them in the first place, and that should not be the case.\u201dFormer business secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg said he felt \u201cunease\u201d at the \u201ccancellation\u201d of Mr Farage by Coutts.

The following month, rains and floods swept the region, killing 15 people, causing billions of euros\u2019 worth of damage and hitting agriculture particularly hard.According to the Coldiretti agricultural association, more than 5,000 farms were left under water in the region, which accounts for a third of Italy\u2019s fruit harvest, including Ferrini\u2019s smallholding.\u201cThe flood meant that the plants, which were in the midst of a vegetative recovery (from the cold), suffered water stress and went into crisis,\u201d Ferrini said.Then came the heat, with record temperatures registered in many areas of Italy this past week.\u201cWe are being hit hard by the heatwave which is putting the plants under strain. This is also because temperatures at night are not falling below 24 Celsius (75 Fahrenheit), which does not allow plants to grow properly,\u201d he said.A severe hailstorm proved the final blow for much of his fragile crop.\u201cThe climate is overheating. We have a very warm sea and every time there is a cold weather front, we have thunderstorms, strong winds, hailstorms and these are becoming more and more frequent in the Po Valley,\u201d he said.Maryam Zakir-Hussain20 July 2023 13:001689853175Italian farmer battles the elements as climate change takes its tollFarmer Andrea Ferrini is on the frontline of climate change in Italy and it is hurting.

Even planning for future years is becoming really challenging.\u201d Ferrini, 52, has owned a farm in the fertile Emilia-Romagna region since 2003. He has 15 hectares (37 acres) of vines and orchards, which produce kiwi and peaches, and also grows corn. In a normal year he produces around 1,000 quintals (100,000 kg) of fruit and grapes, but this year he expects to harvest no more than 200-300 quintals. \u201cI am discouraged, but I am not giving up,\u201d he said, bowing his head as pent up emotions swell.

But even governments with a really good target, like the United Kingdom, don\u2019t have the policies in place, don\u2019t have the financing in place to reach those goals.\u201dScientists have warned that allowing the global average temperature to reach 1.5C could trigger irreversible tipping points that would heat the Earth beyond our control to unpredictable and dangerous levels.Maryam Zakir-Hussain20 July 2023 11:001689843627What is the difference between heat exhaustion and heat stroke?In recent years, climate change and rising global temperatures have triggered record-breaking heatwaves across the world - with the latest forecast showing an increase in temperatures across southern Europe this week.The European Space Agency (ESA) has warned that Italy, Spain, France, Germany and Poland may see extreme conditions.The impact of the heatwave has already led to raging wildfires in Spain which has prompted evacuations.Greece has also shut down the ancient Acropolis during the hottest part of the day, while Italy has issued hot weather red alerts for many major cities.What is the difference between heat exhaustion and heat stroke?Heatwave: What is the difference between heat exhaustion and heat stroke?

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeExperts are calling for stronger laws in the UK to protect people from heat stress for when it is too hot to work amid record-breaking heatwaves sweeping the planet from China to Europe and the US.Europe is currently experiencing devastating heat, with temperatures frequently going beyond 40 degrees Celsius in Italy, Spain and Greece, prompting health alerts.The UK currently has a respite from extreme weather as rains have kept temperatures down. But heatwaves are becoming increasingly common in the country, according to the Met Office, as it recorded its hottest June ever this year and smashed all-time temperature records last year. Scientists said heat is going continue to increase until greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels are slashed. Meanwhile, there is also an urgent need to adapt to the \u201cnew normal\u201d.Last year, the British workers\u2019 union GMB called for a \u201ctoo hot to work\u201d law to be passed that ensures workers are not compelled to labour in extreme heat conditions that pose significant health risks.RecommendedEuropean heatwave - latest updates as red alerts and record temperatures continueWhat is the difference between heat exhaustion and heat stroke?Why is there no UK heatwave as Europe swelters during Charon?While Europe has laws in place to determine when conditions become unsuitable for employees, till now there is no temperature limit set for workplaces in the UK. According to health and safety guidelines, workplaces are expected to maintain a \u201ccomfortable\u201d environment for employees. However, since the UK is more prone to extreme cold than heat, these guidelines only specify a lower limit in temperatures, indicating that temperatures in office settings should not dip below 16C.Europe is getting hotter twice as fast as the rest of the world, and several countries already have laws in place.In Germany, the maximum temperature that should be reached in the workplace is 26C.Spain has passed orders to ban outdoor work during heat and in France, employers have to make sure their workers are able to do their jobs under safe conditions, although an upper limit for temperature is not fixed.But with rapidly changing climate and an increased number of hot days, experts have said the issue is not just about having a requirement for an upper limit for temperatures.They have stated that working conditions also need to be accounted for, as some workplaces can be hotter than others.While there are calls for an upper-temperature limit, experts pointed out there isn\u2019t a \u201cone size fits all\u201d solution.\u201cAn arbitrary maximum temperature for a working environment may have an immediate appeal but it is not the solution unions may think it is,\u201d said Martin Williams, head of employment and partner at Mayo Wynne Baxter.\u201cWorking conditions are as variable as working types and there is no \u2018one size fits all\u2019. A kitchen or bakery is likely to reach a higher temperature far quicker than an office, for example.\u201d\u201cMitigating the effects of exposure to heat is what is required and this will depend on the individual and the workplace. It is a health and safety matter where assessment is key.Heatwaves can have significant health impacts on people, from heat strokes to exhaustion, especially on those with pre-existing conditions, often also leading to deaths. The World Health Organisation categorises heatwaves as among the most dangerous of natural hazards.Last year, heatwaves are estimated to have led to over 61,000 deaths in Europe, according to recent findings. While temperatures of 40C and above are usual in the tropics, for the UK and Europe where the population is not used to the extreme heat stress, these temperatures can be fatal. Tina Woods, CEO of Business for Health, a coalition of businesses, highlighted that data from the office for national statistics showed about 2.5 million people were forced out of work because of long-term sickness, adding that taking care of employees needs to be prioritised by businesses.RecommendedWorld\u2019s largest carbon-sucking factory starts operation in Iceland\u2018The climate crisis is a reality\u2019: Africa\u2019s summer of extremesAgainst the odds: The fight to save sea turtles in Ras Baridi\u201cFrom a long-term perspective, businesses need to make adequate adaptations to working arrangements to ensure they do not lose staff to health conditions as average annual temperatures rise,\u201d she said.\u201cWhether this be as simple as reviewing air conditioning and ventilation in the office and increasing flexible working arrangements or introducing health checks for employees, businesses must be placing the health of their employees at the forefront of their business strategy.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b9402e51ac331da6c7c049", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/grangemouth-police-clydebank-police-scotland-protesters-b2378858.html", "primaryCategory": "News", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Police arrest 20 climate activists during protest targeting oil refinery", "lead": "A small group of This Is Rigged protesters still remain at the Nustar Clydebank oil terminal.", "author": "Laura Paterson", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 12:15:35", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:50.358525", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-20T12:15:35+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/20/13/ec2ad59244f99c6a2694f0fa74d75c65Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg5OTM5MTYw-2.73052216.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to the Independent Climate email for the latest advice on saving the planetGet our free Climate email\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeA leading climate scientist has said he is \u201cvery pessimistic\u201d about the world reducing emissions to limit the global average temperature to 2C above pre-industrial levels.Professor Robert Watson, of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change, told the Today Programme that failure to do so will result in more heatwaves, floods, sea level rise, crop failure and health problems.Almost every country on Earth signed up to the Paris Agreement in 2015 to limit global temperature rise to 1.5C but if not, at the very least 2C.Eight years later, emissions continue to rise and current policies have us on track for around 2.5C of warming by the end of the century, according to Prof Watson.\n\nWe need to try and hold governments to start to act sensibly now and reduce emissionsProfessor Robert Watson, Tyndall CentreRecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveMany countries including the UK have made pledges to go net zero \u2013 balancing the amount of greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere with those absorbed \u2013 but most are several decades away from achieving that.The UK has committed to going net zero by 2050 but Prof Watson, who has been chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and scientific adviser to the UK and US governments, said current emissions need to be slashed in half before 2030 to have any chance of reaching the Paris goals.He said: \u201cI think most people fear that if we give up on the 1.5C, which I do not believe we will achieve \u2013 in fact I\u2019m very pessimistic about achieving even 2C \u2013 but if we allow the target to become looser and looser, higher and higher, governments will do even less in the future.\u201cWe need to try and hold governments to start to act sensibly now and reduce emissions. But even governments with a really good target, like the United Kingdom, don\u2019t have the policies in place, don\u2019t have the financing in place to reach those goals.\u201dScientists have warned that allowing the global average temperature to reach 1.5C could trigger irreversible tipping points that would heat the Earth beyond our control to unpredictable and dangerous levels.Melting of polar glaciers and sea ice, die-back of the Amazon rainforest and coral reef extinction are all seen as being on the edge of tipping over into a feedback loop of self-destruction, whereby their decline itself becomes a source of warming.The Earth has already warmed by around 1.2C, which has exacerbated heatwaves and wildfires that have caused thousands of deaths and millions of dollars of destruction and has led to the oceans heating to previously unseen levels.Pascal Soriot, CEO of the pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca, said seven million people are already being killed by climate change around the world \u2013 as many as those killed by Covid.In response to a question about the economic impacts on people of cutting emissions rapidly, Prof Watson said: \u201cIt\u2019s in their absolute best interest to tackle climate change, net zero by 2050, large reductions this decade.\u201cIf we don\u2019t, we\u2019re going to see more heatwaves, more adverse effects on health, we\u2019re going to see agriculture food production threatened, we\u2019re going to see problems with water quantity and water quality.\u201cWe\u2019ll see more floods, more sea level rises displacing people on coastal areas, lots of adverse health effects.\u201dIn a separate interview with the former BBC and now independent environment journalist Roger Harrabin, Prof Watson said current policies are \u201ctotally inadequate\u201d and that world leaders had made a \u201cterrible mistake\u201d in prioritising inflation, the pandemic and the Ukraine war over the climate.RecommendedNHS could save \u00a3635m through \u2018green social prescribing\u2019, study suggestsTravel to Europe by rail four times more expensive than flying, analysis findsWilliam to visit New York to attend Earthshot Prize Innovation SummitHe also warned that the polar regions are melting faster than scientists predicted and that weather events, such as heatwaves and wildfires, have been much more devastating than previously thought.\u201cI am very concerned,\u201d he said. \u201cNone of the observed changes so far are surprising.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeA deadly heatwave sweeping across Europe with temperatures forecast to shatter records in the coming days stands in complete contrast to the weather faced by the United Kingdom that has had wet and windy conditions continuing this week. As the UK gets prolonged showers \u2013 the Met Office predicts unsettled conditions to continue for the next few days \u2013 the Mediterranean region grapples with soaring heat that could touch a new European record as soon as this week.Temperatures are expected to go beyond 40C in parts of Spain and Italy in the coming days.Spain, Italy and Greece have been experiencing scorching temperatures for several days already, damaging agriculture and leaving tourists scurrying for shade.But a new anticyclone dubbed Charon, who in Greek mythology was the ferryman of the dead, pushed into the region from north Africa on Sunday and could lift temperatures above 45 Celsius (113 Fahrenheit) in parts of Italy early this week.RecommendedEurope heatwave live: Rome shatters temperature record as Switzerland, Spain and Greece battle firesMet Office gives update on whether 40C heatwave would hit BritainWhat is driving the record-breaking global heatwaves across three continents?The country\u2019s blazing mercury led to the death of a 44-year-old man, while a tourist from the UK visiting Rome\u2019s Colosseum fainted, prompting health warnings.\u201cWe need to prepare for a severe heat storm that, day after day, will blanket the whole country,\u201d Italian weather news service Meteo.it warned on Sunday.\u201cIn some places ancient heat records will be broken.\u201dThe temperature of the ground, which is different from the air temperature that weather forecasts mention, hit more than 60C in some areas of Spain last week, satellite recordings have shown.While mean ground temperatures are generally close to the air temperatures, they can sometimes be higher as the soil in summer can trap more heat. However, a surface land temperature of 60C is extremely high and rare in Europe.The heatwave will intensify from Monday, with temperatures reaching 44C (111.2F) in the Guadalquivir valley near Seville in the south of the country, forecasters predicted. The conditions have been raising fears of a repeat of last year\u2019s extreme heat conditions when Europe experienced its hottest summer on record in 2022, marked by an onslaught of scorching heatwaves, devastating droughts and raging forest fires driven by the human-induced climate crisis.The heat contributed to the deaths of over 61,000 people, a recent study has shown.Heat map showing extremely hot areas in black  (European Union, Copernicus Sentinel-3 imagery)Experts have said the European heatwave is because of an area of high pressure named after the underworld monster from Dante\u2019s Inferno \u2013 Cerberus.The area of high pressure comes as the world recently experienced record-shattering temperatures that have fuelled baking heatwaves in several countries like the US \u2013 that has seen contrasting weather extremes of its own.The southern US has been engulfed by extreme heat while its northeast grapples with severe flooding.The UK, on the other hand, finds itself under the influence of a different weather pattern that has brought in more rain and thus pulled down temperatures after the country got its hottest June on record, pointed out experts.Dr Melissa Lazenby, a climate change lecturer at the University of Sussex, explained that the current placement of a high-pressure system located further south is the primary reason for this divergence.\u201cThe current European Heatwave is being driven by stable atmospheric conditions from a stationary high pressures feature,\u201d Dr Lazenby explained.

As the UK gets prolonged showers \u2013 the Met Office predicts unsettled conditions to continue for the next few days \u2013 the Mediterranean region grapples with soaring heat that could touch a new European record as soon as this week.Temperatures are expected to go beyond 40C in parts of Spain and Italy in the coming days.Spain, Italy and Greece have been experiencing scorching temperatures for several days already, damaging agriculture and leaving tourists scurrying for shade.But a new anticyclone dubbed Charon, who in Greek mythology was the ferryman of the dead, pushed into the region from north Africa on Sunday and could lift temperatures above 45 Celsius (113 Fahrenheit) in parts of Italy early this week.RecommendedEurope heatwave live: Rome shatters temperature record as Switzerland, Spain and Greece battle firesMet Office gives update on whether 40C heatwave would hit BritainWhat is driving the record-breaking global heatwaves across three continents?The country\u2019s blazing mercury led to the death of a 44-year-old man, while a tourist from the UK visiting Rome\u2019s Colosseum fainted, prompting health warnings.\u201cWe need to prepare for a severe heat storm that, day after day, will blanket the whole country,\u201d Italian weather news service Meteo.it warned on Sunday.\u201cIn some places ancient heat records will be broken.\u201dThe temperature of the ground, which is different from the air temperature that weather forecasts mention, hit more than 60C in some areas of Spain last week, satellite recordings have shown.While mean ground temperatures are generally close to the air temperatures, they can sometimes be higher as the soil in summer can trap more heat. However, a surface land temperature of 60C is extremely high and rare in Europe.The heatwave will intensify from Monday, with temperatures reaching 44C (111.2F) in the Guadalquivir valley near Seville in the south of the country, forecasters predicted. The conditions have been raising fears of a repeat of last year\u2019s extreme heat conditions when Europe experienced its hottest summer on record in 2022, marked by an onslaught of scorching heatwaves, devastating droughts and raging forest fires driven by the human-induced climate crisis.The heat contributed to the deaths of over 61,000 people, a recent study has shown.Heat map showing extremely hot areas in black  (European Union, Copernicus Sentinel-3 imagery)Experts have said the European heatwave is because of an area of high pressure named after the underworld monster from Dante\u2019s Inferno \u2013 Cerberus.The area of high pressure comes as the world recently experienced record-shattering temperatures that have fuelled baking heatwaves in several countries like the US \u2013 that has seen contrasting weather extremes of its own.The southern US has been engulfed by extreme heat while its northeast grapples with severe flooding.The UK, on the other hand, finds itself under the influence of a different weather pattern that has brought in more rain and thus pulled down temperatures after the country got its hottest June on record, pointed out experts.Dr Melissa Lazenby, a climate change lecturer at the University of Sussex, explained that the current placement of a high-pressure system located further south is the primary reason for this divergence.\u201cThe current European Heatwave is being driven by stable atmospheric conditions from a stationary high pressures feature,\u201d Dr Lazenby explained.

The following month, rains and floods swept the region, killing 15 people, causing billions of euros\u2019 worth of damage and hitting agriculture particularly hard.According to the Coldiretti agricultural association, more than 5,000 farms were left under water in the region, which accounts for a third of Italy\u2019s fruit harvest, including Ferrini\u2019s smallholding.\u201cThe flood meant that the plants, which were in the midst of a vegetative recovery (from the cold), suffered water stress and went into crisis,\u201d Ferrini said.Then came the heat, with record temperatures registered in many areas of Italy this past week.\u201cWe are being hit hard by the heatwave which is putting the plants under strain. This is also because temperatures at night are not falling below 24 Celsius (75 Fahrenheit), which does not allow plants to grow properly,\u201d he said.A severe hailstorm proved the final blow for much of his fragile crop.\u201cThe climate is overheating. We have a very warm sea and every time there is a cold weather front, we have thunderstorms, strong winds, hailstorms and these are becoming more and more frequent in the Po Valley,\u201d he said.Maryam Zakir-Hussain20 July 2023 13:001689853175Italian farmer battles the elements as climate change takes its tollFarmer Andrea Ferrini is on the frontline of climate change in Italy and it is hurting. First his fruit and corn crops in northern Italy withered in a hard frost, then they were hit by torrential rains and record flooding, followed by an exceptional heatwave and finally hail storms. \u201cIt has certainly been a disastrous year,\u201d said Ferrini. \u201cMaking money from my farm is becoming difficult with this changing climate. Even planning for future years is becoming really challenging.\u201d Ferrini, 52, has owned a farm in the fertile Emilia-Romagna region since 2003. He has 15 hectares (37 acres) of vines and orchards, which produce kiwi and peaches, and also grows corn. In a normal year he produces around 1,000 quintals (100,000 kg) of fruit and grapes, but this year he expects to harvest no more than 200-300 quintals. \u201cI am discouraged, but I am not giving up,\u201d he said, bowing his head as pent up emotions swell.

But even governments with a really good target, like the United Kingdom, don\u2019t have the policies in place, don\u2019t have the financing in place to reach those goals.\u201dScientists have warned that allowing the global average temperature to reach 1.5C could trigger irreversible tipping points that would heat the Earth beyond our control to unpredictable and dangerous levels.Maryam Zakir-Hussain20 July 2023 11:001689843627What is the difference between heat exhaustion and heat stroke?In recent years, climate change and rising global temperatures have triggered record-breaking heatwaves across the world - with the latest forecast showing an increase in temperatures across southern Europe this week.The European Space Agency (ESA) has warned that Italy, Spain, France, Germany and Poland may see extreme conditions.The impact of the heatwave has already led to raging wildfires in Spain which has prompted evacuations.Greece has also shut down the ancient Acropolis during the hottest part of the day, while Italy has issued hot weather red alerts for many major cities.What is the difference between heat exhaustion and heat stroke?Heatwave: What is the difference between heat exhaustion and heat stroke?

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeChoosing to travel by train for a European holiday will cost an average of four times the cost of flying, according to a major new report from Greenpeace, which has blasted the price difference as \u201coutrageous\u201d.In some cases there could be 30 times the difference in cost, such as routes between Barcelona and London, with rail operators unable to compete with tickets on sale for as little as \u00a311.10. The campaign group said that shifting the 3.36 million annual flights between the UK capital and Barcelona to rail would save approximately 461,000 tons of harmful greenhouse gases \u2013 equivalent to the annual emissions of all the cars in Glasgow.The report blames price differences on an \u201cuneven regulatory playing field that benefits low-cost airlines at the expense of the climate and workers\u2019 rights\u201d.On the eve of one of the busiest flying periods of the year, as schools across Europe are breaking up for the summer holiday, the study, which compared ticket prices on 112 routes between 27 major European cities, found that flights were generally cheaper on 70 per cent of routes, with trains twice as expensive as flying on average.The UK performed worse than average, with people paying four times as much for train journeys to and from the country. Flying was consistently cheaper on all 12 of the UK routes in the study, including domestic routes between London and Scotland, the report shows.RecommendedIndependent Traveller guide to best hotels and short breaksBest UK hotels 2022Cheap hotels in Paris 2022: Where to stay for value for moneyCountries with the most expensive train tickets compared to flights are the UK, Spain, Belgium, France and Italy. In Central and Eastern Europe, trains are more often cheaper in relation to flights than in Western Europe; however, the train frequency, speed and connections are usually worse.The report found that despite some \u201creally effective\u201d train routes, such as Amsterdam-London, London-Edinburgh and Toulouse-Paris, they are still among the most popular short-haul flight routes in Europe \u2013 and remain cheaper than travelling by rail.Of the more than 100 routes analysed, the train was deemed \u201calmost always cheaper\u201d on just 23, with six of them having no direct flights and another six not served by low-cost airlines. Greenpeace only considers 12 of the 23 to be \u201cgreat train routes\u201d, which it defines as having more than three daily direct connections (day and night for longer routes), travelling at a good average speed, high reliability and usually costing less than a flight but not more than \u20ac150 (\u00a3131).The best rail routes include Berlin-Prague, Zurich-Vienna, Zurich-Berlin, Athens-Thessaloniki, Warsaw-Berlin, Prague-Budapest, Porto-Lisbon and Madrid-Barcelona.\u201cAs millions of Brits head off on their European breaks \u2013 many to areas that are being scorched by this historic heatwave \u2013 the twisted economics of the transport industry means they are being encouraged to keep throwing fuel on the climate inferno\u201d, said Dr Doug Parr, Greenpeace UK\u2019s director of policy.\u201cFlying only looks like a bargain because the cost of pollution is so cheap. Low-cost airlines are paying negligible tax while imposing low wages and poor conditions on staff.\u201dA recent analysis by Transport and Environment said the UK Treasury was missing out on \u00a34.7bn because it \u201cunder-taxes\u201d the aviation sector.Greenpeace said airlines keep their prices artificially low because they pay no fuel tax or VAT, and have even received a recent reduction in Air Passenger Duty in the UK. Train operators have to pay energy taxes, VAT and high rail tolls in most European countries, although no VAT in the UK.James Dunne, founder and CEO of Rail Online, told The Independent earlier this year: \u201cAs one of the most important considerations when booking, especially given the cost-of-living crisis, the primary way to encourage more people to choose rail above air travel would be to ensure domestic train travel is more affordable than the alternative flight route option.\u201dLast month, it was announced that new proposals set to be considered by the government\u2019s rail regulator would cut the window to buy discount fares from three months to just eight weeks before the date of travel \u2013 making it harder to plan ahead.RecommendedEasyJet blames flight cancellations on \u2018unprecedented\u2019 air-traffic control disruptionPassengers only offered $12 food voucher during 30-hour flight delaySummer holiday getaway begins with fresh national rail strikeDespite Greenpeace\u2019s findings, it is possible to swap air for rail travel and still save money, according to consumer group Which? \u2013 if you\u2019re travelling as a larger group.Spot checks by the consumer champion discovered that a family of four could save nearly \u00a3100 travelling by sleeper train, while a bigger family could save more than \u00a3250.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeHistoric heatwaves are sweeping the planet from China to Europe and the United States, with 2023 on track to become the hottest year on Earth since records began. Rome and Catalonia on Tuesday recorded their highest temperatures ever, provisional data suggests, as southern Europe is gripped by extreme heat and wildfires. Meteorologists predict this week Europe can record its highest temperature ever as parts of Italy are forecast to cross 48C (118.4F). Meanwhile, China has already recorded its highest-ever temperatures with a scorching 52.2C (125.9F) recorded in Sanbao on Sunday as the country is hit by multiple climate disasters at once. The same day, Death Valley in the US recorded 53C (127.4F), as meteorologists say it is close to setting a new record for the highest temperatures ever recorded on Earth amid blistering heat gripping large parts of the southern states. Recommended2023 is set to be hottest on record amid global heatwaves, scientists sayWhy is there no UK heatwave as Europe swelters during Charon?11 pictures that capture the devastation of climate crisis as heatwave sweeps EuropeThis onslaught of heat from Asia to the Americas is just the latest in the series of climate extremes we have witnessed this year with the first week of July being recorded as the hottest days on the planet and ocean temperatures reaching record highs. So what is causing these extreme temperatures and is there a link between all the heatwaves the planet is currently experiencing?According to experts, a combination of factors are contributing to these extreme weather events including stagnant weather systems and the El Nino phenomenon. However, the driving forces behind the heatwaves are primarily linked to the climate crisis. Scientists say high-pressure systems are dominating Europe, central Asia and the southern US, leading to these regions experiencing heatwave conditions. The hotter-than-usual ocean waters are also contributing to rising temperatures over land.\u201cThe bubble of hot air that has inflated over southern Europe has turned Italy and surrounding countries into a giant pizza oven,\u201d Professor Hannah Cloke of University of Reading, says.\u201cThe hot air which pushed in from Africa is now staying put, with settled high pressure conditions meaning that heat in warm sea, land and air continues to build.\u201dDr Akshay Deoras, meteorologist at the University of Reading, says while it isn\u2019t unusual for the northern hemisphere to experience heat at this time of the year, the temperatures seen in Europe are definitely unusual. \u201cHeatwaves are common in the northern hemisphere at this time of year. However, the temperatures we are expecting in parts of southern Europe in the coming days are what we normally get in the tropical deserts or tropical countries such as India, Pakistan or the Middle East during summer,\u201d Dr Deoras says.This image uses data from the Copernicus Sentinel-3 mission\u2019s radiometer instrument and shows the land surface temperature across Europe and parts of northern Africa  (European Union, Copernicus Sentinel-3 imagery)\u201cThe simultaneous occurrence of heatwaves in different regions of the world as well as their forecasted intensity fits well with the anticipated impact of climate change on global temperatures.\u201dDr Melissa Lazenby, senior lecturer in climate change at the University of Sussex, said the weather extremes being experienced across the globe are \u201cexactly what climate scientists have been predicting\u201d as a result of the man-made climate crisis. \u201cThe northern hemisphere is experiencing a combined effect of both natural and anthropogenic climate change resulting in extreme heat over three NH [northern hemisphere] continents,\u201d Dr Lazenby said. According to the United Nations\u2019 top science body, the world has become hotter by approximately 1.2C (34.1F) since the 1800s due to the greenhouse gases released by burning fossil fuels. Scientists say the heat brought by a natural phenomenon like El Nino comes on top of the existing heat the planet is experiencing due to greenhouse gas emissions, hence, raising the temperatures higher than they would have in a world without man-made pollution. \u201cThere is a developing El Nino event as well as the additional warming from human emissions, therefore, resulting in abnormally warmer temperatures than without human emissions,\u201d Dr Lazenby said.Locals help firefighters as they try to extinguish a wildfire burning near the village Vlyhada near Athens  (Getty Images)Professor Cloke adds: \u201cIt is not surprising that different parts of the northern hemisphere have heatwaves during our summer months, but the combined picture is starting to look like climate change impacts all happening at the same time, as scientists have forecast for decades.\u201cWe are now living through these impacts, rather than predicting them in a computer simulation of the future climate.\u201dAlarms were raised by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) earlier this year about the unprecedented warming the planet could experience once the El Nino cycle begins. The WMO said there is a 98 per cent likelihood that \u201cat least one of the next five years, and the five-year period as a whole, will be the warmest on record\u201d.However, since then, several heat records have been broken. Even before the weather phenomenon could start in full swing, June was the hottest month recorded for the planet, according to Berkley Earth, an independent organisation that maintains monthly temperature records.The researchers at the California-based independent organisation have said there is an 80 per cent chance this year could be the hottest on record for the planet. Map of global ocean temperatures by NOAA shows water around the UK hitting category 5 marine heatwave (NOAA)Ocean temperatures have also been breaking records with parts of the North Atlantic,. especially waters around the UK and Ireland experiencing an \u201cunprecedented\u201d marine heat wave, with temperatures up to 5C (41F) hotter than usual.\u201cThe El Nino gathered momentum since May this year and its effects have already kicked in with significant anomalies in upper-surface sea temperatures in the Pacific,\u201d Dr Malcolm Mistry, assistant professor in climate and geo-spatial modelling, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said. \u201cThis in turn is known to disturb wider weather patterns not only in the Pacific, but also globally such as over Eastern US and parts of Europe, Africa and Asia.\u201d El Nino is still in its developing stages and it typically peaks in the months of December to February. Scientists say, there is likely more extreme events and heat to come globally as it kicks in.\u201cAs per current seasonal forecasts, the El Ni\u00f1o is expected to strengthen and its effects to remain persistent till the rest of the year,\u201d says Dr Mistry. According to Dr Deoras, El Ni\u00f1o is \u201cstill weak and in its early stages of development\u201d. \u201cIts effect on the global weather patterns will become more robust in the coming months,\u201d he adds.This year\u2019s heatwave comes as a repeat of the devastation experienced last year in all three continents, when Asia, Europe and the US all suffered through scorching heat. Scientists say with heatwaves becoming more frequent and prolonged, more immediate measures are needed to protect vulnerable population and cut down planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions immediately.

And since the commencement of the four-month monsoon season on 1 June, the state of Uttar Pradesh, where Agra is located, has experienced rainfall equivalent to 108 per cent of its usual amount.RecommendedEurope heatwave live: Hundreds flee wildfires for third day as Greece braces for extreme temperaturesNorth India rains: Thousands evacuated in Delhi as residents warned of drinking water crisisAs heavy rains kill more than 100 in India, what is making south Asia\u2019s monsoons more deadly?The swelling of the river driven by unusually heavy rains has raised worries about potential harm to the 17th-century white marble monument, built by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his queen Mumtaz Mahal.\u201cIf it rains more, or the water stays this high for some days, we will need to assess the situation again,\u201d Raj Kumar Patel, superintendent archaeologist with the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), the government agency responsible for the conservation of historical monuments, told Reuters.But there was \u201cno serious concern\u201d about the monument as of now.The swollen Yamuna rises to the periphery of the Taj Mahal, the first time in 45 years in Agra on 19 July (AP)Mr Patel, however, said numerous other monuments and gardens situated near the Taj Mahal, closer to the banks of the Yamuna, \u201chave been submerged\u201d and suffered damage.Among the affected sites are the tomb of Itimad-ud-Daulah, popularly known as \u201cbaby Taj\u201d, which dates back to the 1600s and Mehtab Bagh, also from the same period.The structure of Mehtab Bagh has suffered damage, it was reported, and its once beautiful garden area is now completely submerged and destroyed.Visuals of the surging Yamuna river near the Taj Mahal have also been widely shared on social media.The river had last reached the walls of the monument 45 years ago in 1978.CWC data also revealed that its station near the Taj Mahal recorded the river\u2019s highest flood level that year, reaching 154.76m.On social media, some citizens expressed fears about the water level near the monument.\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to see Yamuna get to the Old Delhi Fort... but seeing it reach the Taj Mahal is... a whole diff level of scary. As they say, the river never forgets,\u201d tweeted journalist Vidya Krishnan.The swelling of the Yamuna due to torrential rains caused by worsening climate crisis in northern India have led to thousands being evacuated in Delhi.At least 100 people have died after heavy rains.RecommendedWhat is driving the record-breaking global heatwaves across three continents?China shatters all-time high temperature record with a sizzling 52.2C2023 is set to be hottest on record amid global heatwaves, scientists sayThe river had flowed above the \u201cdanger mark\u201d in Delhi and prompted deadly landslides as well as floods in two other states.The city state received record single-day rain earlier this month, the highest since July 1982.

Last month\u2019s US Open champion starts his second Open appearance in superb fashion with a birdie at the last moving him into a tie for second. There\u2019s also a last-hole birdie for Schauffele who moves into the red and sits nicely at -1. Cam Smith found the fairway bunker off the tee and does well to save par.

There\u2019s a bit of work to be done for his par but he knocks it in comfortably. A super round of 66 has him in a share for the lead and there\u2019s a big grin on his face as he is greeted by huge applause from the grandstands.Scheffler gets up and down well from the greenside to make birdie at the last. Another very solid round from Scheffler but once more, a round that threatened to get away with him after some wayward putting. Still, the world number one is nicely positioned at -1. It\u2019s an unfortunate double-bogey seven for Scott at the last after his first drive went out of bounds. He\u2019s left on +1 after his opening round.

Adam Scott is one of the first players to find out his harsh reality as he sends his first tee shot straight in. His second shot is hardly any better and flies way left.

That is simply sensational from Khawaja to give Australia a breakthrough they so, so needed. It is short from Mitchell Starc and positively nailed by a pulling Moeen Ali, lasering it to Khawaja\u2019s right. Out go the paws as the fielder lunges across and Khawaja\u2019s claws lock around it. Moeen\u2019s fun is over having very much proven his worth at first drop - Australia, at last, have a glimmer of hope just as England looked to be taking total control. Harry Latham-Coyle20 July 2023 14:301689859769England 130/1 (27), Zak Crawley 70, Moeen Ali 54, Josh Hazlewood 0-28 (6) (trail by 187)Australia\u2019s wheels, meanwhile, are threatening to come off, Travis Head launching a wild shy at the stumps that Usman Khawaja does very, very well to prevent flying away for four overthrows. Those extra runs arrive courtesy of two more two in Josh Hazlewod\u2019s next couple of deliveries. Dropped? Yes! Bad to worse for Pat Cummins, continuing a disastrous hour after lunch. Hazlewood hurries Moeen Ali on the hook, and Cummins should really take on the lunge at midwicket, but over-extends as it arrives and lets it clang away off his wrists. Harry Latham-Coyle20 July 2023 14:291689859463England 122/1 (26), Zak Crawley 63, Moeen Ali 53, Mitchell Starc 1-21 (7) (trail by 195)Pat Cummins sends for Mitchell Starc, hoping some left-arm fizz can stem the flow. Zak Crawley\u2019s latest inside edge is safely deflected away from danger by the batter\u2019s thigh. It\u2019s not all entirely tidy from the England batters, but their making swift progress. Josh Hazlewood steps in for Travis Head.Harry Latham-Coyle20 July 2023 14:24\n\n\n\nNewer1\u00a0/\u00a08Older\n\n\n\n"}, {"_id": "64b9403351ac331da6c7c05b", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/australia-ireland-result-womens-world-cup-b2378855.html", "primaryCategory": "Football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Australia relief after Women\u2019s World Cup opener reveals significance of Sam Kerr injury", "lead": "<p><strong>Australia 1-0 Ireland: </strong>The co-hosts had to rely on Steph Catley\u2019s penalty to earn a narrow opening win after the shock of losing Kerr for their first two games</p>", "author": "Miguel Delaney", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 13:33:16", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:55.563550", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-20T13:33:16+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/20/13/GettyImages-1558011362.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Miguel Delaney\u2019s Reading the Game newsletter sent straight to your inbox for freeSign up to Miguel\u2019s Delaney\u2019s free weekly newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeAustralia get away with it, Ireland will feel they should have got something. Both can take some encouragement from their opening game of the Women\u2019s World Cup, while England can take encouragement from how beatable these possible last-16 opponents look.This absorbing first game for the co-hosts was so much more engaging than a single penalty from Steph Catley and a narrow 1-0 suggested. Some of that might have been down to Sam Kerr\u2019s injury for the opening two matches. The truth is it makes Australia a completely different team.That\u2019s also why it could have been a lot worse for the hosts. A proud if frustrated Ireland would have felt they should have had so much better, though.Many would certainly have expected worse going into this game. Australia have been seen as potential champions, with home support and significant momentum behind them.That might return with Kerr but it is, for now, a disruption. An uncertainty. It also can\u2019t be discounted that nerves could have added to that.RecommendedWomen\u2019s World Cup 2023 LIVE: Australia defeat Ireland after Sam Kerr blow as New Zealand stun NorwayWomen\u2019s World Cup teams: Every squad and key players to watchWhat TV channel is the Women\u2019s World Cup on? How to watch every matchThe context was key to all of this. This was the biggest match the hosts had ever played, the move to Stadium Australia indicating that.It was also the biggest match Ireland had ever played since it was their first ever World Cup game.They rose to that to add to Australia\u2019s issues.Ireland have always been a defensively drilled team under manager Vera Pauw but, as befitting the occasion, there was an escalation. It wasn\u2019t just the team taking to the match with energy. There was more to the approach. It often felt as if a good defensive unit evolved into systemic hard challenges, reminiscent of a Diego Simeone side.Australia, already missing Kerr and the manner in which she naturally links the entire team together through her central attacking role, were further disrupted and broken up. There was little fluency to their play. Kerr-ful now: Australia\u2019s star player was ruled out due to a calf injury  (Getty)There couldn\u2019t be. Ireland were too disruptive. Louise Quinn was one of a few Irish players meeting everything at the back but it went right up the pitch.Arsenal\u2019s Katie McCabe was typically willing to lead the way. She was so committed she suffered an injury to her fingers, but was also fortunate not to be further sanctioned for a particularly abrasive challenge on Hayley Raso. Their encounters on the left developed into a proper battle, mostly in the right way \u2013 although not without some edge.The issue was maybe how the use of McCabe took away from some of her edge, but it was necessary against a superior side. It just always carries some risks of its own.McCabe led her side yesterday, putting up a strong fight even after going down a goal  (Getty)Marissa Sheva went in very heavily on Katrina Gorry just before half-time in what could have been a crucial tackle.Ireland were always on the brink of giving something more on way, even as they attempted to give up no space.The only surprise was maybe how early it came, given that it looked like it was going to become one of those matches where the home side were forced to the limits of their patience. As it was, shortly after half-time, Australia lofted a ball forward. If Raso\u2019s position in the box was anticipated, it would have been less likely that it was Sheva marking her.The forward had her hands all over Raso\u2019s back and the Australian finally had the recompense for a lot of punishment in the game. Her team had a badly needed penalty.Catley stepped up, the atmosphere suddenly ratcheting up. The delay only added to the nerves. Catley didn\u2019t show any. She hammered the ball right into the top corner.Catley converts a second-half penalty  (Getty)Australia had their reprieve and, temporarily, enjoyed a release. There was an extended spell when they were enjoying much more space around the Irish box.That only served to show, however, how much they miss Kerr. Australia had about 10 minutes when Ireland looked affected by the goal but couldn\u2019t maximise it. Pauw\u2019s team in turn sensed this and really picked it up.They began to get at the hosts, to get around them. McCabe\u2019s superb set-piece deliveries were constantly causing problems. For one, the ball fell back to Heather Payne in a free position near the penalty aree, only for the winger to swipe at it.It said enough that Australia goalkeeper Mackenzie Arnold was already time wasting by this point. It actually meant there was more time for anguished chances for Ireland. As late as the 96th minute, the ball fell back to McCabe, only for the team leader to not fully get behind the shot. She immediately got behind a brilliant cross, though, that Louise Quinn could only head wide.Australia were relieved.RecommendedWomen\u2019s World Cup odds: Who are favourites to win the tournament?New Zealand squad stayed calm after hearing of Auckland shootingNew Zealand\u2019s historic moment gives Women\u2019s World Cup the spark it neededIreland could take huge pride, and they will surely challenge Canada and Nigeria for second place in this group \u2013 and maybe a knock-out game against England.Australia, however, take the three points. It\u2019s a start. It could have been worse for the hosts, but it needs to get a lot better."}, {"_id": "64b9403351ac331da6c7c05c", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/cycling/tour-de-france-stage-18-route-map-preview-b2378824.html", "primaryCategory": "Cycling", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Tour de France 2023 stage 18 preview: Route map and profile of 186km from Moutiers to Bourg en Bresse", "lead": "<p>After a slog through the Alps which all but sealed the yellow jersey for Jonas Vingegaard comes an opportunity for the sprinters \u2013 and the dominant Jasper Philipsen </p>", "author": "Lawrence Ostlere", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 13:28:35", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:55.803868", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-20T13:28:35+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/28/11/stage%2018%20map.jpeg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free sport newsletter for all the latest news on everything from cycling to boxingSign up to our free sport email for all the latest news\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeStage 18 of the 2023 Tour de France is officially classified as \u201chilly\u201d but in truth this is a relatively flat ride heading north-west from the Alps, carving through the gap between Lyon and Geneva to the finish at Bourg en Brasse.There awaits a fast, technical finish, with roundabouts and a sharp corner before a swinging right-hand turn on to the home straight where the stage will be won and lost.Jasper Philipsen is the strong favourite to win his fifth stage of this Tour having taken a clean sweep of the sprints so far. At this point in the race his rivals are few and far between: Mark Cavendish crashed out with a broken collarbone, Australian sprinter Caleb Ewan abandoned with fatigue, while Wout van Aert went home yesterday to be with his wife for the birth of their second child. There are still some opponents Philipsen may need to outsprint: Dylan Groenewegen hasn\u2019t made much of an impact on this race but has Tour stage wins on his palmares, while former world champion Mads Pedersen has already won once here, on stage eight. There is also the possibility of a breakaway escaping up the road and staying away to claim the win amongst themselves. Such is Philipsen\u2019s dominance that not many teams want to see a bunch sprint finish, so his Alpecin-Deceuninck teammates will have to do a lot of the work on the front of the peloton to bring back the breakaway.RecommendedTadej Pogacar concedes Tour de France as Felix Gall pips Simon Yates on stage 17\u2018I\u2019m dead\u2019: Tadej Pogacar concedes Tour de France to Jonas VingegeaardThe Tour de France team that ride by nightIf they manage it, Philipsen can rely on the great Mathieu van der Poel to drive his leadout train and present him at the finish to seal the deal.For the man in the yellow jersey, Jonas Vingegaard, it\u2019s a day to recover weary legs and stay out of trouble.

They have such a powerful team, it was difficult for us to play against them but they did so well. They didn\u2019t create a lot of chances, right?\"A draw would have been a reasonable result. I think everybody is proud that we are part of the top nations and we can only grow from this.\" Mike Jones20 July 2023 14:271689859228Gustavsson on Kerr\u2019s injuryTony Gustavsson also spoke about how Sam Kerr is feeling following her injury in training. Australia\u2019s captain is going to miss two of the three group games and is, rightly, gutted.\u201cThis is her dream, she has been planning and preparing for it for years.\u201d he said, \u201cThis is her big moment to step up as captain and play in front of her fans and friends and family. \u201cIt is devastating but the way she spoke to the team today says a lot about her as a person and as a captain for this team.\u201dMike Jones20 July 2023 14:201689858808Reaction from Australia\u2019s head coachAustralia boss Tony Gustavsson spoke after his team earned a slim 1-0 victory over Ireland and said he was happy with how his team dealt with the pressure.\u201cWe knew this game would be tough. All the teams here will put up a fight.\u201d said Gustavsson, \u201cEveryone can beat everyone in this tournament. We knew set pieces would be a massive part of it and I have to credit the team for how they handled all those set plays in the final stages. \u201cThey are one of the best teams in attack on set plays and we dealt with it.\u201cTournament football is always about finding a way to win. There\u2019s been a lot challenges thrown at this team over the last 24 hours, an opening game at a home World Cup and then you add Sam Kerr\u2019s injury to that. They stuck together and played as a team and that mental toughness I am proud of.\u201cThe fans carried this team to the victory. That support was amazing. In the stands they were amazing.\u201dMike Jones20 July 2023 14:131689858448Why this Women\u2019s World Cup will be unlike anything we\u2019ve seen beforeAs the squads have been adjusting to Australia and New Zealand over the last few weeks, many coaches and staff members have been doing what the rest of the public does, bouncing around news stories about the different teams to see how they are doing. It is the point at which an international tournament takes on that enticingly self-contained quality. All eyes still go to the USA, especially with this being Megan Rapinoe\u2019s last World Cup, and the squad looking to see her off with a historic third successive victory.As the defending champions themselves look around the field, though, they aren\u2019t seeing what they used to. There is the usual confidence, of course, but also some caution. The gap between them and the rest of the teams isn\u2019t as big. Rapinoe\u2019s retirement may well close out a wider era, since the dominant factor in women\u2019s football over the last decade has been how the USA have enjoyed much longer-term development than the rest of the game. That has been seen as especially influential as regards physical conditioning, but the general feeling is that the European game and Australia have caught up.England would certainly have no fears there, especially given how they beat the USA in that signpost match back in October.Why this Women\u2019s World Cup will be unlike anything we\u2019ve\u00a0seen\u00a0beforeThe staging of the first 32-team Women\u2019s World Cup in Australia and New Zealand presents fresh challenges, but a supreme cast of talent and a wide-open tournament can take the game to new heights, writes Miguel Delaney Mike Jones20 July 2023 14:07\n\n\n\nNewer1\u00a0/\u00a014Older\n\n\n\n"}, {"_id": "64b9403451ac331da6c7c060", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/womens-world-cup-tv-channel-b2378613.html", "primaryCategory": "Football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "What TV channel is the Women\u2019s World Cup on?

Read our\u00a0privacy notice\u201cWe\u2019ve been fighting for this for so long,\u201d Ali Riley said, smiling through the tears. The New Zealand captain had waited more than most, winless at her four previous World Cups, part of a run that stretched back even further than that. Without a victory in 15 attempts at the tournament, New Zealand entered their own World Cup with unwanted history hanging over them. Facing Norway in their opening match, that winless run was expected to continue.How Hannah Wilkinson\u2019s goal changed that. In a stunning upset, New Zealand altered the narrative, providing the World Cup with its first shock that will ripple not just in Group A but throughout the tournament. With a victory in their most difficult game of the group stages, New Zealand can now set their sights higher and target a place in the knockouts. They will have momentum on their side when they face Switzerland and the Philippines.Such moments can change expectations, as well as perceptions.It had been noted before kick-off that while pre-tournament excitement and buzz was palpable in Australia, particularly in Sydney ahead of the Matildas\u2019 opening game against Ireland, in New Zealand it was far more low-key. Compared to the neighbours, New Zealand hadn\u2019t generated the same interest in terms of tickets sold across the country.RecommendedAustralia relief after Women\u2019s World Cup opener reveals significance of Sam Kerr injuryWomen\u2019s World Cup teams: Every squad and key players to watchWhat TV channel is the Women\u2019s World Cup on? How to watch every matchA reason for that is because Australia can win the World Cup. As hosts, they are aware of the opportunity they have to change society, as shown by England\u2019s historic win at the Euros last summer, and are inspired by the chance to provide the country its biggest sporting moment since Cathy Freeman and the 2000 Olympics. Having an international star like Sam Kerr creates hope that such an achievement can be possible.New Zealand aren\u2019t there yet - but they will now believe they can make that change happen, as well. \u201cWe had a clear goal that we wanted to inspire young girls, young people in this country and around the world and I think we did that tonight,\u201d the 35-year-old Riley said.A moment such as Wilkinson\u2019s goal, which came after a fine breakaway and cross from the forward Jacqui Hand, can be the spark, and not just for them. There are eight teams who will be making their World Cup debuts over the next week, and with the same fundamentals of organisation and commitment that New Zealand showed in restraining Norway, they too will hope to close the gap to the established nations.New Zealand had the advantage of being a host country, even if preparations for their opening match would have been disrupted by the shocking news of a mass shooting in Auckland on the morning of the tournament. But in front of a sold-out crowd of over 42,000 at Eden Park, New Zealand lived up to the role of underdog hosts superbly. For a team who had gone 10 games without a win until beating Vietnam before the World Cup, they were motivated by the occasion and upset the odds.Wilkinson earned New Zealand their first win at the Women\u2019s World Cup  (Getty Images)Norway had the star quality - in Ada Hegerberg, Caroline Graham Hansen, Guro Reiten and Frida Maanum - but New Zealand believed in the collective. Riley led the way as she marked Graham Hansen out of the game - there was only one moment midway through the first half where the Barcelona star found the space to burst away, but the defender tracked it, shutting down the cross. When Norway had other half-chances, New Zealand found the blocks they needed.RecommendedNew Zealand squad stayed calm after hearing of Auckland shootingAustralia relief after World Cup opener reveals significance of Sam Kerr injuryWomen\u2019s World Cup teams: Every squad and key players to watchIt\u2019s an upset that asks questions of Norway, of course, after their shambolic group-stage exit at the Euros last summer. Hege Riise was brought in to repair the damage, but Norway were still far too open and unorganised in defence, while lacking cohesion in attack.\u201cThere have been a lot of doubters because of the results we had, but we believed,\u201d Riley said. Now others at the World Cup will feel that too."}, {"_id": "64b9403551ac331da6c7c062", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/womens-world-cup-new-zealand-auckland-shooting-b2378868.html", "primaryCategory": "Football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Jitka Klimkova: New Zealand squad stayed calm after hearing of Auckland shooting", "lead": "<p>Three people were killed in an incident which occurred 400 metres from Norway\u2019s team hotel</p>", "author": "Rachel Steinberg", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 12:47:37", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:57.231352", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-20T12:47:37+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/20/09/20-9fd94849fb48490a8c1f3ba2640a0157.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Miguel Delaney\u2019s Reading the Game newsletter sent straight to your inbox for freeSign up to Miguel\u2019s Delaney\u2019s free weekly newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeEngland made an encouraging start with bat and ball as they attempted to take control of their must-win Ashes Test at Emirates Old Trafford.The hosts snapped up Australia\u2019s last two wickets as the tourists bowed out for 317, and recovered well from the early loss of Ben Duckett to reach 61 for one at lunch.Moeen Ali\u2019s experimental promotion to number three was beginning to pay off, with the all-rounder reeling off five boundaries on his way to 31 not out and Zak Crawley was unbeaten on 26.The growing sense that the game was unfolding in England\u2019s favour was strengthened when Cameron Green had Crawley lbw, only for ball-tracking to show the ball disappearing past the leg stump.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveWith plenty of rain forecast over the weekend, the home side know they must move fast to set the game up and land the victory they need to keep the series alive, but after four sessions the building blocks are in place.They enjoyed the perfect start, hometown hero James Anderson striking with the first ball of the day following 17 wicketless overs on Wednesday.It was far from his best delivery, served up a fraction full outside off stump, but it got the desired response as Pat Cummins lifted a gentle catch straight to Ben Stokes at point to make it 299 for nine.Anderson, bowling from the end that bears his name, took the acclaim in what could yet be his last appearance at this ground.England looked to have wrapped things up in the next over, number 11 Josh Hazlewood fencing Chris Woakes to slip, but the TV umpire called a marginal no-ball as the seamer nudged the line.Australia cashed in another 17 runs but Woakes\u2019 hopes of a first five-for against Australia were only on pause, Hazlewood clipping to third slip to end the innings.The English reply began with four off the first delivery, Crawley brushing Starc fine off his hip to keep the cheers coming from the stands.It was not long before they turned to groans though, Duckett lasting only six balls as he pressed forward and nicked Starc tamely into Alex Carey\u2019s gloves.That meant an early appearance for Moeen, who promptly threw his hands at the fourth delivery he faced and hit fresh air. Crawley was also bested when he edged Hazlewood just in front of the cordon, but the attacking instincts of the pair began to pay off.Crawley whipped Hazlewood smartly through midwicket as his timing returned and Moeen hit the boundary ropes four times in eight deliveries as he unfurled a couple of picturesque drives and took his career tally beyond 3,000 Test runs.RecommendedAmateur Christo Lamprecht sets the early pace at the OpenJitka Klimkova: New Zealand squad stayed calm after hearing of Auckland shootingJordan Henderson urged to speak on human rights abuses if Saudi move goes aheadGreen thought he had Crawley when umpire Joel Wilson raised his finger, but a wise referral spared the opener and brought one of the biggest roars of the day.Crawley signed off the session with a sweet cover drive off Cummins, leaving Australia with questions to answer in the afternoon."}, {"_id": "64b9403651ac331da6c7c064", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/golf/southport-tom-lewis-hillside-south-african-turnberry-b2378869.html", "primaryCategory": "Golf", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Amateur Christo Lamprecht sets the early pace at the Open", "lead": "The 22-year-old posted an impressive five-under 66 on the first day in Hoylake.", "author": "Carl Markham", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 12:20:57", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:58.001757", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-20T12:20:57+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/20/13/ff1512b3b691643effd914390753be39Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg5OTQwNzE5-2.73058964.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free sport newsletter for all the latest news on everything from cycling to boxingSign up to our free sport email for all the latest news\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

I\u2019m kind of running out of words to describe it. It was crazy, mental, loud \u2013 everything that I could have wished for.\u201cI\u2019m certainly trying to think of a better experience than that, and I don\u2019t think I can.\u201dSouthport\u2019s Tommy Fleetwood got to two under through 11 holes with world number one Scottie Scheffler a shot further back.RecommendedJitka Klimkova: New Zealand squad stayed calm after hearing of Auckland shootingEngland enjoy good morning with ball and bat in crunch Old Trafford TestJordan Henderson urged to speak on human rights abuses if Saudi move goes aheadThe controversial new 17th hole claimed its first victim with Lucas Herbert, joint-leader at the time on three under, making a triple-bogey at the 126-yard hole.He missed the green to the left, chipped across the putting surface into a bunker, left his next in the sand and eventually finished with a six."}, {"_id": "64b9403651ac331da6c7c065", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/jordan-henderson-steven-gerrard-amnesty-international-reds-liverpool-b2378834.html", "primaryCategory": "Football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Jordan Henderson urged to speak on human rights abuses if Saudi move goes ahead", "lead": "Henderson looks set to link up with former Reds teammate Steven Gerrard, who was appointed Al-Ettifaq manager earlier this month.", "author": "Robert O'Connor", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 11:48:58", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:58.259516", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-20T11:48:58+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/20/12/373e3d27b24b70725bb3c2c3647c24acY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg5OTM4NjU1-2.29279945.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Miguel Delaney\u2019s Reading the Game newsletter sent straight to your inbox for freeSign up to Miguel\u2019s Delaney\u2019s free weekly newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Group H: Germany, Morocco, Colombia, South KoreaGermany are out for revenge - the World Cup is the perfect chancePlayers to watchNew Zealand: If New Zealand are going to need something special to break their cycle of World Cup disappointment on home soil, don\u2019t be surprised if they are inspired by the fearlessness of youth. The Football Ferns finished an impressive third at the Under-17 World Cup five years ago and striker Gabi Rennie, the team\u2019s No 9, is a breakthrough prospect.Norway: It\u2019s a testament to the skill, speed and elusiveness of Barcelona\u2019s Caroline Graham Hansen that Guro Reiten isn\u2019t even the most dangerous winger on the Norway team. Arguably the best dribbler in the game, the 28-year-old took a break from the international side following the Euros last summer but is now back to best - as Chelsea once again found out in this season\u2019s Champions League. (Getty Images)Switzerland: The smooth and composed Lia Walti draws the eye in the centre of midfield and the captain is the pillar of the side. \u201cLia is such a magnetic player. Everyone passes to her,\u201d said the Switzerland head coach Inka Grings. \u201cShe always demands the ball and, when she has it, it sticks to her feet.\u201dPhilippines: Sarina Bolden took the most important kick in the history of the Philippines with the winning penalty against Chinese Taipei that secured their qualification for the World Cup. The Philippines will need more moments of history to make an impact in New Zealand.Australia: There\u2019s no question about this. Sam Kerr is the face of the World Cup and the star of the Australia team. As the most lethal striker in the world, who always seems to deliver on the big occasion, the Chelsea forward could be the difference for the Matildas as they look to advance past the quarter-finals for the first time. The 29-year-old makes the hosts a genuine contender. (Getty Images)Canada: Christine Sinclair has been setting records for most of her life. At 40, and now into the 22nd year of her international career, the striker is set to become the first player to play at six World Cups - although Brazil\u2019s Marta could later equal that record this tournament. In Australia, Sinclair and Marta also have the chance to become the first player to score at six different World Cups. Nigeria: Asisat Oshoala doesn\u2019t just have a claim to be the greatest African player in the world, but the best of all time. The Nigeria striker and Barcelona star has won the African player of the year award four times and has hit at least 20 goals in each of her last two seasons in Spain. The Super Falcons may have been drawn in the group of death, but Oshoala will be a threat to both Australia and Canada. (Getty Images)Ireland: Katie McCabe. The Arsenal fan favourite famously wears her heart on her sleeve and embodies what Ireland will require in Australia: defensive nous, aggression, a lot of effort, and quality when it counts. McCabe has it all and alongside Denise O\u2019Sullivan will be key.Spain: Aitana Bonmati. When an ACL injury robbed two-time Ballon d\u2019Or winner Alexia Putellas of the chance to play at the Euros last summer and then took away almost all of the following season, it handed her international and club team-mate Bonmati the opportunity to play further forward for Barcelona. How she took it. Arguably the best player in the world over the past year.  (Getty Images)Japan: Yui Hasegawa. Signed by Manchester City last summer to replace England\u2019s Keira Walsh, the 26-year-old impressed with her class and composure on the ball and tenacity in midfield, finishing the season as one of the top performers in the Women\u2019s Super League. Japan will rely on Hasegawa to set their tempo from the middle of the pitch.Zambia: Barbra Banda made history at the 2021 Olympics when she became the first player to score back-to-back hat-tricks at the Games. The 23-year-old is captain of the Zambia side and is key to their chances of making it out of the group, as her stunning two-goal display against Germany before the tournament showed.Costa Rica: Raquel Rodriguez is Costa Rica\u2019s record scorer with 55 goals, including the country\u2019s first at a World Cup on their only previous appearance in 2015. The Portland Thorns midfielder, who has won over 100 caps for Costa Rica, has urged her team-mates to battle with passion and commitment as they look to claim a first-ever World Cup win.England: Keira Walsh was the player of the match in the Euros final and remains England\u2019s most important player with her ability to set the team\u2019s pace and tempo in midfield. Walsh\u00a0 moved to Barcelona last summer for what was said to be a world-record fee and after winning the Champions League on her first season at the club, the 26-year-old has returned to the Lionesses to set higher standards. Denmark: Pernille Harder is one of the top players in the world and will be a familiar face to England fans after three successful seasons spent in the Women\u2019s Super League with Chelsea, who she joined for a world-record fee in 2020. The skillful and tireless attacker leads the line for Denmark, who cannot afford to leave her isolated. One of the game\u2019s most decorated players, Harder will be making her World Cup debut. (Getty Images)China: Captain Wang Shanshan is a wonder: a veteran striker with a tendency to score crucial goals, the 33-year-old can also help out defensively by playing at centre-back for the team.Haiti: There is considerable excitement around the 19-year-old Melchie Dumornay, who has signed a pre-contract with European powerhouse Lyon ahead of the new season. The midfielder scored twice as Haiti beat Chile in the inter-continental play-offs to qualify for the World Cup and is regarded as one of the best young players in the world. USA: Alex Morgan, the face of the US team and joint top scorer in France four years ago, is back for her fourth World Cup, arguably better than ever. Since helping the US to back-to-back titles, Morgan has given birth to her first child and at 33 is still scoring regularly in the NWSL. Netherlands: With Vivianne Miedema ruled out with an ACL injury, the Netherlands will turn to a relatively unknown prospect for goals. Fenna Kalma only made her international debut in September but comes into the World Cup having scored 30 goals in just 20 appearances for FC Twente last season.Portugal: Jessica Silva is a baller who belongs on the World Cup stage. The Benfica forward has a tall and languid style but is devastating on the ball and is one of the most skillful attackers in the game. (Getty Images)Vietnam: As the only player in the Vietnam squad to play their football outside of the country and in Europe, striker Huynh Nhu will be familiar with some of her Group E rivals. The 32-year-old, who is Vietnam\u2019s record goalscorer, plays for Portuguese side Lank Vilaverdense.France: With Marie-Antoinette Katoto and Delphine Cascarino out of the World Cup due to injury, more emphasis and responsibility will be placed on the shoulders of Kadidiatou Diani. The PSG forward, who can play across the front line, will need to support the returning Eugenie Le Sommer, France\u2019s record goalscorer.Brazil: While Marta is very much the leader and inspiration in the Brazil team, keep an eye on the Barcelona forward Geyse, who troubled England in April with her quick turning and dribbling. Geyse has been linked with a move to the WSL and Manchester United in recent weeks. (Getty Images)Jamaica: Khadija \u2018Bunny\u2019 Shaw scored 20 goals in 22 appearances in the Women\u2019s Super League last season, second only to England\u2019s Rachel Daly, and the Manchester City striker is a shining light in the Jamaica team. Shaw thrives on the responsibility. She is Jamaica\u2019s record scorer, men\u2019s or women\u2019s, and her goals secured qualification to a second consecutive World Cup. Panama: Marta Cox is the captain of the side and stands as the inspirational force behind Panama\u2019s qualification for the World Cup. The 25-year-old midfielder dedicated Panama\u2019s victory against Paraguay in the inter-continental qualifiers to her late mother, who had passed away nine months earlier.Sweden: Converted into a left back by Barcelona, Fridolina Rolfo remains one of the most dangerous players in the world and is given full licence to attack by her national team. With a brilliant left foot and engine, Rolfo comes into the World Cup on a high after scoring the winning goal in last season\u2019s Champions League final. (Getty Images)South Africa: With key forward Thembi Kgatlana injured, Hildah Magaia scored a clinical brace as South Africa beat Morocco to win the women\u2019s Africa Cup of Nations, their first major title. Magaia was also named player of the tournament and will be key to their hopes in Group G.Italy: Barbara Bonansea. The Juventus forward is a quality outlet on the wings and remains from the Italy team that reached the quarter-finals in France four years ago. The 32-year-old Bonansea has overseen a period of change this then, with the Italy domestic league turning professional in 2022 and a new generation coming through, but she remains just as important to her side.Argentina: Estefania Banini is a star for Atletico Madrid in Spain and made the FifPro World XI in 2021. The tricky wide midfielder has returned from injury a previous falling out with the national team and is set to be fit for what is expected to be her last World Cup at the age of 33.Germany: Alexandra Popp became the first player in Euros history to score in five consecutive games before her story took an unexpected twist, with injury ruling the 32-year-old out of the final against England. The Wolfsburg striker, who is driven by goals, is among the contenders for the golden boot. (Getty Images)Morocco: Ghizlane Chebba was named player of the tournament as Morocco reached the final of the women\u2019s Africa Cup of Nations for the first time, where they lost to South Africa. The 32-year-old scored three goals during the tournament and the captain of the Morocco team has become a star in her country.Colombia: The rise of Linda Caicedo has been extraordinary. The 18-year-old is set to star in the World Cup having played in both of the U-17 and U-20 World Cups in 2022, as well as the Copa America. There, Caicedo won the tournament\u2019s Golden Ball and helped Colombia reach the final, before a big move to Europe beckoned. The midfielder chose Real Madrid, who have secured one of the biggest talents in the game. (Getty Images)South Korea: Ji So-Yun was hailed as an \u201cicon\u201d, a \u201cmagician\u201d and the \u201cbest international player in the WSL ever\u201d by Chelsea manager Emma Hayes after she made the decision to bring eight years with the Blues to an end in 2022.

That win saw Estrada, 33, avenge a 2012 defeat by \u201cChocolatito\u201d, but its narrow nature meant the old rivals were set to rematch last March, until Estrada had to withdraw due to Covid symptoms. Estrada has since outpointed Argi Cortes and triumphed in his delayed trilogy bout with \u201cChocolatito\u201d in December, winning a close fight by majority decision. His creative use of angles is one of his standout attributes, making him a fun watch each time out.9.

Devin Haney (30-0, 15 knockouts)Devin Haney (right) was a unanimous-decision winner against George Kambosos Jr in two fights in 2022  (Getty Images)The unbeaten American entered our list following his second straight clinic against George Kambosos Jr. Haney eased to a unanimous-decision win against the Australian on Kambosos\u2019 home turf in June 2022 to become undisputed champion at lightweight, before retaining that status in the pair\u2019s rematch in October \u2013 also in Melbourne. Prior to those clashes, Kambosos Jr was undefeated. At just 24 years old, the best is still ahead of Haney, though he must learn from his most recent bout, with Lomachenko in May.\u00a0It was a fight that Haney won, but not without controversy.7. Dmitry Bivol (21-0, 11 KOs)Dmitry Bivol outpointed Saul \u2018Canelo\u2019 Alvarez for a stunning win  (Copyright 2022 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.)Entered our list in May 2022, following his stunning victory over Saul \u201cCanelo\u201d Alvarez. The Russian remained unbeaten and retained the WBA light-heavyweight title with that result, which he achieved by fighting on the front foot, picking his shots wisely, and almost doubling the output of his opponent. Bivol, 32, won by two points on all three judges\u2019 scorecards, though the margins should have been much wider. A clinical showing that raised the Russian\u2019s profile immensely and likely sets up a rematch with Canelo down the line. Before that, though, Bivol was tasked with getting past the unbeaten Gilberto Ramirez in November. Bivol won on points with an aggressive and sharp performance, which saw him rise from ninth to seventh on our list. 6. Tyson Fury (33-0-1, 24 KOs)Tyson Fury after stopping Deontay Wilder again in a heavyweight epic in 2021  (Getty Images)Has eclipsed Anthony Joshua as the household name in British boxing. Fury, 34, returned to the sport in 2018 after three years off due to a long struggle with his mental health. Since then, he has established himself as one of the greatest heavyweights of all time, dethroning Deontay Wilder to become WBC champion in the pair\u2019s 2020 rematch, having controversially drawn with the American in their first clash, in 2018. In October 2021, Fury stopped Wilder for the second fight in a row to retain the belt, which he did again in April by knocking out Dillian Whyte with ease and once more in December with a late stoppage of Derek Chisora. A creative fighter who has demonstrated remarkable resilience and heart in the ring, Fury previously held the WBA, WBO, IBF and IBO titles and was looking to regain them in a fight with Oleksandr Usyk this spring. However, the fight \u2013 which would have crowned an undisputed heavyweight champion \u2013 fell through.5. Errol Spence Jr (28-0, 22 KOs)Errol Spence Jr leaving AT&T Stadium with another welterweight belt (Getty Images)The American has not been the most active fighter in recent years, but he has been slowly building a fine resume. Spence Jr holds impressive wins against the likes of Shawn Porter, Mikey Garcia, Danny Garcia and Carlos Ocampo. The southpaw stopped the latter, as well as notably finishing Kell Brook on the Briton\u2019s home turf earlier in his career, and a cancelled clash with Manny Pacquiao would surely have built up Spence even further had it come to fruition. Last time out, the 33-year-old beat Yordenis Ugas by brutalising the Cuban\u2019s eye, collecting another welterweight belt and rising up our rankings in the process. Spence will likely only continue to climb here, especially if he wins his long-awaited meeting with Terence Crawford...4. Terence Crawford (39-0, 30 KOs)Terence Crawford stopped Shawn Porter in November 2021 to stay unbeaten  (AP)The WBO welterweight champion has one of the most impressive resumes in the sport, and it just keeps getting better. Four of the American\u2019s last 10 opponents were undefeated before facing him, and all 10 were stopped by Crawford \u2013 who has a tremendous number of knockout and TKO victories to his name. Wins against big-name boxers Brook and Porter in 2020 and 2021 further enhanced the 35-year-old\u2019s profile, especially his victory over the latter, before Crawford stopped David Avanesyan in December 2022. Next up? Spence in late July.3. Saul \u2018Canelo\u2019 Alvarez (59-2-2, 39 KOs)Saul Alvarez following his stoppage win against Caleb Plant in 2021  (AP)In the 10 years since his loss to Floyd Mayweather, the Mexican has established himself as the face of boxing, with wins against Erislandy Lara, Miguel Cotto, Amir Khan, Gennadiy Golovkin, Daniel Jacobs, Billy Joe Saunders and many more of note. The effectiveness of the 32-year-old\u2019s counter-punching, slickness of his head movement and beauty of his body work make him a joy to watch.Detractors will point to Alvarez\u2019s clenbuterol controversy in 2018 and the fact that a few of his victories have come via controversial scorecards. Supporters will give more credence to Canelo\u2019s admirable level of activity and the great number of formidable foes he has fought and beaten. His three victories in 2021 \u2013 all stoppages \u2013 saw him ultimately become boxing\u2019s first ever undisputed super-middleweight champion. A title holder in four weight classes, the Mexican failed to add a second light-heavyweight title to his collection when he was outpointed by unbeaten Russian Bivol in May 2022.That result, which surprised a number of fans, marked just the second defeat of Canelo\u2019s professional career and saw him drop from No 1 in our list to No 4. He rebounded with a decisive points win against ageing rival Golovkin, though that result proved little at this point and only saw him climb one spot here. The ambitious Mexican then defended his super-middleweight belts against John Ryder in Guadalajara, dropping the Briton en route to a decision win that sees him stay put at No 3.2. Oleksandr Usyk (20-0, 13 KOs)Oleksandr Usyk (left) has outpointed Anthony Joshua twice in a row  (Getty Images)Was the only ever undisputed cruiserweight champion of the four-belt era before moving up to heavyweight, where he became WBA, WBO, IBF and IBO champion in 2021 by outpointing Anthony Joshua with relative ease. The Ukrainian, 36, is undefeated and most recently beat Joshua on points a second time to retain his heavyweight titles and climb two spots here. The southpaw, an Olympic gold medalist, is as technical and awkward as they come in the heavier weight classes, making a potential match-up with Fury an intriguing prospect \u2013 though that bout collapsed this spring. Next up for Usyk is mandatory challenger Daniel Dubois in mid-August.1. Naoya Inoue (24-0, 21 KOs)Naoya Inoue (left) stopped Paul Butler in Round 11 in December  (AP)One of the lesser-known names on this list to the more casual fan, the Japanese does not lack in prowess what he may lack in profile. Inoue has the best stoppage percentage of any fighter on this list, part of what makes him such an exciting fighter to watch \u2013 along with his effortless evasiveness, brutal body attacks, and frightening level of output. In June, \u201cMonster\u201d lived up to his nickname once again by eviscerating Nonito Donaire in a rematch, having narrowly outpointed the Filipino in their first fight.

No biting and no eye gouging\u2019: UFC\u2019s first ever champion Royce Gracie on the night MMA was bornTop 1010. Robert Whittaker (24-7, middleweight)Robert Whittaker holds one of the most impressive resumes in MMA (Zuffa LLC)The Australian has tasted defeat just three times in the last nine years. The first two of those three losses came against the phenomenal Israel Adesanya, with Whittaker losing the middleweight belt to his rival by TKO in 2019 before dropping a debatable decision to the \u201cLast Stylebender\u201d last February. Between those bouts, the \u201cReaper\u201d earned three straight wins against elite competition, and his earlier run to the belt saw him successfully navigate a murderers\u2019 row of opponents that is almost incomprehensible. He bounced back from his second loss to Adesanya with a masterful points win against Marvin Vettori, before suffering a shock TKO loss to Dricus Du Plessis in July.9. Dustin Poirier (29-7, 1 No Contest; lightweight)Former interim UFC lightweight champion Dustin Poirier  (Getty Images)The American has only two defeats in the last six years \u2013 coming against the greatest lightweight of all time in Khabib Nurmagomedov and one of the best active lightweights right now in Charles Oliveira. The \u201cDiamond\u201d holds eight wins against six different world champions of the sport, having beaten Conor McGregor twice in 2021 before most recently submitting Michael Chandler to improve that tally. He will fight Justin Gaethje, whom he stopped in 2018, in a rematch in July as the pair vie for the \u2018BMF\u2019 belt.8. Aljamain Sterling (23-3, bantamweight champion)Aljamain Sterling has recorded three title defences, all against ex-champions  (Getty Images)The Jamaican-American was mocked by some fans after winning the bantamweight title via disqualification in 2021, when Petr Yan landed an illegal knee while leading the bout. In a rematch 13 months later, Sterling silenced some doubters and irked others by winning a narrow decision. He then dominated former champion TJ Dillashaw en route to a TKO in October, as the challenger battled a dislocated shoulder, and went on to beat another ex-champion in Henry Cejudo this May, defeating the American \u2013 who had not fought in three years \u2013 via split decision. Some observers attach asterisks to each of Sterling\u2019s title defences, but all have come against former world champions, and \u201cFunk Master\u201d has now won nine fights in a row.7. Charles Oliveira (34-9, 1 NC; lightweight)Charles Oliveira has the most finishes and submissions in UFC history  (Getty Images)The Brazilian\u2019s 2010 debut in the UFC gave way to an inconsistent record with numerous failed weight-cuts along the way, but the former featherweight then turned his career around. An 11-fight win streak over five years saw Oliveira claim and retain the lightweight title vacated by the retired Khabib, then submit Justin Gaethje in May 2022 \u2013 one day after being stripped of the belt for a narrow weight-miss. That win positioned him as No 1 contender as he looked to regain the gold. However, he was submitted by Islam Makhachev in October as the Russian won the vacant title. Oliveira bounced back in June 2023, though, with a TKO win over Beneil Dariush in the first round. That result extended Oliveira\u2019s records for most finishes (19) and most submissions (16) in UFC history.6. Kamaru Usman (20-3, welterweight)Kamaru Usman was a dominant welterweight champion from 2019 until 2022  (AP)In 2021, Usman was arguably the best mixed martial artist in the world, let alone the UFC, and our pound-for-pound No 1. The Nigerian-American is perhaps the most clinical wrestler in the promotion and has added knockout power to his game in recent years, and he was unbeaten for nine years between 2013 and 2022 \u2013 with a dominant welterweight title reign for the last three years of that run. After five successful defences \u2013 two against Colby Covington, two against Jorge Masvidal, and one against Gilbert Burns \u2013 Usman dropped the belt to Leon Edwards last August, dominating his old opponent for much of the fight but falling to an incredible, late head kick. Edwards then outpointed Usman in London this March to retain the gold.5. Israel Adesanya (24-2, middleweight champion) (Getty Images)One of the most exciting fighters to watch in the history of the sport. The former kickboxer routinely produces striking masterclasses against his opponents, simply proving too slick and too clever for his competition. Adesanya has faced a who\u2019s-who of 185lbers, knocking out a number of them and losing to just one. The \u201cLast Stylebender\u201d suffered his first defeat in pro MMA in 2021, but there was even merit in that as the Nigerian-born New Zealander moved up a weight class to challenge then-champion Jan Blachowicz for the light-heavyweight title.He then began to \u201clap the opposition\u201d with back-to-back rematch wins against Vettori and Whittaker prior to his decision victory over Jared Cannonier at UFC 276. Adesanya then suffered just his second MMA defeat \u2013\u00a0and first at middleweight \u2013 in losing the title to old foe Alex Pereira in November. Pereira, who twice beat Adesanya in kickboxing bouts across 2016 and 2017, stopped the Kiwi in the final round to dethrone \u201cStylebender\u201d at the end of a thrilling encounter. But Adesanya finally exorcised his demon by knocking out Pereira in the second round in April, regaining the title and reasserting himself as the best middleweight in the UFC.4. Leon Edwards (21-3, 1 NC; welterweight champion)Leon Edwards made a successful first defence of the welterweight title in March  (Action Images via Reuters)Edwards became Britain\u2019s second ever UFC champion with a stunning, last-gasp knockout of Usman in August. After taking down the Nigerian-American \u2013\u00a0something no fighter had ever done in the UFC \u2013 in Round 1, Edwards continually rose to his feet amid an onslaught of grappling pressure from the champion over the next few frames, keeping himself in the fight. Then, with a minute left on the clock, Edwards knocked Usman out cold with a perfect head kick to take his gold, beating the man who outpointed him seven years earlier. Then, this March, Edwards outpointed Usman in London to solidify his status as champion. Edwards\u2019 first win over Usman saw him enter our list, while the second propelled him up the rankings. Since his 2015 loss to the \u201cNigerian Nightmare\u201d, Edwards is unbeaten with 11 straight wins (save for a No Contest against Belal Muhammad in 2021).3. Islam Makhachev (24-1, lightweight champion)Islam Makhachev won the UFC lightweight title by submitting Charles Oliveira in November  (AFP via Getty Images)Some used to question the Russian\u2019s credentials, given a lack of top-tier opponents on his record, though that was arguably due to highly-ranked fighters\u2019 tentativeness to risk their spots against a dangerous up-and-comer. Others accused Makhachev of benefiting from his connection to Khabib \u2013 his childhood friend and now one of Makhachev\u2019s coaches. Regardless, the 31-year-old banished any doubt in October when he submitted Oliveira \u2013 the fighter with the most submission wins in UFC history \u2013 to win the vacant lightweight title, suggesting that he would have done the same to most contenders at 155lbs.Makhachev then made it 12 wins in a row by outpointing Alexander Volkanovski in February, matching the Australian\u2019s record streak for an active fighter while retaining his title against the featherweight champion in a very close contest. In advance of that fight, many suggested that a Makhachev win would make him the new pound-for-pound No 1, but Indy Sport was more impressed by Volkanovski\u2019s showing in a higher weight class and would like to see Makhachev add some more notable names to his resume. As such, the Russian was our No 2, until...2. Jon Jones (27-1, 1 NC; heavyweight champion)Jon Jones returned to the UFC in March to collect a title in a second division  (Getty Images)When Jon Jones returned to the UFC in March after a three-year absence, winning the heavyweight title by submitting Ciryl Gane in the first round, many believed that the American confirmed himself as the greatest of all time. A lot of fans also felt that he should go straight to the top of any and all pound-for-pound lists. And Jones\u2019 victory certainly was impressive, particularly due to the manner in which it was achieved and the factors around the 35-year-old\u2019s heavyweight debut. It was also enough for the former two-time light-heavyweight champion to shoot straight into our rankings at No 2, with his long-term resume standing out more than Makhachev\u2019s (Jones has beaten numerous world champions), but his lack of activity keeping him below our No 1 \u2013 for the time being, at least.1. Alexander Volkanovski (26-2, featherweight champion)Alexander Volkanovski has defended and retained the featherweight title five times  (Getty Images)After suffering the sole defeat of his professional career in 2013, Volkanovski won a stunning 22 fights in a row. In fact, his only pro losses have come against a welterweight champion and a lightweight champion. All of the Australian\u2019s recent fights have pitted him against top names. In 2022, Volkanovski put on a clinic against fan favourite Chan Sung Jung before producing a masterclass to outpoint Max Holloway for the third time, leaving no doubt about his superiority over the man he dethroned in 2019. In doing so, the 34-year-old enhanced his own claim to be labelled the 145lbs GOAT. He even holds a win against the other standout contender for that status \u2013\u00a0Jose Aldo \u2013 as well as victories over Chad Mendes, Brian Ortega, and Yair Rodriguez.RecommendedTwo major fights announced for UFC 294 in Abu Dhabi\u2018The Rock\u2019s shoes can go f*** themselves\u2019: UFC fighter hits out at sponsorsMichael Chandler opens up on \u2018high stakes\u2019 of Conor McGregor fightVolkanovski is as dynamic, composed and well rounded as they come.

That is due to the stunning performance produced by the Aussie in that fight, with Volkanovski dropping Makhachev twice, neutralising the Russian in many of the grappling exchanges, and arguably winning the bout despite a significant size disadvantage.

Russian Makhachev, 31, has since retained the belt against featherweight champion Alexander Volkanovski, beating the Australian with a narrow decision in February. Meanwhile, Brazilian Oliveira bounced back from his loss to Makhachev by stopping Beneil Dariush in the first round in June.Oliveira, 33, won the lightweight title in 2021 after it was vacated by Khabib Nurmagomedov \u2013 Makhachev\u2019s coach and childhood friend \u2013 upon the icon\u2019s retirement.

As the camera zoomed in on the mark that Zhang\u2019s shot had left, it seemed even clearer that the shot had landed comfortably on the line.However, the \u2018out\u2019 call stood, leading Zhang to remonstrate extensively with the umpire. Meanwhile, Hungarian Toth appeared to laugh at the episode, before walking over to the mark two points later and wiping it away with her foot \u2013\u00a0while Zhang shouted: \u201cWait, wait, leave the mark!\u201dThe initial call occurred with the score at 5-5 (15-15) in the first set, and a tearful Zhang soon called the physio, before retiring from the match while down 6-5. Toth, 20, then raised her arms aloft to celebrate her victory in Budapest.During the controversial scenes, the crowd appeared to grow restless with Zhang.RecommendedNovak Djokovic fined for Wimbledon final outburstWimbledon champion Carlos Alcaraz returns home to flat above kebab shop after triumph over Novak DjokovicWimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova took inspiration from sponsor snubReacting to footage of the episode (which you can watch at the top of this article), one Twitter user wrote: \u201cThe disgusting part is when Toth celebrates as Zhang retires [...] Shame on Toth.\u201dMeanwhile, the user who shared the footage wrote: \u201cI really don\u2019t have words for how bad the umpire was for this mark. @WTA it\u2019s really time you do something and investigate these, they can\u2019t make such big mistakes at this level.

Then, in March, light-heavyweight \u2018GOAT\u2019 Jon Jones moved up to heavyweight after three years away, submitting Ciryl Gane in the first round to win the title vacated by Francis Ngannou in January, when the latter left the UFC.Later in March, Britain\u2019s Leon Edwards retained the welterweight belt with a decision win over Kamaru Usman in London, seven months after taking the title from the \u201cNigerian Nightmare\u201d with a stunning head kick. April then kicked off with Israel Adesanya finally beating long-time rival Alex Pereira, the 33-year-old knocking out the Brazilian to regain the middleweight belt that he lost to Pereira in November.There are plenty more title fights to come, too.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeTournament football is about solving problems, quickly and effectively. While Sarina Wiegman, assistant Arjan Veurink, and the rest of the coaching team will be devising plans to see off England\u2019s World Cup opponents, a lot comes down to how teams react on the pitch to what is in front of them.That is especially true when facing teams who want to sit deep against a team of England\u2019s undoubted strength, where unlocking packed back lines with 10 or 11 behind the ball will be crucial.Against cautious opponents \u2013 which is what England will face in the group stage when they play Haiti, Denmark and China \u2013 taking chances is the key. Scoring not only puts you up, but it also alters the stage of the game, it will invite the opposition forwards to try to get one back, and there is the psychological impact. There is nothing more disheartening than defending superbly for 20 or 30 minutes and then conceding from the first real opportunity.And that is why Sarina\u2019s biggest decision is who starts in the number 9 position. Rachel Daly started against Portugal, before Alessia Russo replaced her at half time. With Ellen White retired, the decision of who gets the starting jersey is between these two.I think Sarina should go with Daly.RecommendedWhy this Women\u2019s World Cup will be unlike anything we\u2019ve\u00a0seen\u00a0beforeWomen\u2019s World Cup 2023: Group guides and players to watch for every teamHow to watch every Women\u2019s World Cup match on TVForm matters. In the last World Cup, two of the top four scorers came into the tournament in blistering form. Sam Kerr, who netted five in France 2019, had scored 13 in her previous 11 league games. Ellen White, whose league campaign was more disrupted and shorter, still scored two thirds of her six league goals in the last four games before the tournament started, where she also scored six.And while the other two top scorers, Megan Rapinoe and Alex Morgan, arguably weren\u2019t in form, five of Morgan\u2019s six goals came in one game against a very poor Thailand, while Rapinoe had at least scored three in seven internationals that year.Daly is in form.While she and Russo were both goalless against Portugal, Daly has scored nine in five WSL games since the friendly loss to Australia in April; Russo has two from the same number of games. Daly will come into the tournament confident that she can convert when it counts.Rachel Daly won the WSL\u2019s golden boot last season with 22 goals for Aston Villa  (The FA via Getty Images)There are tactical reasons why this decision makes sense too. In the absence of Beth Mead and Fran Kirby, England are missing some pace, direct running, and thrusts from deep. The temptation might be to go with Russo\u2019s excellent ability in holding-up the ball and creating chances for the inverting wide attackers, but this could lead to England having too many players in front of the defence, clogging space.England will have a lot of the ball, especially against teams that sit off (it was 67.5 per cent against a defensive Portugal), but without players making runs in behind or down the channels to stretch defences or force the centre backs to turn and chase occasionally, this possession can become predictable and unthreatening.Daly offers that threat, running in behind or with potent movement in the box, the kind of predatory, reactive striker who never allows defenders a moment\u2019s peace. Playing against that kind of attacker is exhausting, and Rach has a bit of an edge to her as well which defenders will not appreciate. That also comes out in her pressing, her ability to win the ball back high or force turnovers, which can create real chances for England throughout the tournament.None of this questions Russo\u2019s ability and what she brings. We saw her throughout this WSL season as the focal point for the Manchester United attack as well as the magnificent Euro campaign where she excelled off the bench, especially once the game became a little more disjointed, when her ability to link play, create through her movement, one touch combinations or use her aerial strength, can really come into play.Alessia Russo thrived as England\u2019s impact sub at the Euros  (The FA via Getty Images)As an England fan you\u2019d take a lot of comfort seeing Russo there knowing that if we haven\u2019t made a breakthrough yet that we\u2019ve got someone that knows exactly how to score in big moments. We saw that not only in Euros, but even more recently in April with her winner for Manchester United against Arsenal.RecommendedToday at the Women\u2019s World Cup: Co-hosts play in opening gamesHow to watch every Women\u2019s World Cup match on TVFIFA Women\u2019s World Cup fixtures and full scheduleAnd that is one of the positives for England going into this tournament. As I said, tournament football is about problem solving and having two very different, but very high-quality strikers means that Sarina has a variety of possible solutions to whatever questions the team is asked. Selecting the right times to use these players will come down to Sarina.We are accustomed to thinking of players by their positions, but if we view Rachel Daly and Alessia Russo as excelling at different roles, rather than competing for the same position, it is easier to understand how England have such strength in depth and, more importantly, so many possible answers to whatever teams throw at them this summer."}, {"_id": "64b9403b51ac331da6c7c079", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/fifa-auckland-new-zealand-cbd-police-b2378550.html", "primaryCategory": "Football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Women\u2019s World Cup opener \u2018proceeds as planned\u2019 despite fatal Auckland shooting", "lead": "FIFA said the decision was made to move forward after consulting with New Zealand authorities and the participating teams.", "author": "Rachel Steinberg", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 08:00:52", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:10:03.625261", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-20T08:00:52+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/20/09/20-9fd94849fb48490a8c1f3ba2640a0157.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Miguel Delaney\u2019s Reading the Game newsletter sent straight to your inbox for freeSign up to Miguel\u2019s Delaney\u2019s free weekly newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeExit the entertainer? Allan Saint-Maximin was the crowd-pleasing anomaly in a bleak time for Newcastle United. Such excitement as they offered in the unlamented era under Steve Bruce, of largely dull and defensive football, came from the charismatic Frenchman and his mesmeric solo runs.Now, at a time when Newcastle supporters have started singing about going to Barcelona and Bayern Munich, Saint-Maximin seemingly will not be. He was omitted from the pre-season friendly against Rangers and, coach Eddie Howe said, is unlikely to join them on their pre-season tour of the United States. Saudi Arabia apparently beckons for the man who looked the prized asset when Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund (PIF) bought 80 per cent of Newcastle.The winger\u2019s departure would be a move with three strands, each reflecting wider trends in the transfer market and, in particular, at Newcastle. United have acquired the title of the world\u2019s richest club; whether accurate or not, they may have unlimited wealth but their spending power is limited by the regulations. \u201cFFP [Financial Fair Play] is a new dynamic which came to the fore,\u201d Howe said; Chelsea have to be very conscious of it, and Manchester United and Arsenal will need to be aware of the eventual figures for their summer business.RecommendedThe key area Manchester United are lagging behind City and ChelseaWho could replace Fabinho? Liverpool transfer options analysedMan Utd edge closer to Rasmus Hojlund signing amid advanced talks with AtalantaNewcastle\u2019s coup of signing Sandro Tonali also took their spending under the new regime to around \u00a3300million. Precious little has been recouped in that time. \u201cPlayer trading is a key part \u2013 if you can\u2019t hit it, you don\u2019t trade,\u201d Howe added. His squad falls into two categories: Those who, whether bought or transformed in the last 18 months, could command high prices but look invaluable to Howe; and those who could be available, who have the look of relegation strugglers or Championship footballers and were contracted in a time of lower expectations and expenditure. The problem of buying a club at the foot of the league is that many of the existing players are not worth much. Then there is Saint-Maximin who, in a season when Newcastle came fourth, had a bit-part role, with 12 league starts and a lone, if spectacular, goal.The second facet is the contentious part. Al Hilal, partly owned by the Saudi PIF, seem Saint-Maximin\u2019s suitors. It looks convenient, to say the least: At a time when Newcastle need to bring in money to carry on spending, an offer materialises from Saudi Arabia. Some may note that United have already agreed a shirt-sponsorship deal this summer with Sela, a Saudi events company. It may be more suspicious if a huge Saudi bid arrived for Ryan Fraser, Paul Dummett or Isaac Hayden than a footballer of Saint-Maximin\u2019s gifts, but it still might not sit easily with many if high-calibre signings are funded by a sale to the Middle East.Saint-Maximin has been one of the most exciting players in the Premier League in recent seasons  (AFP via Getty Images)Newcastle are entitled to argue that vast numbers of elite players from Europe\u2019s major divisions have been targeted by Saudi clubs this summer, that Chelsea have been far more active in trading with Saudi Arabia, and that Saint-Maximin \u2013 at a mooted price of \u00a340m \u2013 would bring in less than Wolves got for Ruben Neves. Liverpool, too, may make more from Saudi Arabia, but with the significant difference that losing Jordan Henderson and Fabinho was not part of the plan and would have a disruptive effect.In contrast, Saint-Maximin\u2019s switch could suit Newcastle. Howe smothered him in praise \u2013 \u201cWe all love him\u2026 if we do lose him, it would be with a heavy heart\u201d \u2013 but they are a stylistic mismatch. Saint-Maximin does not press with the vigour or reliability demanded in a team who can be exhausting simply to watch; the workaholic Joelinton sometimes took his spot on the left wing last season, and the January signing Anthony Gordon produces defensive statistics that Saint-Maximin cannot rival, even though the Frenchman is a far more compelling solo runner. Despite playing about one-third of minutes last season, Saint-Maximin made the most dribbles; he ranked a mere 16th in their squad for counter-pressing actions, however. That Newcastle could spend the proceeds of Saint-Maximin\u2019s departure on Harvey Barnes is an indication they want a quick winger; just one with different characteristics.Think of Saint-Maximin in a Newcastle shirt and the image that may come to mind will be of him picking the ball up in his own half, seemingly intent on taking on an entire defence on his way to goal. It was in part a tactic under Bruce. Now Newcastle play higher up the pitch under Howe. If, back then, virtually everyone else concentrated on defence and he was left almost alone to attack, now there is a shared commitment, with team moves producing goals and with forwards who regain the ball. Newcastle\u2019s collectivism has worked for Howe, but it has left Saint-Maximin\u2019s fate looking like the death of the maverick, the end of the wildcard.Perhaps, as Newcastle confront packed defences more often this season, they will wish they still had someone capable of supplying the X-factor. They did not sign James Maddison, a former target and a player who, in very different ways, can produce something out of nothing. Saint-Maximin belonged to a tradition of Newcastle flair players, illuminating an otherwise grey team. Yet if the age of individual inspiration is over, the other elements behind a probable move to Saudi Arabia feel very modern."}, {"_id": "64b9403c51ac331da6c7c07c", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/cricket/ashes-score-england-australia-cricket-live-b2377907.html", "primaryCategory": "Cricket", "subCategories": "test", "title": "The Ashes 2023 LIVE: England vs Australia score and latest updates as fourth Test begins at Old Trafford", "lead": "<p>Ashes scorecard and live updates as England vs Australia resumes at Old Trafford </p>", "author": "Sonia Twigg and Harry Latham-Coyle", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 07:42:10", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:10:04.384448", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-20T07:42:10+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/19/16/GettyImages-1555479023.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "\u2715CloseStokes: \"Weather forecast could dictate how we play in 4th Ashes Test\"England are batting on day two of the fourth men\u2019s Ashes Test after bowling out Australia for 317, as Chris Woakes sealed a maiden Ashes five-fer following a costly no-ball. James Anderson removed Pat Cummins with the first ball of the day at Old Trafford as the Australia captain tamely chipped to cover, and Woakes then thought he had wrapped up the innings in the next over when he drew the outside edge of last man Josh Hazlewood.However, as Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc ran off the field, the television umpire ruled Woakes had marginally overstepped, allowing Australia\u2019s batters to add another 17 runs to the total. They were eventually all out for 317 as Hazlewood again fenced to second slip, with Duckett taking a head-high catch as a relieved Woakes finished with figures of five for 62.Follow all the live action from Old Trafford as England face Australia:RecommendedStuart Broad reaches stunning career milestone as Chris Woakes strikes vital Ashes blowsEngland vs Australia - fourth Ashes Test, day twoOUT!

But Australia look a little bit rattled still, clinging on for dear life as England press the accelerator, Root waving a short ball into a long leg gap before caressing the most delectable drive for his third and fourth boundaries. The deficit dips below 150 as Cummins gathers his lieutenants for another strategy meeting.

Australia clearly fancy the short ball against Joe Root - the England batter has opened his stance up and got his hands high, prepared to take it on. He mistimes his hoick but takes a single out to Mitch Marsh at deep backward square.Harry Latham-Coyle20 July 2023 14:511689860542England 151/2 (29), Zak Crawley 83, Joe Root 8, Josh Hazlewood 0-41 (7) (trail by 166)No sign of a tempered approach from Zak Crawley after losing his partner - there are two catchers either side of an orthodox midwicket on the leg side but the batter is confident enough to bisect them as he pulls for four. Suspecting that the next ball will be fuller, Crawley strides down and outside off, a lofted larrup off his legs.The crowd boo as Josh Hazlewood and his captain take a pause to try and figure out how they might slow England\u2019s juggernaut as he thunders up towards a ton. There\u2019s no immediate solution - a drive brings Crawley three more. Cummins and Hazlewood can have a longer mull over a drink.

It is short from Mitchell Starc and positively nailed by a pulling Moeen Ali, lasering it to Khawaja\u2019s right. Out go the paws as the fielder lunges across and Khawaja\u2019s claws lock around it.

Those extra runs arrive courtesy of two more two in Josh Hazlewod\u2019s next couple of deliveries. Dropped? Yes! Bad to worse for Pat Cummins, continuing a disastrous hour after lunch. Hazlewood hurries Moeen Ali on the hook, and Cummins should really take on the lunge at midwicket, but over-extends as it arrives and lets it clang away off his wrists.

I think we\u2019ve had a lot of these conversations, probably over the last however many years, just not everything\u2019s always seen by the public.\n\nI'm truly honoured to be part of such a successful team and be here to compete with the bestJordan Nobbs\u201cI think together as a team we\u2019re pausing the conversations to obviously focus on the World Cup, but we just want to keep growing the women\u2019s game.\u201c[Compared to previous negotiations] we have a different group of players, the game\u2019s grown so quickly. So I think conversations have been different, but I think it\u2019s just been to try and fight in the right area of where the game is right now.\u201cSo I think together, between the players and the FA, we\u2019re just trying to go on the same path and obviously have questions between each other.\u201cIt\u2019s not just about money, it\u2019s not just about care, or facilities, I think there\u2019s so many areas we\u2019re trying to grow. And we\u2019re trying to obviously just do it in the way that the women\u2019s game has grown as well.

They passed away when I was 15, 16, but growing up it was weekend trips all the time, and we were really close.\u201cThey were from a place called Springfield, Massachusetts and they grew up there when they came over from Ireland. They lived in the same house their whole life, so it\u2019s pretty cool.\u201dBrosnan posted five clean sheets in World Cup qualifiers, and also denied Real Madrid\u2019s Caroline Weir the vital first-half penalty that would have given Scotland a 1-0 lead in their World Cup play-off to decide which team would make the tournament.Instead, Brosnan\u2019s save allowed substitute Amber Barrett to swoop in after the restart and score, her goal enough to ensure the Republic would win 1-0 and seal the momentous result.She said: \u201cMe and Amber laugh because people will come up to her and say, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re the best goalkeeper I know\u2019 and people will come up to me and say, \u2018Oh, what a finish!\u2019 and I\u2019m like, \u2018Ok, I know we both have red hair but we are different people!'\u201dMore people will surely tell the difference after the Republic walk out at Stadium Australia to begin the next exciting chapter in their history, before facing Canada and Nigeria to conclude the group stage.Brosnan added: \u201cI think it\u2019s a really, really special moment that we\u2019re able to take part in.\u201cThis is something we\u2019ve always dreamed of, then there\u2019s the added bonus that you\u2019re playing the host nation, that the crowd\u2019s so big, that this is our first World Cup.RecommendedOn This Day in 2005 \u2013 England striker Peter Crouch signs for LiverpoolEngland undecided over armband for World Cup openerMLS All-Star boss Wayne Rooney struggles to take lessons out of Arsenal thumping\u201cWe\u2019ve discussed really openly about how we know the quality of the group that we\u2019re in and the competition is really fierce.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeFormer England star Wayne Rooney called Arsenal one of Europe\u2019s best sides and aired some frustrations after seeing his MLS All-Star team comprehensively beaten on Wednesday.Mikel Arteta\u2019s Gunners ran out 5-0 victors in stifling conditions in Washington DC, where Gabriel Jesus\u2019 fine opener was followed by a thumping Leandro Trossard strike.Jorginho\u2019s penalty, a fine Gabriel Martinelli effort and Kai Havertz\u2019s first goal since joining Arsenal wrapped things up on a one-sided night for the Premier League runners-up.Recent acquisitions Declan Rice and Jurrien Timber made their first appearances since joining the club and Manchester United great Rooney was impressed by the visitors.\u201cObviously the result is what it is and Arsenal showed the quality they have,\u201d the MLS All-Star boss said.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow live\u201cI thought the All-Star lads looked a little nervous and hesitant, especially the first half when we got into some good areas, to get their shots off.\u201cI think you see a difference, of course you do. Arsenal are one of the best teams in Europe.\u201cI thought it was a bit stop-stop. The referee made the game a little bit about himself once again, so I think that\u2019s something that needs improving in the MLS.\u201cI\u2019ve said that all season so it\u2019s a good opportunity for me to bring it up again.\u201cBut, yeah, it was a disappointing result but I think most importantly it\u2019s a good event for the fans, especially the fans in DC, to come and see some really good players.\u201dRooney praised the occasion and opponent in the post-match press conference at Audi Field, but he also laid bare some irritation with aspects of the event.Asked what he took out of the game as an up-and-coming coach, the former England forward said with a smile: \u201cAbsolutely nothing.\u201cListen, it\u2019s difficult. On Monday the players all arrived and we did a small-sided game.\u201cOn Tuesday, as a I suggested, I didn\u2019t want them training at the National Mall but that\u2019s where we trained and we can\u2019t do anything.\u201cWe did head tennis so literally had not time whatsoever to do any tactics whatsoever so you put the players out there and you hope they can figure things out and against a team like Arsenal that\u2019s very difficult to do.\u201dAnother matter that got under Rooney\u2019s skin around the All-Star game revolved around broadcasters Apple, who he claims prevented some of his staff working as usual.\u201cI think everything around the game is great and it\u2019s great publicity for the league moving forward,\u201d he said.\u201cObviously Apple coming into the league as well has been great \u2013 although they didn\u2019t allow my staff to sit in their seats today.\u201cMy staff got kicked out of their seats today by members of Apple.\u201cAnd I wouldn\u2019t be doing my staff a service if I didn\u2019t bring that up because if you\u2019re getting asked to do the game with your staff, you expect your staff to have seats to sit in although I do think Apple will help the league moving forward.\u201dAs for Arsenal counterpart Arteta, he was quick to allay concerns over Trossard after the Belgium international limped off early in the second half.\u201cTrossard got a knock and we don\u2019t want to take any risks at this stage,\u201d he said. \u201cHe had some pain. We\u2019ll see how he is tomorrow but I don\u2019t expect it to be anything big.\u201dIt was a fine start to Arsenal\u2019s pre-season tour, which continues onto New Jersey and Los Angeles to take on Manchester United and Barcelona.\u201cIt was a great occasion, great atmosphere,\u201d Arteta added. \u201cGreat to see so many Arsenal supporters fill the stadium.RecommendedToday at the World Cup: Co-hosts Australia and New Zealand play in opening gamesShane Lowry determined to win another major as Open gets under wayDay two of fourth Ashes Test: England racing to beat Australia and the weather\u201cWe had great moments in the game, moments especially in the first half that weren\u2019t that great but we\u2019re still very early in pre-season.\u201cIt was great to see some debuts with Jurrien, with Auston (Trusty) and with Declan obviously.

The \u2018Bazball\u2019 era has thrown up plenty of thrilling batting but rarely have they had to race against the clock with such high stakes.While Australia can allow themselves the luxury of letting the match take its natural course, safe in the knowledge that a draw would see them retain the urn, England skipper Ben Stokes has made it clear he wants his side to do pull every lever they can to force a result.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveWith another full-house ready to roar them on the scene is set, but England must be careful not to go too hard, too often and blow up their own chances before the real storms arrive on Saturday.Broad joins elite companyMuttiah Muralitharan (Sri Lanka) - 800 in 133 TestsShane Warne (Australia) - 708 in 145 TestsJames Anderson (England) - 688 in 182 TestsAnil Kumble (India) - 619 in 132 TestsStuart Broad (England) - 600 in 166 TestsBroad moved to 599 Test wickets by pinning Usman Khawaja in front, bringing the enticing prospect of David Warner being the England seamer\u2019s landmark scalp.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeAfter three breathless Test matches in the Ashes series, the first day at Old Trafford reverted to a more traditional day of Test cricket, with Stuart Broad joining a select group with his 600th Test wicket, as Australia finished the first day 299-8.No side has ever won the toss, bowled first and then won a Test match at Old Trafford, in 84 matches at the ground, but England under Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum have never given much credit to what has gone before.It was Chris Woakes who was the pick of the England bowlers, continuing where he left off at Headingley. With 4-52 from his 19 overs, he has continued to prove to any doubters that he is one of the best in home conditions.While Broad might have been overshadowed by Woakes just looking at the day\u2019s play, his achievement in the format overall cannot be underestimated. Moeen Ali said in the build-up to the Test that \u201cold is gold\u201d when referring to the veteran bowling attack in England\u2019s side (with Mark Wood the youngest of the five bowlers at 33), but they showed their skill on the first day, to keep the Australian wickets tumbling at a steady rate.Only James Anderson has more Test wickets as a fast bowler than Broad, who reached the milestone 600th when Travis Head fell for England\u2019s trap. The Australian batter could not resist hooking the ball and played it straight to Joe Root on the deep fine-leg boundary, and he had to depart for just 48.RecommendedStuart Broad reveals addiction to Test cricket after taking 600th wicketStuart Broad: \u2018Addiction to Test cricket\u2019 fuelled pursuit of 600th career wicketHarry Kane interrupted by squabbling kangaroos \u2013 Wednesday\u2019s sporting socialEngland were rewarded for their persistence throughout the day, and unlike the other matches in the series where the wickets tended to fall in flurries or spells, it was a case of consistency and patience that reaped the rewards. At lunch, the tourists were 107-2, with Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne at the crease, but as they have done for most of the series, England claimed the two key wickets before they were able to really put the pressure back on the home side.Smith in particular played an uncharacteristic innings, hitting from the outset, including a six off Ali, before England successfully overturned an on-field decision for lbw, with Mark Wood trapping the former captain for just 41 from 52.Woakes\u2019s ninth wicket of the series was not only his second of the over, but it helped dispel some of the questions surrounding Jonny Bairstow\u2019s ability behind the stumps. It was a stunning diving catch low to his right to leave Australia 255-7. Woakes\u2019s nine wickets of the series have cost just 177 runs, and he has undoubtedly been a key asset since being recalled ahead of the Headingley Test match.Chris Woakes celebrates with teammates on a day when he took four tickets  (Getty Images)For Australia, it was a day of missed opportunities to capitalise. Any chance could be key, with rain due to affect play on days four and five, limiting the prospect of a result, although the home side will try anything to avoid a first draw in the Bazball era. David Warner made 32, Labuschagne 51, Smith 41, Head 48 and Marsh 51 but none of them were able to push on and really look to take the game away from England, or force them into more daring tactics during the rest of the game.In the final hour of play, England stifled Australia\u2019s flow of runs. When Marsh was out, Australia had 255-7, but they only put on another 44 runs in the final 20.1 overs of play, and took the wicket of Alex Carey.At times it felt like Australia were playing for the draw, inexplicable on day one but possible with the current weather forecast, but England will be buoyed by how freely the wickets fell, including batters who had looked settled and comfortable at the crease."}, {"_id": "64b9404151ac331da6c7c092", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/peter-wright-blackpool-sky-sports-michael-van-gerwen-god-b2378508.html", "primaryCategory": "Sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Ryan Searle requires new hotel after shocking Peter Wright in Blackpool", "lead": "The world number two was not at his best as he became the latest big name to slip out of the competition.", "author": "Pa Sport Staff", "datePublished": "2023-07-19 22:28:40", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:10:09.627726", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-19T22:28:40+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/19/23/b882112f59aacb62b2815ad39f787a63Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg5ODkwMzA2-2.70389759.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free sport newsletter for all the latest news on everything from cycling to boxingSign up to our free sport email for all the latest news\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

that.\u201cI\u2019ve picked two difficult jobs to take, to be fair, but I really believe that they\u2019ll help me in the future.\n\nI know I am not where I want to be as a finished article, but these next few years are really important in terms of me getting to grips and getting the best out of myself.Wayne Rooney\u201cWhen DC came in I felt it was a great opportunity to come out and keep developing.\u201cA difficult job in terms of where the club was at, so I had to try to improve the club first of all and get them up the table.\u201cAnd really just seeing different challenges, different things \u2013 obviously languages, culture, religion \u2013 and understanding all them different scenarios which could happen if you manage at the top level, which you will have to deal with.\u201dRooney\u2019s knowledge and experiences have clearly made him an empathetic, considered coach, who is focused on developing himself as well as his players at DC United.\u201cI think it\u2019s a place where I\u2019m coming to work and to learn and develop,\u201d he said.\u201cOf course, after games you can get frustrated and you are always thinking of how the game has gone but I think it\u2019s the right place now, in this moment in time, for me to develop.\u201dWith his family back in the UK, Rooney says he lives a \u201cquite boring\u201d existence Stateside around a 45-minute drive from downtown Washington DC.He stays with his fellow coaches and the relaxed environment is allowing the football obsessive to try new things.\u201cIf you would have asked me a year ago if I would play with a back five I would have said no,\u201d Rooney said.\u201cThen I\u2019ve gone to a back five quite a few times this season because of probably the quality of the players and it suited the squad more with the players I had.\u201cSo, there are small things like that which it has allowed me to learn and develop tactically with different formations.\u201cIt\u2019s a great experience for me to come here and work and I think it will really help me moving forward.\u201dRooney has never shied away from his ambitions to one day manage at the top level, previously saying he would \u201clove\u201d to coach Manchester United or boyhood club Everton.But right now it is DC United that holds his full focus in a competition that feels like it is about to take a giant leap forward.Lionel Messi\u2019s stunning move to Inter Miami certainly has the potential to take football in North America to new heights, while Rooney believes MLS\u2019 true quality has long been underestimated.\u201cI think it\u2019s surprised a lot of people,\u201d he said. \u201cStill now I get agents phoning me up and saying there\u2019s a striker in League Two and he\u2019s ready now to come to the MLS.\u201cI\u2019m like: \u2018He\u2019s nowhere near good enough to come and play in the MLS!\u2019\u201cI think that\u2019s a lack of understanding of the league maybe and there\u2019s maybe a little bit of disrespect towards the league from that point of view.\u201cThere are some really quality players in this league who can play at a high level.RecommendedWayne Rooney backs Declan

The first came against India in 2011 as part of figures of six for 46, with the second against Sri Lanka in 2014.Australia opener David Warner is his favourite opponent with 17 dismissals across seven Ashes series dating back to 2013, including seven in 10 innings in 2019.He has 11 dismissals each of Warner\u2019s fellow Australians Steve Smith and Michael Clarke and has taken the wickets of New Zealand pair Ross Taylor and Tom Latham and South Africa\u2019s AB de Villiers 10 times each.Broad\u2019s golden period between 2013 and 2016 also saw him take six for 25 against India at Old Trafford and six for 17 in Johannesburg to bowl South Africa out for 83.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeAfter three breathless Test matches in the Ashes series, the first day at Old Trafford reverted to a more traditional day of Test cricket, with Stuart Broad joining a select group with his 600th Test wicket, as Australia finished the first day 299-8.No side has ever won the toss, bowled first and then won a Test match at Old Trafford, in 84 matches at the ground, but England under Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum have never given much credit to what has gone before.It was Chris Woakes who was the pick of the England bowlers, continuing where he left off at Headingley. With 4-52 from his 19 overs, he has continued to prove to any doubters that he is one of the best in home conditions.While Broad might have been overshadowed by Woakes just looking at the day\u2019s play, his achievement in the format overall cannot be underestimated. Moeen Ali said in the build-up to the Test that \u201cold is gold\u201d when referring to the veteran bowling attack in England\u2019s side (with Mark Wood the youngest of the five bowlers at 33), but they showed their skill on the first day, to keep the Australian wickets tumbling at a steady rate.Only James Anderson has more Test wickets as a fast bowler than Broad, who reached the milestone 600th when Travis Head fell for England\u2019s trap. The Australian batter could not resist hooking the ball and played it straight to Joe Root on the deep fine-leg boundary, and he had to depart for just 48.RecommendedStuart Broad reveals addiction to Test cricket after taking 600th wicketStuart Broad: \u2018Addiction to Test cricket\u2019 fuelled pursuit of 600th career wicketHarry Kane interrupted by squabbling kangaroos \u2013 Wednesday\u2019s sporting socialEngland were rewarded for their persistence throughout the day, and unlike the other matches in the series where the wickets tended to fall in flurries or spells, it was a case of consistency and patience that reaped the rewards. At lunch, the tourists were 107-2, with Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne at the crease, but as they have done for most of the series, England claimed the two key wickets before they were able to really put the pressure back on the home side.Smith in particular played an uncharacteristic innings, hitting from the outset, including a six off Ali, before England successfully overturned an on-field decision for lbw, with Mark Wood trapping the former captain for just 41 from 52.Woakes\u2019s ninth wicket of the series was not only his second of the over, but it helped dispel some of the questions surrounding Jonny Bairstow\u2019s ability behind the stumps. It was a stunning diving catch low to his right to leave Australia 255-7. Woakes\u2019s nine wickets of the series have cost just 177 runs, and he has undoubtedly been a key asset since being recalled ahead of the Headingley Test match.Chris Woakes celebrates with teammates on a day when he took four tickets  (Getty Images)For Australia, it was a day of missed opportunities to capitalise.

That is such a great place to be as a 37-year-old. You turn up each day with it really fun. There is no fear of failure or judgement, it's about moving the game forward and I think that suits me.\u201cI owe a lot in the last 14 months to the way Baz and Stokes have brought energy to the group. I have been able to match that and move myself forward as a player. I have found it really enjoyable, I would argue it\u2019s been the most enjoyable year of my Test career, which is an awesome thing to say at 36 or 37.\u201dEngland will almost face a battle against the weather to keep the Ashes alive in Manchester.

To have more than seven minutes is really incredible.\u201cOf course the Tour de France is not over. I\u2019m sure Tadej will try something on the last three stages so we have to keep fighting. We\u2019re not in Paris yet.\u201dPogacar\u2019s form coming into the Tour had been an open question given his lack of racing since breaking his wrist in April. For two weeks he kept the gap tantalisingly close, but the third week has proven too much.\u201cI don\u2019t know (what happened),\u201d said Pogacar, who played down a small crash early on the stage. \u201cI tried to eat as much as possible but nothing goes to my legs, it stays in my stomach. I was really empty after three and a half hours, really empty at the bottom.\u201cIf I didn\u2019t have such great support I was thinking I would lose the podium but I was fighting with Marc and I\u2019m grateful to my team-mates\u2026\u201cI must say today was one of the worst days of my life on the bike but I had to keep fighting to the finish. I hope to recover now and then we can go for another stage on stage 20. I think it\u2019s going to be a good stage if I have good legs.\u201dAs soon as the 24-year-old radioed in his concession, team-mate Adam Yates was told to protect his third place overall and the Lancastrian put time into Carlos Rodriguez to solidify his podium spot, now 76 seconds up on the young Spaniard and three minutes behind Pogacar.Up ahead, Gall attacked from the remains of a 34-strong breakaway. Simon Yates did his best to chase down the Austrian but could not quite bridge the gap and came in 30 seconds down, his second runner-up finish of the Tour after being beaten by twin brother Adam on stage one in Bilbao.\u201cI didn\u2019t know the climb but I don\u2019t know if I would change anything,\u201d the Jayco-Alula rider said. \u201cI was wary of the altitude so I tried to pace myself.

Vingegaard was climbing the giant Col de la Loze, a 28.1km slog averaging 6% gradient to the highest point in this year\u2019s race, at the end of the Tour\u2019s queen stage.The Dane had already shaken off his main rival for the yellow jersey, Tadej Pogacar, and set off in pursuit of the leader on the road, Austrian rider Felix Gall, when he was brought to a standstill by a logjam ahead. A media motorbike appeared to stall on the mountain, forcing the car behind it to stop suddenly. Vingegaard and Jumbo-Visma teammate Wilco Kelderman were close behind and had to stop before squeezing through a narrow gap between the car and another bike amid a swarm of spectators.Some fans gave Vingegaard a push to help him get back on his way but in truth he was unlikely to have ever caught Gall, who eventually won the stage with a healthy gap to second-placed Simon Yates, with the man in the yellow jersey eventually finishing fourth.RecommendedThe new Tour de France battleground: Handling the heatwaveJonas Vingegaard \u2018proud\u2019 as time trial win hands him control of Tour de FranceJonas Vingegaard takes control of Tour de France with big time trial victoryGall, making his Tour debut, delivered a first win of this year\u2019s race for the AG2R Citroen team, having unexpectedly taken over the leadership role within the squad after Ben O\u2019Connor\u2019s overall ambitions faded in the first week.\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say,\u201d the 25-year-old said. \u201cThis whole year has been incredible and now to do so well in the Tour and to win the queen stage it\u2019s incredible.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeTottenham are considering a move for Flamengo\u2019s Pedro to prepare for the prospective sale of Harry Kane, among several forward options, The future of the England striker remains \u201c50-50\u201d, with Bayern Munich believing they have everything in place other than the key agreement with Daniel Levy, but Spurs are naturally looking at alternative options - especially given Kane only has a year left on his contract.The 26-year-old Pedro has a fine scoring record with Flamengo, with whom he won the Copa Libertadores, and was in the Brazil squad for the 2022 World Cup. While he struggled in a spell at Fiorentina four years ago, the feeling is that the move came too early and he is now ready to play for a big European club. He is also one of a range of options Spurs are considering, although it may be too late to move for Atalanta\u2019s Rasmus Hojlund, given Manchester United\u2019s advances.Should Spurs sell Kane, the idea would be more to reshape the attack amid Ange Postecoglou\u2019s fluid new style, rather than directly replace the forward. That is seen as virtually impossible.RecommendedNew Spurs boss Ange Postecoglou discusses first Harry Kane meeting \u2013 \u2018nothing earth-shattering\u2019The idea of Kane leaving, however, is now seen as much more realistic than it had been. It is merely up to Bayern - or any other suitor - to come up with a number acceptable to Levy. The German champions have already had two offers up to \u00a380m rejected. Paris Saint-Germain retain interest, but Kane prefers Bayern. Real Madrid had wanted Kane before Kylian Mbappe\u2019s situation changed, but they would never have gone for more than \u00a360m for a player with a year left on his contract.Levy remains unwilling to sell to an English club, in a situation that could still go to the wire."}, {"_id": "64b9404851ac331da6c7c0a9", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/cricket/moeen-ali-england-ben-stokes-mark-wood-marnus-labuschagne-b2378222.html", "primaryCategory": "Cricket", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Moeen Ali dismisses Marnus Labuschagne to boost England hopes in must-win Test", "lead": "Australia were 187 for four at tea in Manchester.", "author": "Rory Dollard", "datePublished": "2023-07-19 15:08:35", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:10:16.583907", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-19T15:08:35+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/19/16/8e18d5c3265767ca22080929fa9e9e07Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg5ODY0NTU5-2.73050749.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free sport newsletter for all the latest news on everything from cycling to boxingSign up to our free sport email for all the latest news\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeMoeen Ali made an important breakthrough on the first afternoon as England battled to keep their Ashes prospects alive at Emirates Old Trafford.After sending Australia in to bat in increasingly placid conditions, Ben Stokes saw the tourists reach 187 for four at tea on day one in Manchester.With rain predicted to be a factor over the weekend, that just about keeps the home side in touch as they look to force the win they need to take the series to a decider at the Kia Oval next week but the margin for error is slim.Stuart Broad and Chris Woakes took care of Australia\u2019s openers in the morning, the former moving to 599 career wickets, but Australia\u2019s middle order threatened to drag the game away after lunch.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveMark Wood successfully removed Steve Smith to check that progress but a stand of 63 between Marnus Labuschagne (51) and Travis Head (47no) was beginning to become a major headache.Then, 10 minutes before the interval, Moeen found enough spin to turn one past Labuschagne\u2019s inside edge and win an lbw decision via DRS.Labuschagne had just celebrated his first half-century of the series and was starting to show flickers of the form that, until recent weeks, saw him occupy top spot in the ICC\u2019s world batting rankings.The suggestion of early spin from Moeen also had the effect of casting question marks over Australia\u2019s team selection, having dropped Todd Murphy and gone in without a specialist spinner for the first time in 120 Tests.The day began with Pat Cummins calling incorrectly at the toss for the fourth time in a row, a losing streak that left him jokingly asking to inspect the coin.Eager to press the game forward due to his side\u2019s 2-1 deficit Stokes was happy to gamble by sending the opposition in, despite the fact that the morning cloud cover was already beginning to give way to sun and the pitch looked invitingly flat.Broad saw a loose first ball slapped for four by his old rival David Warner, but was soon celebrating England\u2019s first success when a full delivery from round the wicket pinned Usman Khawaja deep in crease.Nobody has scored more runs or batted for longer than Khawaja in this Ashes and England were delighted to see the back of him for just three.James Anderson, back and bowling from the end that bears his name after being rested at Headingley, was tidy from start but was still wicketless heading into the evening session and appeared short of his absolute best.The arrival of Mark Wood dialled up the pace as he once again cleared 90mph at a canter but his first four overs cost 21 \u2013 plus four byes down leg \u2013 as Australia stood up to his challenge.It took the subtler promptings of Woakes to get England\u2019s second, Warner (32) caught behind on the drive just as he was beginning to grow in confidence.Smith was next up and almost gifted England a chance with an opening stroke that was entirely out of character.He stepped inside the line of his first ball from Woakes, hooking straight towards Wood at fine-leg. Had he been stationed on the rope it would have been a regulation catch, but he was several metres in and saw the ball clear his despairing dive en route to a one-bounce four.Smith and Labuschagne scored with greater freedom as Australia moved to 107 for two at the lunch break, Moeen\u2019s first two-over burst costing 17, but England applied the brakes well in the following session.Australia scored just 80 between lunch and tea, losing their middle-order engine room to a pair of lbws.RecommendedJohn Asiata wants underdogs Leigh to continue doing \u2018special\u2019 thingsOllie Pope has surgery on dislocated right shoulderBilly Boston says Cardiff \u2018codebreakers\u2019 statue among \u2018highlights of my life\u2019Wood\u2019s air-speed was the decisive factor in breaching Smith\u2019s defences, beating the bat with a ball that speared into the front pad at 92mph, while Moeen found the perfect combination of accuracy and grip to end a battling knock from the out-of-sorts Labuschagne. Both decisions were turned down on the field but Stokes picked his challenges well to get both appeals upheld.Head, who was rattled on the grille by a Wood bouncer with just two to his name, played with his usual attacking verve and helped himself to seven boundaries as he stepped in to lead Australia\u2019s charge."}, {"_id": "64b9404851ac331da6c7c0aa", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/ufc/ufc-sponsors-the-rock-shoes-tanner-boser-b2378197.html", "primaryCategory": "UFC", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018The Rock\u2019s shoes can go f*** themselves\u2019: UFC fighter hits out at company\u2019s sponsors", "lead": "<p>Tanner Boser said he doesn\u2019t \u2018get a single penny\u2019 from the various brands involved with the UFC </p>", "author": "Alex Pattle", "datePublished": "2023-07-19 15:04:41", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:10:16.869921", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-19T15:04:41+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/19/15/newFile-6.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free sport newsletter for all the latest news on everything from cycling to boxingSign up to our free sport email for all the latest news\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeIn the final minutes before the hottest stages of the Tour de France, the man in the yellow jersey, Jonas Vingegaard, can be spotted wearing a CryoVest \u2013 a fetching waistcoat of ice. Keeping his body temperature low delays the inevitable spike, at least a little, and as soon as the race is done he cools down in front of an industrial-sized fan while a staff member douses his neck with freezing water.The south of France has been punishingly hot in recent days. Temperatures reached 39C and a weather warning was issued in Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, where the Tour is into its third week of hard racing. The road surface a few inches below the riders\u2019 feet reaches 60C, cooking riders like a pizza oven. Cyclists may be anatomical anomalies but they race on their limits, and the inescapable heat can break them.Inside the peloton, ice cubes are crammed in helmets and stuffed down jerseys and specially designed socks. Chilled bidons are pushed down backs, and wet towels are wrapped around shoulders. Britain\u2019s Tom Pidcock wears his own cooling jacket made up of 20 individual pockets. On the road, they snake across to the side guarded by trees or a few shop awnings, and afterwards team doctors assess weight loss, as well as their urine.Jonas Vingegaard greets fans before stage 14, wearing his CryoVest  (EPA)Lidl-Trek\u2019s Italian rider Giulio Ciccone douses himself with water (Getty)RecommendedJonas Vingegaard \u2018proud\u2019 as time trial win hands him control of Tour de FranceJonas Vingegaard takes control of Tour de France with big time trial victoryTour de France LIVE: Stage 16 latest updatesIneos\u2019s British rider Tom Pidcock sports an ice vest (AP)The area to make marginal gains has shifted through phases over the years: the focus was body fat percentage, diet and nutrition, sleep (Team Sky would take a rider\u2019s personalised bedding to each new hotel); key data points like functional threshold power and Vo2 max; improvements in aerodynamics and altitude training. And, increasingly, heat adaptation is becoming a critical tool in a rider\u2019s armoury.Vingegaard\u2019s closest rival, Slovenia\u2019s Tadej Pogacar, has a reputation for struggling in the heat, while oddly Vingegaard \u2013 who grew up in the much flatter relief and cooler climate of Denmark \u2013 thrives on hot and sticky days in the high mountains. Pogacar took special action this year, training in Spain\u2019s Sierra Nevada desert where he wore extra layers of clothing to stress his body, and limited nutrition and water intake to replicate the depletion of a burning day.Taking on board enough energy before and during a hot day\u2019s race is vital. Elite riders train themselves to eat as much food as possible, literally stretching their stomachs, in what is another secret discipline within the sport. When they can\u2019t take on more, it can be costly. \u201cI need to evaluate a little bit, but I think I just didn\u2019t have enough energy,\u201d said Ineos\u2019s Tom Pidcock after losing valuable time on the mountainous stage 14 due to heat exhaustion. \u201cYesterday was a late stage, a late dinner and I just couldn\u2019t really eat enough.\u201dSodium replenishment has become an industry in itself. One company, Precision Fuel and Hydration, works with Belgian team Lotto-Dstny to come up with tailored fuelling strategies, based on each rider\u2019s rate of perspiration and their sodium lost per litre of sweat. Beads of sweat are sucked up from a contraption on the arm and analysed carefully: everyone sweats differently (it has nothing to do with fitness or aerobic capacity) and so everyone\u2019s fuelling needs are unique.Sports writer Lawrence Ostlere inside the 40C heat chamber (The Independent)It all feeds into the body\u2019s ability to respond to a rising core temperature. I recently put this to the test in the Porsche Human Performance Centre at Silverstone, by riding a watt bike for 30 minutes in a heat chamber set at 40C, to get the smallest sense of what a Tour de France rider might experience. Even in that short period of time, at a manageable cadence, the heat was smothering and the legs felt noticeably drained.My core temperature was measured throughout the experiment to make sure it didn\u2019t tip above 40C, at which point the test would have been abandoned. Below 38C the body can operate with high efficiency, but once a rider\u2019s temperature tips above 39C, the brain instructs the muscles to slow down and fatigue sets in. Above 40C, heat exhaustion (losing too much water and sodium through sweat) is in play; above 41C there is the serious risk of heat stroke (when temperature regulation fails) and the body shutting down. My temperature got very close to 40C before stabilising in the high 39s. Stepping off the bike and out of the chamber half an hour later brought a wash of relief.Lawrence feels the heat during the 30-minute test (The Independent)RecommendedSelfie-seeking Tour de France fans warned after causing horror crashTour de France spectator causes huge crash by taking selfieThe sporting weekend in picturesTour riders have an arsenal of weapons to combat such extreme conditions, but ultimately there is only so much they can do once they\u2019re on the road. They have no choice but to ride through the heat and there is a balance to be struck between conserving output and pushing hard: the quicker they finish, the quicker it\u2019s over.Then again, for Vingegaard, the harder the race and the tougher the conditions, the more chance he has of winning another yellow jersey. After two and a half weeks of gruelling racing, from the sweeping coastline of the Spanish Basque Country to the high Alpine roads, through driving rain and stifling sun, he is almost there."}, {"_id": "64b9404a51ac331da6c7c0af", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/womens-world-cup-groups-players-b2378089.html", "primaryCategory": "Football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Women\u2019s World Cup 2023: Group guides and players to watch for every team", "lead": "<p>The full guide to the biggest ever Women\u2019s World Cup as the tournament kicks off in Australia and New Zealand </p>", "author": "Jamie Braidwood", "datePublished": "2023-07-19 14:24:30", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:10:18.122749", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-19T14:24:30+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/19/13/GettyImages-1507385576.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Miguel Delaney\u2019s Reading the Game newsletter sent straight to your inbox for freeSign up to Miguel\u2019s Delaney\u2019s free weekly newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Group G: Sweden, South Africa, Italy, ArgentinaCan Sweden turn heartbreak into Women\u2019s World Cup history? Group H: Germany, Morocco, Colombia, South KoreaGermany are out for revenge - the World Cup is the perfect chancePlayers to watchNew Zealand: If New Zealand are going to need something special to break their cycle of World Cup disappointment on home soil, don\u2019t be surprised if they are inspired by the fearlessness of youth. The Football Ferns finished an impressive third at the Under-17 World Cup five years ago and striker Gabi Rennie, the team\u2019s No 9, is a breakthrough prospect.Norway: It\u2019s a testament to the skill, speed and elusiveness of Barcelona\u2019s Caroline Graham Hansen that Guro Reiten isn\u2019t even the most dangerous winger on the Norway team. Arguably the best dribbler in the game, the 28-year-old took a break from the international side following the Euros last summer but is now back to best - as Chelsea once again found out in this season\u2019s Champions League. (Getty Images)Switzerland: The smooth and composed Lia Walti draws the eye in the centre of midfield and the captain is the pillar of the side. \u201cLia is such a magnetic player. Everyone passes to her,\u201d said the Switzerland head coach Inka Grings. \u201cShe always demands the ball and, when she has it, it sticks to her feet.\u201dPhilippines: Sarina Bolden took the most important kick in the history of the Philippines with the winning penalty against Chinese Taipei that secured their qualification for the World Cup. The Philippines will need more moments of history to make an impact in New Zealand.Australia: There\u2019s no question about this. Sam Kerr is the face of the World Cup and the star of the Australia team. As the most lethal striker in the world, who always seems to deliver on the big occasion, the Chelsea forward could be the difference for the Matildas as they look to advance past the quarter-finals for the first time. The 29-year-old makes the hosts a genuine contender. (Getty Images)Canada: Christine Sinclair has been setting records for most of her life. At 40, and now into the 22nd year of her international career, the striker is set to become the first player to play at six World Cups - although Brazil\u2019s Marta could later equal that record this tournament. In Australia, Sinclair and Marta also have the chance to become the first player to score at six different World Cups. Nigeria: Asisat Oshoala doesn\u2019t just have a claim to be the greatest African player in the world, but the best of all time. The Nigeria striker and Barcelona star has won the African player of the year award four times and has hit at least 20 goals in each of her last two seasons in Spain. The Super Falcons may have been drawn in the group of death, but Oshoala will be a threat to both Australia and Canada. (Getty Images)Ireland: Katie McCabe. The Arsenal fan favourite famously wears her heart on her sleeve and embodies what Ireland will require in Australia: defensive nous, aggression, a lot of effort, and quality when it counts. McCabe has it all and alongside Denise O\u2019Sullivan will be key.Spain: Aitana Bonmati. When an ACL injury robbed two-time Ballon d\u2019Or winner Alexia Putellas of the chance to play at the Euros last summer and then took away almost all of the following season, it handed her international and club team-mate Bonmati the opportunity to play further forward for Barcelona. How she took it. Arguably the best player in the world over the past year.  (Getty Images)Japan: Yui Hasegawa. Signed by Manchester City last summer to replace England\u2019s Keira Walsh, the 26-year-old impressed with her class and composure on the ball and tenacity in midfield, finishing the season as one of the top performers in the Women\u2019s Super League. Japan will rely on Hasegawa to set their tempo from the middle of the pitch.Zambia: Barbra Banda made history at the 2021 Olympics when she became the first player to score back-to-back hat-tricks at the Games. The 23-year-old is captain of the Zambia side and is key to their chances of making it out of the group, as her stunning two-goal display against Germany before the tournament showed.Costa Rica: Raquel Rodriguez is Costa Rica\u2019s record scorer with 55 goals, including the country\u2019s first at a World Cup on their only previous appearance in 2015. The Portland Thorns midfielder, who has won over 100 caps for Costa Rica, has urged her team-mates to battle with passion and commitment as they look to claim a first-ever World Cup win.England: Keira Walsh was the player of the match in the Euros final and remains England\u2019s most important player with her ability to set the team\u2019s pace and tempo in midfield. Walsh\u00a0 moved to Barcelona last summer for what was said to be a world-record fee and after winning the Champions League on her first season at the club, the 26-year-old has returned to the Lionesses to set higher standards. Denmark: Pernille Harder is one of the top players in the world and will be a familiar face to England fans after three successful seasons spent in the Women\u2019s Super League with Chelsea, who she joined for a world-record fee in 2020. The skillful and tireless attacker leads the line for Denmark, who cannot afford to leave her isolated. One of the game\u2019s most decorated players, Harder will be making her World Cup debut. (Getty Images)China: Captain Wang Shanshan is a wonder: a veteran striker with a tendency to score crucial goals, the 33-year-old can also help out defensively by playing at centre-back for the team.Haiti: There is considerable excitement around the 19-year-old Melchie Dumornay, who has signed a pre-contract with European powerhouse Lyon ahead of the new season. The midfielder scored twice as Haiti beat Chile in the inter-continental play-offs to qualify for the World Cup and is regarded as one of the best young players in the world. USA: Alex Morgan, the face of the US team and joint top scorer in France four years ago, is back for her fourth World Cup, arguably better than ever. Since helping the US to back-to-back titles, Morgan has given birth to her first child and at 33 is still scoring regularly in the NWSL. Netherlands: With Vivianne Miedema ruled out with an ACL injury, the Netherlands will turn to a relatively unknown prospect for goals. Fenna Kalma only made her international debut in September but comes into the World Cup having scored 30 goals in just 20 appearances for FC Twente last season.Portugal: Jessica Silva is a baller who belongs on the World Cup stage. The Benfica forward has a tall and languid style but is devastating on the ball and is one of the most skillful attackers in the game. (Getty Images)Vietnam: As the only player in the Vietnam squad to play their football outside of the country and in Europe, striker Huynh Nhu will be familiar with some of her Group E rivals. The 32-year-old, who is Vietnam\u2019s record goalscorer, plays for Portuguese side Lank Vilaverdense.France: With Marie-Antoinette Katoto and Delphine Cascarino out of the World Cup due to injury, more emphasis and responsibility will be placed on the shoulders of Kadidiatou Diani. The PSG forward, who can play across the front line, will need to support the returning Eugenie Le Sommer, France\u2019s record goalscorer.Brazil: While Marta is very much the leader and inspiration in the Brazil team, keep an eye on the Barcelona forward Geyse, who troubled England in April with her quick turning and dribbling. Geyse has been linked with a move to the WSL and Manchester United in recent weeks. (Getty Images)Jamaica: Khadija \u2018Bunny\u2019 Shaw scored 20 goals in 22 appearances in the Women\u2019s Super League last season, second only to England\u2019s Rachel Daly, and the Manchester City striker is a shining light in the Jamaica team. Shaw thrives on the responsibility. She is Jamaica\u2019s record scorer, men\u2019s or women\u2019s, and her goals secured qualification to a second consecutive World Cup. Panama: Marta Cox is the captain of the side and stands as the inspirational force behind Panama\u2019s qualification for the World Cup. The 25-year-old midfielder dedicated Panama\u2019s victory against Paraguay in the inter-continental qualifiers to her late mother, who had passed away nine months earlier.Sweden: Converted into a left back by Barcelona, Fridolina Rolfo remains one of the most dangerous players in the world and is given full licence to attack by her national team. With a brilliant left foot and engine, Rolfo comes into the World Cup on a high after scoring the winning goal in last season\u2019s Champions League final. (Getty Images)South Africa: With key forward Thembi Kgatlana injured, Hildah Magaia scored a clinical brace as South Africa beat Morocco to win the women\u2019s Africa Cup of Nations, their first major title. Magaia was also named player of the tournament and will be key to their hopes in Group G.Italy: Barbara Bonansea. The Juventus forward is a quality outlet on the wings and remains from the Italy team that reached the quarter-finals in France four years ago. The 32-year-old Bonansea has overseen a period of change this then, with the Italy domestic league turning professional in 2022 and a new generation coming through, but she remains just as important to her side.Argentina: Estefania Banini is a star for Atletico Madrid in Spain and made the FifPro World XI in 2021. The tricky wide midfielder has returned from injury a previous falling out with the national team and is set to be fit for what is expected to be her last World Cup at the age of 33.Germany: Alexandra Popp became the first player in Euros history to score in five consecutive games before her story took an unexpected twist, with injury ruling the 32-year-old out of the final against England. The Wolfsburg striker, who is driven by goals, is among the contenders for the golden boot. (Getty Images)Morocco: Ghizlane Chebba was named player of the tournament as Morocco reached the final of the women\u2019s Africa Cup of Nations for the first time, where they lost to South Africa. The 32-year-old scored three goals during the tournament and the captain of the Morocco team has become a star in her country.Colombia: The rise of Linda Caicedo has been extraordinary. The 18-year-old is set to star in the World Cup having played in both of the U-17 and U-20 World Cups in 2022, as well as the Copa America. There, Caicedo won the tournament\u2019s Golden Ball and helped Colombia reach the final, before a big move to Europe beckoned. The midfielder chose Real Madrid, who have secured one of the biggest talents in the game. (Getty Images)South Korea: Ji So-Yun was hailed as an \u201cicon\u201d, a \u201cmagician\u201d and the \u201cbest international player in the WSL ever\u201d by Chelsea manager Emma Hayes after she made the decision to bring eight years with the Blues to an end in 2022. Ji\u2019s impact on Chelsea\u2019s success under Hayes was clear, but the creative midfielder has created an even finer legacy in her own country. Ji is South Korea\u2019s greatest ever player and record scorer, and this is set to be her last World Cup.How can I follow the Women\u2019s World Cup?For UK viewers, every game will be available to watch on the BBC and ITV.For the BBC, there will be live coverage on television as well as the BBC Sport website with live audio commentary available on BBC Radio 5 Live, 5 Sports Extra and the BBC Sounds app.RecommendedAustralia relief after World Cup opener reveals significance of Sam Kerr injuryAustralia star Sam Kerr ruled out of Women\u2019s World Cup opener after injury blowEngland Women World Cup Fixtures: Full Lionesses schedule and route to the finalFor ITV, live coverage will be available on television as well as online via ITVX.At present, the BBC and ITV have only announced the schedule for the group stages, although the BBC have said they will broadcast both semi-finals with the final available on both channels."}, {"_id": "64b9404a51ac331da6c7c0b0", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/golf/rory-mcilroy-r-a-wyndham-clark-jon-rahm-padraig-harrington-b2378167.html", "primaryCategory": "Golf", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Open organisers opt for final-day theatre as Rory McIlroy eyes end to major wait", "lead": "R&amp;A chief executive Martin Slumbers is hoping for a dramatic climax to the tournament on Sunday.", "author": "Phil Casey", "datePublished": "2023-07-19 14:17:37", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:10:18.363592", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-19T14:17:37+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/19/15/777c11d3af747253285fc440602add23Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg5ODYwNDI3-2.73049198.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free sport newsletter for all the latest news on everything from cycling to boxingSign up to our free sport email for all the latest news\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeDrama has not been in short supply off the course in recent times as men\u2019s professional golf suffered a seismic split before an equally shocking possibility of peace.On the course, in this year\u2019s majors at least, that has not been the case as Jon Rahm, Brooks Koepka and Wyndham Clark won the Masters, US PGA and US Open respectively with relatively little final-round fuss.All that could be about to change if the R&A get their way in the 151st Open Championship at Royal Liverpool, where changes made since Rory McIlroy\u2019s victory in 2014 are intended to produce a dramatic climax to the year\u2019s final major.Most significantly, a new par-three \u2013 the 17th \u2013 has been created as part of a re-routing of the closing stretch which could play a large role in deciding who is left holding the Claret Jug on Sunday evening.\u201cOne of the sentiments that was felt after 2006 and 2014 was that the course could do with more drama,\u201d R&A chief executive Martin Slumbers said.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow live\u201cIt was actually the club that came to us and said there was a lot of talk around flipping what was the 15th up on to the dunes. We came and looked at it and we thought, \u2018Yeah, that could really add some drama\u2019. There is a lot of jeopardy there.\u201cI think it fits well. It also enabled us to reconfigure the final bit around there. So the final four holes will be a 610-yard par five, 480-yard par four, 136-yard par three and a 620-yard par five.\u201cA lot of things could happen on that (stretch) and I think that drama will unfold come Sunday.\u201dA finish similar to Sunday\u2019s Scottish Open would certainly be welcome, McIlroy defying strong winds to birdie the last two holes and defy home favourite Robert MacIntyre the title at the Renaissance Club.It completed the ideal preparation for the world number two as he bids to end a major drought which stretches back to the 2014 US PGA, victory at Valhalla coming just seven days after winning the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational.Even the weather seems to have turned in McIlroy\u2019s favour as a hot spell gave way to wetter conditions which have always suited his powerful game and high ball flight.\u201cI was expecting it to be more like 2006 when I was looking at it five, six weeks ago, and I was excited about that,\u201d Slumbers added. \u201cBut every time I get excited about a nice brown golf course, mother nature comes in.\u201cBut on the other side of it, the rough has come up. When it was brown the rough had burnt out and it was a different golf course. My worry is now what the forecast is for Saturday and Sunday. It\u2019s going to be wet or it\u2019s going to be very wet. We\u2019ll see.\u201dWith McIlroy cancelling his formal pre-tournament press conference for the second major running, it has fallen to other players to speak about his chances, with two-time Open champion Padraig Harrington asked if a return to Hoylake could be the missing link to major success.\u201cYes, of course it could,\u201d Harrington said. \u201cHe\u2019s got to like the golf course. He\u2019s got to be familiar with the course.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeTupac Shakur, one of gangsta rap\u2019s greatest icons, was mortally wounded in a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas, Nevada, on the night of 7 September 1996.The black BMW 750 sedan he was riding in with Death Row records boss Suge Knight was suddenly fired upon from a rented white Cadillac that had pulled up longside the vehicle, as it idled at traffic lights at the intersection of Flamingo Road and Koval Lane.Tupac, 25, had failed to notice the danger as he flirted playfully with a carload of female fans on the passenger side of his car.He was hit four times as the mystery gunman fired 14 shots from a Glock semi-automatic pistol, with one bullet tearing through his right lung.He died of internal bleeding in the intensive care unit of the University Medical Center of Southern Nevada six days later.RecommendedLas Vegas police serve search warrant in connection with Tupac Shakur murderMoment police swarm Las Vegas house 27 years after Tupac murdered in drive-by shootingLas Vegas police raided a home in connection with Tupac Shakur\u2019s 1996 murder. Why is it happening now?His murder has never been solved and no arrests have ever been made.Now, 27 years later, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department has executed a raid on a property in Henderson, a city 15 miles southeast of the gambling paradise, unexpectedly blowing open one of the 20th century\u2019s most infamous cold cases.Police are remaining tightlipped as to what has suddenly led to this development.Tupac\u2019s murder has long been blamed on the escalating East Coast-West Coast hip-hop rivalry of the 1990s \u2013 a rivalry which would also claim the life of Shakur\u2019s friend-turned-rival Notorious BIG in Los Angeles on 9 March 1997.But, in the absence of any concrete answers as to what happened to the hip-hop icon, conspiracy theories have filled the void over the past three decades.Here are some of the most common \u2013 and most bizarre theories around Tupac\u2019s death:Theory: Biggie Smalls set up Orlando \u2018Baby Face\u2019 Anderson to pull the triggerChuck Philips, an investigative reporter with The Los Angeles Times, spent a year researching Shakur\u2019s killing and published his article \u201cWho Killed Tupac Shakur?\u201d on 6 September 2002.Shakur had attacked Orlando \u201cBaby Lane\u201d Anderson, 21, earlier that evening in the lobby of the MGM Grand Hotel after both men had attended a sold-out boxing bout between Mike Tyson and Bruce Seldon.One of Knight\u2019s entourage, who belonged to the feared Los Angeles gang the Bloods, had pointed out Anderson, a member of the rival Crips, and claimed that he had been responsible for attempting to rob one of Shakur\u2019s bodyguards at a mall in Lakewood, California, earlier that year, stealing a medallion as a calculated insult.The ensuing assault on Anderson by the rapper and his minders was caught on the MGM Grand\u2019s surveillance footage.After that, Shakur headed with Knight to the fashionable Club 662 night spot \u2013 a journey that would be his final ride.A mural dedicated to Tupac Shakur in California  (AFP/Getty)Mr Philips wrote that the shooting was carried out as revenge for the casino attack, with Anderson himself firing the fatal shots.The murder weapon, the journalist alleged, had been provided to Anderson by the Notorious BIG AKA Biggie Smalls AKA Christopher Wallace, who had agreed to pay a $1m bounty for Shakur\u2019s death after becoming enraged when Tupac responded to his 1994 diss track \u201cWho Shot Ya?\u201d with \u201cHit \u2018Em Up\u201d, in which he bragged about sleeping with Biggie\u2019s wife Faith Evans.Anderson would only be interviewed by investigating officers once and would likewise be killed in a seemingly unrelated gangland shooting on 29 May 1998.A follow-up piece by Philips looked at the alleged mistakes made by law enforcement in the immediate aftermath of the slaying.Theory: Suge Knight masterminded the hits on both Tupac and BiggieIn his 2002 film Biggie and Tupac, British documentarian Nick Broomfield argued that the driver of the car \u2013 Suge Knight \u2013 in which Shakur was shot was the real puppet-master behind the incident, despite Tupac being the biggest star on his record label at the time.Mr Broomfield interviewed ex-LAPD detective Russell Poole in the film, who claimed that corrupt officers helped Knight to cover up both killings.Shakur\u2019s murder, he said, was carried out in response to fears that Shakur might leave Death Row to become an actor \u2013 on the calculation that he would remain commercially viable as a martyr after his death but would represent a business threat as a competitor. Biggie\u2019s murder, he claimed, was staged a year later to conceal Knight\u2019s part in the first.Suge Knight with Tupac in 1996  (Shutterstock)The director\u2019s work has been dismissed as speculative, however, and the credibility of some of his sources called into question.If Knight had planned the attack, unrelated to the Orlando Anderson fracas, he placed himself in considerable danger by being present in the BMW when the gunman opened fire and could surely have conceived of a less messy plot than a drive-by.That said, the facts as they stand do leave him with the perfect alibi.In 2017, Knight endorsed another documentary that implied that it was he, not Tupac, who was the real target of the attack, which alleged that his ex-wife Sharitha Golden and his former head of security Reggie Willis Jr had planned it all as part of a coup to assume control of Death Row.Theory: Tupac is alive and well in CubaA man named Michael Nice, who claimed to have been part of Shakur\u2019s security team, insisted in December 2018 that the rapper was not dead after all.Instead, Mr Nice said that he himself had played a role in helping to stage the drive-by and spirit his boss away to Cuba \u2013 with the support of the country\u2019s late leader Fidel Castro, no less, who retained a friendly respect for the rapper\u2019s former Black Panther aunt Assata Shakur, who had sought asylum in Havana in 1980 after escaping from prison.But before Mr Nice could deliver the evidence he had promised to substantiate this unlikely story, he apparently died.Sensationally, he then returned from the grave a year later to reveal that he had faked his own death just to prove it was possible.Biggie Smalls and Tupac Shakur before the feud  (Rex)Another friend of Shakur \u2013 Todd Anthony Shaw, who goes by the alias Too Short \u2013 has also said he does not believe the All Eyez on Me star is really gone, commenting: \u201cI\u2019m just saying that not every politician did not die of car crashes and some of them got killed. Some of those plane crashes were deliberate\u2026 It is a possibility. Believe me, it ain\u2019t just open and shut.\u201dMr Nice and Mr Shaw are not alone in their belief, however, with \u201csightings\u201d of the dead man reported in such exotic locations as New Orleans, Somalia and Belize over the years, the funniest of which is surely a claim reported by The Daily Mirror that Shakur is not only alive and well but selling DVDs to earn a crust at Barras market in Glasgow, Scotland.Theory: Tupac is alive and under CIA protectionAnother bizarre theory is that Shakur is alive and living under the protection of the CIA as a government witness.However, the agency has come out and flatly denied that speculation.Despite this, the rumour continues to live on among the conspiracy-minded.Adding further fuel to the fire is the theory that one of Tupac\u2019s nicknames \u2013 \u201cMakaveli\u201d, in tribute to the Renaissance political thinker Niccolo Machiavelli \u2013 is actually an anagram of \u201cAm Alive K\u201d.It has also been pointed out that Machiavelli himself advocated faking one\u2019s death in his 1520 treatise The Art of War in order to win an advantage in battle, stating: \u201cSometimes it has been of great moment while the fight is going on, to disseminate words that pronounce the enemies\u2019 captain to be dead, or to have been conquered by another part of the army. Many times this has given victory to him who used it.\u201dBelievers also point to the fact that Shakur\u2019s posthumous album The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory (1996) features a design by Ronald \u201cRiskie\u201d Brent of Tupac as Jesus Christ on the cover, who, of course, returned from the dead after his crucifixtion."}, {"_id": "64b9404c51ac331da6c7c0b7", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/blur-review-ballad-of-darren-b2377299.html", "primaryCategory": "Reviews", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Blur review, The Ballad of Darren: The band\u2019s best record since 1999", "lead": "<p>Songs that elevate Damon Albarn\u2019s suburban tristesse into moments of sheer ecstasy</p>", "author": "Helen Brown", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 13:35:09", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:10:20.719041", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-20T13:35:09+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/20/09/BLUR_BW_90S_PHOTO20KEVIN20WESTENBERG.FINAL.4.5mb.gr.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Roisin O\u2019Connor\u2019s free weekly newsletter Now Hear This for the inside track on all things musicGet our Now Hear This email for free\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeIs there any band more reflective of modern Britain than Blur? Earlier this month, they united the nation at Wembley (our \u201cagnostic temple\u201d, they called it). Workaholic, melancholic Damon Albarn stood out front in his ironic, Essex boy tracksuit, while complex, nerdy Graham Coxon scrawled angry edges on Albarn\u2019s pretty tunes with his guitar. At the back, a load of giddy bounce courtesy of Labour councillor Dave Rowntree on drums and the Tory hobnobber Alex James on bass. Apathy energised. Ambition eyerolled. Despair romanced. Brainless rock-outs and sentimental overthinking. Our isolating bubbles briefly burst by a stadium-sized bawl-along to \u201cParklife\u201d.Seeing the gigs trending on social media, my kids asked me to explain Britpop. \u201cTesco disco,\u201d I told them, quoting a line from Blur\u2019s triumphant ninth album, The Ballad of Darren. Nostalgic, almost painfully self-aware and chocca with choons, it\u2019s a little mid-tempo in mood, but still the band\u2019s best record since 1999\u2019s 13.Albarn apparently wrote the songs in a series of American hotel rooms. (It\u2019s a setting that has historically been good for him; he wrote much of 1993\u2019s excellent Modern Life Is Rubbish in bland suites across the Atlantic.) These are mostly sad songs that hint at the possibility that he has split from his long-time partner, the artist Suzi Winstanley. \u201cI just looked into my life/ And all I saw was that you\u2019re not coming back,\u201d he laments on opening track \u201cThe Ballad\u201d. \u201cCharles Square\u201d begins with the angry admission: \u201cI f***ed up/ I\u2019m not the first to do it\u201d, while \u201cBarbaric\u201d finds him pleading for an opportunity to \u201ctalk to you about what this break-up has done to me/ I have lost the feeling that I thought I\u2019d never lose/ Now where am I going?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t punish me,\u201d he begs over the wonky arpeggios of \u201cGoodbye Albert\u201d. Then again, all of this could instead be about his band\u2019s many fallings out and reunions. The \u201cDarren\u201d of the title is a long-term crew member, but also a stand-in for an everyman of a certain age. (The name peaked in popularity for babies born in the 1970s, but fell out of the top 100 boy\u2019s names in 1994.)If such bittersweet reflections came packaged on a solo Albarn release, they\u2019d probably be set to sorrowful, detached, acousto-electronic sounds. But his old friends have alchemised those sentiments into songs that elevate his suburban tristesse into moments of sheer ecstasy. According to James, the band leapt around the studio while working on \u201cCharles Square\u201d, a track that harnesses the moshpit spirit of \u201cSong 2\u201d. It\u2019s here where Albarn references the \u201cTesco disco\u201d (perhaps a subtle nod to the supermarket visit referenced in Pulp\u2019s Britpop standard \u201cCommon People\u201d). Coxon throws himself into thrash and discordant squall mode, while Rowntree batters his kit. You can almost hear James pogoing about as Albarn howls, screams and camps up the idea of fleeing from a B-movie creature with \u201clong and slender claws\u201d.RecommendedRita Ora review, You & I: Safe, polished, nothing specialTaylor Swift review, Speak Now (Taylor\u2019s Version): A stunning rediscovery of a musician at a crossroadsPJ Harvey, I Inside the Old Year Dying review: A grungy, pagan whirl around the Dorset countrysideBut the real monster hiding beneath Albarn\u2019s bed is isolation. The musician recently left London to live full-time at his very big house in the country. He snarls about loneliness and, self-skeweringly, of how \u201cevery generation has its gilded posers\u201d. He continues to examine the ego trip that is pop stardom on the supremely catchy single \u201cThe Narcissist\u201d, on which Coxon channels a little Johnny Marr jangle and Albarn\u2019s voice cracks through falsetto as he pleads not to be hurt again. Later, there\u2019s a nod to The Jam\u2019s Britpop-foreshadowing \u201cThat\u2019s Entertainment\u201d (1980) on \u201cBarbaric\u201d.\u201cRussian Strings\u201d is a sad hymn for the individual\u2019s powerlessness in the face of terrible world events. It wraps a ballroom piano and woozy beach-bar guitar around a peak Albarnian lyric about not hearing the tumbling down of tenement blocks \u201cwith headphones on\u201d. \u201cThere are strings attached to all of us,\u201d he sighs. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing in the end, only dust/ So turn the music up/ I\u2019m hitting the hard stuff.\u201d This attitude isn\u2019t a world away from the shrugged bop of their first Top 40 single \u201cThere\u2019s No Other Way\u201d (1990).I remember first seeing Blur live around the time that song made the Top 10 \u2013 Albarn cocky and staring into space. Now in his fifties, he sounds like a man for whom that disconnect comes at a higher price, his sharp sneer softened by painful experience. Yet freighted with more hope, too. \u201cGoodbye Albert\u201d stacks \u201cAvalon\u201d, bringing the bolstering brass as Albarn conjures images of aeroplanes flying over his Devon home on their way to war. The album closes with \u201cThe Heights\u201d: a smudgy horizon on which Albarn reaches acceptance. There\u2019s a military-parade stoicism to Rowntree\u2019s drumming, neatly balanced by Coxon\u2019s freer jamming.Albarn has previously knocked The Rolling Stones for banging out the hits into their dotage. Here, he asks: \u201cAre we running out of time?\u201d But still, he is reaching forward: \u201cSeeing through the coma in our lives\u201d towards \u201csomething so bright out there you can\u2019t even see it/ Something so momentary that you can only be it...\u201d It\u2019s the loveable mumbling of your mate on a wobbly stagger back from a late night. A moment of drunken clarity before the track \u2013 and album \u2013 dismantles itself into feedback and white noise. Like the end of an old pub gig.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeOppenheimer is Christopher Nolan\u2019s best and most revealing work. It\u2019s a profoundly unnerving story told with a traditionalist\u2019s eye towards craftsmanship and muscular, cinematic imagination. Here, Nolan treats one of the most contested legacies of the 20th century \u2013 that of J Robert Oppenheimer (played by Cillian Murphy), the \u201cfather of the atomic bomb\u201d \u2013 as a mathematical puzzle to be solved.In 1943, at the behest of Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer became director of the Los Alamos Laboratory, the Manhattan Project\u2019s New Mexico site for attempting to successfully build an atomic bomb. Oppenheimer, at first, was driven by moral imperative: he feared deeply, as a Jewish man, about what would happen if the Nazis were to develop a weapon of such deadly capability (that a non-Jewish actor has taken on a role in which identity plays such a central role is, in this light, somewhat strange).Following Hitler\u2019s defeat, Oppenheimer continued to support the bomb\u2019s deployment in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, convinced that such hellish destruction would not only bring an end to the war in the Pacific, but to all wars. Historians have since disputed the idea that the bombs were in any way necessary for Japan\u2019s surrender (the real turning point, it seems, was the threat of Soviet invasion). And Oppenheimer\u2019s own utopian vision was swiftly dismantled by fellow scientist Edward Teller (Benny Safdie) and the chair of the US Atomic Energy Commission, Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr), who pushed forward with the creation of the H-bomb, a thousand times deadlier in its scope.Oppenheimer attempted, in vain, to halt the subsequent nuclear arms race between the US and the Soviet Union. He was promptly silenced using one of America\u2019s most cherished tools of political oppression \u2013 anti-Communist hysteria. He was attacked for his personal associations with the Communist Party, through his brother Frank (Dylan Arnold), wife Kitty (Emily Blunt), and ex-lover Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh). It was an act of pure, public humiliation.Nolan observes each of these chapters with sickly wonder, as Jennifer Lame\u2019s editing work and Ludwig G\u00f6ransson\u2019s clattering score lend Oppenheimer a frightening momentum. The film is constructed in a way that allows its audience to comprehend, on an intellectual level, the profound power and chaos that led its central character to see himself as the \u201cDeath, destroyer of worlds\u201d of Hindu scripture. I\u2019m not sure, however, that it burrows deeper than that \u2013 into that profound, emotional space that can be both overwhelming and difficult to verbalise. It\u2019s a little too conscious of itself, and the ways cinema crafts its own reality. Throughout, the film teases an unheard conversation between Oppenheimer and Albert Einstein (Tom Conti), its inevitable reveal delivered in the same tone as the solution to the teleportation trick in Nolan\u2019s own The Prestige.RecommendedBarbie is \u2018near miraculous\u2019 and Oppenheimer branded a \u2018masterpiece\u2019 as reviews finally land \u2013 movie newsMission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One review \u2013 As muscular, extravagant and old school as its starElemental review: Pixar\u2019s culture clash allegory overcomplicates itselfBut the prioritisation of cleverness in Oppenheimer isn\u2019t necessarily a criticism of Nolan \u2013 more a testament to who he is as an artist. The detonation of the A-bomb, during its first test in the New Mexico desert, is depicted as booming tufts of flame in extreme close-up, coupled with enraptured onlookers. You sense its primal force, the kind of untapped power that led Oppenheimer to view himself as a kind of American Prometheus (also the title of a 2005 biography Nolan drew heavily from). But contrast that, perhaps, with how David Lynch approached the same A-bomb test in his 2017 limited series Twin Peaks: The Return. Lynch drew the camera in, slowly, confronting us with the full-scale of the weapon\u2019s destruction, while sucking us into its very centre, damning us through its inescapability. Nolan\u2019s A-bomb is wondrous until we consider its context; Lynch\u2019s A-bomb is pure nightmare.The film\u2019s non-linear structure (de rigueur for the Tenet and Inception filmmaker), with each timeline beautifully lensed by Hoyte van Hoytema in either colour or black and white, lends a little more focus to Oppenheimer\u2019s post-war betrayal than it does to the blossoming of his guilt. Large swathes of the film play out as political thriller, the fuel in its engine being Downey Jr\u2019s titanic colouring of Strauss, all boorishness and manipulative charm.But Nolan is still committed to understanding the innerworkings of his subject. Here\u2019s a man deep in denial. When confronted with photographs of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, he averts his gaze. Its horrors rumble (literally) in his peripheral vision, only clear to him when he imagines such brutality inflicted on the white Americans celebrating his \u201cvictory\u201d in Los Alamos. Murphy creates his own devastating fission: brilliance torn apart by arrogance. Scene by scene, the light behind his eyes starts to dim. He even has sex the same way he builds bombs. After his extramarital affair turns sour, his wife Kitty chastises him: \u201cYou don\u2019t get to commit a sin and then make us all feel sorry when there are consequences.\u201d In Oppenheimer, a man\u2019s private, internal, and political lives are strung together, each a component of the great equation that defines a man\u2019s soul.Dir: Christopher Nolan.

The clip features alarmist news footage of violent clashes between demonstrators and police officers, petty crime and flag burning, seemingly to make an impassioned point about the extent of current political divisions within the United States.An increasingly vocal conservative since the final year of the Trump administration, Aldean is perhaps best known to non-fans for being the act who was on stage performing when mass shooter Stephen Paddock opened fire on revellers attending the Route 91 Harvest music festival on the Las Vegas Strip on 1 October 2017.Paddock attacked the crowd with a 1,000-bullet hail of gunfire from the balcony of his 32nd floor suite at the Nevada gambling Mecca\u2019s Mandalay Bay Hotel, killing 60 people and injuring 413 before turning his assault rifle on himself.His motive for carrying out the worst gun massacre in American history has never been established.RecommendedSheryl Crow accuses Jason Aldean of \u2018promoting violence\u2019 with controversial song \u2018Try That In A Small Town\u2019Jason Aldean responds after backlash to \u2018pro-lynching\u2019 music videoMoment country singer Jason Aldean runs off stage after suffering heat strokeAldean himself was not hurt in the incident and posted on Instagram that evening: \u201cTonight has been beyond horrific. I still don\u2019t know what to say but wanted to let everyone know that me and my crew are safe. \u201cMy thoughts and prayers go out to everyone involved tonight. It hurts my heart that this would happen to anyone who was just coming out to enjoy what should have been a fun night. #heartbroken #stopthehate.\u201dHowever, rather than make a compassionate appeal for gun control in light of having witnessed such a traumatic episode, Aldean instead appears to be doubling down on his Second Amendment advocacy in this new single from his upcoming 11th album.Here\u2019s why the song (and its new music video in particular) is so contentious.What is \u2018Try That in a Small Town\u2019 about?The lyrics for Jason Aldean\u2019s new track depict America\u2019s major cities as liberal havens for anarchy and street crime, characterised by disrespect for authority and contempt for traditional values.Like Bruce Wayne at his most embittered and dismayed, Aldean denounces small-time urban thugs who \u201csucker punch somebody on a sidewalk\u201d, \u201ccarjack an old lady at a red light\u201d or \u201cpull a gun on the owner of a liquor store\u201d.

This is the site of a notorious lynching in 1927 when Black youth Henry Choate, 18, was hanged from a second storey window by a white mob after being dragged along behind a car.What has been said about it?Among those denouncing the three-minute promo was Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, who tweeted that Aldean, despite his ordeal in Las Vegas, had written a song \u201cabout how he and his friends will shoot you if you try to take their guns\u201d.Chris Willman of Variety meanwhile called the track \u201cthe most contemptible country song of the decade\u201d and commented: \u201cFor Aldean, it\u2019s about how tiny burgs are under the imminent threat of attack from lawless urban marauders who will have to be kept at bay by any means necessary \u2013 meaning, pretty explicitly, vigilantism.\u201dFellow country icon Sheryl Crow likewise accused Aldean of inciting violence, telling him on Twitter: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing small-town or American about promoting violence. You should know that better than anyone having survived a mass shooting.\u201dOthers saw in it an explicit attack on the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement and called it a \u201cmodern lynching song\u201d in light of the choice of setting for the video.Journalist Matthew Chapman tweeted of \u201cTry That in a Small Town\u201d that it \u201cabsolutely captures everything about the American Right, from the paranoid threats of violence, to the irrational fetishisation of communities where everyone acts and thinks the same, to the fact that the singer in fact grew up in a city\u201d.In the wake of that heavy backlash from social media, the video has been withdrawn from rotation by the country music channel CMT on Monday, according to Billboard and Deadline, although the network offered no explanation of the rationale behind that programming decision.Jason Aldean in the video for \u2018Try That in a Small Town' (Jason Aldean/YouTube)What has Aldean said in defence of the song?The singer took to Twitter to issue an angry defence of his song on Monday evening, stating: \u201cIn the past 24 hours I have been accused of releasing a pro-lynching song (a song that has been out since May) and was subject to the comparison that I (direct quote) was not too pleased with the nationwide BLM protests.\u201cThese references are not only meritless, but dangerous. There is not a single lyric in the song that references race or points to it \u2013 and there isn\u2019t a single video clip that isn\u2019t real news footage \u2013 and while I can try and respect others to have their own interpretation of a song with music, this one goes too far.RecommendedJason Aldean responds as row continues over \u2018Try That in a Small Town\u2019Sheryl Crow accuses Jason Aldean of \u2018promoting violence\u2019 with controversial songAled Jones robbed of \u00a317,000 Rolex watch by teenager wielding a machete\u201cAs so many pointed out, I was present at Route 91 \u2013 where so many lost their lives \u2013 and our community recently suffered another heartbreaking tragedy. NO ONE, including me, wants to continue to see senseless headlines or families ripped apart.\u201c\u2018Try That In A Small Town\u2019, for me, refers to the feeling of a community that I had growing up, where we took care of our neighbours, regardless of differences of background or belief. Because they were our neighbours, and that was above any differences. My political views have never been something I\u2019ve hidden from, and I know that a lot of us in this country don\u2019t agree on how we get back to a sense of normalcy where we go at least a day without a headline that keeps us up at night.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeCountry music star Jason Aldean is facing a storm of criticism after releasing a new music video for his song \u201cTry That in a Small Town\u201d. The clip features alarmist news footage of violent clashes between demonstrators and police officers, petty crime and flag burning, seemingly to make an impassioned point about the extent of current political divisions within the United States.An increasingly vocal conservative since the final year of the Trump administration, Aldean is perhaps best known to non-fans for being the act who was on stage performing when mass shooter Stephen Paddock opened fire on revellers attending the Route 91 Harvest music festival on the Las Vegas Strip on 1 October 2017.Paddock attacked the crowd with a 1,000-bullet hail of gunfire from the balcony of his 32nd floor suite at the Nevada gambling Mecca\u2019s Mandalay Bay Hotel, killing 60 people and injuring 413 before turning his assault rifle on himself.His motive for carrying out the worst gun massacre in American history has never been established.RecommendedSheryl Crow accuses Jason Aldean of \u2018promoting violence\u2019 with controversial song \u2018Try That In A Small Town\u2019Jason Aldean responds after backlash to \u2018pro-lynching\u2019 music videoMoment country singer Jason Aldean runs off stage after suffering heat strokeAldean himself was not hurt in the incident and posted on Instagram that evening: \u201cTonight has been beyond horrific. I still don\u2019t know what to say but wanted to let everyone know that me and my crew are safe. \u201cMy thoughts and prayers go out to everyone involved tonight. It hurts my heart that this would happen to anyone who was just coming out to enjoy what should have been a fun night. #heartbroken #stopthehate.\u201dHowever, rather than make a compassionate appeal for gun control in light of having witnessed such a traumatic episode, Aldean instead appears to be doubling down on his Second Amendment advocacy in this new single from his upcoming 11th album.Here\u2019s why the song (and its new music video in particular) is so contentious.What is \u2018Try That in a Small Town\u2019 about?The lyrics for Jason Aldean\u2019s new track depict America\u2019s major cities as liberal havens for anarchy and street crime, characterised by disrespect for authority and contempt for traditional values.Like Bruce Wayne at his most embittered and dismayed, Aldean denounces small-time urban thugs who \u201csucker punch somebody on a sidewalk\u201d, \u201ccarjack an old lady at a red light\u201d or \u201cpull a gun on the owner of a liquor store\u201d.

This is the site of a notorious lynching in 1927 when Black youth Henry Choate, 18, was hanged from a second storey window by a white mob after being dragged along behind a car.What has been said about it?Among those denouncing the three-minute promo was Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, who tweeted that Aldean, despite his ordeal in Las Vegas, had written a song \u201cabout how he and his friends will shoot you if you try to take their guns\u201d.Chris Willman of Variety meanwhile called the track \u201cthe most contemptible country song of the decade\u201d and commented: \u201cFor Aldean, it\u2019s about how tiny burgs are under the imminent threat of attack from lawless urban marauders who will have to be kept at bay by any means necessary \u2013 meaning, pretty explicitly, vigilantism.\u201dFellow country icon Sheryl Crow likewise accused Aldean of inciting violence, telling him on Twitter: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing small-town or American about promoting violence. You should know that better than anyone having survived a mass shooting.\u201dOthers saw in it an explicit attack on the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement and called it a \u201cmodern lynching song\u201d in light of the choice of setting for the video.Journalist Matthew Chapman tweeted of \u201cTry That in a Small Town\u201d that it \u201cabsolutely captures everything about the American Right, from the paranoid threats of violence, to the irrational fetishisation of communities where everyone acts and thinks the same, to the fact that the singer in fact grew up in a city\u201d.In the wake of that heavy backlash from social media, the video has been withdrawn from rotation by the country music channel CMT on Monday, according to Billboard and Deadline, although the network offered no explanation of the rationale behind that programming decision.Jason Aldean in the video for \u2018Try That in a Small Town' (Jason Aldean/YouTube)What has Aldean said in defence of the song?The singer took to Twitter to issue an angry defence of his song on Monday evening, stating: \u201cIn the past 24 hours I have been accused of releasing a pro-lynching song (a song that has been out since May) and was subject to the comparison that I (direct quote) was not too pleased with the nationwide BLM protests.\u201cThese references are not only meritless, but dangerous. There is not a single lyric in the song that references race or points to it \u2013 and there isn\u2019t a single video clip that isn\u2019t real news footage \u2013 and while I can try and respect others to have their own interpretation of a song with music, this one goes too far.RecommendedJason Aldean responds as row continues over \u2018Try That in a Small Town\u2019Sheryl Crow accuses Jason Aldean of \u2018promoting violence\u2019 with controversial songShakira facing new investigation from Spanish court over alleged tax fraud\u201cAs so many pointed out, I was present at Route 91 \u2013 where so many lost their lives \u2013 and our community recently suffered another heartbreaking tragedy. NO ONE, including me, wants to continue to see senseless headlines or families ripped apart.\u201c\u2018Try That In A Small Town\u2019, for me, refers to the feeling of a community that I had growing up, where we took care of our neighbours, regardless of differences of background or belief. Because they were our neighbours, and that was above any differences.

And while it\u2019d be easy to assume that it\u2019s intended for children, considering its source material, some parents may need some more information about its PG-13 rating (equivalent to a 12A rating in the UK).A PG-13 rating is generally given to titles that the Motion Pictures Association (MPA) feels include \u201csome material that may be inappropriate for children under 13\u201d. Barbie was granted this rating for \u201csuggestive references and brief language\u201d.

Without giving too much away, here are some things you may find helpful in determining whether it\u2019s suitable for your family. *Warning, the following may contain spoilers*In interviews ahead of its premiere, Gerwig revealed that its core themes are inherently heavy. Even in its official trailer, Robbie\u2019s titular Barbie asks her fellow Barbies: \u201cDo you guys ever think of dying?\u201d Danny Brogan, the executive editor at Common Sense Media, an organisation that reviews and rates content for children, shared his thoughts on Gerwig\u2019s \u201cmaturer content\u201d in an interview with Yahoo!.Kate McKinnon in \u2018Barbie\u2019  (AP)\u201cI think Gerwig has included all this maturer content knowing that a large portion of the audience will be millennials and members of Generation Z \u2013 people who grew up with Barbie during the \u201980s, \u201990s and \u201900s \u2013 looking for that nostalgia but also to be entertained,\u201d Brogan said. \u201cThey\u2019re no longer that eight-year-old who took Barbie everywhere with them.\u201dAs for its \u201csuggestive references\u201d, many of the lines perhaps deemed as such will probably go over the heads of particularly young audiences.

And while it\u2019d be easy to assume that it\u2019s intended for children, considering its source material, some parents may need some more information about its PG-13 rating (equivalent to a 12A rating in the UK).A PG-13 rating is generally given to titles that the Motion Pictures Association (MPA) feels include \u201csome material that may be inappropriate for children under 13\u201d. Barbie was granted this rating for \u201csuggestive references and brief language\u201d.

Without giving too much away, here are some things you may find helpful in determining whether it\u2019s suitable for your family. *Warning, the following may contain spoilers*In interviews ahead of its premiere, Gerwig revealed that its core themes are inherently heavy. Even in its official trailer, Robbie\u2019s titular Barbie asks her fellow Barbies: \u201cDo you guys ever think of dying?\u201d Danny Brogan, the executive editor at Common Sense Media, an organisation that reviews and rates content for children, shared his thoughts on Gerwig\u2019s \u201cmaturer content\u201d in an interview with Yahoo!.Kate McKinnon in \u2018Barbie\u2019  (AP)\u201cI think Gerwig has included all this maturer content knowing that a large portion of the audience will be millennials and members of Generation Z \u2013 people who grew up with Barbie during the \u201980s, \u201990s and \u201900s \u2013 looking for that nostalgia but also to be entertained,\u201d Brogan said. \u201cThey\u2019re no longer that eight-year-old who took Barbie everywhere with them.\u201dAs for its \u201csuggestive references\u201d, many of the lines perhaps deemed as such will probably go over the heads of particularly young audiences.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeOppenheimer is Christopher Nolan\u2019s best and most revealing work. It\u2019s a profoundly unnerving story told with a traditionalist\u2019s eye towards craftsmanship and muscular, cinematic imagination. Here, Nolan treats one of the most contested legacies of the 20th century \u2013 that of J Robert Oppenheimer (played by Cillian Murphy), the \u201cfather of the atomic bomb\u201d \u2013 as a mathematical puzzle to be solved.In 1943, at the behest of Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer became director of the Los Alamos Laboratory, the Manhattan Project\u2019s New Mexico site for attempting to successfully build an atomic bomb. Oppenheimer, at first, was driven by moral imperative: he feared deeply, as a Jewish man, about what would happen if the Nazis were to develop a weapon of such deadly capability (that a non-Jewish actor has taken on a role in which identity plays such a central role is, in this light, somewhat strange).Following Hitler\u2019s defeat, Oppenheimer continued to support the bomb\u2019s deployment in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, convinced that such hellish destruction would not only bring an end to the war in the Pacific, but to all wars. Historians have since disputed the idea that the bombs were in any way necessary for Japan\u2019s surrender (the real turning point, it seems, was the threat of Soviet invasion). And Oppenheimer\u2019s own utopian vision was swiftly dismantled by fellow scientist Edward Teller (Benny Safdie) and the chair of the US Atomic Energy Commission, Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr), who pushed forward with the creation of the H-bomb, a thousand times deadlier in its scope.Oppenheimer attempted, in vain, to halt the subsequent nuclear arms race between the US and the Soviet Union. He was promptly silenced using one of America\u2019s most cherished tools of political oppression \u2013 anti-Communist hysteria. He was attacked for his personal associations with the Communist Party, through his brother Frank (Dylan Arnold), wife Kitty (Emily Blunt), and ex-lover Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh). It was an act of pure, public humiliation.Nolan observes each of these chapters with sickly wonder, as Jennifer Lame\u2019s editing work and Ludwig G\u00f6ransson\u2019s clattering score lend Oppenheimer a frightening momentum. The film is constructed in a way that allows its audience to comprehend, on an intellectual level, the profound power and chaos that led its central character to see himself as the \u201cDeath, destroyer of worlds\u201d of Hindu scripture. I\u2019m not sure, however, that it burrows deeper than that \u2013 into that profound, emotional space that can be both overwhelming and difficult to verbalise. It\u2019s a little too conscious of itself, and the ways cinema crafts its own reality. Throughout, the film teases an unheard conversation between Oppenheimer and Albert Einstein (Tom Conti), its inevitable reveal delivered in the same tone as the solution to the teleportation trick in Nolan\u2019s own The Prestige.RecommendedBarbie is \u2018near miraculous\u2019 and Oppenheimer branded a \u2018masterpiece\u2019 as reviews finally land \u2013 movie newsMission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One review \u2013 As muscular, extravagant and old school as its starElemental review: Pixar\u2019s culture clash allegory overcomplicates itselfBut the prioritisation of cleverness in Oppenheimer isn\u2019t necessarily a criticism of Nolan \u2013 more a testament to who he is as an artist. The detonation of the A-bomb, during its first test in the New Mexico desert, is depicted as booming tufts of flame in extreme close-up, coupled with enraptured onlookers. You sense its primal force, the kind of untapped power that led Oppenheimer to view himself as a kind of American Prometheus (also the title of a 2005 biography Nolan drew heavily from). But contrast that, perhaps, with how David Lynch approached the same A-bomb test in his 2017 limited series Twin Peaks: The Return. Lynch drew the camera in, slowly, confronting us with the full-scale of the weapon\u2019s destruction, while sucking us into its very centre, damning us through its inescapability. Nolan\u2019s A-bomb is wondrous until we consider its context; Lynch\u2019s A-bomb is pure nightmare.The film\u2019s non-linear structure (de rigueur for the Tenet and Inception filmmaker), with each timeline beautifully lensed by Hoyte van Hoytema in either colour or black and white, lends a little more focus to Oppenheimer\u2019s post-war betrayal than it does to the blossoming of his guilt. Large swathes of the film play out as political thriller, the fuel in its engine being Downey Jr\u2019s titanic colouring of Strauss, all boorishness and manipulative charm.But Nolan is still committed to understanding the innerworkings of his subject. Here\u2019s a man deep in denial. When confronted with photographs of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, he averts his gaze. Its horrors rumble (literally) in his peripheral vision, only clear to him when he imagines such brutality inflicted on the white Americans celebrating his \u201cvictory\u201d in Los Alamos. Murphy creates his own devastating fission: brilliance torn apart by arrogance. Scene by scene, the light behind his eyes starts to dim. He even has sex the same way he builds bombs. After his extramarital affair turns sour, his wife Kitty chastises him: \u201cYou don\u2019t get to commit a sin and then make us all feel sorry when there are consequences.\u201d In Oppenheimer, a man\u2019s private, internal, and political lives are strung together, each a component of the great equation that defines a man\u2019s soul.Dir: Christopher Nolan.

In a repost of a video showing SAG president Fran Drescher speaking out against the \u201cdisgusting\u201d greed of film and TV bosses, the High Fidelity star shared an anecdote relating to the hit 1989 teen romcom Say Anything, in which his character wooed his love interest by holding a boombox above his head at her bedroom window.\u201cThe greed is almost a legendary comic trope,\u201d he began his post. \u201cOne fun fact \u2013 when I was a youngin \u2013 I did a film (with a boom box) and somehow I got points \u2013 net not gross.\u201cNever expected to see any money but the film became quite famous \u2013 so about 10 years ago I looked again at the financial statements they were obligated to report \u2013 and to my shock, they claimed they had LOST 44 million dollars on the film.\u201dThe Must Love Dogs star, 57, then went on to point out differences between the amount the film cost to make and release, and how it has reportedly fared in the years since.John Cusack in \u2018Say Anything\u2019  (Getty / Twentieth Century Fox)\u201cI thought wow, I almost bankrupted Fox! (not really) The film cost about 13 million to make \u2013 and money spent to release was minimal at the time. 30 years in \u2013 that film lost millions every year! A neat accounting trick don\u2019t ya think?\u201dMandy Moore claims she received \u2018pennies\u2019 in This Is Us streaming residualsSpeaking to The Hollywood Reporter from the picket line in Los Angeles on Tuesday (18 July), Moore alleged to have only received a \u201cvery, very tiny\u201d amount in streaming revenue from her starring role on NBC\u2019s hit series This Is Us.Moore, 39, starred in the Emmy-nominated family drama from 2016 to 2022. She played matriarch Rebecca across the six-season series, which followed a picture-perfect family as they go through life\u2019s emotional ups and downs.However, despite the show\u2019s critical acclaim and impressive viewership ratings, leading lady Moore, who The Independent\u2019s Nicole Vassell has argued is \u201csecretly the best actor on TV\u201d, said she has only made \u201cpennies\u201d from residual payments.Residuals are additional compensation paid out to actors when their TV shows or movies are replayed.\u201cThe residual issue is a huge issue,\u201d Moore continued. \u201cWe\u2019re in incredibly fortunate positions as working actors having been on shows that found tremendous success in one way or another\u2026 but many actors in our position for years before us were able to live off of residuals or at least pay their bills.\u201dWhile This Is Us is an NBC original that aired live throughout its run, the network struck a digital deal with Hulu to have it land on the streaming platform the day after each episode was broadcast.The show has remained on Hulu ever since, yet Moore claimed she\u2019s only received \u201cvery, very tiny checks, like 81-cent checks\u201d in streaming residuals.\u201cI was talking with my business manager who said he\u2019s received a residual for a penny and two pennies,\u201d she said.Orange Is the New Black star claims cast members held second jobs due to poor salariesKimiko Glenn, who joined Netflix\u2019s groundbreaking drama in its second season as new inmate Brook Soso, claimed she only made $27.30 (\u00a320) in 2020 from streaming residuals.The 34-year-old actor originally shared the \u201castounding\u201d truth of her earnings in a 2020 TikTok video, in which she showed a pink SAG-AFTRA Foreign Royalties Statement that listed all of the titles of the episodes she appeared in, with the grand total of $27.30 (\u00a320.90) at the bottom.She later reposted the video on Saturday (15 July), following SAG\u2019s strike approval. The video has since gone viral, with many commenters in shock by how little she was paid.In a new TikTok video, Glenn recounted the initial reaction to the video, saying: \u201cI remember a lot of comments back when I posted that were like, \u2018Guys guys guys, they got paid upfront.\u2019\u201cFirst of all,\u201d she argued, \u201cwhether or not we got paid upfront, my tits live on in perpetuity. I deserve to get paid for as many f***ing streams as that s*** gets.\u201dKimiko Glenn shares how much she earns in Orange Is The New Black royaltiesGlenn continued: \u201cSecond of all, we did not get paid very well, ever. And when I say didn\u2019t get paid very well, you would die!\u201d She went on to reveal that \u201cpeople were still bartenders, people had their second jobs still\u201d.\u201cThey were f***ing famous as s***, like internationally famous \u2013 couldn\u2019t go outside \u2013 but had to keep their second jobs because they couldn\u2019t afford to not. We couldn\u2019t afford cabs to set... you guys!\u201d Glenn added.Final Destination 5 star claims he wasn\u2019t \u2018paid a cent\u2019 for cameoIn a since-deleted tweet, Final Destination star Devon Sawa claimed he wasn\u2019t paid for his cameo in the horror franchise\u2019s fifth instalment. Sawa\u2019s character Alex Browning \u2013 the lead in the original 2000 Final Destination film \u2013 briefly makes an appearance in Final Destination 5 using footage from the first film.\u201cI never got paid a cent for Final Destination 5. They didn\u2019t even tell me I was in it when they invited me to the premiere. In the first contract for part one there was a section that stated they owned the footage and could use it in the future. I assumed for press. I was wrong,\u201d Sawa wrote in a tweet that was captured by ComicBook.com before it was deleted. \u201cThis has nothing to do with the filmmakers by the way. I loved FD5. I love them all to be completely honest. And I\u2019m super excited to see number 6,\u201d he added.Devon Sawa (Getty Images)She-Hulk writer reveals \u2018appalling\u2019 amount his residual check was worthShe-Hulk writer Cody Zigler led the outrage aimed at Disney boss Bob Iger\u2019s earlier criticism of the union for not being \u201crealistic\u201d with their strike expectations. \u201cThe residual check from my episode of She-Hulk: Attorney at Law was $396 [\u00a3302],\u201d Zigler tweeted in response to an article relaying the millionaire\u2019s words. \u201cThis was one of the most watched episodes of television, of one of the most watched television series on Disney +.

While the song was originally released in May, it garnered attention as the accompanying video dropped, showing Aldean performing in front of a courthouse with an American flag hanging from the entrance and images of protesters fighting with police officers.The song was criticised for its allusion to gun ownership and use, particularly as Aldean, 46, performed at Route 91 Festival in 2017, the site of the deadliest mass shooting by a single gunman in US history, which left 60 dead and 400 injured.On Tuesday (18 July), it was pulled from Country Music Television, although the broadcaster did not provide a reason for its decision.After Aldean responded to critics, saying any suggestions the song is \u201cpro-lynching\u201d are \u201cmeritless\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d, Crow, 61, became the latest musician to speak out against the country star.Recommended13 awful movies by great filmmakers, from Christopher Nolan to Steven SpielbergBarbie review: A near-miraculous achievement from Greta Gerwig and Margot Robbie11 films they tried to bury: from dinner with DiCaprio to Johnny Depp\u2019s snuff storyTagging Aldean directly, the \u201cAll I Wanna Do\u201d singer wrote: \u201c@Jason_Aldean I\u2019m from a small town.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThere\u2019s a running joke about the lack of jazz and blues artists booked to play Montreux Jazz Festival, with pop, indie and rock acts all materialising on the lineup over the years. But tell that to this year\u2019s performers, including Buddy Guy, Joe Bonamassa and Marcus Miller, or to any of the younger talents who use the genres as a blueprint for their own work, and you\u2019ll likely end up with \u0153uf on your face.For two weeks each year, the postcard-pretty town of Montreux is transformed into a sort of Neverland for musicians. Surrounded by the dramatic peaks of the Swiss Alps and overlooking the glorious blue waters of Lac L\u00e9man, this year\u2019s festival hosts artists from Bob Dylan to Lil Nas X. The musicians play across multiple stages, including the storied 4,000-capacity Stravinsky Auditorium and the intimate Miles Davis Jazz Lab.The closing weekend opens with thunderstorms and ends in blazing sunshine. On Friday, Buddy Guy \u2013 one of the greatest guitarists of all time \u2013 shows what we\u2019ll be missing when he stops extensive touring later this year. At 86, the eight-time Grammy winner is still an astonishing sight to behold, and not just because he\u2019s wearing dungarees over a polka dot shirt. Fond of hamming it up, he plays the guitar upside down, with a drumstick, by thwacking it with a rag, and then with his teeth (where do you think Jimi Hendrix got it from?). He teases his audience with the intro to Deep Purple\u2019s \u201cSmoke on the Water\u201d (inspired by their own Montreux visit in 1971) and brings out Joe Bonamassa for a cover of Johnnie Taylor\u2019s 1973 track \u201cCheaper to Keep Her\u201d.At the Jazz Lab, British singer Olivia Dean charms with her whimsical take on soul and Motown. Her voice flits between a smoky croon and fluting falsetto, on songs such as the wide-eyed \u201cDive\u201d and the vulnerable \u201cUFO\u201d. Fresh from his guest appearance with Elton John at Glastonbury, US artist Jacob Lusk leads his band Gabriels in a so-so set, where the funky squish of \u201cAngels & Queens\u201d \u2013 the title track from their debut album \u2013 doesn\u2019t quite translate to the live experience.Loyle Carner is the headlining highlight of the Jazz Lab on Friday, suited and booted with his own band (\u201cwe wanted to make an effort for Montreux,\u201d he tells the audience). Hopefully primed for a Mercury Prize nod later this month with his third album, Hugo, the 28-year-old sounds wise beyond his years as he raps his way through themes of fatherhood, loss, identity, racism, and ennui. Like Guy before him, Carner is a fan of the chop-and-change set. One moment, he is rapping seamlessly over a bristling rendition of \u201cHate\u201d and the next, he\u2019s performing a poem a capella.RecommendedNOS Alive festival 2023 review: Eclectic European festival proves variety truly is the spice of lifeMad Cool review: Europe\u2019s hottest festival is still settling into its new homeRoskilde 2023 review: A triumph for Rosal\u00eca, Rina Sawayama and Lizzo at Denmark\u2019s answer to GlastonburyClosing night of Montreux Jazz Festival 2023 feels like one big party.

And it turned out to be one of the most relaxing holidays I\u2019ve ever had.The aforementioned swathe of concrete is part of the Warren, an area of largely untamed wilderness (and Site of Special Scientific Interest) comprising verdant parklands teeming with wildflowers, twisting coastal paths, and rugged beaches off the tourist trail in the town of Folkestone.Read more on UK travel:How Devon\u2019s original seaside resort is making a comebackThe UK\u2019s best parksThe prettiest UK towns and villages to visit this summerI have lived in this wonderful Kentish seaside spot since September last year, but what with the busyness of building a life somewhere new \u2013 making friends, signing up to every local event, figuring out a new commuting and working from home routine \u2013 I hadn\u2019t had a moment to stop and just be in the place I now called home. And so I did something that travel editors rarely do, what with the whole world of destinations to choose from: I booked a week off in the height of summer and made precisely zero plans.What followed was the kind of frivolous, free-wheeling week that is only feasible when you haven\u2019t got to keep track of seat reservations, hotel bookings, restaurant opening hours or museum ticketing slots. The kind of idyllic holiday that is only possible, in fact, when you stay firmly put.Fish tacos at Sail Box (Helen Coffey)It does take some getting used to, initially. On day one, a feeling of frenzied panic rose in my throat as I stared down the barrel of seven days of... nothing. What an insane waste of annual leave! I could be anywhere, doing anything: watching Flamenco dancers in Seville, kayaking across dazzling blue water in the Austrian Lake District, twirling strands of pecorino-coated cacio e pepe in Rome. What the heck had I been thinking?The wall-to-wall sunshine I had envisaged also failed to appear, and I set out for the town\u2019s trendy redeveloped Harbour Arm on a chillier-than-expected Monday under white-clad skies with a feeling of grim stoicism. Well, I could only keep my expectations low and make the best of it. Sail Box, a new lunch and brunch spot, had opened up, and I had yet to try it. That might be a start. Half an hour later, I was shovelling battered fish tacos into my mouth with greasy fingers; in between bites, my gaze kept drifting up from my book to stare back across the sea, all languid, ivory-stippled waves, to Sunny Sands beach, with its enticing strip of mustard sand. I sat outside \u2013 the sun even made an occasional appearance \u2013 and relaxed into the kind of two-hour lunch I rarely, if ever, indulge in.\n\n It gives you the chance to step out of the manic, non-stop pressures of normal life and see your surroundings in a new way; to really experience the place you liveNext up came the aforementioned Warren excursion, accompanied by a can of cold beer and some fizzy sweets I normally only allow myself when long-distance running. Again, I kept picking up my book and putting it back down; the scene was just too expansive, the kind that inspires dizzying trains of thought (or, if you\u2019re me, some lusty singing into the wind). Hours passed in minutes, and as the sun set I finally stripped off and let myself be immersed in the gasp-inducing chill of the English Channel while basking in the sky\u2019s waning glow.The next days passed in similar splendour: there were 10km runs to Sandgate, the next town over, rewarded by cinnamon buns and iced coffee from Orchard Lane; freshly baked banana bread and yoga classes at newly opened studio and cafe Yoke; beach meditation after endless sea swims; frozen margaritas at the Goods Yard and beers at Brewing Brothers. I felt so rejuvenated I even stirred up the energy to finally repaint my bedroom, leaning into the meditative process of rolling sage green onto bare walls.Folkestone\u2019s redeveloped Harbour Arm has plenty of places to eat and drink (Helen Coffey)The most adventurous thing I did all week was drive with a friend a mere 20 minutes out to the countryside on Folkestone\u2019s doorstep. We tramped through Madams Wood, hoods slicked with rain, before retiring to the Five Bells pub for cauliflower pakora burgers and too many pints of Kentish Pip cider. I ended the week imbued with a bone-deep sense of contentment I haven\u2019t experienced for some time.It does, of course, help if you live in a coastal town, or any particularly attractive beauty spot or rural location. But even that\u2019s not the be-all-and-end-all when it comes to the magic of a staycation. For one, it offers a less-stress version of a holiday that is otherwise impossible to recreate \u2013 unless you have a PA and endless cash reserves. Even then, the best-laid plans are no guarantee: nothing can really stop your flight being delayed, luggage lost, or hotel struck by a freak wave of norovirus cases.Summer holiday vibes on Folkestone Beach (Helen Coffey)But, more importantly, it gives you the chance to step out of the manic, non-stop pressures of normal life and see your surroundings in a new way; to really experience the place you live in, and enjoy it like a visitor might.

The deal was not put to members. Since then, the train operators have announced plans to close almost all station ticket offices at English stations.The union\u2019s general secretary, Mick Lynch, said: \u201cI am proud of our members for showing such fortitude and resolve in this long running dispute.RecommendedEverything you need to know about July and August rail industrial actionLondon Underground strikes: workers announce six-day disruptionFlights in Europe up to 30 times cheaper than rail travel\u201cThe recent attack on ticket offices and the threat to de-staff our railways has galvanised a huge groundswell of public support which we are grateful for.\u201cOur members and our union will not be cowed by rail bosses or government ministers and our dispute will continue until we can reach a negotiated settlement.\u201dBut as The Independent reports, the leader of Britain\u2019s second largest rail union, the Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA) has accused the RMT of putting jobs at risk by pushing ahead with its walk-outs.The TSSA\u2019s general secretary, Peter Pendle, said: \u201cBecause of the line that our colleagues are taking, the deal \u2013 which was a good deal \u2013 has been swept away and all these changes are being imposed.\u201dThursday\u2019s 24-hour walk-out coincides with the fourth day in the latest overtime ban by train drivers belonging to Aslef. The union is involved in a similar dispute on pay and conditions.The last day of the Aslef ban on rest-day working is Friday; on Saturday 22 July, RMT members walk out again for 24 hours.On the London Underground, a strike called by the RMT is likely to shut down almost all of the Tube network between Sunday 23 July and Friday 28 July.The final day of the RMT national rail action is scheduled for Saturday 29 July, with some effects continuing to the following day. And on Monday 31 July, another Aslef overtime ban begins for six days.Cricket fans hoping to attend the fifth Ashes Test between England and Australia at the Oval will be hit by all three sets of industrial action.A spokesperson for the RDG accused the RMT of \u201cdisrupting the plans of families during the summer holidays\u201d and causing \u201cdisappointment, frustration, and financial strain for tens of thousands of people\u201d.Elsewhere, the motoring organisations are warning of congestion accompanying the busiest start to the school holidays in England and Wales.The RAC predicts the worst jams will be on Friday, with the M5 motorway south of Bristol and the southwestern section of London\u2019s M25 \u2013 between the A3 for Portsmouth and the A22 for Eastbourne \u2013 worst affected.The AA said: \u201cThose travelling further afield should expect delays around many of the UK\u2019s ports and airports this summer.\u201cOperation Brock has been deployed in Kent ahead of the summer getaway period.On the corresponding Friday in 2022, huge queues built up at the port of Dover and the Eurotunnel terminal at Folkestone as the effects of post-Brexit passport checks became apparent.Because the UK negotiated to become a \u201cthird country\u201d, French frontier police must now stamp every passport and check for the duration of stays in the European Union.The Kent port\u2019s chief executive, Doug Bannister, said: \u201cWhen passengers arrive at the Port of Dover, they will be processed through border controls \u2013 anticipated to take around 90 minutes on peak days.\u201cHowever, our modelling indicates that processing times may be up to 2.5 hours during the peak hours of 6am to 1pm during the first couple of Saturdays and Sundays of the summer holidays, due to the extreme popularity of these days.\u201dRecommendedFlights in Europe up to 30 times cheaper than rail travelEurope heatwave: Is it safe to travel to Italy, Spain, Greece and Croatia?British family abandon \u00a32.5k Greek holiday over blistering 40C Cerberus heatwaveOn Wednesday evening delays built up at the UK\u2019s two busiest airports, London Heathrow and Gatwick, with some flights departing close to midnight.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeChoosing to travel by train for a European holiday will cost an average of four times the cost of flying, according to a major new report from Greenpeace, which has blasted the price difference as \u201coutrageous\u201d.In some cases there could be 30 times the difference in cost, such as routes between Barcelona and London, with rail operators unable to compete with tickets on sale for as little as \u00a311.10. The campaign group said that shifting the 3.36 million annual flights between the UK capital and Barcelona to rail would save approximately 461,000 tons of harmful greenhouse gases \u2013 equivalent to the annual emissions of all the cars in Glasgow.The report blames price differences on an \u201cuneven regulatory playing field that benefits low-cost airlines at the expense of the climate and workers\u2019 rights\u201d.On the eve of one of the busiest flying periods of the year, as schools across Europe are breaking up for the summer holiday, the study, which compared ticket prices on 112 routes between 27 major European cities, found that flights were generally cheaper on 70 per cent of routes, with trains twice as expensive as flying on average.The UK performed worse than average, with people paying four times as much for train journeys to and from the country. Flying was consistently cheaper on all 12 of the UK routes in the study, including domestic routes between London and Scotland, the report shows.RecommendedIndependent Traveller guide to best hotels and short breaksBest UK hotels 2022Cheap hotels in Paris 2022: Where to stay for value for moneyCountries with the most expensive train tickets compared to flights are the UK, Spain, Belgium, France and Italy. In Central and Eastern Europe, trains are more often cheaper in relation to flights than in Western Europe; however, the train frequency, speed and connections are usually worse.The report found that despite some \u201creally effective\u201d train routes, such as Amsterdam-London, London-Edinburgh and Toulouse-Paris, they are still among the most popular short-haul flight routes in Europe \u2013 and remain cheaper than travelling by rail.Of the more than 100 routes analysed, the train was deemed \u201calmost always cheaper\u201d on just 23, with six of them having no direct flights and another six not served by low-cost airlines. Greenpeace only considers 12 of the 23 to be \u201cgreat train routes\u201d, which it defines as having more than three daily direct connections (day and night for longer routes), travelling at a good average speed, high reliability and usually costing less than a flight but not more than \u20ac150 (\u00a3131).The best rail routes include Berlin-Prague, Zurich-Vienna, Zurich-Berlin, Athens-Thessaloniki, Warsaw-Berlin, Prague-Budapest, Porto-Lisbon and Madrid-Barcelona.\u201cAs millions of Brits head off on their European breaks \u2013 many to areas that are being scorched by this historic heatwave \u2013 the twisted economics of the transport industry means they are being encouraged to keep throwing fuel on the climate inferno\u201d, said Dr Doug Parr, Greenpeace UK\u2019s director of policy.\u201cFlying only looks like a bargain because the cost of pollution is so cheap. Low-cost airlines are paying negligible tax while imposing low wages and poor conditions on staff.\u201dA recent analysis by Transport and Environment said the UK Treasury was missing out on \u00a34.7bn because it \u201cunder-taxes\u201d the aviation sector.Greenpeace said airlines keep their prices artificially low because they pay no fuel tax or VAT, and have even received a recent reduction in Air Passenger Duty in the UK. Train operators have to pay energy taxes, VAT and high rail tolls in most European countries, although no VAT in the UK.James Dunne, founder and CEO of Rail Online, told The Independent earlier this year: \u201cAs one of the most important considerations when booking, especially given the cost-of-living crisis, the primary way to encourage more people to choose rail above air travel would be to ensure domestic train travel is more affordable than the alternative flight route option.\u201dLast month, it was announced that new proposals set to be considered by the government\u2019s rail regulator would cut the window to buy discount fares from three months to just eight weeks before the date of travel \u2013 making it harder to plan ahead.RecommendedEasyJet blames flight cancellations on \u2018unprecedented\u2019 air-traffic control disruptionPassengers only offered $12 food voucher during 30-hour flight delaySummer holiday getaway begins with fresh national rail strikeDespite Greenpeace\u2019s findings, it is possible to swap air for rail travel and still save money, according to consumer group Which? \u2013 if you\u2019re travelling as a larger group.Spot checks by the consumer champion discovered that a family of four could save nearly \u00a3100 travelling by sleeper train, while a bigger family could save more than \u00a3250.

As The Independent reported this week, 61,000 Europeans are believed to have died as a result of the extreme heat last summer.For travellers contemplating their options, these are the key questions and answers.Where are the hottest spots?Temperatures around the Mediterranean are typically 8-13C above normal \u2013 which, at this time of year, means temperatures are very high by UK standards.On 18 July, holidaymakers heading in the favourite Spanish island destination, Mallorca, faced \u201cextreme risk\u201d.Spain\u2019s state meteorological office, Aemet, reported that temperatures hit 44.8C in Llubi, just north of the Balearic Island\u2019s centre, with a thermal sensation of 48C.The official rating was \u201cextreme risk\u201d, although that has been downgraded to \u201cimportant risk\u201d on 19 July.However, other Spanish holiday spots on the mainland, including Alicante and Malaga, have been issued with extreme risk warnings today, with 42C temperatures forecast.The Foreign Office has updated its travel advice for both Spain and Greece, with specific information under \u201cextreme weather\u201d, which advises people to keep up to date with the latest developments from the Greek and Spanish authorities.On Tuesday, Italy\u2019s health ministry issued red weather alerts for 20 of the country\u2018s 27 cities. This is expected to rise to 23 today. Yesterday, temperatures on Sardinia reached 44C, while Rome hit over 40C.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThirteen months on from the start of the first national rail strikes since the 1980s, the disputes over pay, jobs and working conditions appear as intractable as ever. July has seen the resumption of industrial action aimed at more than a dozen train operators by both main rail unions, which will continue into August.In a separate dispute, staff working for the London Underground will walk out for six days in late July in a row over over pensions, job cuts and what the RMT union calls \u201cattacks on working conditions\u201d.In the national rail disputes, the biggest union, the RMT, and Aslef, representing train drivers, say many of their members have not had a pay rise for four years. They are demanding decent, no-strings increases that take into account the high level of inflation. The unions are prepared to discuss reforms, but these must be negotiated separately with commensurate boosts to pay. Train operators and ministers \u2013 who must sign off any deal \u2013 insist modernisation is essential following the collapse of rail revenue, in particular the loss of much of the \u201cbedrock\u201d of season ticket sales since the Covid pandemic.Caught in the middle: the long-suffering passenger. Since June 2022, national rail strikes and other forms of industrial action have scuppered the travel plans of tens of millions of train passengers. Stoppages have been called frequently, causing massive disruption and making advance travel planning difficult.RecommendedRail passengers facing further strikes from ThursdayAll the UK strike dates confirmed for July 2023Train drivers\u2019 union announces another overtime ban, causing three weeks of summer travel disruptionTransport for Wales and ScotRail are not involved and will run normal services, but some of the affected operators usually run trains in Wales and Scotland.These are the key questions and answers.Who is taking industrial action, and when?The train drivers\u2019 union, Aslef, is mounting \u201caction short of a strike\u201d in the shape of Monday-to-Saturday overtime bans. It carried out the first six-day walk-out from 3 to 8 July. The second began on Monday 17 July and will continue until Saturday 22 July inclusive. A third starts on Monday 31 July until Saturday 5 August.Hundreds of trains are likely to be cancelled each day.The biggest rail union, the RMT, has called` 20,000 of its members out on strike on Thursday 20, Saturday 22 and Saturday 29 July. The first two dates coincide with the Aslef overtime bans. The late July walk-outs are likely to cause widespread cancellations at the start of the main summer school holidays in England. A London Underground strike, also involving members of the RMT, will run from Sunday 23 to Friday 28 July. It is sandwiched between two of the national walk-outs called by the same union.Which train operators are involved the national disputes?The RMT strikes and Aslef overtime ban are aimed at rail firms contracted by the Department for Transport. They include the leading intercity operators:Avanti West CoastCrossCountryEast Midlands RailwayGreat Western RailwayLNERTransPennine ExpressMost London commuter operators will be hit:C2C (not involved in the Aslef action)Greater AngliaGTR (Gatwick Express, Great Northern, Southern, Thameslink)SoutheasternSouth Western Railway Operators focusing on the Midlands and north of England will be affected:Chiltern RailwaysNorthern TrainsWest Midlands TrainsWhat is happening about the London Underground?The RMT plans a walk-out from Sunday 23 July until Friday 28 July. General secretary Mick Lynch says: \u201cThis week of action will shut down the London Underground and show just how important the work of our members is.\u201dThe union claims 600 jobs are scheduled to be axed, leading to \u201cmore unstaffed stations and a lowering of safety standards\u201d. The union says bosses \u201cplan to make London Underground staff poorer in retirement\u201d.London Overground and the Elizabeth Line are unaffected by the planned industrial action. But routes that offer alternatives to strike-hit routes, such as Stratford, Walthamstow Central and Ealing Broadway to central London, are likely to be especially busy during the walk-outs by RMT members working for train operators and the London Underground,Why were the July and August dates chosen?Like any unions, the RMT and Aslef are seeking the biggest impact \u2013 ie to cause as much disruption as they can. With rail commuting sharply down since the Covid pandemic, the target is now leisure passengers.Aslef\u2019s first overtime ban coincided with the first week of the Wimbledon tennis championships in southwest London.The second Aslef overtime ban will affect passengers hoping to travel to the first four days of the fourth Ashes Test between England and Australia, which begins on Wednesday 19 July at Old Trafford in Manchester. The RMT union\u2019s national walk-outs are targeting what are likely to be three of the busiest days of the month.Many families will be on the move at the start of school holidays on 20 and 22 July; those dates also fall during the Open golf championship at Royal Liverpool Golf Club.The 29 July strike will hit journeys to and from holiday resorts.Cricket fans hoping to travel to and within London for the fifth Ashes Test at the Oval, which will be played 27-31 July, face disruption from all three components of industrial action.The first two days will be hit by the London Underground strike; the third by the RMT national strike; and the fifth by the Aslef overtime ban..The strike days for the London Underground, from 23 to 28 July, are intended to disrupt travel in the capital for as long as possible. In combination, passengers in the capital who depend on both national rail and the Tube will be hit by strikes on nine out of 10 days between 20 and 29 July.Which trains will run during the Aslef and RMT industrial action?Passengers can expect normal service on:Caledonian SleeperGrand Central (except for dozens of cancellations due to fleet issues)Heathrow ExpressHull TrainsLondon OvergroundLumoMerseyrailScotRailTransport for WalesSoutheastern: no impact expected from Aslef strike; RMT strike days will see much reduced services, with links only from London Victoria to Bromley South, London Bridge to Dartford and Sevenoaks and London St Pancras International and reduced service hours.Southern/Great Northern/Thameslink: During the Aslef overtime ban, an emergency timetable with fewer services will run. The Thameslink core between London Bridge and St Pancras will be closed.On Great Northern train will run regularly from London Kings Cross to Cambridge and Kings Lynn. Peterborough and Letchworth get peak hour services only.\u201cServices will be busier than usual, especially in peak hours. It\u2019s likely you will need to queue and you may not be able to board your chosen service. You should allow extra time for your journey.\u201dOn RMT strike days, a reduced service will run between 7am and 7pm.Gatwick Express: Cancelled on 17-22 July and on 29 July.Southwestern: Reduced services during Aslef overtime ban, skeleton network on RMT strike days: London Waterloo to Guildford, Southampton, Ascot and Hampton Court. All other lines closed.Great Western Railway (GWR): Night Riviera sleeper train from London Paddington to Penzance is cancelled from 16 to 21 July, resuming on 23 July.The Aslef overtime ban \u201cis likely to cause some short-notice alterations or cancellations\u201d.On the RMT strike days, \u201cmany parts of the GWR network will have no service at all\u201d.GWR says: \u201cServices will start later, finish much earlier and only operate for a limited period during the day.\u201dBut a bigger network than on previous days will operate, with trains on the following intercity routes to and from London Paddington:Cardiff and SwanseaBath and Bristol Temple MeadsOxfordExeter and PlymouthSwindon and Cheltenham SpaIn addition some regional services will run, including Cardiff to Westbury via Bath and Bristol, and Bristol to Plymouth.Chiltern: Fewer trains and reduced hours during the Aslef overtime ban. On RMT strike days the network will be reduced to a limited service linking London Marylebone with Aylesbury, Banbury and Oxford.Avanti West Coast: The Aslef overtime ban is not expected to have an impact. But on RMT strike days the picture is complicated by large-scale engineering work. The basic pattern to and from London Euston will be one train each hour to/from:ManchesterLiverpool (via Birmingham)Preston, with a limited service onwards to Glasgow.On 29 July there will be more trains with Birmingham and Liverpool each getting a dedicated service.North Wales, Shrewsbury, Blackpool, Stoke-on-Trent, Macclesfield and Edinburgh will have no Avanti West Coast services.\u201cThe days after industrial action are also expected to be affected \u2013 particularly due to the reduced timetable for engineering work, but trains may also start later in the morning than usual following the strike,\u201d Avanti West Coast says.Northern: \u201cDisruption is expected between 17-22 July, particularly Friday 21 July, due to industrial action called by Aslef.\u201cThere will be very limited Northern services on Thursday 20, Saturday 22 and Saturday 29 July.\u201dTransPennine Express: \u201cWe expect some services to start later and finish earlier than usual, and some journeys may be altered late or on the day of travel\u201d \u2013 that is the prediction for the Aslef overtime ban.On RMT strike days (20, 22 and 29 July) a very limited number of trains will run on the Manchester Piccadilly-Leeds-York-Scarborough route; between Preston and Manchester Airport; and between Sheffield and Cleethorpes.East Midlands Railway: A number of train cancellations are predicted during the Aslef overtime ban. On RMT strike days, the operator says: \u201cOnly travel by rail if absolutely necessary and if you do travel, expect severe disruption.\u201d But a significant service will operate hourly on these routes:London St Pancras to/from Nottingham, Sheffield and Corby.Derby and NottinghamDerby and MatlockSheffield and NottinghamLeicester and LincolnMansfield Woodhouse and NottinghamNottingham and Skegness (every two hours)LNER: During Aslef overtime ban, \u201cit is possible there will be short-notice alterations and cancellations\u201d.On RMT strike days, a regular service will run on the London-York-Newcastle-Edinburgh line, with first departures around 7am and final arrivals around 10pm. The London-Leeds will run approximately 7am-6pm.Trains could be unexpectedly full as Grand Central \u2013 uninvolved in the dispute \u2013 has cancelled dozens of trains due to fleet issues.Greater Anglia: \u201cA number of cancellations\u201d during the Aslef overtime ban.\u201cAvoid travelling with Greater Anglia on strike days,\u201d the company says.Will airport trains run?The Gatwick Express between the Sussex airport and London is suspended, but Southern trains are available on the London Victoria-Gatwick linkGatwick, Luton, Birmingham and Manchester airports will have some trains during the RMT walk-outs. Stansted Airport is likely to have trains to and from London Liverpool Street every hour from around 7am until the evening.Heathrow airport is unaffected by the national walk-outs: it is served by the Heathrow Express and Elizabeth Line, as well as the London Underground. But during the RMT Tube strike against Transport for London, the airport\u2019s Tube link on the Piccadilly Line is likely to be suspended \u2013 in common with almost all other Underground servicesWill Eurostar be affected?No, but connections to and from the train operator\u2019s main hub at London St Pancras International will be difficult because union members working for all three domestic train operators at the station (East Midlands Railway, Southeastern and Thameslink) serving the station will walk out. On London Underground strike days, 23-28 July, access will also be difficult.Why is Aslef taking industrial action?Mick Whelan, Aslef\u2019s general secretary, said: \u201cOnce again we find ourselves with no alternative but to take this action. We have continually come to the negotiating table in good faith, seeking to resolve the dispute.\u201cSadly, it is clear from the actions of both the train operating companies and the government that they do not want an end to the dispute. Their goals appear to be to continue industrial strife and to do down our industry.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to inconvenience the public. We just want to see our members paid fairly during a cost of living crisis when inflation is running at above 10 per cent, and to not see our terms and conditions taken away.\u201cIt\u2019s time for the government and the companies to think again and look for a resolution.\u201dWhy is the RMT striking nationally?The RMT general secretary Mick Lynch has described the latest offer from the train operators \u2013 represented by the Rail Delivery Group (RDG) \u2013 as \u201csubstandard\u201d. He said: \u201cThis latest phase of action will show the country just how important railway staff are to the running of the rail industry.\u201dThe government continues to shackle the companies and will not allow them to put forward a package that can settle this dispute.\u201cRMT will continue its industrial campaign until we reach a negotiated settlement on pay, working conditions and job security.The RMT has staged walk-outs on 28 days in the current wave of strikes, with Aslef stopping work on 13 previous occasions.What do the train operators say?A spokesman for the RDG said: \u201cMore strikes are totally unnecessary. After a year of industrial action all the RMT has achieved is losing their members more money than they would have received in the pay offers they refused to put to put out to a vote, despite having agreed the terms with the negotiators the room.\u201cWe have now made three offers that the RMT executive have blocked without a convincing explanation.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThirteen months on from the start of the first national rail strikes since the 1980s, the disputes over pay, jobs and working conditions appear as intractable as ever. July has seen the resumption of industrial action aimed at more than a dozen train operators by both main rail unions, which will continue into August.In a separate dispute, staff working for the London Underground will walk out for six days in late July in a row over over pensions, job cuts and what the RMT union calls \u201cattacks on working conditions\u201d.In the national rail disputes, the biggest union, the RMT, and Aslef, representing train drivers, say many of their members have not had a pay rise for four years. They are demanding decent, no-strings increases that take into account the high level of inflation. The unions are prepared to discuss reforms, but these must be negotiated separately with commensurate boosts to pay. Train operators and ministers \u2013 who must sign off any deal \u2013 insist modernisation is essential following the collapse of rail revenue, in particular the loss of much of the \u201cbedrock\u201d of season ticket sales since the Covid pandemic.Caught in the middle: the long-suffering passenger. Since June 2022, national rail strikes and other forms of industrial action have scuppered the travel plans of tens of millions of train passengers. Stoppages have been called frequently, causing massive disruption and making advance travel planning difficult.RecommendedRow between rail unions as RMT accused of ruining dealAll the UK strike dates confirmed for July 2023Rail passengers facing further strikes from ThursdayTransport for Wales and ScotRail are not involved and will run normal services, but some of the affected operators usually run trains in Wales and Scotland.These are the key questions and answers.Who is taking industrial action, and when?The train drivers\u2019 union, Aslef, is mounting \u201caction short of a strike\u201d in the shape of Monday-to-Saturday overtime bans. It carried out the first six-day walk-out from 3 to 8 July. The second began on Monday 17 July and will continue until Saturday 22 July inclusive. A third starts on Monday 31 July until Saturday 5 August.Hundreds of trains are likely to be cancelled each day.The biggest rail union, the RMT, has called` 20,000 of its members out on strike on Thursday 20, Saturday 22 and Saturday 29 July. The first two dates coincide with the Aslef overtime bans. The late July walk-outs are likely to cause widespread cancellations at the start of the main summer school holidays in England. A London Underground strike, also involving members of the RMT, will run from Sunday 23 to Friday 28 July. It is sandwiched between two of the national walk-outs called by the same union.Which train operators are involved the national disputes?The RMT strikes and Aslef overtime ban are aimed at rail firms contracted by the Department for Transport. They include the leading intercity operators:Avanti West CoastCrossCountryEast Midlands RailwayGreat Western RailwayLNERTransPennine ExpressMost London commuter operators will be hit:C2C (not involved in the Aslef action)Greater AngliaGTR (Gatwick Express, Great Northern, Southern, Thameslink)SoutheasternSouth Western Railway Operators focusing on the Midlands and north of England will be affected:Chiltern RailwaysNorthern TrainsWest Midlands TrainsWhat is happening about the London Underground?The RMT plans a walk-out from Sunday 23 July until Friday 28 July. General secretary Mick Lynch says: \u201cThis week of action will shut down the London Underground and show just how important the work of our members is.\u201dThe union claims 600 jobs are scheduled to be axed, leading to \u201cmore unstaffed stations and a lowering of safety standards\u201d. The union says bosses \u201cplan to make London Underground staff poorer in retirement\u201d.London Overground and the Elizabeth Line are unaffected by the planned industrial action. But routes that offer alternatives to strike-hit routes, such as Stratford, Walthamstow Central and Ealing Broadway to central London, are likely to be especially busy during the walk-outs by RMT members working for train operators and the London Underground,Why were the July and August dates chosen?Like any unions, the RMT and Aslef are seeking the biggest impact \u2013 ie to cause as much disruption as they can. With rail commuting sharply down since the Covid pandemic, the target is now leisure passengers.Aslef\u2019s first overtime ban coincided with the first week of the Wimbledon tennis championships in southwest London.The second Aslef overtime ban will affect passengers hoping to travel to the first four days of the fourth Ashes Test between England and Australia, which begins on Wednesday 19 July at Old Trafford in Manchester. The RMT union\u2019s national walk-outs are targeting what are likely to be three of the busiest days of the month.Many families will be on the move at the start of school holidays on 20 and 22 July; those dates also fall during the Open golf championship at Royal Liverpool Golf Club.The 29 July strike will hit journeys to and from holiday resorts.Cricket fans hoping to travel to and within London for the fifth Ashes Test at the Oval, which will be played 27-31 July, face disruption from all three components of industrial action.The first two days will be hit by the London Underground strike; the third by the RMT national strike; and the fifth by the Aslef overtime ban..The strike days for the London Underground, from 23 to 28 July, are intended to disrupt travel in the capital for as long as possible. In combination, passengers in the capital who depend on both national rail and the Tube will be hit by strikes on nine out of 10 days between 20 and 29 July.Which trains will run during the Aslef and RMT industrial action?Passengers can expect normal service on:Caledonian SleeperGrand Central (except for dozens of cancellations due to fleet issues)Heathrow ExpressHull TrainsLondon OvergroundLumoMerseyrailScotRailTransport for WalesSoutheastern: no impact expected from Aslef strike; RMT strike days will see much reduced services, with links only from London Victoria to Bromley South, London Bridge to Dartford and Sevenoaks and London St Pancras International and reduced service hours.Southern/Great Northern/Thameslink: During the Aslef overtime ban, an emergency timetable with fewer services will run. The Thameslink core between London Bridge and St Pancras will be closed.On Great Northern train will run regularly from London Kings Cross to Cambridge and Kings Lynn. Peterborough and Letchworth get peak hour services only.\u201cServices will be busier than usual, especially in peak hours. It\u2019s likely you will need to queue and you may not be able to board your chosen service. You should allow extra time for your journey.\u201dOn RMT strike days, a reduced service will run between 7am and 7pm.Gatwick Express: Cancelled on 17-22 July and on 29 July.Southwestern: Reduced services during Aslef overtime ban, skeleton network on RMT strike days: London Waterloo to Guildford, Southampton, Ascot and Hampton Court. All other lines closed.Great Western Railway (GWR): Night Riviera sleeper train from London Paddington to Penzance is cancelled from 16 to 21 July, resuming on 23 July.The Aslef overtime ban \u201cis likely to cause some short-notice alterations or cancellations\u201d.On the RMT strike days, \u201cmany parts of the GWR network will have no service at all\u201d.GWR says: \u201cServices will start later, finish much earlier and only operate for a limited period during the day.\u201dBut a bigger network than on previous days will operate, with trains on the following intercity routes to and from London Paddington:Cardiff and SwanseaBath and Bristol Temple MeadsOxfordExeter and PlymouthSwindon and Cheltenham SpaIn addition some regional services will run, including Cardiff to Westbury via Bath and Bristol, and Bristol to Plymouth.Chiltern: Fewer trains and reduced hours during the Aslef overtime ban. On RMT strike days the network will be reduced to a limited service linking London Marylebone with Aylesbury, Banbury and Oxford.Avanti West Coast: The Aslef overtime ban is not expected to have an impact. But on RMT strike days the picture is complicated by large-scale engineering work. The basic pattern to and from London Euston will be one train each hour to/from:ManchesterLiverpool (via Birmingham)Preston, with a limited service onwards to Glasgow.On 29 July there will be more trains with Birmingham and Liverpool each getting a dedicated service.North Wales, Shrewsbury, Blackpool, Stoke-on-Trent, Macclesfield and Edinburgh will have no Avanti West Coast services.\u201cThe days after industrial action are also expected to be affected \u2013 particularly due to the reduced timetable for engineering work, but trains may also start later in the morning than usual following the strike,\u201d Avanti West Coast says.Northern: \u201cDisruption is expected between 17-22 July, particularly Friday 21 July, due to industrial action called by Aslef.\u201cThere will be very limited Northern services on Thursday 20, Saturday 22 and Saturday 29 July.\u201dTransPennine Express: \u201cWe expect some services to start later and finish earlier than usual, and some journeys may be altered late or on the day of travel\u201d \u2013 that is the prediction for the Aslef overtime ban.On RMT strike days (20, 22 and 29 July) a very limited number of trains will run on the Manchester Piccadilly-Leeds-York-Scarborough route; between Preston and Manchester Airport; and between Sheffield and Cleethorpes.East Midlands Railway: A number of train cancellations are predicted during the Aslef overtime ban. On RMT strike days, the operator says: \u201cOnly travel by rail if absolutely necessary and if you do travel, expect severe disruption.\u201d But a significant service will operate hourly on these routes:London St Pancras to/from Nottingham, Sheffield and Corby.Derby and NottinghamDerby and MatlockSheffield and NottinghamLeicester and LincolnMansfield Woodhouse and NottinghamNottingham and Skegness (every two hours)LNER: During Aslef overtime ban, \u201cit is possible there will be short-notice alterations and cancellations\u201d.On RMT strike days, a regular service will run on the London-York-Newcastle-Edinburgh line, with first departures around 7am and final arrivals around 10pm. The London-Leeds will run approximately 7am-6pm.Trains could be unexpectedly full as Grand Central \u2013 uninvolved in the dispute \u2013 has cancelled dozens of trains due to fleet issues.Greater Anglia: \u201cA number of cancellations\u201d during the Aslef overtime ban.\u201cAvoid travelling with Greater Anglia on strike days,\u201d the company says.Will airport trains run?The Gatwick Express between the Sussex airport and London is suspended, but Southern trains are available on the London Victoria-Gatwick linkGatwick, Luton, Birmingham and Manchester airports will have some trains during the RMT walk-outs. Stansted Airport is likely to have trains to and from London Liverpool Street every hour from around 7am until the evening.Heathrow airport is unaffected by the national walk-outs: it is served by the Heathrow Express and Elizabeth Line, as well as the London Underground. But during the RMT Tube strike against Transport for London, the airport\u2019s Tube link on the Piccadilly Line is likely to be suspended \u2013 in common with almost all other Underground servicesWill Eurostar be affected?No, but connections to and from the train operator\u2019s main hub at London St Pancras International will be difficult because union members working for all three domestic train operators at the station (East Midlands Railway, Southeastern and Thameslink) serving the station will walk out. On London Underground strike days, 23-28 July, access will also be difficult.Why is Aslef taking industrial action?Mick Whelan, Aslef\u2019s general secretary, said: \u201cOnce again we find ourselves with no alternative but to take this action. We have continually come to the negotiating table in good faith, seeking to resolve the dispute.\u201cSadly, it is clear from the actions of both the train operating companies and the government that they do not want an end to the dispute. Their goals appear to be to continue industrial strife and to do down our industry.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to inconvenience the public. We just want to see our members paid fairly during a cost of living crisis when inflation is running at above 10 per cent, and to not see our terms and conditions taken away.\u201cIt\u2019s time for the government and the companies to think again and look for a resolution.\u201dWhy is the RMT striking nationally?The RMT general secretary Mick Lynch has described the latest offer from the train operators \u2013 represented by the Rail Delivery Group (RDG) \u2013 as \u201csubstandard\u201d. He said: \u201cThis latest phase of action will show the country just how important railway staff are to the running of the rail industry.\u201dThe government continues to shackle the companies and will not allow them to put forward a package that can settle this dispute.\u201cRMT will continue its industrial campaign until we reach a negotiated settlement on pay, working conditions and job security.The RMT has staged walk-outs on 28 days in the current wave of strikes, with Aslef stopping work on 13 previous occasions.What do the train operators say?A spokesman for the RDG said: \u201cMore strikes are totally unnecessary. After a year of industrial action all the RMT has achieved is losing their members more money than they would have received in the pay offers they refused to put to put out to a vote, despite having agreed the terms with the negotiators the room.\u201cWe have now made three offers that the RMT executive have blocked without a convincing explanation. We remain open to talks and we have said repeatedly that we want to give our people a pay rise.\u201cBut until the union leadership and executive is united in what it wants and engages in good faith with the 30 per cent shortfall in revenue the industry is continuing to grapple with post-Covid, it is difficult to move forward.\u201cSadly our staff, our customers and the communities across the country which rely on a thriving railway are the ones that are suffering as a result.\u201dWhat does the government say?A spokesperson for the Department for Transport said: \u201cThe RMT leadership\u2019s decision to call strikes targeting two iconic international sporting events, as children and families begin their summer holidays, will disrupt people\u2019s plans across the country.\u201cAfter a year of industrial action, passengers and rail workers alike are growing tired of union bosses playing politics with their lives.\u201cIt\u2019s high time the union leaders realised that strikes no longer have the impact they once did and are simply driving people away from the railway.\u201dI have a ticket booked for one of the RMT national strike days. What can I do?Passengers with Advance, Anytime or Off-Peak tickets can have their ticket refunded with no fee if the train that the ticket is booked for is cancelled, delayed or rescheduled.Train operators are likely to offer flexibility to travel on a wide range of non-strike days.Passengers with season tickets who do not travel can claim compensation for the strike dates through Delay Repay.RecommendedSummer holiday getaway begins with fresh national rail strikeHoliday travel chaos looms as schools break up for summerTrain union extends overtime ban, causing three weeks of summer travel disruptionWhat are the alternatives?As always, long-distance coach operators \u2013 National Express, Megabus and Flixbus \u2013 will keep running, though seats are becoming scarce and fares are rising."}, {"_id": "64b9405d51ac331da6c7c0f6", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/airbnb-host-kicks-out-renter-nightclub-b2377866.html", "primaryCategory": "News &amp; Advice", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Airbnb host catches guests throwing massive party on CCTV: \u2018This is how not to rent an Airbnb\u2019", "lead": "<p>Party broke the listing\u2019s rules but opinions are split as to whether it should have been shut down </p>", "author": "Benjamin Parker", "datePublished": "2023-07-19 19:51:45", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:10:37.385125", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-19T19:51:45+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/18/10/tik%20tok.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Simon Calder\u2019s free travel email for expert advice and money-saving discountsGet Simon Calder\u2019s Travel email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeWith the summer heat upon us, it means that our homes may become uncomfortably hot, especially at night.As it gets hotter, it can be tempting to open your windows to let in some fresh air when the weather gets too warm \u2013 but should you keep them shut instead?Should you keep windows open or closed during a heatwave?According to NHS advice, curtains should be kept shut to keep sun-facing rooms as shaded as possible.The health service advises drinking plenty of fluid and avoiding excess alcohol, keeping out of the sun between 11am and 3pm, and avoiding exercise during the hottest part of the day.Professor Amin Al-Habaibeh, an expert in heat transfer in buildings at Nottingham Trent University, tells The Independent: \u201cIt is all about heat transfer. We need to reduce heat gain to inside the building in hot weather.RecommendedHow to keep your house cool in a heatwave How to sleep during a heatwave, according to experts How tin foil can keep your home cool during a heatwave\u201cHeat gain comes mainly from two sources: solar radiation and hot air. Also we need to avoid \u2018green house\u2019 effect as this would increase the temperature inside the house.\u201cSo if you have a conservatory, it is important to keep windows open during day time and ideally isolate it from the rest of the house to reduce thermal gain to the rest of the building due to the \u2018green house\u2019 effect.\u201cIt is important keep the curtains closed during the day to reduce solar gain inside the house.\u201dOn whether or not you should keep windows open, Al-Habaibeh says it depends on the type of house and the outside temperatures.\u201cIn short, open windows when the temperature inside the house becomes greater than the external temperature, otherwise keep the windows closed,\u201d he explains.Dr Lindsay Browning, psychologist and sleep expert at bed retailer And So To Bed agrees that it\u2019s best to keep windows closed where you can.\u201cGenerally, when it is really hot outside it is a good idea to keep windows closed during the daytime, as you don\u2019t want the hot external air to come into the house warming it up. However, after the sun goes down, the outside air will start to cool down,\u201d Browning explains.\u201cAt this point, it is a great idea to open the windows to let in a breeze of cool external air into the bedroom, helping cool the room and to provide needed air circulation.\u201dShe also recommends keeping the room dark during the day to stop the sun from heating up the room.RecommendedHow to tell if you have Covid or heatstrokeWhy do heatwaves in the UK feel hotter than abroad?A spokesperson for NHS Property Services says they recommend \u201cclosing blinds and curtains in rooms that face the sun, opening windows on the side of the building that is in the shade, but closing windows that are in direct sunlight\u201d.They also recommend keeping the windows closed if you have air conditioning so that cooler air can circulate."}, {"_id": "64b9405e51ac331da6c7c0fa", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/june-heatwave-temperature-pets-safety-b2377381.html", "primaryCategory": "Health &amp; Families", "subCategories": "test", "title": "How to keep your pet cool and healthy during a heatwave", "lead": "<p>Animals can be prone to overheating as temperatures rise</p>", "author": "Sabrina Barr", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 13:54:20", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:10:38.658432", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-20T13:54:20+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2022/06/17/09/iStock-589431650%20%281%29.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Stay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletterStay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeLearning how to cope in the heat can be a struggle, with the beaming rays of the sun, the inescapable humidity and the ever-rising temperatures tough to handle for many.With this in mind, it\u2019s worth considering that domestic animals don\u2019t have the luxury of being able to say when they\u2019re feeling overheated or dehydrated, which is why you need to learn how to keep your pet as safe and healthy as possible during these extreme weather conditions.Whether you\u2019re a dog person or own a reptile, this is how to look after your pet properly as the heatwave runs its course.Dogs (Getty Images/iStockphoto)RecommendedHow to tell if you have Covid or heatstrokeWhy do heatwaves in the UK feel hotter than abroad?Dogs with long fur will likely fare worse than their shorter-haired peers during the summer.However, they are able to cool themselves down by panting and releasing heat through their paws, as animal charity Blue Cross explains. Dogs do this because they\u2019re unable to sweat through their skin in the same way as humans do.RecommendedWarning drivers could face \u00a35000 fine over summer driving errorUK weather: Met Office predicts how long rain will last before heatwave beginsJuly dates for DWP cost of living payments, benefits and pensionsIf a dog does overheat, they could be at risk of suffering from a serious heatstroke, with the charity explaining that \u201csigns of heatstroke in dogs include collapse, excessive panting and dribbling\u201d.\u201cIf you suspect your pet is suffering from the condition, move them to a cool place, preferably with a draught, wet their coat with cool - not freezing - water, and contact your vet immediately,\u201d the charity advises.Furthermore, leaving a dog in a car on a hot day can have devastating consequences, as the temperature within the car can soar to extreme levels at a rapid rate, which is why it\u2019s advised never to leave a dog in a car in hot conditions. To ensure that dogs are comfortable during walks on days with excessive heat, the RSPCA recommends only walking your dog in the morning or evening at the peak of summer, as doing so will help prevent them from burning their paws on the pavement or suffering from heatstroke.You must also make sure that your dog always has access to water.Cats (Getty Images/iStockphoto)Different types of cats may be more prone to sunburn than others, as pet agency Very Important Pets outlines. \u201cPale-coloured cats are vulnerable to sunburn; particularly on their ears, noses and sparsely haired areas,\u201d the agency states, adding that, \u201clike in humans, sunburn can sometimes lead to skin cancer.\u201dWhile many cat owners may let their feline friends roam at will, the agency recommends keeping your cat indoors during the hottest time of the day, from around 11am until 3pm.You can even invest in a suncream designed specifically for pets to provide them with adequate protection from the sun\u2019s rays.Having your cat\u2019s fur trimmed could also be a good course of action in order to make them feel more comfortable in the heat.Furthermore, if you think that your cat may be feeling overheated, you can use a damp towel to cool them down.Just like with any other animal, cats shouldn\u2019t be left in cars during a heatwave.Hamsters (Getty Images/iStockphoto)If you normally keep your hamster in a glass or plastic crate, you should be aware that the interior may be hotter than the average room temperature.This is important to keep in mind when considering where their crate is placed, as putting it on a window sill where it\u2019s exposed to the sun could put your hamster at risk of overheating.Hamster blog site Hammysworld also suggests placing the crate on a stone or tiled floor during the day if possible in order to help the animals remain cool and comfortable.You could even place a ceramic tile within the cage as a means of lowering the temperature of the interior even more.Another trick that the outlet recommends is to place a frozen bottle of water on the side of the outside of the crate while also regularly refreshing your pet\u2019s water supply.Fish (Getty Images/iStockphoto)You may think that your fish is safe in their tank of water as those outside battle the intense heat and humidity.However, the temperature of the tank can easily rise if the room temperature is higher than normal.If you have heaters in your fish tank, it would be wise to turn them off, Tropical Fish Site recommends, while it may also be worth reducing the normal temperature of the tank if possible.Another method that you can employ to help keep the water cool is to put bags filled with ice at the bottom of the tank.Birds (Getty Images)While birds living in exotic locations around the world may be used to hotter climates, chances are that domesticated birds won\u2019t have the same thresholds for higher temperatures.According to Bird Supplies, birds may be very susceptible to sudden changes in their environment, which is why knowing how to keep them cool during a heatwave is important.\u201cYour average bird has a standard core temperature of around 105F or 40C, and are very susceptible to overheating,\u201d the site states.Some signs to look out for that may indicate that your bird is overheating include if its panting, holding its wings far away from its body or exhibiting anxious behaviour.Many birds naturally enjoy spending time outdoors. However, if this is the case, you should make sure that the outdoor space that your bird frequents is equipped with shaded areas.On top of that, the site states that you should make sure to replace the bathing dish of water at the bottom of your bird\u2019s cage at least once a day, while also ensuring that it has a decent supply of clean water to drink.Reptiles and amphibians (Getty Images)Reptiles and amphibians are ectothermic or cold-blooded, which means that their body temperature relies on external sources, as detailed by Encyclopaedia Britannica. With that in mind, if the temperature of your home is higher than normal, then your pet snake or lizard could suffer in the hot conditions.Pet store Just For Pets advises first checking whether the temperature of your home falls within your animal\u2019s ideal range. If the temperature exceeds its ideal range, then you can cool them down by providing them with clean water and keeping a small fan close by.Furthermore, you could utilise a similar technique to the one advised for hamster owners by placing a ceramic tile in its enclosure that it can use to lower its body temperature (that you could cool first in the fridge).Plus, if you place an iced bottle of water nearby, it could help reduce the temperature of the air, thus providing your pet with a more bearable environment."}, {"_id": "64b9405e51ac331da6c7c0fb", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/tan-sunscreen-shade-uv-protection-b2374810.html", "primaryCategory": "Lifestyle", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Do you still tan when wearing sunscreen and when you sit in the shade?", "lead": "<p>You should always wear sunscreen when outside to protect from harmful UV radiation\u00a0</p>", "author": "Chelsea Ritschel", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 13:54:06", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:10:38.904598", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-20T13:54:06+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/06/27/14/istock-815654798.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Stay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletterStay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Once the rays penetrate to the lower layers of the epidermis, cells begin to produce melanin.Melanin is a group of natural pigments found in the body. In addition to pigmenting our hair and eyes, it is also responsible for tanning skin exposed to sunlight or UVA radiation, according to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). RecommendedHow much sunscreen should you use and how often do you need to apply it?Does sunscreen expire, what does SPF mean and which type is best?The pigment is also what protects the skin from getting burned \u2013 people with cells that produce more melanin typically don\u2019t burn as quickly, if at all.For people with fair or light skin, less melanin is produced \u2013 meaning the skin is not protected from UVB rays, the rays that cause burns. With light-skinned people, any tanning that will occur usually happens quickly or within minutes - with the risk of burning much more likely. Those with more melanin in their skin take typically longer to develop a tan and can usually spend hours in the sun without burning. Some people tan faster than othersHowever, the amount of time spent in the sun before developing a tan or a burn is all dependent on each individual person\u2019s pigmentation.While outside, it is important to know your skin type and wear the SPF factor sunscreen that will provide the correct amount of protection for you.Is tanning ever safe?Tanning increases the risk of skin cancer \u2013 and studies conclude that tanning is never healthy.RecommendedHow much sunscreen you need to apply, according to dermatologistsAccording to skincancer.org, different skin types are at different risks of sun damage.Damage occurs when the ultraviolet light damages the skin\u2019s cellular DNA \u2013 creating genetic mutations.Light-skinned people have a higher risk of damage associated with tanning because of the lack of melanin to protect the skin from the sun.However, people with darker skin are also at risk.Do you still tan when wearing sunscreen?Sunscreen protects the skin from the harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun \u2013 prolonging the time a person can spend outside without getting burnt.The higher the SPF, the more protection a sunscreen offers \u2013 with SPF 50 filtering 98 per cent of UV rays.There is no sunscreen that can protect skin 100 per cent from UV rays.SPF\u00a050 offers the highest sun protection You can, however, tan while wearing sunscreen.According to ABC Australia, if your unprotected skin would take 10 minutes to show signs of burning, properly applying SPF 50 sunscreen would extend this rate by 50 times.Sunscreen only extends the length of time until burning takes place, it does not impact how deeply a person will tan or how long it will take to show a tan.Is it possible to tan in the shade and how do you protect your skin from the sun?According to skincancer.org, \u201cpeople can spend long hours in the shade while still receiving quite a lot of sun exposure and risking sun damage\u201d and shade alone can rarely provide full UV protection.Burns are also possible as UVB rays can reach the skin indirectly.Even if you are in the shade or under an umbrella, wearing sunscreen is necessary to protect skin from the sun.In reality, a combination of multiple sun protection measures is typically needed to provide \u201coptimal protection,\u201d according to a study published in US National Library of Medicine journal. To increase protection, clothing that covers your skin, hats, sunglasses and shade are all important factors.This article was originally published in June 2018."}, {"_id": "64b9405f51ac331da6c7c0fc", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/sunscreen-expiration-date-spf-heatwave-b2374796.html", "primaryCategory": "Lifestyle", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Does sunscreen expire, what does SPF mean and which type is best?", "lead": "<p>Keep your skin protected while in the sun </p>", "author": "Sabrina Barr", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 13:53:57", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:10:39.185999", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-20T13:53:57+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/07/25/15/suncream.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Stay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletterStay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeWhen spending time outdoors in the sun, it's essential that you have a constant supply of sunscreen at hand, so that you're ready to top up your sun protection on a regular basis.However, with so many different types of sunscreen on the market, it can be difficult to decipher which are actually providing your skin with an adequate degree of protection.Here's everything you need to know about sunscreen, from knowing which brands will protect you in the water to understanding the difference between UVA and UVB rays:What are UVA and UVB rays?UV (ultraviolet) rays are a form of electromagnetic radiation which comes from the sun, the American Cancer Society explains.RecommendedShould I keep my windows closed or open in hot weather?The truth about applying after-sun on sunburnt skin, according to the expertsHow to check if you have skin cancer14 best sunscreens for sensitive skin to protect you from the raysThere are three forms of UV rays \u2013 UVA, UVB and UVC.UVA rays emit the least amount of energy of the three types of UV rays, causing the skin to age and potentially leading to some skin damage.UVB rays emit more energy than UVA rays, and can cause direct damage to DNA in the skin cells, resulting in sunburn. \n\nUK heatwave rolls in as temperatures soarShow all 441/44UK heatwave rolls in as temperatures soar\n\nUK heatwave rolls in as temperatures soarBournemouthHundreds of people at the beach in Bournemouth, as the UK could encounter the hottest July day on recordPAUK heatwave rolls in as temperatures soarManchesterHamza and Haris splash in the water feature beside the National Football MuseumPAUK heatwave rolls in as temperatures soarDerbyshirePeople play in the water at Hathersage Outdoor Swimming PoolPAUK heatwave rolls in as temperatures soarWhitley BaySunrise at St Mary's LighthousePAUK heatwave rolls in as temperatures soarMargateFamilies fish for crabs from a sea wall Getty ImagesUK heatwave rolls in as temperatures soarSurreyPeople leap from a bridge at Taggs Island, near Hampton CourtPAUK heatwave rolls in as temperatures soarLondonIreland's players in a drinks break during the second day of the test match against England at Lord'sAPUK heatwave rolls in as temperatures soarLondonPeople sunbathe in Hyde ParkPAUK heatwave rolls in as temperatures soarManchesterPeople splash in the fountains in Piccadilly GardensPAUK heatwave rolls in as temperatures soarMargateFamilies make their way to the beachGetty ImagesUK heatwave rolls in as temperatures soarCambridgePeople use umbrellas to shield from the sun as they punt along on the River CamPAUK heatwave rolls in as temperatures soarBrightonPeople enjoy the hot weather on the beachPAUK heatwave rolls in as temperatures soarLondonEngland's Jack Leach cools down with a towel in a drinks breakAPUK heatwave rolls in as temperatures soarMargateGetty ImagesUK heatwave rolls in as temperatures soarNorthumberlandKadie Lane, 10, cools off in the fountain at Alnwick Gardens.

The higher the SPF number, the stronger the protection you'll have.SPF provides you with an insight into how much longer it will take for your skin to turn red in response to UVB rays in comparison to if you weren't using any protection at all.Therefore, if you would normally start burning within 30 minutes without sun protection, then a sunscreen with SPF 30 would theoretically provide you with 30 times more protection, which equates to 15 hours of protection.NHS recommends using suncream with minimum SPF 30 (Getty Images/iStockphoto)However, this relative measure does not mean that you should go 15 hours without reapplying sunscreen, as sunscreen can come off by being dried by the sun or coming into contact with water.\u201cNo sunscreen, regardless of strength, should be expected to stay effective longer than two hours without reapplication,\u201d states the Skin Cancer Foundation.The NHS recommends reapplying sunscreen at least every two hours, suggesting that children and adults use a sunscreen with a minimum SPF of 30.How much sunscreen should you apply?The NHS warns that if sunscreen is applied too thinly, then the amount of protection that it is able to provide will decrease.According to the NHS, adults should use approximately two teaspoons of sunscreen if they're exposing their head, arms and neck to the sun.However, if they're wearing a swimsuit, adults should aim to use two tablespoons of sunscreen.Adults in the care of children should make sure that any area of skin that is exposed to the sun is covered in sunscreen.Different types of sunscreenSome sunscreens claim to only be necessary for use once a day, while others state that they are water resistant.Here's everything you need to know about the various forms you can find:Once-a-day sunscreenAccording to research conducted by Which?, sunscreens which claim to only require application once a day do not provide a sufficient amount of protection.Therefore, consumers are advised to not rely on a sunscreen which states that it only needs to be applied once a day.Applying suncream once a day is not recommended (Getty Images)Water-resistant sunscreenWater-resistant sunscreen is especially ideal for those spending time in the pool or sea this summer to cool down.It does exactly what it says on the bottle \u2013 provide you with sun protection while you're in the water.However, you must not assume that this protection will continue when you're out of the water.Even if you're using a water-resistant suncream, you should still reapply once you're back on dry land.Sunscreen with insect repellantWhile sunscreen which contains insect repellant may sound appealing to those who want to ward off any pestering bugs, it may not be advisable.The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends using sunscreen separately to insect repellant.\n\n20 swimsuits and bikinis to buy for your summer holidayShow all 211/2120 swimsuits and bikinis to buy

that limited studies have shown that when insect repellant products containing DEET (diethyltoluamide) have been applied over suncream, this can reduce a sunscreen's SPF by a third.It is therefore recommended to apply sunscreen first before then using a separate insect repellant.Facial sunscreen\u200bSkincare brand La Roche Posay explains that facial sunscreens are made to feel \u201dcomfortable to wear\u201d on the face, with \u201dtextures that are lighter and more easily-absorbed than suncreams for the body\u201d.The company outlines how facial suncreams are designed to not feel greasy, to not clog the face's pores and can be catered for specific skin types, such as for individuals with dry or oily skin.Sunscreen for babies and childrenThe Skin Cancer Foundation recommends keeping children aged under six months out of direct sunlight, with this guidance most important during the hours of 10am and 4pm.Once they are six months old, the foundation encourages parents to use a broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen that offers a minimum sun protection factor (SPF) of 15 and to apply 30 minutes before going outside and then again every two hours.Sunscreen shelf lifeThe majority of sunscreens have a shelf life of between two and three years.So, if you haven\u2019t recently purchased a new sunscreen, it is wise to do so instead of relying on bottles that may have expired. If you don\u2019t know whether a sunscreen is expired, you can examine the formula to see if the texture or smell has changed, which can be useful indicators of expiration.It is important to dispose of expired sunscreen products as they are no longer be effective and, as a result, can lead to burns."}, {"_id": "64b9405f51ac331da6c7c0fd", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/unveil-exciting-xbox-all-access-experiences-at-game-b2350474.html", "primaryCategory": "Lifestyle", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Unveil Exciting Xbox All Access Experiences at GAME", "lead": "<p>Customers can pick up a brand new Xbox Series X or S from \u00a320.99 a month which includes Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</p><p></p>", "author": "", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 13:29:41", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:10:39.391581", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-20T13:29:41+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/02/16/SHOT_01.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For those looking to leap into the next generation of gaming, 2023 promises to be a big year for new releases. That\u2019s why it\u2019s the ideal time to pick up a new Xbox console to make the most of what those new titles have to offer.But investing in a new gaming device can be a costly endeavour, having to pay upfront for a console before any new games can be factored into that equation means that it can get prohibitively expensive.But picking up a new Xbox no longer has to be a daunting purchase, as customers can spread the cost through Xbox All Access at GAME.Xbox All Access allows new players to pick up either an Xbox Series X (\u00a3449.99, Game.co.uk) or an Xbox Series S (\u00a3249.99, Game.co.uk) from \u00a320.99 a month over 24 months, with zero per cent APR, no upfront cost and no additional cost compared to purchasing equivalent products outright.Not only that, it also includes a Game Pass Ultimate subscription (worth \u00a310.99 a month) for the duration of the 24 months period, Game.co.uk. Xbox Game Pass works much like a typical subscription service but instead of streaming films and shows, it allows players to play over 100 titles ranging from reimagined classics such as Halo: The Master Chief Collection to popular new releases like Minecraft Legends that the whole family can enjoy, all at no extra cost.Other Microsoft-exclusive titles, such as Forza Horizon 5 and the upcoming sci-fi role-playing game Starfield, are also regularly added to the service as soon as they are released, meaning that there\u2019s always new titles to play on a monthly basis. Those games aren\u2019t limited to your new Xbox either. Select titles can also be played across PC, console, mobile and tablet devices as well.So which console is right for you?

According to\u00a0Powerball, final ticket sales pushed the jackpot beyond its earlier estimate of $1 billion to $1.08 billion at the time of the drawing, making it the third largest Powerball jackpot and sixth largest US lottery jackpot ever won.\u00a0The winner will have the choice between an annuitized prize of $1.08 billion or a lump sum payment of $558.1 million.Whether it\u2019s $1 billion or $1.08 billion, that\u2019s still a life-changing amount of money. And a previous lottery winner has revealed that there are some things that do not change when you win millions of dollars.According to Timothy Schultz, a podcast host and YouTuber from Iowa who won a $29m Powerball jackpot in 1999 and who spoke to Fox News in November, there is no denying that winning the lottery is \u201cone of the most potentially life-altering things that can happen\u201d.RecommendedWhat to do if you win the lottery, according to expertsIs there a way to pick the best Powerball numbers as jackpot reaches $1.9bn?Q&A: A look at $1.9B Powerball jackpot, how it grew so large\u201cOne minute you have one life,\u201d and the next \u201cyour world is turned on its head,\u201d he said.However, according to Schultz, who uses his podcast to interview other lottery winners, while the \u201ceuphoria is real,\u201d it eventually \u201csubsides,\u201d at which point he said you realise \u201cmoney doesn\u2019t change who you are as a person\u201d.\u201cIf you were unhappy before, you might be unhappy after,\u201d he claimed. \u201cThere are some very wealthy people in the world who are extremely unhappy. Money can be positive, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily fix all problems.\u201dSchultz, who acknowledged that the money can help with things like financial stress, then shared some of the downsides he experienced after winning the lottery, with the former gas station revealing that he has found it \u201cmuch more difficult\u201d to trust people after he won $29m.\u201cMost people were supportive and happy for me, but I did receive stacks of letters from people asking for money,\u201d he revealed, adding that it was difficult for him to trust \u201cnew people\u201d because he worried they wanted him for \u201cthe wrong reasons\u201d.He added: \u201cIt felt like some people viewed me as a walking, talking ATM machine.\u201dSchultz also acknowledged that there are things that even millions of dollars can\u2019t fix, such as one\u2019s health. \u201cMoney can\u2019t fix everything,\u201d he said. \u201cOur health should not ever be taken for granted. Money can certainly help, but it can\u2019t fix everything.\u201dAs for what does change when one wins the lottery, the YouTuber said that, while every winner is different, he has recognised \u201ccommon themes\u201d when interviewing fellow lottery winners.According to Schultz, one of the most common changes is the impact winning has on one\u2019s personality, as he claimed that \u201cwinning the lottery can magnify personalities\u201d.\u201cFor example, if you are into the church, you may decide to build one,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re into movies, you may decide to produce a film.

According to\u00a0Powerball, final ticket sales pushed the jackpot beyond its earlier estimate of $1 billion to $1.08 billion at the time of the drawing, making it the third largest Powerball jackpot and sixth largest US lottery jackpot ever won.\u00a0The winner will have the choice between an annuitized prize of $1.08 billion or a lump sum payment of $558.1 million.Powerball is played in 45 states across the US, as well as Washington DC, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands. While the winner of the Powerball jackpot has not yet been revealed, many people are wondering whether tourists or non-US citizens are allowed to play the lottery too.According to the Powerball website, players do not have to be US citizens or residents to play the lottery.RecommendedPowerball jackpot reaches $1bn after no winner in latest drawingIs there a way to pick the best Powerball numbers as jackpot reaches $1bn?What to do if you win the lottery, according to expertsThe lottery is open to all players over the age of 18, regardless of their citizenship status. In order to play, those who live in jurisdictions where Powerball tickets are not sold must purchase a lottery ticket from a licensed or authorised retailer \u2013 typically at convenience stores, gas stations, or food markets.When a non-US citizen buys a lottery ticket, they will need to show proof of identity with an official identification document issued by their country of origin, such as a passport or other form of valid ID, to verify their age.The odds of winning the Powerball jackpot are one in 292.2 million. However, if one lucky foreigner or tourist were to beat those odds, they may be subjected to various taxes on their prize winnings.Federal and jurisdictional income taxes apply to both the cash lump sum and the annuity payment option. For starters, the IRS requires a mandatory 24 per cent withholding for winnings of $5,000 or more.On top of that, winners must also give up an additional federal income tax. For example, if a winner opts for the cash lump sum payment, they would be subjected to a federal income tax at the top tax rate, which is 37 per cent. That means, after 24 per cent is taken from the IRS, another 13 per cent would be taken for federal income tax.An additional tax could come from the state, depending on where the Powerball winner lives. State tax rates can range from about three per cent to 11 per cent, while some states don\u2019t tax lottery winnings at all.RecommendedIs there a way to pick the best Powerball numbers?Powerball jackpot reaches $1bn for third time everFormer lottery winner reveals what doesn\u2019t change after you win millionsIf a tourist or non-US citizen were to win the Powerball, they would face the same tax implications as an American citizen.

That\u2019s before there\u2019s any mention of the amount of waste each used cartridge can amount to.That\u2019s where the Epson EcoTank ET-2820 All-in-One Wireless Inkjet Printer (Was \u00a3209.99, now \u00a3179.99, Currys.co.uk) comes in. Featuring Epson\u2019s EcoTank technology, The et-2820 replaces proprietary plastic cartridges with refillable ink tanks that can have a serious saving on your printing costs while still being able to print, all without the added hassle of cartridge reloads.Save up to 90 per cent on your printing costsRefilling printer ink can be a fiddly and messy process, not to mention the added difficulty of where to responsibly dispose used cartridges once they have been depleted. EcoTank technology means that each tank can be individually topped up from a bottle, which not only saves on the amount of plastic used per refill but also significantly reduces the cost of ink. It\u2019s no small bonus that as an inkjet, EcoTank has a positive impact on your energy bills as well, particularly compared to more energy-intensive laser printers.Each printer comes bundled with four refillable bottles \u2013 one for each tank \u2013 which provides up to three years worth of printing, or 7,500 colour pages to be more precise. Ink levels are also clearly displayed in transparent containers at the front of the printer, so there\u2019s no need for second guessing when the ink might run dry midway through a printing job.When you do eventually make it through each bottle, they can simply be disposed of with household recycling, so there\u2019s no need to plan a trip to your local recycling point or feel a pang of guilt for throwing it out with your household waste.No more messy cartridges (Currys)The \u201cjust fill and chill\u201d mentality, courtesy of none other than Usain Bolt, Epson\u2019s brand ambassador, is central to the EcoTank experience that places convenience and affordability at its centre, while still able to print up to ten pages per minute.It\u2019s why the ET-2820 is designed with the busy household in mind. Whether that\u2019s transferring documents from your hybrid office or printing off homework assignments, its all-in-one scanning, printing and copying capabilities make it well suited to a variety of different tasks all around the home, from the comfort of your smart device or the printer\u2019s 3.7cm LCD display.The Epson Smart Panel app enables you to control your printer with great ease. You can print, copy and scan documents and photos, set up, monitor and troubleshoot your printer, and let the creativity flow with a range of artistic templates to choose from.

One lucky ticket sold at Las Palmitas Mini Market in Los Angeles was the only ticket across the country to match all 6 numbers in the July 19 #Powerball\u202fdraw, winning the $1 Billion Powerball jackpot.\u201dAn additional seven tickets matched five of the numbers \u2013 which means that these ticket holders will also win a prize of $448,750 each.According to Powerball, final ticket sales pushed the jackpot beyond its earlier estimate of $1 billion to $1.08 billion at the time of the drawing, making it the third largest Powerball jackpot and sixth largest US lottery jackpot ever won.RecommendedPowerball jackpot reaches $1bn after no winner in latest drawingIs there a way to pick the best Powerball numbers as jackpot reaches $1bn?$252.6 million winning Powerball ticket sold in OhioThe lucky ticket holder will have the choice between the total $1.08 billion jackpot paid out over 30 years or a lump sum payment of $558.1 million. While the winner of the billion-dollar Powerball jackpot has not been revealed, experts agree that there are a few things each lottery winner should consider before making any decisions at all.Make copies of your ticket and hold off signing itIf you manage to beat the odds and find yourself with the winning Powerball jackpot ticket, the first thing you should do, according to experts, is make multiple copies and take photos of the ticket.\u201cI would take a selfie with it,\u201d Robert Pagliarini of Pacifica Wealth Advisors previously told Today. \u201cI would take a video of the ticket and me smiling.\u201dAs for whether you should sign the back of your ticket, many experts agree that you should hold off, as it may interfere with your ability to stay anonymous.\u201cIf a client comes to me, and they have a ticket that\u2019s unsigned on the back, I can really paint whatever picture they want and keep them anonymous all the way through the process,\u201d attorney Kurt Panouses told Fox13. \u201cSo that\u2019s really what my recommendation is, is to not sign the back of the ticket, just make a good copy of the back of the ticket, put it in a safe place.\u201dThe same advice is also given by insurance company State Farm, which notes that you shouldn\u2019t sign your ticket because \u201cin some cases, signing your ticket might prevent you from creating a blind trust later\u201d.Try to keep from sharing the newsWhile a life-changing lottery win is easily going to become one of the most exciting things to happen in one\u2019s life, experts also advise against sharing the news publicly.\u201cOther than a spouse or life partner, I wouldn\u2019t tell anyone about your good fortune until after you\u2019ve created a solid plan with the professionals,\u201d Laura Adams, author of Money Girl\u2019s Smart Moves to Grow Rich, told Today. \u201cWell-meaning friends and family may not offer you the best financial advice.\u201dState Farm also advises against sharing the information with anyone. \u201cSome lotteries will require you to make your name public, give interviews or show up at a press conference. If so, be sure to change your phone number and set up a new PO box beforehand to avoid being inundated with requests,\u201d the company advises. \u201cYou may also consider forming a blind trust through your attorney to anonymously receive the money, keeping your name out of the spotlight.\u201dConsult a financial advisor, lawyer and accountantAfter making multiple copies and placing a winning ticket in a secure place, perhaps the most important thing for lottery winners to do is form a team of trusted advisors, made up of financial advisors, lawyers and accountants.\u201cYou\u2019re going to need a lawyer, accountant and financial advisor who have experience with large financial windfalls - finding them should be one of your first steps before you claim your money,\u201d State Farm says.According to experts, winners should seek help from financial experts regarding their choices when it comes to their prize money, as Powerball notes that the jackpot winnings can be paid out either as a discounted lump sum payment or an annuity over 29 years or 30 payments.\u201cLong-term investments take financial wisdom and restraint, but with careful planning, you may be able to grow your lump-sum winnings larger than the future annuity payments would have been. However, if you need some structural help to keep from overspending too quickly, an annual payout is a solid, responsible way to make sure you\u2019ll continue to have income through most of your adult life,\u201d State Farm notes.Financial advisors can also advise about taxes and help winners plan their big picture goals for their newfound wealth, while lawyers can advise winners on their rights when it comes to remaining anonymous.Create a budget and refrain from handing out cash to loved onesWhile it may sound appealing to start spending millions of dollars on vacations or luxury homes, the best thing that lottery winners can do is create a budget.\u201cRealise it\u2019s not a bottomless pit of money. Don\u2019t spend wildly in the belief that it\u2019ll last forever,\u201d Edelman told Today. \u201cA financial adviser can tell you how much income you can receive monthly from your winnings - you need to live on that amount or less.\u201dHowever, that doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t splurge, as Erica Sandberg, personal finance expert and author of Expecting Money: the Essential Financial Plan for New and Growing Families, told the outlet that it\u2019s all about \u201cbalance\u201d.\u201cSet a budget, but also allow yourself those dream purchases. It\u2019s a balance,\u201d she said.The reminder is especially important considering \u201clottery winners are more likely to declare bankruptcy within three to five years than the average American,\u201d according to CNBC.RecommendedPowerball: Can a non-US citizen win the lottery?Is there a way to pick the best Powerball numbers?Powerball jackpot reaches $1bn for third time everIn addition to a budget, lottery winners should also avoid lending money to loved ones, or anyone who comes seeking it, as William R Patterson, chairman and CEO of the Baron Solution Group, told Today this is \u201cone of the fastest ways to lose your money\u201d.\u201cDon\u2019t feel obligated to bail out, reward, loan or give out lumps sums of cash to friends and family members,\u201d he said. \u201cTalk with your financial advisers about strategies and vehicles, such as trusts, that can allow you to help others and also preserve your wealth. Additionally, cash and other gifts can have significant tax consequences.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b9406051ac331da6c7c102", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/powerball-numbers-drawing-win-b2377379.html", "primaryCategory": "Lifestyle", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Is there a way to pick the best Powerball numbers?", "lead": "<p>The $1bn Powerball jackpot found a lucky winner in California </p>", "author": "Meredith Clark", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 13:19:44", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:10:40.648138", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-20T13:19:44+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/13/12/Lottery_Jackpot_59366.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Stay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletterStay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

To play Powerball, hopefuls must pick five numbers between 1 and 69 and then choose one Powerball number between 1 and 26. The first five numbers drawn appear on the white balls, while the Powerball number is shown using a red ball. If a player has a ticket that matches all of the five winning numbers plus the Powerball number, then they win the jackpot.While there\u2019s no determining exactly what the lucky numbers will be at the next drawing, as it all comes down to random chance, it doesn\u2019t stop players from relying on a number of tricks and estimations. One strategy players are known to rely on when it comes to picking Powerball numbers is choosing the lottery\u2019s most commonly drawn numbers. According to Lotto Numbers, which tracks Powerball statistics over time, these are the most common white ball numbers that have been drawn from 2015 to 2023.RecommendedPowerball jackpot reaches $1bn after no winner in latest drawingStores see increase in ticket sales ahead of estimated $900 million Powerball jackpotWinner of record-breaking $2bn Powerball jackpot buys $25m California mansionThe number 61 has been pulled 89 times throughout the past 912 Powerball drawings, the most recent time being 3 July. Next on the list of most common white ball numbers is 32, with a total of 86 times. Twenty-one, 36, 23, 63, 69, 39, 62, 59, 64, 37, 28, 33, 20, 47, 53, and 3 are also very common.Out of the Powerball numbers \u2013 those displayed on the red ball \u2013 the most popular winning number is 18 with a total of 48 times, as recently as three days ago.As for the least common numbers pulled, the least common white ball numbers have been 13, 34, 49, 26, 25, 4, 29, 46, 35, 60, 51, 65, 48, 7, 24, 43, 5, and 1. For the Powerball drawing, the least common winning red ball number is 15.However, it is important to remember there is no difference between picking the numbers most chosen or relying on random numbers, as it all comes down to chance.\u201cYou\u2019re not really going to learn anything about what the likely picked numbers are going to be based on the previous picks, because they\u2019re all done completely at random,\u201d Dr Mark Glickman, Senior Lecturer on Statistics at Harvard University, told The Independent. \u201cThe information in previous drawings doesn\u2019t give you any information about the likelihood of picking numbers on any given day.\u201dAlthough, Derek Smith, professor of mathematics at Lafayette College, told The Independent that there are some strategies to help avoid splitting the jackpot with other players. \u201cNothing can improve the odds that you will win the jackpot each time you play,\u201d Professor Smith said. \u201cThat said, if by some great ridiculous luck your numbers do match the numbers drawn, you\u2019ll have to split the jackpot if other folks picked the same set of numbers.\u201dPlayers often choose numbers such as birthdays, ages of children, or anniversary dates for their lottery numbers, but experts warn against using this strategy because it limits the number range between one and 31. \u201cIf you do play, you might try to choose sets of numbers that reduce your chances of matching others\u2019 picks,\u201d Professor Smith added.RecommendedPowerball: Can a non-US citizen win the lottery?Powerball jackpot reaches $1bn for third time everFormer lottery winner reveals what doesn\u2019t change after you win millionsThis is only the third time the Powerball jackpot has reached over $1 billion in its 30-year history, according to the lottery website.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeDoes very hot weather leave you feeling more exhausted and lethargic than usual? There might be an initial surge of joy when the sun finally comes out \u2013 but once temperatures really creep up, we can end up feeling physically drained, wondering whether we should follow the Mediterranean\u2019s lead and start introducing daily siestas.So, why does hot weather make us so tired? We asked a doctor to explain\u2026Our bodies have to work harder in the heat\u201cWhen the weather is hot, our bodies have to work harder to cool themselves down,\u201d says Dr Zulqarnain Shah, medical director at SSP Health and GP at SSP Health practice Colne Road Surgery.\u201cThe body\u2019s natural cooling mechanism involves increasing blood circulation near the skin\u2019s surface and promoting sweat production. These physiological changes can lead to fatigue and a feeling of lethargy. It is essential to recognise that this fatigue is a normal response to heat and is typically temporary.\u201dRecommendedAirbnb customer furious after being charged extra over dog hairPeople seek hay fever advice once every three seconds, says NHS EnglandWhy is my hay fever so bad at the moment?DehydrationLow energy and tiredness are also common when you\u2019re lacking hydration.\u201cHot weather increases the rate of fluid loss through sweating, leading to dehydration. Dehydration can contribute to fatigue and make you feel even more lethargic,\u201d adds Dr Shah.\u201cTo avoid this, it\u2019s important to stay adequately hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids, especially water. Aim to drink even when you\u2019re not feeling thirsty, as thirst is not always an accurate indicator of dehydration.\u201dHeat exhaustion\u00a0\u201cProlonged exposure to heat can result in heat exhaustion, a condition characterised by symptoms such as heavy sweating, weakness, dizziness, nausea, headache, and muscle cramps. If you experience these warning signs, it\u2019s crucial to move to a cooler environment, drink fluids, and rest. If symptoms persist or worsen, seek medical attention promptly,\u201d says Shah.It\u2019s important to pay attention to warning signs, as if heat stroke develops, this is a medical emergency. Shah stresses: \u201cHeat stroke is a severe and potentially life-threatening condition that requires immediate medical intervention. It occurs when the body\u2019s temperature regulation fails, and the core temperature rises dangerously high.\u201cSymptoms may include a high body temperature (above 39.4C), altered mental state, confusion, rapid breathing, rapid heartbeat, and even loss of consciousness. If you suspect heat stroke, call emergency services immediately.\u201dSleep deprivationThe extra tiredness could also be linked to poor sleep, as this can really suffer in the heat.\u201cHot temperatures can disrupt sleep and lead to poor sleep quality. The body needs to cool down to initiate sleep, and the excessive heat can make it difficult to reach the optimal sleep temperature,\u201d explains Shah. \u201cTo improve sleep in hot weather, consider using fans or air conditioning, wearing lightweight and breathable sleepwear, keeping your bedroom well-ventilated, and using lighter bedding.\u201dPre-existing conditions could get worseMany people living with chronic or long-term health conditions deal with fatigue, which may flare up during heatwaves.RecommendedHow to tell if you have Covid or heatstrokeWhy do heatwaves in the UK feel hotter than abroad?\u201cHot weather can exacerbate symptoms and increase fatigue in individuals with certain chronic health conditions. Conditions such as heart disease, kidney problems, and respiratory issues can be particularly sensitive to heat,\u201d notes Shah.\u201cIt\u2019s vital to be aware of your specific health condition and consult with your healthcare provider for personalised advice on managing your symptoms during hot weather. They may recommend staying in cooler environments, adjusting medications, or monitoring your fluid intake more closely.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b9406151ac331da6c7c104", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/hot-weather-july-tired-why-heatwave-b2378875.html", "primaryCategory": "Health &amp; Families", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Why do we get so tired in hot weather?", "lead": "<p>A doctor explains why our bodies can get exhausted in hot weather</p>", "author": "Abi Jackson", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 12:36:17", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:10:41.166361", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-20T12:36:17+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/16/08/14095058-9ed99744-f391-40f2-ae7b-2a258b55d625.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Stay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletterStay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

We asked a doctor to explain\u2026Our bodies have to work harder in the heat\u201cWhen the weather is hot, our bodies have to work harder to cool themselves down,\u201d says Dr Zulqarnain Shah, medical director at SSP Health and GP at SSP Health practice Colne Road Surgery.\u201cThe body\u2019s natural cooling mechanism involves increasing blood circulation near the skin\u2019s surface and promoting sweat production. These physiological changes can lead to fatigue and a feeling of lethargy. It is essential to recognise that this fatigue is a normal response to heat and is typically temporary.\u201dRecommendedAirbnb customer furious after being charged extra over dog hairPeople seek hay fever advice once every three seconds, says NHS EnglandWhy is my hay fever so bad at the moment?DehydrationLow energy and tiredness are also common when you\u2019re lacking hydration.\u201cHot weather increases the rate of fluid loss through sweating, leading to dehydration. Dehydration can contribute to fatigue and make you feel even more lethargic,\u201d adds Dr Shah.\u201cTo avoid this, it\u2019s important to stay adequately hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids, especially water. Aim to drink even when you\u2019re not feeling thirsty, as thirst is not always an accurate indicator of dehydration.\u201dHeat exhaustion\u00a0\u201cProlonged exposure to heat can result in heat exhaustion, a condition characterised by symptoms such as heavy sweating, weakness, dizziness, nausea, headache, and muscle cramps. If you experience these warning signs, it\u2019s crucial to move to a cooler environment, drink fluids, and rest. If symptoms persist or worsen, seek medical attention promptly,\u201d says Shah.It\u2019s important to pay attention to warning signs, as if heat stroke develops, this is a medical emergency. Shah stresses: \u201cHeat stroke is a severe and potentially life-threatening condition that requires immediate medical intervention. It occurs when the body\u2019s temperature regulation fails, and the core temperature rises dangerously high.\u201cSymptoms may include a high body temperature (above 39.4C), altered mental state, confusion, rapid breathing, rapid heartbeat, and even loss of consciousness. If you suspect heat stroke, call emergency services immediately.\u201dSleep deprivationThe extra tiredness could also be linked to poor sleep, as this can really suffer in the heat.\u201cHot temperatures can disrupt sleep and lead to poor sleep quality. The body needs to cool down to initiate sleep, and the excessive heat can make it difficult to reach the optimal sleep temperature,\u201d explains Shah. \u201cTo improve sleep in hot weather, consider using fans or air conditioning, wearing lightweight and breathable sleepwear, keeping your bedroom well-ventilated, and using lighter bedding.\u201dPre-existing conditions could get worseMany people living with chronic or long-term health conditions deal with fatigue, which may flare up during heatwaves.RecommendedHow to tell if you have Covid or heatstrokeWhy do heatwaves in the UK feel hotter than abroad?\u201cHot weather can exacerbate symptoms and increase fatigue in individuals with certain chronic health conditions. Conditions such as heart disease, kidney problems, and respiratory issues can be particularly sensitive to heat,\u201d notes Shah.\u201cIt\u2019s vital to be aware of your specific health condition and consult with your healthcare provider for personalised advice on managing your symptoms during hot weather. They may recommend staying in cooler environments, adjusting medications, or monitoring your fluid intake more closely.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b9406151ac331da6c7c105", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/glastonbury-tips-festival-hot-heatwave-b2363033.html", "primaryCategory": "Health &amp; Families", "subCategories": "test", "title": "6 hacks for handling the heatwave at a festival", "lead": "<p>Worried about the heat this festival season?

Fill a hot water bottle with iced water and place on the \u2018cooling points\u2019 of your body: knees, ankles, wrists, neck, groin and elbows. You can also fill a hot water bottle with cool water, freeze it and take it to bed with you.3. Moisturise before bed with an aloe vera based aftersun cream, ideally kept in the fridge.4. Fill an empty perfume bottle with chilled water and keep it by your bedside, spray on your face, back of your neck, and back of your knees to cool down.5. Use cotton pyjamas and thin, pure cotton sheets for your bed \u2013 high quality cotton is the ideal bedding material to sleep between to stay cool as it\u2019s most breathable. 6. Make sure you\u2019re not eating too much protein as this can actually heat your body up by boosting your metabolic rate, according to sleep expert Dave Gibson.7. Eat spicy food, but at least three hours before bed \u2013 it can make you sweat which cools the body down.8. Exercise in the morning rather than evening to stop your body from getting too hot. 9. Keep your evening shower tepid to lower your body temperature. Don\u2019t have a freezing cold one though, as your body will react to the sudden change in temperature by preserving heat. 10. Contrary to popular belief, Gibson says we should keep windows closed during the day to keep the house cooler. Keep the curtains closed too.11. Turn off all electrical devices in the bedroom as these emit heat. Switch off sockets too.12. Keep your feet cool, either by keeping them outside the covers or resting on an ice pack. 13. Put a roasting pan full of ice in front of a fan to cool the air.14. Drink water regularly during the day, but not too much at night. About \u00bd pint before bed will be enough to keep you hydrated and prevent you from having to get up and go to the loo.15. Sleep in a separate bed from your partner \u2013 two bodies = twice the body heat. 16. Sleep downstairs if you can as the heat rises.17. Sleep in cool, wet socks or even a damp T-shirt.18.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeLearning how to cope in the heat can be a struggle, with the beaming rays of the sun, the inescapable humidity and the ever-rising temperatures tough to handle for many.With this in mind, it\u2019s worth considering that domestic animals don\u2019t have the luxury of being able to say when they\u2019re feeling overheated or dehydrated, which is why you need to learn how to keep your pet as safe and healthy as possible during these extreme weather conditions.Whether you\u2019re a dog person or own a reptile, this is how to look after your pet properly as the heatwave runs its course.Dogs (Getty Images/iStockphoto)RecommendedHow to tell if you have Covid or heatstrokeWhy do heatwaves in the UK feel hotter than abroad?Dogs with long fur will likely fare worse than their shorter-haired peers during the summer.However, they are able to cool themselves down by panting and releasing heat through their paws, as animal charity Blue Cross explains. Dogs do this because they\u2019re unable to sweat through their skin in the same way as humans do.RecommendedWarning drivers could face \u00a35000 fine over summer driving errorUK weather: Met Office predicts how long rain will last before heatwave beginsJuly dates for DWP cost of living payments, benefits and pensionsIf a dog does overheat, they could be at risk of suffering from a serious heatstroke, with the charity explaining that \u201csigns of heatstroke in dogs include collapse, excessive panting and dribbling\u201d.\u201cIf you suspect your pet is suffering from the condition, move them to a cool place, preferably with a draught, wet their coat with cool - not freezing - water, and contact your vet immediately,\u201d the charity advises.Furthermore, leaving a dog in a car on a hot day can have devastating consequences, as the temperature within the car can soar to extreme levels at a rapid rate, which is why it\u2019s advised never to leave a dog in a car in hot conditions. To ensure that dogs are comfortable during walks on days with excessive heat, the RSPCA recommends only walking your dog in the morning or evening at the peak of summer, as doing so will help prevent them from burning their paws on the pavement or suffering from heatstroke.You must also make sure that your dog always has access to water.Cats (Getty Images/iStockphoto)Different types of cats may be more prone to sunburn than others, as pet agency Very Important Pets outlines. \u201cPale-coloured cats are vulnerable to sunburn; particularly on their ears, noses and sparsely haired areas,\u201d the agency states, adding that, \u201clike in humans, sunburn can sometimes lead to skin cancer.\u201dWhile many cat owners may let their feline friends roam at will, the agency recommends keeping your cat indoors during the hottest time of the day, from around 11am until 3pm.You can even invest in a suncream designed specifically for pets to provide them with adequate protection from the sun\u2019s rays.Having your cat\u2019s fur trimmed could also be a good course of action in order to make them feel more comfortable in the heat.Furthermore, if you think that your cat may be feeling overheated, you can use a damp towel to cool them down.Just like with any other animal, cats shouldn\u2019t be left in cars during a heatwave.Hamsters (Getty Images/iStockphoto)If you normally keep your hamster in a glass or plastic crate, you should be aware that the interior may be hotter than the average room temperature.This is important to keep in mind when considering where their crate is placed, as putting it on a window sill where it\u2019s exposed to the sun could put your hamster at risk of overheating.Hamster blog site Hammysworld also suggests placing the crate on a stone or tiled floor during the day if possible in order to help the animals remain cool and comfortable.You could even place a ceramic tile within the cage as a means of lowering the temperature of the interior even more.Another trick that the outlet recommends is to place a frozen bottle of water on the side of the outside of the crate while also regularly refreshing your pet\u2019s water supply.Fish (Getty Images/iStockphoto)You may think that your fish is safe in their tank of water as those outside battle the intense heat and humidity.However, the temperature of the tank can easily rise if the room temperature is higher than normal.If you have heaters in your fish tank, it would be wise to turn them off, Tropical Fish Site recommends, while it may also be worth reducing the normal temperature of the tank if possible.Another method that you can employ to help keep the water cool is to put bags filled with ice at the bottom of the tank.Birds (Getty Images)While birds living in exotic locations around the world may be used to hotter climates, chances are that domesticated birds won\u2019t have the same thresholds for higher temperatures.According to Bird Supplies, birds may be very susceptible to sudden changes in their environment, which is why knowing how to keep them cool during a heatwave is important.\u201cYour average bird has a standard core temperature of around 105F or 40C, and are very susceptible to overheating,\u201d the site states.Some signs to look out for that may indicate that your bird is overheating include if its panting, holding its wings far away from its body or exhibiting anxious behaviour.Many birds naturally enjoy spending time outdoors. However, if this is the case, you should make sure that the outdoor space that your bird frequents is equipped with shaded areas.On top of that, the site states that you should make sure to replace the bathing dish of water at the bottom of your bird\u2019s cage at least once a day, while also ensuring that it has a decent supply of clean water to drink.Reptiles and amphibians (Getty Images)Reptiles and amphibians are ectothermic or cold-blooded, which means that their body temperature relies on external sources, as detailed by Encyclopaedia Britannica. With that in mind, if the temperature of your home is higher than normal, then your pet snake or lizard could suffer in the hot conditions.Pet store Just For Pets advises first checking whether the temperature of your home falls within your animal\u2019s ideal range. If the temperature exceeds its ideal range, then you can cool them down by providing them with clean water and keeping a small fan close by.Furthermore, you could utilise a similar technique to the one advised for hamster owners by placing a ceramic tile in its enclosure that it can use to lower its body temperature (that you could cool first in the fridge).Plus, if you place an iced bottle of water nearby, it could help reduce the temperature of the air, thus providing your pet with a more bearable environment."}, {"_id": "64b9406251ac331da6c7c10a", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/love-sex/dolph-lundgren-marriage-emma-krokdal-b2378841.html", "primaryCategory": "Love &amp; Sex", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Dolph Lundgren, 65, marries personal trainer Emma Krokdal, 27", "lead": "<p>The \u2018Rocky IV\u2019 actor and fitness expert married in an intimate ceremony at their villa in Mykonos, Greece </p>", "author": "Ellie Muir", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 12:21:57", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:10:42.708412", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-20T12:21:57+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/20/13/newFile-1.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Stay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletterStay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeA chef who frequently posts recipes on social media has divided the internet over how to season chicken.Zoe Barrie, who has more than 500k followers on TikTok, shared a recipe for spatchcocked roast chicken on her platform earlier this week, which involved a dry brining method.She began her video by saying that one of the biggest lessons she learned in cooking school was that \u201cwith the proper amount of salt and time, chicken can taste delicious\u201d.Barrie\u2019s method was to heavily salt the raw chicken and leave it in the fridge overnight uncovered to \u201cdry it out\u201d. The next day, she removed the chicken from the fridge, patted the bird dry and added black pepper before starting to cook it.Once cooked, she covered the chicken in a \u201clemon chimichurri\u201d sauce, which included lemon, parsley, oregano, garlic, shallot, red wine vinegar, salt, and olive oil.RecommendedBye bye swimwear round, hello body positivity: How beauty pageants became less uglyPrince Harry and Meghan weren\u2019t allowed to fly Air Force One with Biden after Queen\u2019s funeral, report says\u2018Just awful\u2019: Man accused of \u2018selfish\u2019 behaviour after proposing to girlfriend at their graduationIn her video, Barrie acknowledged that she would \u201cget a lot of crap for saying\u201d that all her chicken needed was \u201csalt and time\u201d to taste good. Viewers quickly proved her right, with many demanding to know why she hadn\u2019t added seasoning aside from salt and pepper to the meat.\u201cAre they allergic to seasoning or something?\u201d one person wrote.Another said: \u201cSalt? That\u2019s it?\u201dOthers criticised Barrie for not \u201cwashing\u201d her chicken in her preparation, with some claiming it was unsanitary and a potential food hazard not to do so.\u201cI kept on waiting for the chicken to be washed,\u201d one commenter said, while another added: \u201cWash your chicken with lemon or vinegar please!\u201dWashing raw meat \u2013 including poultry, beef, pork, lamb or veal \u2013 before cooking is not recommended by the United States Department of Agriculture. The department warns that doing so may spread bacteria in raw meat and poultry juices to other cooking utensils and surfaces, and cause cross-contamination.Some viewers defended Barrie\u2019s method of salting the chicken and using the chimichurri to add flavour, rather than using powdered seasoning such as garlic or onion powder.\u201cY\u2019all, lemon zest, jalapeno, pepper, parsley, oregano, garlic, shallots\u2026 those are all seasonings.

Doing so helps result in a crispier skin.

But the truth is, while money can\u2019t guarantee contentment by any means, managing and understanding it can have a huge impact on many different areas of your life. From the freedom to pursue career and education goals or personal dreams, to allowing you to make key life changes and feel secure if things don\u2019t go to plan, financial security provides a foundation to build on and thrive from.Although we might not consider ourselves \u2018money people\u2019, be driven to earn a certain salary, or find the whole topic confusing, stressful or scary, money impacts almost every aspect of our lives, and it\u2019s vital \u2013 however big or small our bank balance \u2013 to engage with our financial situation, and develop healthy behaviours around it.Unfortunately, the cost of living crisis, combined with a number of gender-based issues is making the financial outlook for young women extremely tough. From bills and food prices reaching record highs, to ballooning rents and student loans setting up a life-time of debt, hundreds of thousands of young people are at the sharp end of a multi-pronged crisis.RecommendedFinance coach Ellie Austin-Williams: \u201cMoney is complex and emotional \u2013 that\u2019s why we need to talk about it\u201dThe Ripple Effect: AJ Odudu interviews inspiring women about their achievements, challenges and learningsIt\u2019s no wonder that a study by cross-party think tank Demos found that Britons aged 18 to 30 are worst affected by the cost of living crisis. The combination of high property prices and soaring rents means few young people can get on the property ladder: in 2021, UK renters spent an average of 23 per cent of their income on rent. Right now, circumstances feel insurmountable and hard to ignore \u2013 53 per cent of young people perceive their career prospects are worsening and although 72 per cent see the sense in saving, 47 per cent said they had too much debt, or couldn\u2019t pay the bills in the event of a financial shock.Financial inequality (Independent)Unsurprisingly, all this pressure is triggering a lot of financial difficulty and insecurity. In a 2022 survey, Young Women\u2019s Trust \u2013 a charity that campaigns for an equal world of work for young women \u2013 found that 29 per cent of young women are constantly in debt, while 52 per cent are \u2018filled with dread\u2019 when thinking about their household finances.As Claire Reindorp, CEO of Young Women\u2019s Trust, explains, the rising cost of living is having a disproportionate impact on young women as they earn less to begin with. \u201cFor too long young women have been paid less than young men \u2013 earning on average a fifth less each year. Not only do young women get paid less, but they also face barriers to employment such as inflexible working, costly childcare, and they often encounter workplace discrimination that prevents them from thriving in their careers.\u201d\u201cThis financial inequality which starts so early in working life sets off a spiralling effect \u2013 women earn less, so are more likely to be in debt, more likely to be stuck in poverty, more likely to be on benefits, and doing more childcare and other unpaid work. This gap accumulates over a lifetime, ending up in a pensions gap of around 35 per cent. In this context, it\u2019s even more important for young women to feel financially confident, yet sadly, even harder. All too often they are stuck in \u2018any job\u2019 \u2013 not a job that they enjoy or thrive in or that fulfils their potential \u2013 because of the need to make ends meet or because making a move might mean they lose out on important things like flexibility.\u201dThe Young Women\u2019s Trust report revealed that over a third of young women said they have taken on new debt in the last year, compared to only a quarter of young men. \u201cWith all this pressure, young women\u2019s mental health is suffering, as well as their confidence and self esteem, Reindorp reveals. \u201cThey tell us that they\u2019re missing out on seeing their friends because they simply cannot afford to eat or heat their homes.\u201dMany of those supported by Young Women\u2019s Trust have been hugely affected by the cost of living crisis, which has taken its toll on everything from their career and earning potential, to their living situation and their mental health. Amy, 29, a mental health advisor who lives in a remote town in Wales, says: \u201cThe crisis is really impacting on my future. My ultimate goal is to become a mental health professional, however, to achieve this, I\u2019m having to spend three hours each day travelling to an office in a nearby city to get experience in the field.\u201d For Amy, this is both a mental and financial drain. \u201cI\u2019ve been working to the point of burnout for a housing deposit, or enough money to rent short term closer to the city centre. But now, with the new rise in interest rates, that feels even further out of reach.\u201d Her travel to work eats up a third of her salary, while rising prices of everything from food to bills makes saving incredibly tough. \u201cBecause of this I\u2019m not seeing friends as often because I can\u2019t justify the costs.\u201dA fairer way forward (Independent)So how can we start to tackle the financial inequality young women face, and help build a fairer future? \u201cFirstly, we want the government to do more to tackle the income gap that young women face,\u201d says Reindorp. \u201cWe want them to prioritise support during the cost of living crisis by extending the national living wage and increasing it to cover the rising cost of living. We also want them to ensure the benefits system offers support for young women to move into jobs that allow them to thrive.\u201dThe charity also advocates for changes in the workplace. \u201cThere are lots of ways employers can help create an equal world of work for young women,\u201d Reindorp says. \u201cCompanies can start by having transparent pay scales, offering flexible working, ending zero hours contracts, offering the Living Wage, and providing meaningful development opportunities for young women. What\u2019s more, it makes business sense. Society loses an estimated \u00a328.2bn a year by trapping young women in low paid, insecure work and making the workplace inaccessible for young women with caring responsibilities.\u201d Conversely, boosting women\u2019s financial security via better pay and opportunities has benefits for everyone, as Reindorp notes. \u201cAt Young Women\u2019s Trust our vision is to create an equal world of work for young women and to ensure they are paid fairly for the work they do \u2013 where they are valued, can make choices and look forward to a fairer financial future. Greater financial security will enable young women to thrive and fulfil their aspirations, which in turn will see this huge talent pool helping to boost our economy.\u201dPower-up tips: How to boost financial securityTake controlWhile it can feel difficult to tackle your money situation, particularly when you have other life pressures to deal with, there is a wealth of instantly accessible and easy-to-use resources that will allow you to quickly take control, helping you manage your money, discover any benefits and funding you are entitled to, and get support from experts whose job it is to help improve your financial circumstances.

Do you: a) Work on it till end of day, accept that while it might not be perfect, it has its charms, and feel proud of yourself once it\u2019s done for pulling it off under pressure. Or b) Work on it until the early hours, endure a fitful night of stress-sleep, while afterwards you can\u2019t stop picking over the bit where you froze and worrying when your boss is going to haul you over the coals for it.If you\u2019re very much in the latter camp, while it might not be all that reassuring, you\u2019re far from alone. Imposter syndrome \u2013 which manifests in a number of symptoms including perfectionism, unjustified self doubt, and fears your incompetencies are about to be discovered \u2013 affects people of all ages, backgrounds and experiences, and can manifest across all areas of life, from work and education, to friendships, relationships and hobbies.A common problem (Independent)The phenomenon, which was coined by psychologists in 1978, is defined as a sense of anxiety and inability to feel validated internally, despite all the objective, outward signs of achievement and success. To the outsider, it looks like you\u2019re smashing it, but internally, you feel fearful, inadequate, and even fraudulent. It\u2019s a potent combination that\u2019s especially prevalent among women. According to a study of 4,000 adults commissioned by Galaxy, 53 per cent of British women suffer from imposter syndrome, commonly peaking in the mid to late twenties, with work (72 per cent) and education (29 per cent) two of the areas they are impacted most. RecommendedCricket legend Ebony Rainford-Brent: \u201cAnyone can suffer from imposter syndrome \u2013 it\u2019s part of who we are\u201dThe Ripple Effect: AJ Odudu interviews inspiring women about their achievements, challenges and learningsThe prevalence of imposter syndrome among young women is down to a complex web of factors that take root early. Exposed to beliefs and thought patterns that discriminate against their gender, young girls are raised with a higher risk of the self-doubt that characterises imposter syndrome. Once in work, women are held to higher ethical standards than men, and are expected to be warm, caring and communal, among many other contradictory, often clashing biases. Without even close to equal representation at leadership level, many women genuinely are striding out alone, without role models or protocol designed minority identities. According to Young Women\u2019s Trust \u2013 a charity that campaigns for an equal world of work for young women \u2013 one in five HR decision makers think that men are better suited to senior management jobs than women, a view which may be preventing young women from progressing. It\u2019s understandable then that women\u2019s imposter syndrome is driven by a lack of confidence (63 per cent), constant comparison to peers (44 per cent) and striving for perfection (30 per cent). Men, while impacted by the phenomenon, are less broadly affected \u2013 with 54 per cent of men saying they have never felt it at all.Although ubiquitous, imposter syndrome shouldn\u2019t stop young people from doing what they want, or slow them down as they progress in their career and personal life. \u201cOne of the first steps is realising that it\u2019s not you \u2013 it\u2019s the system of society and the world of work that means the odds are stacked against women,\u201d says Shona Horsman, who has been a professional career coach for twenty years and provides support through \u2018Work It Out\u2019, a service set up by Young Women\u2019s Trust. \u201cI always say when coaching that we want to keep one foot in acknowledgement and one foot in possibility.\u201d So, what strategies should young women deploy to open up, destigmatise and help tackle imposter syndrome in their own lives?Power up tips: How to manage imposter syndrome (Independent)Normalise itAlthough not everyone who\u2019s experienced imposter syndrome would use the label, it\u2019s universal and for some, lifelong. Some 62 per cent of the women surveyed by Galaxy admitted that they have rarely experienced true confidence. \u201cWe need to normalise imposter syndrome and remember that it\u2019s a common experience,\u201d says Shona. \u201cEven the most confident and successful-seeming person has moments.\u201d Not only does it happen to many people, but also across many areas of life. The study revealed that women affected by imposter syndrome experience it in the workplace (72 per cent), in educational settings (29 per cent, in their friendships (29 per cent), romantic relationships (24 per cent), when parenting (18 per cent) and in the gym (16 per cent). \u201cAccepting it as a normal part of everyday life can dilute its power, and dispel the shame that makes it so lonely and isolating,\u201d Shona explains. \u201cWith this foundation, you can begin working through it with the support and guidance of others.\u201dEngage with your strengthsThere\u2019s no one-size-fits-all approach to tackling imposter syndrome, but it often requires effort on multiple fronts, particularly for women, who are less likely than men to say their attempts to manage it have been successful (22 per cent vs. 45 per cent). Start by making a list of all the things you\u2019re good at, in any area of your life, whether professional qualities, or abilities that link to interests, hobbies and relationships. As Shona points out, it\u2019s the strengths you wouldn\u2019t normally put on your CV. After all, so many vital qualities fall between the cracks of traditional self-promotion and assessment techniques.\u201cIf you\u2019re struggling to come up with them by yourself, imagine asking a friend what they appreciate about you,\u201d Shona recommends. \u201cThen write them down and put them somewhere so you can be reminded regularly.\u201d With a holistic view of your strengths and qualities, you\u2019ll have the resources to hand when imposter syndrome creeps in. Try physically putting them in places you typically have intrusive thoughts, such as your desk, or wherever you get ready in the mornings.Accept imperfectionImposter syndrome can be spurred by pressure to perform at your best in every circumstance. When you don\u2019t, feelings of incompetence and anxiety bubble up. Shona suggests a kinder approach that embraces imperfection. \u201cPeople are excellent at pointing out where things have gone wrong, or focusing on the worst bits,\u201d she says. \u201cBut by overcoming the need for everything to be perfect, you can find the value in taking stock and developing skills from something that didn\u2019t go your way.\u201d Rather than poring over all the reasons why you didn\u2019t get a job, ask what you learnt about yourself in the process, for example. There\u2019s a lot to glean from that, and the more skills you can pick up on, the more confident you\u2019ll feel going forward.Many research papers have shown that women are more conscientious than men on average, yet aren\u2019t taken as seriously or respected for their skills as they would like. While studies have revealed that men apply for a job when they meet only 60 per cent of the qualifications, but women apply only if they meet 100 per cent of them. And it\u2019s having an impact \u2013 women apply for 20 per cent fewer jobs than men despite similar job search behaviours, according to a LinkedIn Gender Insights Report. By accepting that you don\u2019t need to check every box \u2013 or be perfect \u2013 you\u2019ll take more chances and feel freer from the constraints of the shoulds, and should-nots.Find a safe space to share and source strengthJuggling preconceived gender biases and stereotypes \u2013 plus the added weight of imposter syndrome, is a lot to handle. With the majority of women (68 per cent) saying they have never spoken openly about their experiences, safe, non-judgemental spaces for sharing experiences, big and small are essential. Groups established specifically for people of a minority identity or group in the workplace can be a huge help in sharing with confidentiality and finding strength from others. And if no such safe space exists, why not set one up? \u201cIt\u2019s important to find a voice and realise that you can challenge some of those highly critical thoughts \u2013 because although we\u2019ve been led to believe otherwise, you shouldn\u2019t always trust your thoughts at face value,\u201d Shona says.Half of women who experience imposter syndrome believe that they \u2018just need to learn to live with it\u2019. However, it doesn\u2019t have to be that way \u2013 there is lots of constructive support and tools available. Young Women\u2019s Trust\u2019s \u2018Work It Out\u2019 coaching service provides six free sessions to women aged 18 to 30. Usually carried out via telephone, they\u2019re flexible sessions with professional coaches like Shona. \u201cWe identify people\u2019s skills and explore hopes for a better future which can make all the difference in shaking off unhelpful feelings,\u201d she explains. \u201cHaving a caring, trusted person on the end of the phone to talk through these worries helps put things into perspective \u2013 often the client realises they\u2019re better than they thought and don\u2019t feel so much of an imposter.\u201dAcknowledge, but don\u2019t dwell on itImposter syndrome has an undeniable impact on the lives of those who experience it. More than one in five women who have experienced it said that it\u2019s stopped them from making friends, while 14 per cent say they have quit a job as a result. However, Shona warns that it can be a self-fulfilling prophecy. \u201cBe careful about overreliance on the label, and don\u2019t overly buy into the idea,\u201d she says.Instead, Shona recommends acknowledging imposter syndrome, but by avoiding dwelling too much on it, the impact can be reduced, if not completely avoided. \u201cTry instead to focus on the strengths, supports and useful resources you have in your life. It\u2019s amazing what can happen in the future when you do other things to help yourself move forward.\u201d Finding role models within your workplace, friendship circle or in the public eye (everyone from AJ Odudu and Ebony Rainford-Brent, to Lady Gaga, Billie Eilish and Emma Watson have all spoken openly about imposter syndrome) can help you find concrete strategies that are more specific to the ways yours manifests, making it easier to manage.Galaxy\u00ae is committed to help one million people, including women, their families and communities thrive by 2030 via its \u2018Your Pleasure Has Promise\u2019 manifesto and vital initiatives including the Women for Change programme in collaboration with CARE and their How to Thrive series in partnership with Young Women\u2019s Trust.

It might sound like the plot of 60s-based dramas like Mad Men, Hidden Figures and On the Basis Of Sex, but the latest stats reveal that, shockingly, these are still the very real experiences of young women in the workplace today.According to a study by Young Women\u2019s Trust \u2013 a charity that campaigns for an equal world of work for young women \u2013 when compared to men their age, young women are losing out on over \u00a35000 a year because they\u2019re being funnelled into low paid jobs and sectors, and getting stuck at the bottom of the career ladder. Not only do they tend to work in lower-paying industries than men, they get fewer promotions and are less likely to be considered for senior positions. Indeed, almost a third (31 per cent) of HR decision makers agree that it is harder for women to progress in their organisation than men.Barriers also extend beyond just the established workplace, and begin before a woman has even embarked on her chosen career. The stats are stark. Women are far more likely to enter into apprenticeships in lower paying fields, like childcare or social care. For every 20 men who start an apprenticeship in engineering, there\u2019s only one woman, while 13 times as many women do apprenticeships in childcare. And women continue to earn less years after they have completed theirs.Biases and barriers (Independent)\u201cThe issues are twofold for young women in the workplace,\u201d says Claire Reindorp, CEO of Young Women\u2019s Trust. \u201cThere are boundaries in terms of the fields they go into \u2013 for example STEM \u2013 that begin from school and extend upward, discouraging young women from studying and entering these sectors. Then across every field, they face further discrimination, in terms of lower salaries, fewer promotions and fewer senior roles being offered as they progress in their careers when compared to their male counterparts.\u201dStereotypically \u2018female\u2019 roles, such as care work, childcare, and retail, are under-valued and lower paid compared to male-dominated fields such as engineering. \u201cYoung women have so much potential but they\u2019re being held back because of structural and cultural barriers that have been in place for far too long. But it\u2019s not just about encouraging young women to go into STEM. We should be valuing vital work like care and education more too. Regardless of the sector, we need to open up opportunities, provide effective support so that young women can access work, and challenge archaic attitudes that prevent them from progressing.\u201dMoreover, across all sectors, young women are blocked from progressing as easily as men. \u201cWe talk about the broken rung at the bottom of the career ladder \u2013 young women getting trapped in low paid roles, or having to deal with discrimination and inflexible working conditions. In our last annual report one in five HR professionals still think that men are better suited to senior management roles than women. Stereotyping young women into certain roles is unhelpful and perpetuates the idea that gender determines your capabilities.\u201dThis kind of bias and stereotyping is something Emma, 27, from London, a young woman supported by Young Women\u2019s Trust, has experienced throughout her career in communications. \u201cI\u2019ve experienced discrimination in the workplace on so many levels. In an earlier job I was able to prove that a male peer, who actually had a more junior role, was getting paid more than me. I\u2019ve also been bullied out of a role and my complaint was upheld, with the company admitting that policies had been broken, but because the perpetrator was very senior there would be no further action taken.\u201dEconomic pressuresThe pandemic was both a blessing and a curse for women\u2019s labour participation \u2013 on one hand, lockdowns normalised and widened access for some women to flexible and hybrid working, which is helpful for those with parenting and caregiving responsibilities (which still, disproportionately, land on women). On the other hand, this varied greatly across sectors, with many women in roles that precluded working from home. Others had no choice but to leave the workforce to fulfil the caregiving responsibilities COVID created.Coming out of the pandemic, and straight into a cost of living crisis has made the workplace even tougher for young women. \u201cIn our Picking up the pieces: Young women\u2019s experiences of 2020 report, it estimated that 1.5 million young women lost their income since the start of the pandemic and over two thirds (69 per cent) of young women claiming benefits said that they did so for the very first time,\u201d says Reindorp.\u201cThere\u2019s definitely an issue with insecure work and that was magnified during the pandemic. In the same report, 43 per cent of young women reported that they had been offered a zero hours contract (compared to 35 per cent of young men). Also, more than half of young women who are parents said they were unable to apply for or left a job because they couldn\u2019t cover childcare costs.\u201dEven women who do manage to progress in their careers experience bias in the workplace. \u201cBeing a woman in a very senior role comes with lots of discrimination unfortunately,\u201d says Rebecca, 32, who lives in the Lake District. \u201cI always get clients thinking that I\u2019m the more junior member of staff just because of my gender, and I\u2019ve been told that I need to be \u2018more aggressive and bolshy.\u2019\u201dBreaking the bias (Independent)There are solutions though. Although post-pandemic, hybrid working is much more common, it\u2019s not universal: according to the Young Women\u2019s Trust study, just under a third of women who made a request to work flexibly were denied, while many young women (26 per cent) wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable even making the ask. As a starting point, businesses should ensure all roles where flexible working is offered state this in their job adverts, and instead of waiting for individual requests, flexibility should be available for employees at all levels. Widespread \u2013 and concrete \u2013 flexible working opportunities would enable young women to re-enter work, progress quicker and earn higher salaries. In fact, the positives are hard to ignore. According to a Bloomberg study from 2019, if women received greater access to flexible working arrangements, in addition to childcare and secondary education, they could add as much as $20 trillion to the global economy.Reindorp agrees. \u201cYoung women should have all options available to them and should be valued and supported to thrive in whatever role they do. Whether it\u2019s part time work to fit around their lives, childcare or working in a sector that they love and want to progress in. None of these choices are more or less valid. What\u2019s key is that young women have genuine options, are supported regardless, and paid fairly for their work.\u201dYoung Women\u2019s Trust have also created a guide to help employers support young women. \u201cEmployers need to have transparent pay scales, pay the Real Living Wage for everyone, and make sure that processes are in place to report discrimination,\u201d says Reindorp. \u201cWe want to remove gender-based restrictions and stereotypes, support young women in their life choices and then pay them fairly too. To create an equal world of work and raise young women\u2019s incomes full stop.\u201dPower up tips: Ways to smash workplace stereotypesFind a mentorA mentor, especially a female mentor, can be enormously useful in helping young women develop leadership skills and practical abilities to advocate for themselves in the workplace. The value is clear at any point in a young woman\u2019s path \u2013 studies have shown that students with female mentors experienced a greater sense of belonging, motivation and confidence, and were more likely to remain in the field. Employers are well-placed to offer internal mentoring opportunities and to monitor the development of young women to assess the impact of these networks, so it\u2019s worth exploring this with your manager or HR team. But you don\u2019t need to hold out for a formal mentoring program \u2013 reaching out to an experienced woman at work and exploring the potential of mentorship and guidance is a good place to start.RecommendedThe Ripple Effect: AJ Odudu interviews inspiring women about their achievements, challenges and learningsAJ Odudu: \u201cWe all need to be kind to ourselves \u2013 perfection doesn\u2019t exist\u201dConnect with colleaguesFrom D&I committees, to LGBTQ+ networks and working parents groups, workplace networks provide a safe place to raise issues around discrimination and make positive change. So join one that best represents you. Employers can help by setting up networks aimed specifically at supporting young women in the workplace. \u201cYoung women have told us that they would like to see organisations establishing networks of young women; encouraging colleagues to be a cheerleader for them; and making sure that people call out any incidences where young women are spoken over or end up taking on more of the non-promotable and administrative tasks,\u201d says Reindorp.Consult a coachMany employers offer some form of workplace coaching, whether that\u2019s support from members of the HR team, sessions with external coaches, or confidential support with work-related stress or anxiety, so find out what\u2019s available. \u201cAt Young Women\u2019s Trust, we provide coaching to help young women navigate the world of work, whether that be moving into a different job, getting promoted, or dealing with difficult situations at work,\u201d says Reindorp. \u201cWe\u2019re also campaigning for equality at work and want more young women to raise their hands to be involved.

In fact, her hugely successful site and social channel is called \u2018This Girl Talks Money\u2019 and via her relatable, practical and easy-to-understand content she\u2019s \u201copening up the conversation around earning, spending, saving and managing money\u201d and helping thousands of financially challenged young people in the process.Talking to young people about money in a relevant, relatable way was a huge part of Ellie\u2019s decision to set up her blog in the first place. She was living in London and in her first job as a trainee solicitor when she started to get interested in finance. \u201cIt was the first time after years of student living that I\u2019d had a proper salary and I wanted to balance having fun with making good decisions for my future.\u201d But when she started looking for guidance and advice, Ellie was frustrated by what she found.\u201cEverything seemed to be written for people my parent\u2019s age, which wasn\u2019t relatable,\u201d she recalls. \u201cThe tone was very negative - everything seemed designed to make you feel bad about spending money \u2013 and bad about most money decisions,\u201d she explains. Plus there wasn\u2019t really any content that tackled the specific issues affecting young people. \u201cThere was no conversation about managing your own money and investing in the future early on in your career.\u201dEllie also noticed a lot of sexism in the way women were presented in popular culture when it came to their finances. \u201cBooks like Confessions of a Shopaholic or the Carrie Bradshaw character in the Sex and the City series created unhelpful stereotypes \u2013 though actually research shows that men are just as likely as women to overspend. Conversely, male characters were presented as in control of and confident with money.\u201dConfused as to why the needs of women her age were being ignored, Ellie decided to take things into her own hands, training as a certified financial coach and setting up her site and social channel with an aim of becoming a \u2018financial wing woman\u2019 and \u2018digging deep into all the financial adulting school forgot\u2019.Tackling financial inequityVia her site and podcast, Ellie helps empower young women with relevant financial advice (Ellie Austin-Williams)Four years on, with a loyal following of over 35,000 on Instagram, Ellie is a sought-after financial educator and content creator. Along with co-host Victoria Nabarro, she holds no-holds-barred conversations about real life money with her podcast Money Unfiltered, and has a book \u2013 Money Talks: A Lifestyle Guide For Financial Wellbeing \u2013 coming out in January 2024. And she\u2019s as passionate about the importance of financial literacy as ever. Particularly for young women, who are disproportionately affected by the housing and cost-of-living crisis, or having to shoulder caregiving responsibilities.RecommendedFinance is a feminist issue \u2013 the income gap and how to tackle itThe importance of she-conomics: how empowering women financially helps everyone thriveThe Ripple Effect: AJ Odudu interviews inspiring women about their achievements, challenges and learnings\u201cIn this economic climate, understanding your finances and making informed decisions is essential,\u201d she explains. \u201cWithout that foundational understanding of their money, women can find themselves in difficult situations, like being unable to quit a toxic job, trapped in a bad relationship or constantly having defer to a male partner on financial matters, which can expose women to risk.\u201dThere\u2019s a finance knowledge gap among women, which Ellie flags is partly down to women\u2019s recent financial independence. Just 50 years ago, women couldn\u2019t open their own bank accounts, get a credit card or apply for a mortgage. And until 1982, they couldn\u2019t buy a legal drink in a pub. \u201cWhen it comes to splitting or divorcing from a partner, if a woman has few or no deeds and bills in her name, and therefore no credit history, borrowing of any kind is difficult. These older, instilled structures and historic patterns of who manages money end up costing women more.\u201dAside from financial upbringing, women are faced with numerous baked-in biases and structural inequalities, the gender pay gap being one of the most pernicious. \u201cI have a lot of conversations with young women in my community about pay negotiations,\u201d says Ellie. \u201cThe reasons are widespread and rooted in gender bias, as women asking for more money doesn\u2019t align with the traditional female gender role, so often \u2013 whether intentional or subconscious \u2013 women can face backlash for behaving in a way that isn\u2019t considered to be feminine. Equally, the fear of being characterised as \u2018bold\u2019 or \u2018demanding\u2019 can put women off from asking for what they deserve. Yet when women don\u2019t negotiate but their male counterparts do, gender pay and wealth gaps continue to appear and widen.\u201dEllie sees the code of silence around money as exacerbating these issues. \u201cOpening up to friends and colleagues about salaries enables you to find out what you should be paid and advocate for yourself to get what you need,\u201d says Ellie. \u201cAn inability to talk about money only breeds comparison and shame, and compounds issues.\u201dThrough her site, Ellie aims to shatter this taboo as well as toxic assumptions about how people are paying for things. \u201cThe silence only exacerbates that feeling of not being enough, or not having worked enough,\u201d she says. Home ownership is one of the biggest concerns among her community, as they wonder whether they can buy property in the current climate \u2013 or ever. \u201cI try to shine a light on the fact that many people on social media waving the keys to their first place, actually get financial aid from relatives,\u201d she says. \u201cHelping people understand those nuances and what\u2019s going on behind the scenes contextualises wealth and finances.\u201dEllie says using cultural references to open up conversations around money can be helpful. \u201cSuccession has been a good way to talk with friends about attitudes to wealth and money,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen it comes to more personal things, I offer information about myself first, so that people feel more comfortable.\u201d Often, she finds they\u2019re then more receptive to opening up about their circumstances. After all, the complex emotions we feel around money \u2013 fear, guilt, confusion \u2013 are universal, and if we can share even a fraction of those, everyone is likely to feel a bit less alone.\u00a0 Money mindsetsEllie discussed financial equity with host AJ Odudu in our exclusive Ripple Effect series  (Independent/Sofi Adams)This psychological element to money is something Ellie is keen for everyone to explore. \u201cWe form our fundamental view and beliefs around money by the age of seven, so regardless of adult experiences, the attitudes we observe in our caregivers can often have the biggest influence,\u201d says Ellie. A child living in a household where talk was centred around being unable to afford things will likely carry this forward \u2013 so no matter how financially comfortable they become in adulthood, they may find spending money hard. Conversely, if you grew up with a spendthrift parent, you may find this kind of behaviour imprinted upon you too.Of course, such deep-rooted conditioning can\u2019t be shaken off instantly, so begin by putting attention on your money behaviours and their origins. Ellie recommends spending 30 minutes writing down your earliest memories regarding money, the key messages you grew up with and how you perceived your financial circumstances as a child compared to others around you.\u201cIt can be challenging to confront the past, but once you\u2019ve identified those things, remember that beliefs aren\u2019t truths and you can challenge them.\u201d Find hard evidence to counter these habits; for example, if you feel as if money is always going to run out, find proof that\u2019s not the case \u2013 ask yourself whether you\u2019ve ever actually run out of money in your adult life.If you\u2019re a spender \u2013 whether on yourself or others \u2013 it\u2019s worth taking a look at your habits and shifting your actions to have less impact on your finances. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with being someone who shows love through gifts \u2013 it\u2019s simply a love language,\u201d says Ellie. \u201cBut consider whether there are ways you can still show love at a lower cost \u2013 whether that\u2019s through time rather than money, buying on a budget, or shopping second hand. When it comes to treating people, the act is what matters \u2013 not how much you spend.\u201dWhatever your situation, getting into the weeds of your financial state of mind will help you plan for the future, and manage challenges along the way. So, where to begin? Ellie recommends finding an educational format that works best for you, whether that\u2019s podcasts or YouTube \u2013\u00a0 digestible financial advice for young people is a lot easier to come by now (although admittedly, Ellie is still a big fan of Martin Lewis\u2019 site Money Saving Expert.) Books are another great resource: \u201cMoney: A User\u2019s Guide by Laura Whateley, Open Up: Why Talking About Money Will Change Your Life by Alex Holder and Girls That Invest: Your Guide to Financial Independence through Shares and Stocks by Simran Kaur are all great options.\u201dIn the current economic climate, creating an emergency fund is essential. \u201cWith the job market so volatile, try to work towards having three months of savings that will cover rent and bills, and build up to six months-worth further down the line.\u201d In terms of tips, Ellie says: \u201cI always advocate treating your savings as an expense and moving money into a savings account when you get paid. That way, you\u2019re not relying on getting to the end of the month and having cash spare \u2013 chances are, you won\u2019t.\u201dKeeping the money out of reach is important too. \u201cThe easiest way to do this is to use a separate bank to the one for your everyday spending, and don\u2019t have the app on your phone. Technology has made it incredibly easy to access cash, so building barriers can help you resist the urge to spend your hard-earned savings.\u201dEllie strongly recommends paying into a pension fund too. \u201cOver the last year, lots of people have been looking to opt out of workplace pension schemes to have access to their whole pay packet,\u201d she notes. \u201cBut if you can, avoid that \u2013 with tax relief and employer contributions added to the money you pay in, the take-home equivalent would be far less,\u201d she says. \u2018Boring Money\u2019 is her favourite tool for comparing plans and providers.Whatever your financial situation, it\u2019s never too late to tackle it and make change, and the sooner you do so, the more positive and empowered you\u2019ll feel. And while it can feel difficult with all the financial challenges young people are facing, by making some small, simple changes, month by month you can feel more in control.\u201cSet yourself up with whatever means you have in your twenties and thirties, and you\u2019ll have the best shot at a healthy financial future,\u201d says Ellie. \u201cKnowing your financial circumstances and boundaries, you grant yourself freedom, whether that\u2019s going off to build a life elsewhere, taking time off to protect your health or saving towards something major.\u201d And there\u2019s nothing more valuable than that.Galaxy\u00ae is committed to help one million people, including women, their families and communities thrive by 2030 via its \u2018Your Pleasure Has Promise\u2019 manifesto and vital initiatives including the Women for Change programme in collaboration with CARE and their How to Thrive series in partnership with Young Women\u2019s Trust.

As the first black woman to represent England at cricket, she shattered barriers and paved the way for greater inclusivity in the game. From her first game at primary school to her insightful analysis as an international cricket commentator, she\u2019s become a role model for aspiring players and fans alike.Her sporting career is packed with personal highlights, but her proudest moment came when she was a member of the England team that won the 2009 Cricket World Cup, then within three months went on to triumph at the final of the Women\u2019s World Twenty20, win the NatWest One Day series and retain the Women\u2019s Ashes. \u201cWe were hailed as one of the most successful England women\u2019s cricket teams and cricket teams of all time,\u201d says Ebony. \u201cBeing around people who were so laser-focused to achieve that goal taught me so much about life and blew my mind in terms of expectations.\u201dAfter retiring from cricket in 2012, Ebony\u2019s infectious enthusiasm for and desire to improve the sport led her to executive posts on several sporting boards, as well as gracing the airwaves as a pundit for the BBC\u2019s Test Match Special and Sky Sports \u2013 importantly, becoming one of the first women to commentate on men\u2019s international cricket matches. With such a wealth of experience, talent, and incredible achievements, it\u2019s hard to imagine that Ebony might ever have doubted her abilities, but from a young age she experiences imposter syndrome, and it\u2019s something that still affects her today.A natural talentEbony got her first chance to play cricket through a charity, and her talent took her all the way to the England team  (Ebony Rainford-Brent/ECB)Growing up in Herne Hill, south London and raised by her mum, in her words \u2013 as \u201ca typical inner city girl\u201d \u2013 Ebony was surrounded by her football-loving brothers and friends. No one she knew played cricket, so the sport wasn\u2019t on her radar at all. That is, until she played her first game at primary school aged nine via the charity Cricket For Change \u2013 and it was love at first whack. \u201cI felt such freedom and once I got into competing, I was on the path quite quickly,\u201d Ebony recalls. She was scouted to play for Surrey county aged twelve, and remembers her first trial with poignancy. \u201cThere\u2019s this photo where all the girls are in pristine white, and I\u2019m in the middle wearing a big baggy red jumper, purple shorts, standing barefoot, with my body language all awkward and off to the side,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI was going into a world where I didn\u2019t feel like I belonged \u2013 in so many different ways.\u201dWhile most other families drove to games, Ebony and her mum would get two or three buses. She knew she stood out \u2013 people sometimes made cruel comments about her background and colour of her skin \u2013 and the doubts that she deserved any of her accolades were hard to ignore. When a letter announcing her acceptance into the Junior England team came through the door, Ebony stared at it in disbelief. \u201cIt was addressed to me, but I couldn\u2019t believe that could be true,\u201d she says. \u201c\u2018There\u2019s no other Ebony Jewel Rainford Brent living here!\u201d my mum said at the time \u2013 she really had to convince me.\u201dDespite being lauded as one of our top sportswomen, Ebony struggled inwardly with feelings of self-doubt  (Ebony Rainford-Brent/Ken Passley/The Voice)As she progressed through from the under-11s to the Surrey Women\u2019s senior team and even becoming captain, those feelings of inadequacy and fraudulence prevailed. If someone congratulated her or commented on her performance on the pitch, Ebony would deflect it with a self-deprecating joke and push the focus of conversation onto someone else. \u201cI took in all the negatives and none of the positives,\u201d she says. \u201cI believed the narrative in my head which said that it wasn\u2019t a sport for me, and that I wasn\u2019t good enough to be doing what I was doing.\u201dWhile Ebony notes that lots of men experience imposter syndrome, she believes it\u2019s definitely more common and far-reaching among women, especially young women. \u201cFor hundreds of years, society has told women what they can and can\u2019t do, and laid on expectations of what they should and shouldn\u2019t be,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen it comes to cricket boards, I\u2019m often the only woman in the room, and I\u2019m looking around thinking, \u2018Do I belong here? How do I communicate? Should I speak their language or can I speak my own?\u2019\u201dWhile Ebony is pleased to see more workplaces improving their culture and enabling more women to progress in the professional sphere, she\u2019s realistic about the added pressure and expectations women face after hundreds of years of historical biases. Instead of trying to \u2018fix\u2019 imposter syndrome though, Ebony herself has found that the best path forward is to accept it as a normal part of being human. \u201cIt can happen to everyone \u2013 a person who\u2019s super confident and sure in one area can feel it when they try something new,\u201d she says.When she has done corporate public speaking and opened up about her imposter syndrome, she\u2019s been amazed to hear so much of the audience share their own experiences too. Some might be able to overcome it entirely, while others can be content with improving responses over time. \u201cEven if we just exist with imposter syndrome, that\u2019s okay,\u201d she says. \u201cInstead of purging ourselves of it, we need to understand imposter syndrome \u2013 it\u2019s just part of who we are and how we operate.\u201dOpening upEbony and AJ Odudu discussed their experiences of imposter syndrome in our exclusive series  (Independent/Sofi Adams)To better understand her own imposter syndrome, Ebony uses journaling. Every morning, she asks herself two key questions \u2013 what she\u2019s thinking, and whether this should be accepted as a truth. She becomes a judge and jury \u2013 separating the judging imposter syndrome, from evidence that counters it. \u201cQuestions like: \u2018Have I done the work I should have done?\u2019 help to change my thinking around imposter syndrome,\u201d she explains. \u201cThe thoughts might still be there, but I question the negative biases, and don\u2019t fall into it accepting them point blank.\u201dThis system of reflection through writing enables her to work through emotions and step outside of them. \u201cBe silent with yourself and reflect, before sounding it out with one or two good people you can trust, whether that\u2019s a family member, mentor or coach,\u201d she explains. \u201cBounce it off others and they will reflect it to show up your biases which should help you see that you\u2019re doing the work, you deserve your success, and you do belong.\u201dThat said, Ebony has also learnt from being too trusting and vulnerable in sharing with others. \u201cAt times, I\u2019ve felt insecure and scared to open up, then have done so to someone who wasn\u2019t necessarily in my corner, wasn\u2019t empathetic or who brushed me off, which made me feel worse,\u201d she says. \u201cFind someone who you trust who believes in you and your capabilities \u2013 test the waters, open up a little and begin to build that relationship.\u201dTo help her get out of her own head and speak her imposter feelings out loud, Ebony leans on her mum and an external coach, who she has been seeing every fortnight for two years. \u201cIt helps to have someone who doesn\u2019t know my background, and provides total honesty and objectivity,\u201d she says. Without these strategies, Ebony doesn\u2019t think she would have been able to manage the imposter syndrome throughout her career. The combination of journaling and talking authentically about her feelings has helped shift her mindset. \u201cDoing so will help break the cycle of being in our heads, or going into a negative spiral,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s simply a way of asking better questions and reflecting to change our own perspectives of ourselves.\u201dEven with all the right tools, Ebony\u2019s relationship with imposter syndrome fluctuates. Her early days of commentating were fraught with doubt and worry, which was only compounded by the social media reactions after each TV appearance. \u201cBefore I only had to contend with my own judgement of myself, but with Twitter and all those people saying what they thought about me in public, I started questioning whether I was good enough,\u201d she says. \u201cSuddenly I was getting comments like \u201cYou\u2019re a woman, get back in the kitchen\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re only there because you\u2019re a token seat\u201d. Before games, Ebony would have vivid nightmares that someone was going to drag her off air.To cope, she learnt to dissociate her worth from social media narratives. Other commentators reminded her to back herself and ask those important questions. \u201cThings like \u2018Have you done your research?\u2019 \u2018Do you know the players?\u2019 \u2018Have you said what you wanted to say?\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cThey told me if I had done all those things, I shouldn\u2019t be worrying about what the world says.\u201d They\u2019re rules she still leans on today \u2013 Ebony will be presenting at the Ashes 2023 soon and has resolved not to look at Twitter for the first week of the tournament. \u201cI\u2019m going to get myself into the flow without worrying about what others think,\u201d she says.Whether she\u2019s tackling new sporting challenges as non-executive director of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) or helping others as the chair The African-Caribbean Engagement Programme, Ebony accepts that imposter syndrome will continue to crop up, but she\u2019s unfazed.In fact, moving past the idea of confidence is something Ebony sees as key in tackling these feelings. \u201cIf we only do things when we feel confident, we often don\u2019t take action that will help us,\u201d she says. Instead, she encourages young women to feel courage. \u201cConfidence is overrated - I\u2019d like young women to work towards a mindset where they don\u2019t always have to feel empowered and at the top of their game to feel they can do something. When you\u2019re feeling hesitant, flex that muscle to say \u201cOkay, I\u2019m not feeling confident right now, but I\u2019m going to put myself forward or give that a try anyway. You\u2019ll be amazed by what you achieve.\u201dGalaxy is committed to empowering people, including women, children and their communities around the world via its \u2018Your Pleasure Has Promise\u2019 manifesto and vital initiatives including the Women for Change programme in collaboration with CARE and their How to Thrive series in partnership with Young Women\u2019s Trust.

While her classmates were in the soft play area, she was taking apart the VCR player, rewiring the washing machine and commandeering Microsoft Word on her dad\u2019s research computer. \u201cI was fascinated by the devices at home and wanted to learn how they worked,\u201d she says. \u201cI was excited to see what problems I could solve with all that new information.\u201d The budding technologist showed exceptional brilliance early on and her penchant for deconstructing household gadgets flourished into record-breaking talent. By ten, she was speaking six languages and had gained two GCSEs in maths and computing; and by 11, she was the youngest girl in the country to pass A-level computing.Prior to that, as an as-yet undiscovered genius, the pace and method of teaching at primary school had led Anne-Marie to play the class clown. \u201cI always wanted to entertain my friends, rather than listen to what the teacher was saying \u2013 yet again,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt was more out of frustration with the slow and repetitive style of learning, rather than me just being disruptive.\u201d Fortunately both her teachers and parents recognised this, and Anne-Marie was put on an accelerated learning track, which included lessons and study outside of school.Bolstered by her parents\u2019 encouragement in her curiosity for STEM, Anne-Marie was largely insulated from gender bias throughout her home life and school career. \u201cI was never ostracised and no one ever told me that because of my gender, I shouldn\u2019t be there,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI really wasn\u2019t aware of the barriers and divisions for girls in STEM, compared to boys \u2013 and I know I\u2019m privileged that this wasn\u2019t a big feature in my childhood.\u201dWhile studying maths and computer science at the University of Oxford, Anne-Marie was one of three women in a class of 70 yet still, her minority status didn\u2019t compute. \u201cI think my lack of awareness on the matter goes to show that if you\u2019re not made to feel \u2018other\u2019 in these spaces, you can enjoy and thrive in them,\u201d she explains. And thrive she did \u2013 going on to work as a computer scientist for a range of global banking organisations including Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers and Deutsche Bank.At a technical conference almost eleven years ago, Anne-Marie suddenly felt the tectonic plates of her worldview shift. \u201cThere were 3,500 technical women in one space and I thought, my goodness, this is my people!\u201d she says. \u201cI learned that I was part of this shrinking minority and that was a huge issue.\u201d Without women contributing to major technological decisions that affect every single area of life, it dawned on Anne-Marie that something had gone very wrong. \u201cI saw that women\u2019s experiences, perspectives and problems weren\u2019t reflected in technology which is seriously dangerous,\u201d she explains. \u201cIf we only have half of society sitting at the decision-making table, we\u2019re not doing it properly.\u201dSocietal biasesAnne-Marie co-founded Stemettes to support young women and non-binary people in STEM  (Sam & Simon Photography)The underrepresentation of women in STEM takes root early \u2013 sometimes before a child can even hold a pen \u2013 and is compounded by a complex interplay of factors as they age. \u201cEverything for children is on a gender binary, like buying different toys and clothes for girls versus boys,\u201d says Anne-Marie. \u201cThen there\u2019s a lack of representation in the stories we tell, which means that the idea of a technologist, founder or researcher who\u2019s a woman is so far out of the realm of imagination.\u201dThe scarcity of women in STEM is evident in film and television representations too. Anne-Marie recalls the backlash around a potential female Doctor Who, essentially a \u201cfictional time-travelling character who isn\u2019t real!\u201d she laughs wryly. \u201cAnd of course, the tech genius in the Hollywood movie is always a man.\u201d These societal stereotypes and biases have seeped into social norms, which impact every level of the systems we move through, from how parents treat children, to what appears in the school curriculum. \u201cNews coverage is another example \u2013 we rarely see women featured as technical experts, if at all,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are countless signs and signals that reinforce women\u2019s status as \u2018other\u2019 in STEM, or even just out in the world, to an extent that even we don\u2019t realise.\u201dRecommendedBreaking the office bias: smashing the stereotypes holding women backThe Ripple Effect: AJ Odudu interviews inspiring women about their achievements, challenges and learningsDespite these baked-in biases, Anne-Marie is keen to highlight that women have always been pioneering forces in science, technology, engineering and maths. \u201cWomen technologists of all kinds are the reason we have GPS, Wi-Fi, the bulletproof vest, the flight receiver on Concorde, and why Waterloo Bridge is still standing today,\u201d she explains. \u201cBut those stories haven\u2019t been told, have been actively or, very rarely, accidentally erased and hidden.\u201d She\u2019s adamant that herstory \u2013 that\u2019s history viewed from a female or specifically feminist perspective \u2013 gets the airtime and recognition it deserves.This desire to spotlight history and inspire young women was the driving force behind Anne-Marie\u2019s social enterprise Stemettes, which she co-founded not long after her conference lightbulb moment. \u201cIt was a response to my realisation that STEM was no longer this niche thing, of me playing on the computer at home \u2013 it\u2019s driving our economies, healthcare, the way we work, play and live,\u201d she explains. \u201cFor the sake of the world\u2019s future \u2013 not just that of the tech industry \u2013 we must ensure we serve women\u2019s unique needs and experiences. All of us miss out when we don\u2019t have that perspective.\u201dOn a mission to shatter barriers and bridge the gender gap in STEM, Stemettes empowers and equips girls and young women and non-binary people aged five to 25 with the tools and confidence needed to thrive in these fields. Through workshops, hackathons and start-up incubator sessions, Stemettes aims to challenge social norms, including that pervasive narrative that STEM disciplines should \u2018belong\u2019 to boys and men. A decade since launching, Stemettes is mobilising to ensure the curriculum actually reflects the rich herstory of women in STEM. \u201cI want girls to understand how women have contributed to these crucial tools that we use every day and are incredibly technical,\u201d says Anne-Marie.Increasing visibilityIn our exclusive Ripple Effect series, Anne-Marie tackled workplace bias with AJ Odudu  (Independent/Sofi Adams)Her hope is that this will enforce more positive views of what an innovator is and can be for teachers, parents and students. A trailblazing force herself, Anne-Marie has always believed that if you can see it, you can be it; a responsibility she takes even more seriously since being elected President of the British Science Association in 2022. \u201cIt\u2019s so important for me to continue to show what\u2019s possible by stepping into spaces people might not have realised they should and deserve to be in,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m conscious to make clear the value of me coming in and holding that role \u2013 and I hope that it helps others drop some of their own biases and edit some of their own systems.\u201d She finds the trickle-down effect heartening to see, both through her leadership positions and work with Stemettes.Anne-Marie wants girls and women to see how much optimism and creativity awaits them in STEM fields. \u201cOften it\u2019s spoken about as incredibly restrictive and requires a specific set of skills to enter, which puts up barriers \u2013 I want girls to know that contrary to stereotypes, you need to be creative to solve the problems we\u2019re facing right now,\u201d she explains. \u201cThere\u2019s an incredible diversity of options and plenty of roles that don\u2019t even exist yet, so my aim is to ensure women can find success in STEM in the way that they want and deserve.\u201dHaving seen an incredible 60,000 young people engage with what Stemettes does \u2013 many of whom have gone on to take up leadership positions and advocate for other women in the industry \u2013 Anne-Marie remains hugely optimistic on women\u2019s fight for representation and fulfilment in STEM. She continues to carve new pathways and tell her story \u2013 most recently through her book She\u2019s in CTRL, released earlier this year, which documents how women can take back tech to communicate, investigate, problem-solve, broker deals and protect themselves in a digital world.Anne-Marie speaks of all the green shoots to celebrate, namely the growing number of women-led spaces and workplaces run by \u201creasonable people, where women can learn, grow and thrive\u201d without the power struggle associated with historically male-dominated spheres. \u201cI see so many spaces in STEM industries where women\u2019s contributions and perspectives are being welcomed, which proves women can be respected, purposeful and get fairly remunerated for their work,\u201d says Anne-Marie.The task, then, is for women to seek those spaces out and be assertive within them. \u201cAll of us can use our sphere of agency,\u201d says Anne-Marie. \u201cYou\u2019re in control of your own power and the application of your skillset, so you can make change and make it for others.\u201d The more we can do that en masse, the more Anne-Marie believes we can shift the balance towards gender equity and equality \u2013 and create a new world order that everyone will benefit from.Galaxy\u00ae is committed to help one million people, including women, their families and communities thrive by 2030 via its \u2018Your Pleasure Has Promise\u2019 manifesto and vital initiatives including the Women for Change programme in collaboration with CARE and their How to Thrive series in partnership with Young Women\u2019s Trust.

The ultra successful TV star, who is due to host the reboot of seminal reality show Big Brother this Autumn, has a relatability, warmth and natural charm that has seen her career soar from her beginnings at BBC Switch, via The Voice UK and Big Brother\u2019s Bit On the Side, and a show-stealing stint on Strictly (until a last-minute injury robbed her of a shot at the Glitter Ball).Yet despite having a thriving career in arguably one of the most outgoing, extrovert fields out there, AJ isn\u2019t immune from the creeping doubts and anxieties many of us experience on a daily basis \u2013 with the presenter revealing she regularly wrestles with imposter syndrome and doesn\u2019t always feel as assured on-camera as she might seem.\u201cPart of my job as a TV presenter is to appear confident, but there are so many times throughout my career where that has not been the case,\u201d\u00a0 AJ explains. \u201cThere are times when I\u2019m hosting the show and I get so nervous and think \u2018I can\u2019t do it\u2019 \u2013 then all of a sudden it all comes out and I\u2019m able to do it. But it doesn\u2019t stop those moments of self-doubt and it doesn\u2019t stop me questioning \u2018Do I deserve to be here?\u2019\u201dIn terms of finding ways to manage these feelings, AJ notes that it\u2019s \u201creally important to celebrate all of the successes\u201d regardless of \u201chowever big and small\u201d they might appear. \u201cWe\u2019re constantly in this state of moving forward and onto the next and we need to stop and take stock of the here and now,\u201d she adds. She also urges people to \u201cbe kind\u201d to themselves and not strive towards the unattainable goal of perfection. \u201cWe all need to accept that perfection doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d AJ reflects. \u201cWe all know it. I\u2019m not perfect, no one is.\u201dA common problem (Independent)The latest research shows AJ is far from alone. According to a survey of 4000 people conducted by confectionary brand Galaxy, over half of British women (53 per cent) experience imposter syndrome every single day. Of these women, almost three quarters (72 per cent) are affected in the workplace, with 29 per cent impacted in educational settings.Imposter syndrome is described as a feeling of inadequacy that persists despite evidence of success. This sensation of chronic self-doubt can feel both undermining and isolating, with individuals experiencing feelings of fraudulence, and over a prolonged period can act as a significant contributor to burnout. Troublingly, the survey bears out these damaging consequences, with one in seven women who have struggled with imposter syndrome leaving a job as a direct result.The condition is also impacting women\u2019s personal lives: affecting their friendships (20 per cent), romantic relationships (24 per cent) and parenting (18 per cent) while 16 per cent of women have experienced it at the gym. Triggers include lack of confidence, comparing themselves to others, perfectionism, lack of mental support and the pressure to have it all.Perhaps unsurprisingly, a huge number \u2013 79 per cent of the 2000 women surveyed \u2013 believe social media has had a hand in the rise of imposter syndrome. The research also revealed that symptoms of imposter syndrome start on average at 23 years old, with a shocking 62 per cent of women saying they have rarely experienced true confidence in their lives.While men do experience imposter syndrome, they are less likely to be affected and across fewer areas of their lives, with the majority of men (63 per cent) saying they have only experienced it in the workplace and over half (54 per cent) saying they have never felt it at all. Men are also more likely to try to deal with feelings of imposter syndrome (46 per cent) than women (30 per cent). By contrast, over two thirds of women surveyed said that they have never spoken openly about their experiences, while half said they believe they just need to learn to live with it.As Sonia Devlin, 27, from London explains: \u201cI feel like there\u2019s a real divide between young women and young men. In my experience young women feel that they need to do well in the role and really prove themselves before they ask for a salary increase, whereas young men that I know just dive straight in and ask for a pay rise. Often then young women end up burning out because they take on too much. It\u2019s a vicious cycle.\u201dFinding solutions (Independent)In a bid to raise awareness, destigmatize the issue and help young women who are struggling, AJ has teamed up with Galaxy and Young Women\u2019s Trust, a charity campaigning for an equal world of work for young women, to launch their series How to Thrive, exploring causes and resolutions around imposter syndrome. The initiative features candid interviews with inspirational women opening up about their own struggles with imposter syndrome and providing practical guidance and solutions.\u201cImposter syndrome can be crippling and impact so many areas of everyday life,\u201d AJ explains. \u201cIt can consume you while on social media, it can take over when away from home for the first time at university, it can also have an impact when just forging friendships. As someone who has faced it regularly in the past, it\u2019s been a pleasure working on this content series with Galaxy.\u201dThe long-term partnership will see Galaxy supporting Young Women\u2019s Trust\u2019s vital work helping young women, providing free coaching and advice to help them navigate life and career issues and empower them financially.\u201cYoung women face many challenges reaching their potential, progressing in life and earning what they should,\u201d Claire Reindorp, CEO of Young Women\u2019s Trust, explains. \u201cThey\u2019re more likely to be in lower-paid jobs and sectors of the economy and more likely to get stuck there. At a time in life when young women should be growing and learning, they\u2019re instead too often trapped in a struggle just to get by.\"Holly Jevons, 27, from London says that losing her job during the pandemic triggered her imposter syndrome. \u201cI knew I didn\u2019t lose my job because I lacked the skills or talent. But that was all my inner voice kept telling me. It made me doubt my abilities and, without my motivation to succeed and the support of those around me, it would have been really hard. One of the best tips I have for dealing with imposter syndrome is to talk to others about it. As people say, a problem shared is a problem halved. But also I found this normalised it and made me realise everyone has the same feelings \u2013 even those you wouldn\u2019t expect.\u201dBoth Galaxy and Young Women\u2019s Trust are passionate in their belief that when young women thrive, all of society benefits. The partnership forms part of Galaxy\u2019s \u2018Your Pleasure Has Promise Manifesto\u2019, in which they pledge to help one million people, including women, their families and communities thrive by 2030. This includes Galaxy\u2019s work with CARE International in cocoa-farming communities in Ghana and Cote D\u2019Ivoire helping boost women\u2019s financial literacy, entrepreneurial skills and economic equality.Galaxy\u2019s hope is that by supporting and empowering UK women to reach their potential, a virtuous cycle is created in which female empowerment at every level becomes the norm. \u201cOur ambition for Galaxy is to empower young women to thrive, creating a ripple effect of women who then go to enable the next generation to thrive,\u201d Victoria Gell, Galaxy Brand Director, explains. \u201cFrom the work we do supporting women in our cocoa growing regions with education, finance support and entrepreneurship, to campaigns such as this, we want to help make a difference.\u201dGalaxy\u00ae is committed to help one million people, including women, their families and communities thrive by 2030 via its \u2018Your Pleasure Has Promise\u2019 manifesto and vital initiatives including the Women for Change programme in collaboration with CARE and their How to Thrive series in partnership with Young Women\u2019s Trust.

A true ripple effect in action where everyone benefits.This is why helping to empower women financially \u2013 via initiatives that boost their knowledge around money, teach them entrepreneurial skills, and allow them to save and access funding for their own businesses and education \u2013 is central to Mars\u2019 work in cocoa-farming communities. Since 2016, via their Galaxy brand, they have worked with CARE International in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and Ghana, to build healthy, productive and financially stable communities where women are valued, supported and listened to.Right now, millions of farmers are working across six million cocoa farms to meet global demand for chocolate-related products. Roughly two-thirds of the cocoa yielded will come from the C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and Ghana in West Africa \u2013 and despite women often playing an integral role in this cocoa production, their contribution is often overlooked.In C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, women own a quarter of cocoa plantations and form around two thirds of the labour force \u2013 yet they are often denied a proper voice in the sector and seldom acknowledged as cocoa farmers within family businesses\u00a0. Social norms and stereotypes contribute to this inequality by shaping power dynamics that lead to discrimination and the marginalisation of women when it comes to community decision-making. While in Ghana, where two in 10 cocoa farmers are female, women play a central role in the industry, contributing up to 45 per cent of the labour input, particularly early crop care and post-harvest fermentation and drying \u2013 activities that are critical to improving future crop yields and production of quality beans. Yet largely this work goes unpaid, perceived instead as an extension of the family chores.Using enterprise to empowerBy boosting economic equity, Galaxy are helping women, their families and communities thrive  (Mars/Galaxy)To tackle these fundamental issues, Galaxy has been working with global humanitarian agency, CARE International, to help boost gender equity and financial empowerment among women and their families in cocoa-rich communities, with a view to bolstering a more stable and productive wider community.In 2016, Mars, through its Galaxy brand, working in collaboration with CARE, launched the Women for Change programme in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, which is based on the charity\u2019s long-serving Village Savings and Loan Association (VSLA) scheme. Wider societal change remains at the heart of the programme \u2013 including the improvement of school enrolment rates, development of business skills and the improvement of health and nutritional values.The scheme brings women together in a self-managed and familiar setting, where they are inspired to build viable enterprises using savings, small loans and insurance facilities, as well as to share resources and improve their lifestyles.It\u2019s common for family groups to work and save together, with these savings being used to buy farms and launch social enterprises that can bring in much-needed income and allow women to finally take control of their own financial situation. This grassroots building of solidarity and resilience between women often grows into more widespread and influential action, giving women a voice in their local community.\u201cSavings and loan groups lay the critical foundation for resilience,\u201d explains Harper McConnell, VP Cocoa Sustainability at Cocoa for Mars Wrigley\u00a0. \u201cOne of its major benefits is providing access to financial resources, so members can invest in their farms, families and communities. These groups also offer a great platform to build human and social capital, which will eventually lead to empowered and thriving farming communities.\u201dChange that benefits everyoneSince joining the VSLA, mum-of-three Kouassi has been able to set up two successful businesses  (Mars/Galaxy)Mother-of-three, Kouassi Akissi Rodiasse, benefited from the Women For Change VSLA scheme after spending her early adult years unemployed after her education was interrupted in childhood. \u201cWhen my father passed away, the family refused to pay my school fees. My elder brother said that as I am a girl, I had to stop school. So, I finished school in primary third grade.\u201d However with the support of the VSLA, Kouassi, 30, has been able to build two businesses, boosting both her financial situation and her self-esteem, and improving her family life. \u201cI joined the VSLA scheme when it was set up in my village four years ago. As I started to save, I was able to take out a loan, allowing my husband and I to buy a cocoa farm and build a new home. Since then I have also been able to develop my own small business selling natural juice. People respect me more. I am proud of myself, and know the VSLA will help me achieve my dreams.\u201dThe scheme has also had a positive impact on Kouassi\u2019s family life, from helping to fund her children\u2019s education, to helping her and her husband communicate and bond. \u201cBefore, my husband and I used to have huge and deep misunderstandings. But with the VSLA training, we have learned to listen to one another and have more mutual respect. Now we are very close. If there is a problem we sit together, discuss it and find a solution. Now, he helps me at home, including helping to collect the water. We fight together for our future.\u201dEmpowering women at work and homeFrom financial support to helping couples communicate, Galaxy\u2019s work with CARE has many benefits  (Mars/Galaxy)The Women for Change program also seeks to address damaging social norms that oppress and limit women, causing issues and imbalances between husbands and wives at work and home. By creating a network of gender committees, usually made up of at least two men and two women, to champion gender equity \u2013 and holding household dialogue sessions to help women take an active role in decision making at home \u2013 men are encouraged to see joint decision-making and saving as valuable. Families are able to express their desires, needs and dreams without fear of repercussion or risk of abuse \u2013 resulting in a healthier, happier home life.Moreover, a plan to work with families to improve nutrition, increase child protection and improve sexual and reproductive health and rights is a pillar of the scheme. A major part of this is education, which uses a \u2018nutrition curriculum\u2019 to teach parents about food groups and show how to provide a balanced diet for families. Scheme members are encouraged to invest some of their income into essential child education and health services.The Women for Change programme has been so successful that in 2020, Mars, the owner of the Galaxy brand\u00a0, pledged that they would boost the partnership with Care International by investing as much as $10 million to reach over 60,000 members in cocoa communities across C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and Ghana by 2025. In fact, they have already surpassed the goal, reaching more than 80,000 people.In addition, Mars recently announced, through a campaign linked to its Galaxy brand, that they would commit to help one million people including women, their families and their communities thrive by 2030. \u201cWe look forward to strengthening our collaboration with CARE,\u201d noted Global Vice President of Cocoa for Mars Wrigley, Amber Johnson, \u201c[as] we work towards reshaping the future of cocoa and creating a more modern, inclusive, and sustainable cocoa supply chain.\u201dGalaxy\u00ae is committed to help one million people, including women, their families and communities thrive by 2030 via its \u2018Your Pleasure Has Promise\u2019 manifesto and vital initiatives including the Women for Change programme in collaboration with CARE and their How to Thrive series in partnership with Young Women\u2019s Trust.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeA study has found that paying more for clothes doesn\u2019t always mean they will last longer.Researchers at the School of Design at the University of Leeds performed durability tests on 65 items of clothes retailing from under \u00a35 to around \u00a3150.The research showed that durability of both high and low-priced garments ranged from excellent to very poor.Durability refers to how long an item of clothing remains functional and wearable, without requiring much maintenance or repair when faced with normal wear and washing.T-shirts, hoodies and jeans were assessed for several factors including seam strength, resistance to ripping, colour bleeding, shrinking or losing shape.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveThe research \u2013 commissioned by environmental charity Hubbub and retailer Primark \u2013 found women\u2019s T-shirts priced under \u00a310 outperformed one retailing at around \u00a340. While hoodies priced between \u00a311 and \u00a320 were ranked higher on the durability scale than those priced at just under \u00a350 and around \u00a3100.Only negligible differences in durability were found for a pair of women\u2019s jeans priced at around \u00a315 compared to a pair retailing at more than 10 times the price. Of all the garments tested, only menswear hoodies showed consistently higher performance than the lower priced ones.Alongside the study, Hubbub commissioned a survey of 3,000 UK adults on attitudes towards clothing care, revealing that 67% of people expect expensive clothes to last longer.The poll also found people tend to take more care when it comes to costly items, with 64% more likely to hang them up after wearing, 62% removing spills and stains, and 54% willing to carry out repairs.\u201cDurability must become central to the debate on sustainability,\u201d said Aoife Allen, director and fashion lead at Hubbub.\u201cDurable clothes reduce the need for replacement purchases, increase the chance of a longer second life and offer better value for money \u2013 a significant concern in the context of the current cost of living crisis.\u201dOther issues can also be considered when thinking about the environmental and social impact of your clothes \u2013 such as the materials used in production and transparency of the supply chain.Allen believes retailers and consumers alike must help to tackle the huge issue of clothing waste.\u201cThe fashion industry should be designing clothing to last longer, and we can help to make people aware of the simple steps that they can take to help all their clothes last longer,\u201d Allen continues.\u201cThis research highlights that the same level of care should be given to all garments, regardless of price, to extend their life as much as possible.\u201dSo how do you make clothes last longer?Wash at lower temperaturesHigh temperatures can cause clothes to fade more quickly and they aren\u2019t necessary unless garments are very dirty,\u201cFor general washing of clothes that aren\u2019t visibly stained, try washing at 30 degrees or lower and use the eco-setting on washing machines,\u201d says Stephanie Campbell, senior creative partner (fashion) at Hubbub.\u201cMost detergents now clean very well at low temperatures. Try using a shorter washing cycle which can also help prevent clothes from degrading.\u201dGet to grips with care labelsIt\u2019s important to check the instructions on care labels, especially when washing for the first time, to avoid any disasters.\u201cFollowing the care symbols helps to avoid shrinking or damaging clothes and helps you care for them in the best possible way, so take the time to check them before washing,\u201d says Campbell.For example, some delicate fabrics shouldn\u2019t go in the washing machine, while others should be put in a net bag to protect them.Only wash an item when you really need toChucking clothes in the laundry basket after every wear can have a detrimental impact on durability.\u201cWashing clothing too much can cause colours to fade and the garment to start to break down,\u201d says Campbell.\u201cUnless an item is visibly dirty or has a stubborn stain, try spot cleaning marks or airing out odours to keep your clothes looking fresh.\u201dAct fast if you spill something, she adds: \u201cRemember to always treat stains as soon as you can \u2013 the longer you leave them the harder they are to get out.\u201dAir your clothes outAir drying is the best way to keep clothes in good shape \u2013 as long as you pay attention to the \u2018dry flat\u2019 warning on the care label for certain items such as those made from cotton, linen or silk.\u201cTumble drying can shrink or damage items, so air drying can help to keep outfits fitting well and in good condition,\u201d says Campbell. \u201cIt reduces energy bills too.\u201dRepair instead of replacingTry to stick to the \u2018make do and mend\u2019 adage no matter how much you paid for an item.Campbell says: \u201cMaking a quick fix on a hole as soon as you\u2019ve noticed or finding a local tailor that offers repairs is a simple way to get more wear out the clothes you\u2019ve got and keep on enjoying your favourite items.\u201dLove what you\u2019ve gotSustainable fashion influencers know that \u2018shopping your wardrobe\u2019 is key to reducing your clothing waste \u2013 and saving money.RecommendedChanel is set to host a fashion show in Manchester4 key men\u2019s swimwear trends to rock this summer10 ways to style up your picnic\u201cEnjoy what you already own, or swap with pals,\u201d says Campbell.\u201cMix and match what\u2019s in your wardrobe to create new outfits.

The footage of the bride and groom, taken on their wedding day, started off with them holding hands before they ran towards a pool together. The bride was also seen holding her white wedding dress up, in preparation to jump into the water.However, moments before getting in the pool, the groom stepped to the side and pretended to do a jump, while letting go of his partner\u2019s hand. As a result, the bride ended up jumping into the water alone.The short clip ended with the groom looking down at his spouse in the water and laughing. Although it\u2019s unclear how the bride reacted to the prank, she did appear to be smiling, as she began to swim in the pool.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeAs the Lionesses take to the world stage following a historic summer in last year\u2019s European Championships, who are the unsung heroes who empowered women to take on the beautiful game?From the FA ban in 1921, to the wartime trailblazers and activists calling for a more diverse sport, it has taken incredible women to propel football to where it is today.Dick Kerr Ladies and Fodens Women\u2019s FCThe World Wars, despite the immense tragedy across the globe, shone a light on the contributions of women to society, and this extended to sport as well.\u201cWhen the men\u2019s teams were off at war, the women set up their own teams in factories for leisure,\u201d explains Carrie Dunn, author of The Reign Of The Lionesses: How European Glory Changed Women\u2019s Football In England.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow live\u201cThe Dick Kerr ladies were the most famous team, and represented Britain for a long time. They attracted thousands of fans to matches, so they were catalysts for the FA ban \u2013 as the crowds began to come in, and the FA did not think that was appropriate for women,\u201d she explains.The Dick Kerr ladies, who began as merely a factory team, refused to hang up their boots and continued playing in some capacity \u201cfor almost another 50 years\u201d, says Dunn.Similar to the Dick Kerr ladies, Fodens Ladies FC were initially a factory team based in the northwest, she adds. \u201cThey were one of a number of women\u2019s teams touring the world in the 1940s-60s.\u201d\u201cThere still was a demand for it, even though it was banned in England. They created a legacy for working-class women in football, organising their own leisure in a masculine domain. It shows incredible resilience.\u201dSheila Parker\u201cSheila Parker was the first official England captain,\u201d says Dunn. \u201cThere had been unofficial teams referred to as England, but when the FA organised themselves, she was the first official England captain. She was a mother of young children, a proper grown-up compared to the other women playing, and as a woman in the early 1970s, was dealing with the same things many of our players are now \u2013 playing football and motherhood.\u201dKerry DavisKerry Davis was the first black woman inducted into the National Football Museum Hall of Fame, and made her England debut in 1982.\u201cShe was the first official black female England international. Now, people are realising the need for diversity in the England team. It has been very important in the past year since the Euros, to acknowledge the history of the women\u2019s game and those that came before. There are still so many stories to tell,\u201d Dunn continues.Eniola Aluko\u201cEniola Aluko is a former England striker [first playing for the side in 2004] and qualified lawyer. She studied throughout her footballing career, which is amazing,\u201d notes Dunn.\u201cShe is most notable for powerful statements she made following an inquiry into racism in the England camp. She is pushing for diversity at the Lionesses level \u2013 these conversations are happening because of her.\u201dLaura McCallisterA vice president at UEFA, Laura McCallister \u201chas been in Welsh football her whole life and was one of three players lobbying UEFA in the Nineties to recognise women\u2019s football.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeRaz Schenirer was 20 when her mum entered her into the Miss Israel beauty pageant. Her national service had just finished, and she had some spare time before starting university \u2013 so, she thought, why not?The Miss Israel competition, which crowned Hollywood star Gal Gadot as a winner in 2004, was once one of hundreds of contests that take place annually around the globe, where women parade on stage in varying outfits, winning points for talent, personality, charity work and other criteria. Schenirer, now a writer based in New York, recalls standing in heels and a bikini, in front of a panel full of strangers \u2013 an experience that left her feeling broken and insecure and \u201clike a piece of meat\u201d.\u201cYou give so much power and control to somebody else,\u201d she tells me. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you think you\u2019re beautiful; you are there to be judged. It ruins your self worth.\u201d As she approached the final, she exercised excessively, leaving her constantly tired, hungry and angry. Eventually, she found herself in tears, but not knowing why; the more \u201cbeautiful\u201d she became, the less happy she felt. On a trip to Barcelona, she and her fellow contestants went to a restaurant. \u201cIt was so ironic because at the hotel before, girls were crying and we spent hours putting on makeup, trying to mask our insecurities. When we arrived, everyone turned to look at this group of young, beautiful women and they had no idea what we were actually going through. All that glitters is not gold.\u201dContests have long faced claims that they are shallow, sexist, racist and demeaning. In 1970, feminists famously flour-bombed the Miss World Pageant \u2013 which host Bob Hope had described as a \u201ccattle market\u201d \u2013 condemning it as oppressive and exploitative. (The story of the protest became the 2020 film Misbehaviour.) In 2014, a small town in Argentina banned beauty competitions on the grounds that they encourage violence against women. And Miss USA 2016, Deshauna Barber, explained that Black competitors still faced discrimination on the circuit when she won the crown seven years ago. And, in 2022, a decision was made to end the Miss Israel contest, with organisers not giving a reason, instead just quietly stating that the contest would not go ahead. But 10 years after Schenirer was told by judges to \u201cturn around so we can take a look at your cute little butt\u201d, pageantry is trying to clean up its image.While thousands of beauty pageants take place around the world every year, international competitors aim to make the finals for the prestigious \u201cBig Four\u201d: Miss World, Miss Universe, Miss International and Miss Earth. They are run by separate bodies and have different rounds and rules, but what all have in common is that they claim to advocate more than beauty. Now, contests claim to reward personality, intelligence, body positivity, social causes and charity work, alongside rounds in which competitors model swimsuits, national dress or evening gowns. The current Mrs GB, Dr Ana Nacvalovaite, for example, is a research fellow at the University of Oxford, with a master\u2019s degree in international human rights law and a DPhil on regulation of sovereign wealth funds. She also campaigns against domestic violence and helps businesses with their environmental and social responsibilities.\u202f (\u201cMiss\u201d competitions are for those up to the age of 28. Those that carry the title \u201cMrs\u201d are older.)RecommendedBetween Brexit and Covid, London\u2019s food scene has become a dog\u2019s dinner \u2013 can it be saved?Solitude used to mean sad singledom. Now it\u2019s become a status symbolConflict, toxic group chats and organised fun: How we came to despise the hen doNacvalovaite, slender and strikingly beautiful, with doll-like features and huge, expressive eyes, says pageantry is \u201ca very different world\u201d these days. She describes the women she competes alongside as strong, career-minded doctors, lawyers, policymakers and salon owners. Nacvalovaite says she has never dieted before a show, never felt uncomfortable before a panel and has never been made to feel demeaned or objectified. Competitions are something she enters for fun, to network and because they give her a voice. Thanks to the connections that she has formed on the circuits, she travels all over the world, judging and appearing in contests. After first getting involved with pageantry when she met Mrs France at a UN conference, she says she\u2019s even now able to carry out a form of \u201csoft diplomacy\u201d.\u201cIt is all great being an academic and talking to a variety of stakeholders, but what sometimes gets missed is the larger audience,\u201d Nacvalovaite explains. \u201cPageantry has given me a great platform to be able to talk about what it is that I do, and to learn about what other women do, and how we can integrate those relationships. The alliances that I have built are incredible.\u201d\n\nTo watch a revolving door of women be judged based on how well they perform femininity and parade across a stage feels like stepping back into the past in which women were seen but rarely heardBut why just women? Why aren\u2019t there competitions in which scantily-clad men are ranked on stage? There are, says Nacvalovaite. \u201cThere is Mr Universe, Mr World; there are many competitions for men. We just don\u2019t talk about it.\u202f Everybody can have a hobby and sometimes [pageantry] is looked down upon, but there\u2019s nothing wrong with being girly and dressing up and having a wonderful, glamorous time with other women and building solid friendships. I enjoy representing Great Britain.\u201dEven so, many women may struggle with the idea that increased professional esteem can happen after a swimsuit round. Whether women should be judged onstage for how well they wear a two-piece has been a subject shrouded in controversy. But that aspect of contests is changing, too. Miss World contestants no longer parade in bikinis, Miss Northern Ireland ditched the round this year, and Miss England debated bringing it back in after it was dropped in 2009 \u2013 but the move was abandoned last month. Even so, Nacvalovaite is happy appearing in a swimsuit onstage: \u201cIt is all very decent and elegant. Nobody forces you to do anything.\u201dHer view is shared by Katrina Hodge, who had originally campaigned to ban the Miss England swimwear round 13 years ago. Hodge, a former soldier who was decorated for bravery after saving the lives of five colleagues in Iraq, became known as \u201cCombat Barbie\u201d when she was crowned Miss England in 2009. She is now a beauty contest pro, judging competitions all over the world and running her own pageant, Miss Supranational UK.\u202f At the time, Hodge says, she \u201cwanted to get rid of that round because I didn\u2019t understand why you had to be the person whose figure looked the best in swimwear. I was very proud when it was removed because it opened the doors and since then we\u2019ve had rocket scientists and all sorts of women compete, as well as women from different religions and cultures.\u201dSince then, though, Hodge has U-turned, and now has a swimwear round in Miss Supranational UK to promote body positivity. She explains: \u201cIf somebody wants to go out on stage and feel fabulous in swimwear, they can. On Love Island, for example, people spend six to eight weeks on TV and in swimwear and nobody\u2019s pulling them apart. Those people go on to be millionaires. Nobody is being derogatory towards them because they\u2019re just young people enjoying themselves in swimwear. And what\u2019s wrong with that?Katrina Hodge and Raz Schenirer (Charlotte Clemie/Yaniv Sofer)\u201cAt my competition in April, I had girls that were a size 18 to 20. And they all said it was their favourite round. It\u2019s a really empowering moment having the crowd cheering for them. Points aren\u2019t awarded on the girls\u2019 figures; they are scored on confidence and personality. It\u2019s not about who looks the best in the swimsuit. It\u2019s about who comes out and owns it on stage.\u201dOwnership is an important notion, given that the competitions first came from commerce. The original pageant, Miss America, was born more than a century ago in response to a business problem. In 1920, the owner of the Monticello Hotel in Atlantic City hosted a parade of 300 young, attractive women to tempt more visitors. It\u2019s this commodification of the female body that bothers Raquel Rosario S\u00e1nchez, a writer, academic and spokeswoman for women\u2019s right\u2019s charity FiLiA. Rosario S\u00e1nchez says beauty pageants should be abolished as they are a \u201crelic of a patriarchal culture that glorifies the objectification of women\u201d.Beauty pageants give the message that women are \u201cpassive objects to be ogled at and judged\u201d, she says, a message that is \u201cincompatible with a culture that seeks to eradicate sexual harassment\u201d.\u201cTo watch a revolving door of women be judged based on how well they perform femininity and parade across a stage feels like stepping back into a distant past in which women were seen but rarely heard,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you were to remove the element of objectification from these contests, you would have a competition where women are fully dressed; if they are doctors, they would be dressed as doctors, if they are engineers, they would be dressed as engineers.\u201cLook at the industry behind these events; the amount of time, effort and money spent on women to parade them in front of crowds who then judge them. It is a business machinery that is all about reducing women \u2013 and there is no real way to modernise that. The contestants\u2019 skin colour may vary more these days, but amid all the changes and nods to inclusivity, there is still no room for wide noses, disabilities or stretch marks in beauty pageants. The ugly reality is that this is just putting a veneer on something that is at its core is just about judging women in a way that men would never be judged.\u201dDr Ana Nacvalovaite, the current Mrs Great Britain (Olga Luka)Recommended Gemma Atkinson announces birth of second baby in heartwarming Instagram postHarry, Meghan\u2019s \u2018request to fly Air Force One after Queen\u2019s funeral denied\u2019Couple doing IVF lets their dog decide baby\u2019s sex through ultimate game of catchThis was a message received loud and clear by Schenirer, now 31, who says her short time on the beauty circuit irreparably destroyed her confidence. \u201cI remember who I was before. There\u2019s a sort of carelessness that young women have. You just think that you\u2019re great because maybe your parents or your girlfriends told you that you\u2019re beautiful your whole life,\u201d she explains. \u201cAnd then, doing the pageants just for three and a half months, my confidence crashed because of how people looked at me.\u201dBut for Nacvalovaite, who is now helping to judge the Mrs India competition, beauty runs deeper than appearance \u2013 which is the point modern day pageants are trying to make. She adds: \u201cPeople generally underestimate women as the weaker sex. But what I have witnessed is quite extraordinary, in the way that they interact and the way that they build friendships. This international pageant has shown me that women build tremendous bridges, and that is a huge benefit to the countries they represent.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b9406c51ac331da6c7c129", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/royal-family/harry-meghan-markle-biden-queens-funeral-b2378479.html", "primaryCategory": "Royal Family", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Prince Harry and Meghan weren\u2019t allowed to fly Air Force One with Biden after Queen\u2019s funeral, report says", "lead": "<p>Duke and Duchess of Sussex reportedly requested ride back to US aboard Air Force One after Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s funeral in September</p>", "author": "Meredith Clark", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 04:14:32", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:10:52.945088", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-20T04:14:32+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/19/22/harry%20meghan%20air%20force%20one.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Stay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletterStay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeA TikTok couple undergoing IVF in the hopes of getting pregnant let their dog decide the sex of their baby in the ultimate game of fetch. After many undiagnosed infertility issues, Serena Cukjati, 35, and her husband Jacob opted for \u201cin vitro fertilisation,\u201d otherwise known as IVF. The pair were exhausted by the constant disappointment every time a pregnancy test came back negative. However, through the hardship, their cherished goldendoodle Charlie would always uplift their spirits with cuddles on the couch. \u201cThere were so many low points in our journey to conceive, and he would pull me out of the darkness,\u201d Serena told Today.During their IVF journey, the Texas-based couple found out that they had two female embryos and one male embryo. Serena recalled feeling \u201cecstatic\u201d and panicked upon hearing the news. \u201cWe were ecstatic. But all of the sudden we had this decision in front of us - do we transfer the boy or the girl? We just couldn\u2019t decide,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a really cool perk, and a First World problem for sure, but it also felt like a burden. It was just too much.\u201d Rather than decide themselves, the couple left the decision up to their loyal pet. According to Serena, she felt Charlie deserved recognition for the support he\u2019s provided her and Jacob during their difficult time. Serena took to her TikTok to post a\u00a0video of Charlie choosing the baby\u2019s gender\u00a0on 30 June. She and Jacob explained that one lone tennis ball was labeled, \u201cgirl,\u201d and another, \u201cboy.\u201dRecommendedTikTokers are showing off pink outfits they\u2019re going to wear to watch Barbie movieFans love Miles Teller and Chace Crawford dancing to Bad Bunny on golf course: \u2018A reason to play golf\u2019Viral $4,600 dinner bill video divides internet over check splitting etiquetteCharlie and his Labrador retriever sister Kiki were shown on screen before Jacob chucked the two balls in front of him, prompting the dogs to take off in the same direction. While Kiki isn\u2019t the biggest fan of fetch, Charlie appeared torn between which ball to pick up and bring back to his mom.Eventually, the goldendoodle dropped the answer at Serena\u2019s feet. However, the couple didn\u2019t reveal whether it was the boy or girl ball because they plan on making a big announcement after the IVF transfer on 25 July. Although there is a possibility that the embryo won\u2019t implant a pregnancy, Serena and Jacob are remaining positive. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to think about it not working,\u201d Serena admitted.As for their decision to leave the decision up to their dog, Serena said she and her husband felt it was the perfect way of \u201ccelebrating\u201d Charlie.\u201cWe both thought it was the perfect idea to let him pick,\u201d Serena explained. \u201cSo many times, dogs get the short end of the stick. They support us when we\u2019re going through a hard time, but when we\u2019re doing well, they\u2019re not as needed. So, this was a way of celebrating Charlie and incorporating him into this new season of life.\u201dMeanwhile, Charlie is sticking to his pick. Serena revealed that, when her niece came over, she threw both balls again to see which Charlie would go for, and he grabbed the same one. \u201cWe have both balls laying around here, but he\u2019ll only play with that one ball. He\u2019s fully invested,\u201d Serena told Today.

The first person to be open and talk about her feelings,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe first person you\u2019d turn to when you needed to talk about yours. And the last person you\u2019d think would take her own life.\u201dAs Grima recalled how her best friend died by suicide on 1 March 2022, she acknowledged how her death affected students at Stanford, and opened up about her grief since.\u201cHer death shocked the entire Stanford campus, and the entire soccer world. For me, and for the rest of her close friends, it left a void in our lives that is so deep that it\u2019s impossible to put into words,\u201d she continued. \u201cGrief doesn\u2019t work like you think it will. It\u2019s not a straight line. It\u2019s not a formula. It\u2019s a mess.\u201dThe football player added that, while there are days where it feels like Meyer\u2019s death \u201cjust happened,\u201d there are also days when she has \u201ca random memory\u201d and feels her emotions\u00a0\u201cso hard again\u201d. She then reflected on the \u201ceveryday moments\u201d and memories with Meyer that have stayed with her.\u201cWhen you lose a true friend, the hardest part isn\u2019t the big moments,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s actually the small ones. It\u2019s the everyday, boring moments in life that they made so fun, and so funny, and so meaningful.\u201dOne of the things Girma missed most about her friendship with Meyer, she wrote, was going to Starbucks together after practice and working on some homework.\u201cWe\u2019d start studying for about 15 minutes before someone slammed their laptop shut and said, \u2018Wait, real quick,\u2019\u201d Girma added. \u201cThus began two hours of shooting the s*** and procrastinating and laughing until it hurt.\u201dThe athlete specified how one memory with Meyer has now come full circle, as she recalled how her pal once told her: \u201cYou\u2019re going to make the national team, Nay. You\u2019re going to play in the World Cup.\u201d After telling Meyer that she \u201cwas right,\u201d Girma acknowledged that none of her success \u201cwould have happened without\u201d her.\u201cYou touched so many people\u2019s lives in just 22 years. You wanted to change the world more than anyone I\u2019ve ever known,\u201d she said, referring to Meyer. \u201cSo we\u2019re going to make sure that we carry on your legacy. We\u2019re going to make sure that your light never goes out.\u201dGirma explained that in order to honour her friend\u2019s legacy, she \u201cpartnered with Common Goal to launch a mental health initiative during this World Cup that we hope will save lives\u201d and noted that her teammates on the USWNT have helped her with this project.\u201cWe know how important it is to destigmatise the conversation around mental health, especially for the millions of young people around the country who will be watching this World Cup, so FOX Sports will be dedicating 1 per cent of its broadcast coverage to spotlighting the importance of mental health across all its platforms,\u201d Girma said. \u201cWe know first-hand how many people, especially student athletes, are struggling in silence, and we want to use our platform in this huge moment for something bigger than soccer.\u201dHowever, according to the football star, when the World Cup is over she plans to \u201csend out mental health professionals to youth sports organisations in communities across the country, to make sure that the coaches and players have the tools and skills to know when someone is dealing with a mental health issue, and how to get the proper help\u201d.Girma confessed that, while it isn\u2019t \u201ceasy to talk about\u201d Meyer\u2019s death on \u201cthe eve of the World Cup,\u201d she still wants to pay tribute to her through her mental health initiative.\u201cI know what an honour it is to be a part of a World Cup team. I know all about the pressure and expectations,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBut I know how precious life is, too. I know how many people are suffering. I know that the people who are smiling the most, and laughing the loudest, and loving people the hardest, and shining the brightest...sometimes, they\u2019re going through things that you could never imagine. We want to help them shoulder the burden.\u201dShe added: \u201cThrough this project, her spirit, her warmth, and her legacy will live on. We will make sure of that. This World Cup is for you, my friend.In addition to Girma\u2019s work, Meyer\u2019s parents, Gina and Steve, also created the Katie\u2019s Save initiative, with the goal of \u201cspreading awareness in support of implementing necessary changes nationwide, as well as speaking to Nationwide University Administrators to promote student safety and well-being\u201d.The initiative aims to create a university policy that would require an institution to send an email to a \u201cdesignated advocate\u201d of the student during different instances, such as when students have \u201cemotional or mental health visit(s) that result in prescription medication at the Student Health Department, campus counselling office, a local ER\u201d.The proposed policy for Katie\u2019s Save was first launched in June 2022, months before Meyer\u2019s parents first sued Stanford University for the wrongful death of their child and claimed that the school \u201cfailed to respond to Katie\u2019s expression of distress\u201d.\u00a0 At the time, university spokesperson Dee Mostofi issued a statement to reject the allegations.\u201cThe Stanford community continues to grieve Katie\u2019s tragic death and we sympathise with her family for the unimaginable pain that Katie\u2019s passing has caused them,\u201d she wrote. \u201cHowever, we strongly disagree with any assertion that the university is responsible for her death. While we have not seen the formal complaint brought by the Meyer family, we are aware of some of the allegations made in the filing, which are false and misleading.\u201dOn 22 July, Girma\u2019s team will be playing against Vietnam\u2019s national team in its first game for this year\u2019s FIFA World Cup.RecommendedWoman divides viewers after revealing Hinge date asked if he could pop her pimpleHarry, Meghan\u2019s \u2018request to fly Air Force One after Queen\u2019s funeral denied\u2019Bill Gates\u2019 rep responds to rumours that he is engagedIf you are experiencing feelings of distress, or are struggling to cope, you can speak to the Samaritans, in confidence, on 116 123 (UK and ROI), email jo@samaritans.org, or visit the Samaritans website to find details of your nearest branch.If you are based in the USA, and you or someone you know needs mental health assistance right now, call the National Suicide Prevention Helpline on 1-800-273-TALK (8255).

According to Bleacher Report, she told ESPNW: \u201cI\u2019m gay. Megan\u2019s my girlfriend. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019ve not lived my life. I think people have this assumption that if you\u2019re not talking about it, you must be hiding it, like it\u2019s this secret. That was never the case for me.\u201dAddressing her potential critics, Bird added: \u201cIt\u2019s happening when it\u2019s happening because that\u2019s what feels right. So even though I understand there are people who think I should have done it sooner, it wasn\u2019t right for me at the time. I have to be true to that. It\u2019s my journey.\u201dRapinoe publicly identified herself as \u201cgay\u201d in her 2012 Out Magazine feature story. Couple posed together for ESPN\u2019s Body Issue in 2018 The US women\u2019s national star and the former Seattle Storm point guard posed nude for ESPN The Magazine\u2019s Body Issue together as the first same-sex couple to be featured. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to do these things first. It\u2019s important for people to come out. Visibility is important,\u201d Rapinoe said in the accompanying interview. \u201cI feel like [there are] a lot of negative ideas that hopefully I can break down just by being myself. Not only are we female athletes, but we\u2019re dating as well. It\u2019s kind of badass.\u201d At the time, Bird admitted she was excited to look back on the shoot in a few years. Bird publicly expressed support for Rapinoe\u2019s comments about White House visit in 2019During a video filmed in July before the World Cup, Rapinoe conveyed zero interest in visiting the White House if the country\u2019s national women\u2019s soccer team won the championship title. She said: \u201cI will not go to the f***ing White House.\u201d Former president Donald Trump tweeted in response to the athlete\u2019s message said: \u201cMegan should WIN first before she TALKS. Megan should never disrespect our Country, the White House or our flag.\u201dBird understood why Rapinoe refused to go and outwardly supported her decision in an essay she wrote for The Players\u2019 Tribune. \u201cMegan, man \u2026 I\u2019ll tell you what. You just cannot shake that girl. She\u2019s going to do her thing, at her own damn speed, to her own damn rhythm, and she\u2019s going to apologise to exactly NO ONE for it,\u201d Bird wrote. \u201cSo when all the Trump business started to go down last week, I mean - the fact that Megan just seemed completely unfazed? It\u2019s strange to say, but that was probably the only normal thing about it. It\u2019s not an act with her.\u201dWhen the US team won later that month, the 2002 first overall WNBA draft pick was in the stands for her partner\u2019s victory and immediately ran up to Rapinoe to give her a champion\u2019s kiss. Couple became engaged in 2020 In October 2020, Rapinoe discussed the possibility of marriage during an interview with People, where she revealed that the pair had \u201ctalked\u201d about the prospect of tying the knot.A week later, Rapinoe proposed to her partner of four years, with Bird sharing the news of their engagement on Instagram. In the photo, the WNBA champion could be seen standing in an infinity pool while Rapinoe, who was kneeling on one knee, placed a ring on her finger.Rapinoe showed support for her fianc\u00e9e in 2021In April of 2021, Rapinoe showed immense love and support for her fianc\u00e9e in her activism efforts, and then again in July when Bird won her fifth Olympic Gold in Tokyo. An Instagram post of the two women kissing on the sidelines read: \u201cI am so proud of you @sbird10. As if I could love you any more. Congrats baby!\u201dSpeaking to NBC about Bird\u2019s win, Rapinoe continued to praise her hard work. \u201c[I\u2019m] honestly inspired, and I told her the other day, it feels, like, corny to say but it\u2019s like everything you would want in someone that you would look up to. Obviously, I get to be with her and I love her, that\u2019s the most special part,\u201d she said. In 2022, Bird discussed potential wedding plans before announcing her retirement Bird discussed wedding plans with People for the first time since December 2020 in March 2022, when she hinted that the couple may host their nuptials in Mexico. \u201cWe\u2019re kind of toying with having a wedding in Mexico maybe. So there\u2019ll definitely be Coronas on deck. I can count on that for sure,\u201d she said.On 16 June, Bird stunned fans with the news of her retirement in an Instagram post. \u201cI\u2019ve decided this will be my final year.

Brach then told the hosts that they were all wrong, before revealing that dermatologists recommend people shower two to three times a week.In response, Jones said: \u201cWhat? There are seven days in the week!\u201d Brach then clarified that, while the consensus is to shower two to three times a week, it depends on the person and the kind of \u201clifestyle\u201d they live.RecommendedAl Roker shares health update after second knee replacement surgeryAl Roker discusses being a first-time grandfather to his granddaughter SkyMother sparks viral debate for \u2018shaming\u2019 parent who refused to give her daughter a slice of cakeThe clarification was met with confusion from Roker, who could be seen with a confused look on his face as he questioned: \u201cLifestyle?!\u201d Brach went on to give examples about when people may shower more often in a week, such as if they\u2019re someone who \u201chas a labourious job\u201d.When Brach said that how frequently you shower is based on \u201cpersonal preference,\u201d Roker chimed in to disagree, adding: \u201cNot if you come in contact with other people!\u201dBrach noted that the suggestion comes from dermatologists, who are aware that showering too much may lead to skin issues, such as dry skin or eczema. However, Roker maintained an unimpressed and disappointed look on his face as the conversation about showering habits continued. Roker then revealed that his hygiene habits are different from dermatologists\u2019 suggestions, as he explained: \u201cI shower twice a day,\u201d prompting Jones to respond: \u201cThat\u2019s too much.\u201dIn the comments of Today\u2019s Instagram post about the topic, many fans agreed with and were amused by Roker\u2019s response to the shower question.\u201cWe are all Al!\u201d one fan wrote, while another added: \u201c@alroker is my face.\u201dA third wrote: \u201cI live in Louisiana.

Unless you\u2019re camping or sick or have kids lol.\u201dAccording to The Cleveland Clinic, there isn\u2019t a set rule for how often people should shower a week, with the health organisation noting that \u201csomeone who runs five miles every day\u201d will probably need to shower more often than \u201csomeone who rarely breaks a sweat\u201d.Although the hosts of Today said that people should generally shower two to three times a week, according to dermatologists, this isn\u2019t always the case. Speaking to the Cleveland Clinic, dermatologist Shilpi Khetarpal, MD, notes that people should try to shower every day.\u201cWe come in contact with thousands of allergens every day. Showering rinses off those allergens, as well as bacteria and viruses,\u201d she said.However, she also noted that people don\u2019t have to shower an excessive amount in one day, for the sake of protecting their skin.\u201cSome people shower in the morning, after the gym, then again before bed,\u201d she added. \u201cThat\u2019s not necessary, and can be very drying and irritating for your skin.\u201dSpeaking to Today, Dr Mary Stevenson, assistant professor of dermatology at NYU Langone Health, also revealed dermatologists \u201clike to say keep it to three minutes and keep it lukewarm\u201d when it comes to showering. Earlier this year, the Today show hosts found themselves in another on-air debate about hygiene over a discussion about how often they wash their clothes.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeJane Birkin, style mogul and the namesake behind the most expensive bag in the world, has died at age 76. On Sunday 16 July, the British-born actress and singer was found deceased inside her Paris apartment, with French President Emmanuel Macron confirming her death in a tweet, in which he described her \u201ca French icon\u201d.The icon became the muse for Herm\u00e8s\u2019 archetypal accessory and defined the classic Parisian-chic look in the 70s. Since Birkin\u2019s unlikely 1981 run-in with the brand\u2019s former chairman and head designer, she\u2019s held the highest of honours in luxury fashion. The chance encounter happened when Birkin found herself on the same Air France flight as Herm\u00e8s executive Jean-Louis Dumas when a bag that was holding her belongings broke and she angrily blamed Herm\u00e8s for not making a big enough bag to fit her stuff. She complained out loud, unaware that the brand\u2019s artistic director was sitting directly next to her. Not long after, the French fashion house debuted the \u201cBirkin bag,\u201d only offered in a large size to satisfy her wishes. RecommendedJane Birkin death: \u2018Je t\u2019aime... moi non plus\u2019 singer and actor dies aged 76The most iconic Herm\u00e8s Birkin bags inspired by Jane BirkinJane Birkin: Singer, actor and inspiration behind iconic Birkin bag dies aged 76Birkin recalled the consequential interaction in a 2020 interview with Christiane Amanpour from CNN, where she remembered: \u201cI said: \u2018Why don\u2019t you make a bag that\u2019s sort-of four times the [size of the] Kelly that you could just leave open and sort of half the size of my suitcase?\u2019\u201dShe continued: \u201cHe said: \u2018well, draw it for me.\u2019 And I think I drew it on the sick bag, a vomit bag in the aeroplane.\u201dEventually, Dumas turned Birkin\u2019s wishes into a reality. Before she went to purchase the accessory she inspired, Dumas told her she could have one free of charge if he could name it after her. In a 2012 interview with Vogue, Birkin admitted the Herm\u00e8s had paid her \u00a330,000 for her annual royalty, but she opted to donate the money to her preferred charities. \u201cI got Herm\u00e8s to fork out for my charities once I saw the fortune they were making. A certain amount of money every year goes straight to my charity and it will continue to after my death,\u201d she said while speaking to WWD in 2011. Herm\u00e8s will continue to honour her legace by donating to Birkin\u2019s preferred charities in the wake of her passing.Known to cost upwards of $10,000, the Birkin bag is a status symbol as much as an emblem of the relationship between designer goods and practicality. With a waitlist and limited supply of this delicately crafted leather accessory, an air of exclusivity is achieved amongst the fortuitous owners. Vintage models from previous collections are priced and sold anywhere between $30,000 and $500,000 depending on their year, according to Sothebys. These highly regarded handbags mesh conservative and mod fashion codes, celebrating the intersection between Birkin\u2019s and Herm\u00e8s\u2019 styles. However, following a 2015 investigation into the brand by PETA, which revealed the treatment of crocodiles for their skin, Birkin requested that her name be removed from the bags that were made out of the animal. \u201cJane Birkin has expressed her concerns regarding practices for slaughtering crocodiles. Her comments do not in any way influence the friendship and confidence that we have shared for many years. Herm\u00e8s respects and shares her emotions and was also shocked by the images recently broadcast,\u201d the fashion house said at the time.Herm\u00e8s respected her decision then, but she ended up dropping her request as she was satisfied with how the brand handled the situation, labelling it as an \u201cisolated irregularity.\u201d In a statement, the brand said: \u201cJane Birkin has advised us that she is satisfied by the measures taken by Herm\u00e8s.\u201dShe was known for her transcendent performances both on set and stage as a movie star and singer, respectively. However, Birkin\u2019s \u201cFrench girl\u201d aesthetic will have forever affected the fashion industry\u2019s perception of timeless looks. Birkin was a trendsetter, but not in a cyclical way. She would don silk blouses with sheer tights, monochromatic pieces decorated with statement belts, and pendant necklaces. Birkin, who previously favoured large wicker baskets to hold her belongings instead of handbags, would wear a simple white T-shirt and vintage denim combination, taking the most effortless outfit making it elegant.Following the creation of the Birkin bag, she was also looked to as the perfect example for how the expensive bag was meant to be used, with Birkin photographed with her own overflowing Herm\u00e8s handbag on a number of occasions.RecommendedThe most iconic Herm\u00e8s Birkin bags inspired by Jane BirkinKim Kardashian\u2019s Skims is now worth $4bnTikTokers are showing off pink outfits they\u2019re going to wear to watch Barbie movie\u201cI love the way she wears her bag...

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeA TikTok video of a dinner party arguing resulted in an internet uproar over how best to split the check at the end of a meal. Victor Christian (@Viccgotti) shared the controversial ending to a birthday celebration with friends on 17 July that has now reached more than 14.4 million views. In the video, Christian focused the camera on the group\u2019s discussion whether or not they should all split the bill. He said: \u201cI\u2019m only paying for what\u2019s on the check, I\u2019m not splitting the bill.\u201d Christian, along with one other friend, agreed that everyone should only pay for what they consumed, so no one is left paying for what they didn\u2019t have. The longer version of the video, uploaded later that day, revealed that the total amount for the dinner was $4,600. \u201cY\u2019ALL STORY TIME THIS GIRL WAS MY BEST FRIEND SINCE THE third grade \u2026 and she got in front of her other friends and started acting funny with me they call me and our friends broke because we didn\u2019t want to pay a $4,600 bill,\u201d his caption read. In Christian\u2019s second post, he captured a woman saying she shouldn\u2019t be forced to pay for dinner because it\u2019s her birthday. However, the TikToker said he believed that, because he and another friend didn\u2019t drink, they should not need to pay for the bottles of liquor that were ordered and consumed by the rest of their party.

Cause it seems so embarrassing,\u201d one person said. \u201cI don\u2019t know, this look staged,\u201d another skeptical viewer agreed. As the Christian\u2019s views continued to skyrocket, the conversation around what to do with big parties at dinner flooded Twitter. User @Shannonsharpeee reposted Christian\u2019s video, gaining an additional 17 million views and over 8,900 comments. Speaking with Insider, Christian admitted the video may have been a bit exaggerated. \u201cWe probably did maybe over exaggerate a little bit for camera,\u201d he said. The stunned social media user said he couldn\u2019t believe how quickly his video had blown up and confessed his friendship with one of the individuals at the dinner was now ruined because he refused to pay any amount more than what his personal meal cost.

In 2021, she told BT Sport how the abuse she received led her to contemplate suicide. She wants to see that change for everyone.\u201cIt is important to try and educate people \u2013 saying not nice things is harmful. I wouldn\u2019t want anyone else to go through things I\u2019ve been through. They\u2019re all societal issues, not just exclusive to those who are in media or sport. That\u2019s why I often speak about it, because these issues \u2013 in terms of social media \u2013 happen to young boys and young girls \u2013 it\u2019s not exclusive to someone that\u2019s famous, it happens to everyone.\u201cI\u2019ve tried to be positive and make positive differences, and just try and be better every day.\u00a0 That\u2019s all you can do, right?\u201dDespite having done extensive work as a commentator for broadcasters like Sky Sports and ITV, retiring was a difficult choice.\u201cI was heartbroken.

The jackpot now stands at an estimated $1bn for the next drawing on Wednesday 19 July. According to Powerball, the multi-million-dollar prize currently ranks as the seventh largest US lottery jackpot and third largest Powerball jackpot.However, there were more than 2.8m winning tickets nationwide in Monday night\u2019s drawing. The top-winning tickets on Monday included five tickets that matched all five white balls to win $1m prizes. There were also 88 tickets that won $50,000 prizes and 28 tickets that won $200,000 prizes.If a player matches all six numbers during Wednesday night\u2019s drawing, they will have the option to take home the $1bn paid out over 30 years, or be given a cash lump sum option of $516.8m before taxes.To play Powerball, players must pick five numbers between one and 69 and then choose one Powerball number between one to 26. The first five numbers drawn appear on the white balls, while the Powerball number is shown using a red ball.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeAs temperatures continue to reach record highs, Americans are travelling to the US coasts for reprieve from the sweltering heat and heading to the beach. But beach-goers are being advised to keep their wits about them due to the recent increase in the number of reported shark attacks and sightings.At least four people were injured in Long Island, New York, as a result of shark encounters this summer and elsewhere beaches are being closed or closely monitored as fears of shark attacks rise.While experts assure us that this recent string of attacks isn\u2019t necessarily a cause for concern, as shark attacks continue to be \u201crare,\u201d they\u2019ve also provided us with the tools we need to decrease the likelihood of an attack.Dr Neil Hammerschlag, a marine ecologist, research associate professor at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science and Abess Center for Ecosystem Science and Policy, and director of the Shark Research and Conservation Program (SRC), told The Independent that people should avoid swimming in the ocean in places and at times where it would be easy for a shark to mistake you as prey, such as at night, or in murky water, where \u201cit can be hard for a shark to tell the difference between your hand or a fish\u201d.Though, he emphasises, it is important to remember \u201cshark bites are rare\u201d because \u201chumans are just not on the menu for sharks\u201d.RecommendedTeen recounts terrifying shark attack off coast of New York\u2019s Fire IslandEight-foot-long shark washes up on Long Island beach in latest New York shark sightingNew York City beaches closed to swimmers until further notice after multiple shark sightingsDr Hammerschlag also advises against swimming in areas of the ocean where you know there are a lot of fish, such as where people are fishing, as \u201csharks are attracted\u201d to these areas due to the ease in which they can find food. \u201cA fish that gets caught on a fishing line and is bleeding and struggling is a dinner bell to the shark,\u201d he explained. \u201cMany sharks seek out places where people fish in the hopes of catching an easy meal.\u201dSwimmers should also avoid places where a river mouth meets the ocean, as he noted that rivers can pour a lot of nutrients and sand into the ocean, leading to poor visibility. These areas, which are heavy in nutrients and small organisms, also attract bigger animals looking for prey. Dr Hammerschlag said it is also important to remember that there is \u201csafety in numbers\u201d and that, generally, one should not swim in a remote area alone.To further decrease the risk of attracting a shark, Dr Hammerschlag recommends taking your jewellery off before catching some waves, as the shininess can catch light and be attractive to sharks due to the resemblance to a fish scale. For his final piece of advice, which he noted is \u201cone of the most important,\u201d Dr Hammerschlag said to follow your gut and instinct. \u201cMany people that were bitten said they had a weird feeling, or that their inner voice told them to get out of the water,\u201d he told us. \u201cIt\u2019s very possible that our subconscious is identifying something our conscious isn\u2019t. It isn\u2019t scientific, but listen to your gut.\u201dIn the \u201cunlikely scenario\u201d that a shark does approach you while you are swimming in the ocean, Dr Hammerschlag said there are also a few things that swimmers can do to decrease the likelihood they will be bitten.One of the most important things he suggests a swimmer do is to maintain eye contact with the animal. He noted that they are \u201cambush predators\u201d and find themselves uncomfortable when they are looked at.\u201cThe most important thing to remember is, if you see a shark, maintain eye contact with the shark because they are ambush predators and they don\u2019t appear to like to be looked at,\u201d he explained. \u201cIn the natural world, one way to tell your predator they can\u2019t sneak up on you is to maintain eye contact.\u201dDr Hammerschlag said this also means manoeuvring your body the same way as the shark. \u201cIf the shark swims to the left, you also swim to the left,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you are following it with your eyes and your body, it tells the shark you see it and it can\u2019t ambush you.\u201dAs for what you should not do, he stressed the importance of remaining calm and avoiding the instinct to swim away as quickly as possible. Swimmers that are flailing around may accidentally suggest to the shark that they are food. \u201cFood runs away from predators. You don\u2019t want to act like food,\u201d he said, before adding that, instead, swimmers should walk or swim backwards slowly while maintaining eye contact. \u201cHumans are much bigger than most other things in the ocean, I would follow the shark to let it know you see it and you\u2019re alerted to it and I would back up slowly. Walk or swim backwards in the direction of the exit,\u201d he said.Dr Hammerschlag also encouraged those who find themselves face-to-face with a shark to avoid trying to \u201cmake contact\u201d with the animal, as it can anger the shark rather than deter it.\u201cNever try to make contact with the shark,\u201d he said. \u201cThey usually don\u2019t want to swim up and bite someone. If you swing or punch it, you\u2019re more likely to cause distress and elicit an aggressive response or end up putting your hand in its mouth. Last thing you want to do is whack at it.\u201dHowever, those who are swimming with an object such as a snorkel or surfboard can place it in between themselves and the shark as a barrier, according to Dr Hammerschlag, who said the shark will be able to tell \u201cthere\u2019s a physical barrier\u201d.\u201cThe best thing to do is maintain eye contact, don\u2019t try and hit it, give personal space and just try to back out slowly and calmly, but keep looking in the direction it was,\u201d he summed up. \u201cBut obviously yell for help and someone can help you.\u201dIf the above doesn\u2019t work, and the shark continues to approach or tries to bite, Dr Hammerschlag said individuals should fight back by aiming for the snout or very sensitive areas such as the gills or eyes.While he reiterated that it\u2019s \u201cvery unlikely\u201d you will be bitten, if you are, he said to fight back \u201cas hard as you can\u201d. \u201cBang and punch and kick whatever you can and yell. Do not play dead. They\u2019re likely to let you go,\u201d he said.As for why a shark would bite a human, Dr Hammerschlag told us that it could be for any number of reasons, including that the animal is hungry or simply curious. In the majority of shark attack cases, he says that the animal bites just once, as \u201cthey realise you\u2019re not a natural prey item, or the person screamed and they started kicking, and the shark didn\u2019t anticipate that\u201d.Of course, there are some cases where a shark will return and bite again. In these rare instances, it is worth remembering that the sharks are predators and that they may view you as potential prey, according to Dr Hammerschlag.If you are bitten by a shark, Dr Hammerschlag said the most important thing to do is call for help. The next step is to \u201cdo whatever you can to stop the bleeding\u201d.The American Lifeguard Association corroborated that advice, with a spokesperson telling us that, if bitten, \u201cattempt to stop or slow the bleeding even before leaving the water by using direct pressure on the wound\u201d.\u201cLeave the water as quickly and calmly as possible,\u201d the ALA said, adding that victims should \u201cget urgent medical attention, no matter how minor the injury is\u201d.As for how to assist someone who has been bitten by a shark, the ALA said the first step should be \u201cnotifying the beach patrol or lifeguard and calling 911 as soon as possible\u201d.The victim should then be removed from the water. The ALA notes that \u201cextreme care\u201d should be used when doing so, and that it is important to not \u201cendanger yourself\u201d. They advise that the best method for removing a shark bite victim from the water is by boat or jet sky. \u201cRemember that a rescuer should always ensure the scene is safe to approach and always try to reach, throw or row to them but do not enter the water unless you are a trained lifeguard and have the proper equipment to assist,\u201d the ALA stated.The rescuer should then attempt to stop the bleeding \u201cby employing direct pressure,\u201d and if necessary, using a tourniquet. After the victim has been removed from the water, the ALA advises against moving them unless necessary, and \u201cprotecting the victim from the cold by wrapping them in a blanket to reduce body heat loss\u201d.\u201cStay with the victim, continue to control the bleeding, monitor vital signs, and wait until the Emergency Medical Services take over,\u201d the ALA said.While there have been a number of shark attack reports this summer and last, Dr Hammerschlag isn\u2019t surprised. He said it should be expected as a result of the number of people in the ocean. \u201cSharks in the ocean is common. They live in the ocean and that\u2019s where you\u2019re going to find them,\u201d he said, adding that, when there are more people in the ocean, it \u201cobviously increases chances of a shark bite because it\u2019s a numbers game\u201d.He went on to say that the number of shark encounters may increase as a result of climate change. \u201cWaters that were too cold for those species are now becoming warm enough to make them habitable,\u201d Dr Hammerschlag explained, before sharing that warmer waters increase shark metabolisms, which in turn may increase the need for the animals to feed. \u201cWarmer water tends to speed up metabolism, so it might increase their need to feed, which might make them curious and come to areas looking for potential food,\u201d he said. He also referenced a study he published on tiger sharks, which found that tiger sharks are migrating further north and spending more time there because waters off the northeast are warming at a much higher rate.While there is always the possibility of a shark encounter when swimming in the ocean, Dr Hammerschlag reiterated that shark bites are \u201creally rare\u201d and that the fear around them may have more to do with a \u201cprimordial fear\u201d of the creatures living in the ocean.RecommendedPassengers sing Taylor Swift on delayed flight: \u2018This was so unnecessary\u2019Influencer Annabelle Ham dies at age 22: \u2018A light to the world\u2019Inside the UK\u2019s Barbie-inspired dreamhouses\u201cWe have this primordial fear. On land, we have conquered everything, but in the ocean, we have this innate fear of swimming and something coming up and eating you,\u201d he said. \u201cIt makes you so much more scared of it and the situation so much more sensationalised.\u201dAs for the likelihood of a shark attack, the ALA said: \u201cYou have a greater chance of dying from a lightning bolt than a shark attack,\u201d while Dr Hammerschlag added: \u201cIf you never want a shark bite, don\u2019t go in the water.

You don\u2019t want to act like food,\u201d he said, before adding that, instead, swimmers should walk or swim backwards slowly while maintaining eye contact. \u201cHumans are much bigger than most other things in the ocean, I would follow the shark to let it know you see it and you\u2019re alerted to it and I would back up slowly. Walk or swim backwards in the direction of the exit,\u201d he said.Dr Hammerschlag also encouraged those who find themselves face-to-face with a shark to avoid trying to \u201cmake contact\u201d with the animal, as it can anger the shark rather than deter it.\u201cNever try to make contact with the shark,\u201d he said. \u201cThey usually don\u2019t want to swim up and bite someone. If you swing or punch it, you\u2019re more likely to cause distress and elicit an aggressive response or end up putting your hand in its mouth. Last thing you want to do is whack at it.\u201dHowever, those who are swimming with an object such as a snorkel or surfboard can place it in between themselves and the shark as a barrier, according to Dr Hammerschlag, who said the shark will be able to tell \u201cthere\u2019s a physical barrier\u201d.\u201cThe best thing to do is maintain eye contact, don\u2019t try and hit it, give personal space and just try to back out slowly and calmly, but keep looking in the direction it was,\u201d he summed up. \u201cBut obviously yell for help and someone can help you.\u201dIf the above doesn\u2019t work, and the shark continues to approach or tries to bite, Dr Hammerschlag said individuals should fight back by aiming for the snout or very sensitive areas such as the gills or eyes.While he reiterated that it\u2019s \u201cvery unlikely\u201d you will be bitten, if you are, he said to fight back \u201cas hard as you can\u201d. \u201cBang and punch and kick whatever you can and yell. Do not play dead. They\u2019re likely to let you go,\u201d he said.As for why a shark would bite a human, Dr Hammerschlag told us that it could be for any number of reasons, including that the animal is hungry or simply curious. In the majority of shark attack cases, he says that the animal bites just once, as \u201cthey realise you\u2019re not a natural prey item, or the person screamed and they started kicking, and the shark didn\u2019t anticipate that\u201d.Of course, there are some cases where a shark will return and bite again. In these rare instances, it is worth remembering that the sharks are predators and that they may view you as potential prey, according to Dr Hammerschlag.If you are bitten by a shark, Dr Hammerschlag said the most important thing to do is call for help. The next step is to \u201cdo whatever you can to stop the bleeding\u201d.The American Lifeguard Association corroborated that advice, with a spokesperson telling us that, if bitten, \u201cattempt to stop or slow the bleeding even before leaving the water by using direct pressure on the wound\u201d.\u201cLeave the water as quickly and calmly as possible,\u201d the ALA said, adding that victims should \u201cget urgent medical attention, no matter how minor the injury is\u201d.As for how to assist someone who has been bitten by a shark, the ALA said the first step should be \u201cnotifying the beach patrol or lifeguard and calling 911 as soon as possible\u201d.The victim should then be removed from the water. The ALA notes that \u201cextreme care\u201d should be used when doing so, and that it is important to not \u201cendanger yourself\u201d. They advise that the best method for removing a shark bite victim from the water is by boat or jet sky. \u201cRemember that a rescuer should always ensure the scene is safe to approach and always try to reach, throw or row to them but do not enter the water unless you are a trained lifeguard and have the proper equipment to assist,\u201d the ALA stated.The rescuer should then attempt to stop the bleeding \u201cby employing direct pressure,\u201d and if necessary, using a tourniquet. After the victim has been removed from the water, the ALA advises against moving them unless necessary, and \u201cprotecting the victim from the cold by wrapping them in a blanket to reduce body heat loss\u201d.\u201cStay with the victim, continue to control the bleeding, monitor vital signs, and wait until the Emergency Medical Services take over,\u201d the ALA said.While there have been a number of shark attack reports this summer and last, Dr Hammerschlag isn\u2019t surprised. He said it should be expected as a result of the number of people in the ocean. \u201cSharks in the ocean is common. They live in the ocean and that\u2019s where you\u2019re going to find them,\u201d he said, adding that, when there are more people in the ocean, it \u201cobviously increases chances of a shark bite because it\u2019s a numbers game\u201d.He went on to say that the number of shark encounters may increase as a result of climate change. \u201cWaters that were too cold for those species are now becoming warm enough to make them habitable,\u201d Dr Hammerschlag explained, before sharing that warmer waters increase shark metabolisms, which in turn may increase the need for the animals to feed. \u201cWarmer water tends to speed up metabolism, so it might increase their need to feed, which might make them curious and come to areas looking for potential food,\u201d he said. He also referenced a study he published on tiger sharks, which found that tiger sharks are migrating further north and spending more time there because waters off the northeast are warming at a much higher rate.While there is always the possibility of a shark encounter when swimming in the ocean, Dr Hammerschlag reiterated that shark bites are \u201creally rare\u201d and that the fear around them may have more to do with a \u201cprimordial fear\u201d of the creatures living in the ocean.RecommendedPassengers sing Taylor Swift on delayed flight: \u2018This was so unnecessary\u2019Influencer Annabelle Ham dies at age 22: \u2018A light to the world\u2019Inside the UK\u2019s Barbie-inspired dreamhouses\u201cWe have this primordial fear.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeHave you ever noticed an exotic-looking bird in your garden and wondered what it was?For those looking to attract unusual birds to their gardens, there\u2019s a variety of plants readily accessible in the UK, which even the rarest of Britain\u2019s birdlife can\u2019t resist.Of course, the proximity of your garden to woodlands, water sources and its size will all have an effect on the species you see frequent your grounds, but it is possible to tailor the birds that visit with the plants that thrive right here in the UK.Here are some you may spot in your garden and in parks, woodlands, conservation areas and while exploring the great outdoors.1. GoldfinchRecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow livePopulations of goldfinches have been rising steadily in the UK in recent decades, as birds have taken advantage of bird food provided in gardens, according to the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO).To attract goldfinches to your plot, consider planting trees and shrubs that produce smaller berries, such as dog rose and coneflower. These berries are easier for the smaller species like finches and tits to consume.2. HoopoePartial to insects and spiders, this exotic-looking bird has, most notably, a long pinkish-brown crest which it raises when excited, as well as striking black and white wings and a long black downcurved bill. It doesn\u2019t breed in the UK, yet some have been seen mainly on the south coast of England as they migrate north to Europe from Africa, and have even been spotted as far north as Shetland, according to the RSPB.3. Roseate ternThis elegant seabird is known for its pale pinkish hue and long tail streamers. It nests on coastal sites and can be spotted in a few locations around the UK during the summer months. These birds are attracted by sea holly \u2013 the spiky, blue or purple flowers can provide nectar for insects, which in turn attract the terns. Alternatively, sea lavender produces clusters of small, lavender-coloured flowers that can attract insects and provide a food source for the birds.4. Red-footed falconThis small falcon species is a rare visitor to the UK, primarily during the summer. It has a distinctive reddish-brown plumage and can sometimes be spotted in grasslands or wetlands.To attract them, try planting meadowsweet, a perennial plant with white or pink flowers that can attract insects, which are prey for the falcons. Marsh thistle also produces spiky flowers that can attract insects and provide a food source for the birds.5. BullfinchIf you\u2019re hoping to attract bullfinches to your garden, there are specific plants you can incorporate to make your space more enticing to these beautiful birds.Bullfinches are known for their striking colours, with males displaying vibrant pinkish-red breasts. One of the best plants to attract bullfinches is the crab apple, which produces small, colourful fruits that bullfinches find irresistible. The tree blossoms in spring also provide nectar for insects, which can attract bullfinches seeking a source of protein.Additionally, planting berries and fruits such as hawthorn and blackthorn can help draw these birds to your garden, as the berries provide an essential food source for bullfinches, particularly during the winter months when other food options may be scarce.Creating a diverse and layered garden with a mix of trees, shrubs and flowering plants will not only attract rare birds, but also provide them with a range of habitats and food sources throughout the year, the couple maintain.RecommendedHow to make your clothes last longer, as research shows expensive doesn\u2019t always mean durableChanel is set to host a fashion show in Manchester4 key men\u2019s swimwear trends to rock this summerRemember to also provide a water source and create a safe and peaceful environment, minimising disturbances to make your garden a welcoming haven for all bird species.Any flowering trees or shrubs will attract insects, increasing the chance of bringing birds to your garden. The rarer species such as the redstart and blackcap will be drawn in by the caterpillars and insects that use the berries and flowers from these species."}]
