They need to follow certain rules if they want you to pay more - these depend on the type of tenancy you have.If you disagree with your rent increase the best thing you can do is talk to your landlord and try to reach an agreement to pay a lower rent.If you can\u2019t reach an agreement you can challenge the increase.If you need support in challenging your rent increaseContact your nearest Citizens Advice if you don\u2019t feel confident speaking to your landlord or you need help to challenge your increase.Get advice before your rent increase starts. If you pay the new rent, your landlord will usually be able to treat this as an acceptance of the new rate and you won\u2019t be able to challenge it.If you get Housing Benefit (or housing costs payments through Universal Credit) you might be able to get extra money to deal with your rent increase. Tell the housing team at the council about the increase before it starts and send evidence, for example a letter from your landlord.According to https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/ landlords have to follow certain rules to increase your rent - the rules depend on what type of tenancy you have.You\u2019II usually be given an \u2018assured shorthold tenancy\u2019. Your rent can be increased regularly with this type of tenancy, for example every year.Will the government intervene?Speculation has increased over whether the government could step in to help homeowners.New Statesman senior editor George Eaton said he \u201cwould not be surprised if the government ends up subsidising mortgages\u201d, while the Daily Telegraph\u2019s money advice editor Sam Brodbeck suggested it \u201cfeels like the [government] will be intervening sooner rather than later\u201d.While the strongest remarks from Downing Street were merely to say that it expected mortgage lenders to protect homeowners struggling with rate rises, housing minister Rachel Maclean appeared to claim on a BBC panel show that \u201ca mortgage support scheme\u201d is in the pipeline \u2013 but failed to provide any details.Rent ControlTenants in Bristol are facing a \u201cWild West market\u201d with rents growing at a much faster rate than people\u2019s incomes, the local mayor has said.Marvin Rees believes there is a need for rent controls in the housing market as private tenants face some of the highest prices outside London at a time when the supply and quality of existing homes also need to be considered.Marvin Rees on rent control  (Getty Images)The Bristol mayor told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cThere has been no real change in our regulatory powers as a local authority to keep up with the changing nature of the housing market. We are taking old tools to new challenges.\u201dIn Bristol, over the last decade, rents have gone up about 52% and wages have gone up 24%.On rent controls, he said: \u201cI recognise there is complexity but what we certainly need is intervention in the rental market.\u201cWhether you call that control or not is up to you, but there needs to be an intervention because allowing this Wild West of the rental market with rents growing out of all pace to people\u2019s income\u2026\u201cWhat we have at the moment in Bristol is, over the last decade, rents have gone up about 52% and wages have gone up 24%.\u201cYou can see there is a huge price to be paid for that, not just in the individuals impacted, by the way.\u201cA good-quality home is one of the most significant public health interventions we can make that will give us more resilience against future pandemics such as Covid.\u201cIt means that we can actually recruit teachers and nurses to Bristol, which we are struggling to do now because of the affordability.\u201cIt makes for more settled communities.\u201dHe said Bristol has set up a living rent commission, including council representatives, tenants\u2019 groups, housing developers and landlords, to look at the housing market in the area and come up with recommendations to ensure people can live there.Among the various issues the housing sector may have to look at is whether there should be more things to make it easier for landlords to provide privately rented properties, as some say there are more tax breaks for people who provide holiday lets than for those who provide the kind of places that people can live in for a long time.RecommendedMichael Gove says 25-year fixed rates could ease mortgage crisisLiz Truss says tabloid \u2018wet lettuce\u2019 gag was not funnyThe government must do what it takes to help homeowners facing crippling mortgagesEvictions by the backdoorMeanwhile, loopholes in new legislation to protect tenants could see \u201cunscrupulous landlords\u201d continue to evict renters \u201cby the backdoor\u201d, Citizens Advice said, as it detailed helping record numbers of people with those issues last month.The charity provided support to almost 2,000 people with issues around so-called no-fault evictions in May, which it said is the most in a single month on record and a 25% increase since the same month last year.The long-awaited Renters\u2019 (Reform) Bill was introduced to Parliament last month, promising to deliver on a 2019 Conservative manifesto commitment to abolish Section 21 (no-fault) evictions.These currently allow landlords to quickly evict tenants without having to give a reason, but the Government said the changes in the Bill will \u201cempower renters to challenge poor landlords without fear of losing their home\u201d.But concerns have been raised due to the reforms also strengthening landlords\u2019 rights to throw out tenants for antisocial behaviour, with the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities stating that the Bill will broaden the classification of \u201cdisruptive and harmful activities\u201d that can lead to eviction.Notice periods will be reduced where renters have been \u201cirresponsible\u201d \u2013 for example, by breaching their tenancy agreement or causing damage to the property, according to the Government.The Bill also seeks to make it illegal for landlords and agents to impose blanket bans on renting to benefit claimants or families with children, and applies \u201cdecent home\u201d quality standards to the private rented sector for the first time."}, {"_id": "64917c3451ac331becf3e7fe", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/boris-johnson-mel-stride-mps-tories-prime-minister-b2360719.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Boris Johnson caravan must move on, Cabinet minister says as MPs brand him liar", "lead": "Mel Stride defended Rishi Sunak\u2019s decision to dodge the vote approving the Privileges Committee report.", "author": "Sam Blewett", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 09:25:40", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:15:16.607828", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-20T09:25:40+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/20/09/d3c256875cb2202b64553dabd8c62bc4Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg3MzM1MjQ3-2.71473629.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

She said she suffered guilt over the way they had died. Another woman said she had \"lost everything\", while others described suffering anxiety.UK may not have been prepared for pandemicThe UK may not have been \"very well prepared at all\" to deal with the coronavirus pandemic, the official inquiry\u2019s lead lawyer said.Lead counsel Hugo Keith KC questioned whether the nation was equipped to offer substantial protection to the public as leaders had promised when the Department of Health and Social Care, along with the three devolved governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, published a Covid-19 action plan. Hugo Keith KC says UK may not have been prepared for pandemic  (Covid 19 Inquiry)\"The plan stated that the United Kingdom was well prepared to respond in a way that offered substantial protection to the public. Whether that was actually the case will be examined in module one.\"Even at this stage before hearing the evidence it is apparent that we might not have been very well prepared at all.\"Very little thought given to impact of lockdownsMr Keith said there was \u201cvery little thought\u201d given to the impact lockdowns could have on the country.\"Very little thought was given to how, if it proved to be necessary, how something as complex, difficult and damaging as a national lockdown could be put in place at all.\"Equally, there appears to have been a failure to think through the potentially massive impact on education and on the economy in trying to control a runaway virus in this way.\"Mr Keith also questioned whether past experiences could have led to complacency in planning, adding: \"Did our experience of the 2009 swine flu lead to concerns about overreacting?\"Brexit could have \u2018crowded out\u2019 planning for pandemicHugo Keith KC suggested to the Covid inquiry that preparing for Brexit \"crowded out and prevented\" the work that was needed to improve pandemic preparedness.He said: \"The pandemic struck the United Kingdom just as it was leaving the European Union. That departure required an enormous amount of planning and preparation, particularly to address what were likely to be the severe consequences of a no-deal exit on food and medicine supplies, travel and transport, business borders and so on.\"It is clear that such planning, from 2018 onwards, crowded out and prevented some or perhaps a majority of the improvements that central government itself understood were required to be made to resilience planning and preparedness.\u201dEvidence likely to show \u2018chaos\u2019 in governmentEvidence is likely to show a lack of responsibility in government and \"chaos\" which led to a slow reaction to a pandemic where \"lost time is measured in lost lives\", the Covid inquiry has been told.Pete Weatherby KC, of Covid Bereaved Families for Justice UK, said: \"The families expect the evidence will show a lack of responsibility in Government for civil emergency preparedness, with little or no ministerial leadership and the chaos of committees which led to poor planning and ultimately a reactive rather than proactive response to the virus.\"We anticipate the evidence will show that the most fundamental consequence of this was a slow reaction. And with a pandemic, time is of the essence and lost time is measured in lost lives.\"NHS England \u2018failed to prepare PPE stocks\u2019Failures of planning and preparation for personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare staff \"led to the ludicrous spectacle of doctors making aprons from bin liners\" during the pandemic.Brian Stanton, lawyer for the British Medical Association, listed the ways in which medical workers had to improvise due to the lack of adequate protective clothing.He said: \"Frontline staff often had to go without PPE, buy their own, use homemade, donated or expired items, and reuse single-use items. Staff also had to use items that were out of date, with multiple expired stickers visibly layered on top of each other.\"Many felt pressured to work without adequate protection, with consequences for their mental and physical health.\"Politicians presided over \u2018chaos\u2019The barrister representing bereaved families in Scotland told the inquiry that political leaders \"stand accused of presiding over a carousel of chaos\".Claire Mitchell KC demanded answers as to whether politicians in the UK and devolved administrations could put aside political differences and act in the public interest, as well as justifications for delays in lockdown and the Eat Out to Help Out scheme.She told the inquiry \"at best, those in charge sought to prepare for the wrong pandemic\" and the UK was \"woefully under-prepared for the virus that swept our shores\".The inquiry is covering the whole of the UK, although Scotland will hold its own probe.David Cameron gives evidenceDavid Cameron conceded it was a \u201cmistake\u201d for\u00a0 government not to consider different types of disease when planning for future pandemics but denied that his austerity policies damaged the UK\u2019s ability to respond to the pandemic.The former prime minister said that the primary focus was preparing for a flu pandemic, adding \u201cgroupthink\u201d had inhibited officials\u2019 ability to think about other respiratory infections.Giving evidence to the inquiry, he said that \u201cmuch more time\u201d was spent on the \u201cdangers\u201d of flu pandemic \u201crather than on potential pandemics of other, more respiratory diseases, like Covid turned out to be.\u201d\"This is so important - so many consequences followed from that,\u201d he added.Mr Cameron defended his record on risk planning, pointing to his decision to set up the National Security Council, a cabinet committee which considers matters relating to national security, foreign policy, defence, trade, international relations, development, resilience and resource security.He added, however, that there was \"always a danger of group think - perhaps that is what is happening here\".\"I think the failing was not to ask more questions about asymptomatic transmission.\"Former prime minister David Cameron giving evidence to the UK Covid-19 Inquiry (UK Covid-19 Inquiry/PA) (PA Media)Referring to austerity, Mr Cameron said \u201cI think it was the right economic policy.\u201dAnd Mr Cameron added that the time spent focusing on flu during contingency planning was \u201cthe thing I keep coming back to\u201d when considering the \u201chorrors of the Covid pandemic\u201d.\u201cI think it was a mistake not to look more at the range of different types of pandemic,\u201d Mr Cameron said, giving evidence under oath.He added: \u201cMuch more time was spent on pandemic flu and the dangers of pandemic flu rather than on potential pandemics of other, more respiratory diseases, like Covid turned out to be.\u201cAnd you know, I think this is so important because so many consequences follow from that.\u201dHe said he had been \u201cwrestling with\u201d the issue, adding: \u201cBut that\u2019s where I keep coming back to is, so much time was spent on a pandemic influenza and that was seen as the greatest danger \u2013 and we had very bad years for flu so it is a big danger..\u201cBut why wasn\u2019t more time and more questions asked about what turned out to be the pandemic that we faced?\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to answer why that\u2019s the case.

can expect in July \u2013 if last year\u2019s record-breaking heatwave is anything to go by \u2013 might not be comfortable for everyone but it will at least greatly reduce the need for having the central heating switched on, which proved such an expense over the course of the winter just gone.The government\u2019s Energy Price Guarantee (EPG) \u2013 introduced by Liz Truss last September to ensure households paid no more than \u00a32,500 for their electricity and gas, with the government subsidising the remainder owed to providers under Ofgem\u2019s Energy Price Cap (EPC) \u2013 was

would have eased the burden on the state, but ultimately thought better of it, extending the guarantee into April, May and June.Now that the EPG has finally expired, consumers will once more be paying the EPC rate, although Ofgem has announced that will be \u00a32,074 from 1 July, a huge fall from the \u00a33,280 it was set at during the second quarter, from which households were shielded by the

A Financial Conduct Authority study has put the total as high as 10 million, reporting a 3.1 million increase year-on-year and warning that many are having to choose between heating and eating and being forced to cancel insurance policies to make ends meet. With inflation still in double digits at 10.1 per cent, the cost of goods in supermarket aisles and on high street shelves remains high \u2013 doubling in many cases, according to a recent survey from Which? \u2013 household budgets continue to be stretched after a long winter of sky-high energy bills.And, while there is state support available to help those up against it on low incomes, several government initiatives that promised help throughout the winter, such as the Warm Home Discount and Cold Weather Payment schemes, have now ceased to apply, subsiding on 1 April with the changing of the seasons.The government\u2019s Energy Bill Support Scheme, introduced by Rishi Sunak during his time in 11 Downing Street last year, has also now wound up, dishing out the final \u00a367 instalment

The incident occurred during a Year 8 class on \u201clife education\u201d at Rye College in East Sussex last Friday, where students were told to \u201cbe who you want to be \u2013 and how you identify is up to you\u201d.A recording of the discussion, shared on TikTok, captured the unnamed female teacher\u2019s outraged remarks as she accused a pupil of upsetting someone by \u201cquestioning their identity\u201d.The pupil said: \u201cIf they want to identify as a cow or something then they are genuinely unwell \u2013 crazy\u201d. The teacher said gender was not solely determined by biological characteristics but by how individuals identify themselves.RecommendedTeachers in England to stage fresh strikes in long-running pay disputeUkrainians leaving UK because they cannot get housing, volunteer made MBE saysBritish Sign Language GCSE one step closer as Government launches consultationShe further argued there are three biological sexes and numerous genders, including transgender and agender.One of the students, however, could be heard vehemently disagreeing and asserting that \u201cyou can\u2019t have that\u201d.\u201cWhat do you mean you can\u2019t have that? It\u2019s not a law,\u201d the teacher can then be heard saying, after which one of the students responds by saying that it was \u201cour opinion, we just don\u2019t agree with it\u201d.The student can be heard arguing that gender is determined by biological sex, meaning \u201cif you have a vagina you\u2019re a girl and if you have penis you\u2019re a boy. That\u2019s it\u201d.The teacher can be heard responding with a raised voice and condemning their views as \u201creally despicable\u201d.\u201cCisgender is not necessarily the way to be \u2013 you are talking about the fact that cisgender is the norm, that you identify with the gender of the sexual organ you were born with or you\u2019re weird. That\u2019s basically what you\u2019re saying, which is really despicable,\u201d the teacher is heard saying.One of the students asserted that their mother would support their perspective after which the teacher replies, asking the students \u201cwhy do you think we have so many problems in the world with homophobia?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not homophobia, that\u2019s transgender,\u201d one student then says. \u201cI\u2019m fine with lesbians and gay people. I\u2019ve got nothing against them.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re confusing sex with gender,\u201d the teacher further argues, to which the student replies, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t said anything at all in the lessons I have been in, it\u2019s just because they turn around and start saying something, so I said \u2018how can you identify as a cat when you are a girl,\u2019\u201d one of the students was heard responding to the teacher, who then says the pupil in question is writing a statement and the other students will be asked to write one as well. The incident was criticised by a parent of one of the students involved who allegedly shared the recording on social media platforms.\u201cI understand the point the teacher was attempting to make, what bothers me is the shutting down of debate in such a threatening and aggressive manner, which I don\u2019t believe is appropriate in an educational setting,\u201d the parent told The Telegraph.\u201cRegardless of the subject, education should serve to build awareness of differing points of view to widen the understanding of a subject. It shouldn\u2019t be a case of indoctrination.\u201dThe school said it would be \u2018reviewing its processes\u2019 to avoid a repeat of the altercation.

It\u2019s a question of training and having a system that keeps both ministers and officials in post long enough so they can use the training.\u201dAsked whether the so-called \u201crevolving door\u201d tends to undermine experience, efficacy and the ability of ministers and officials to be able to do the job with which they are tasked, Sir Oliver said: \u201cI strongly believe that it does...\u201cI\u2019m pretty certain that the entire structure of the civil service means that you can\u2019t really make progress in a career without going through endless different jobs one after another, which I regard as a disaster for the country, particularly disastrous in the case of things that have very long lead times and where learning from experience is critical.\u201dSir Oliver also said the UK\u2019s critical national infrastructure is \u201cwildly under-resilient\u201d.Martha Mchardy20 June 2023 10:511687254601Failing to appoint minister with sole responsibility over planning for pandemics an \u2018error\u2019 - LetwinFailing to appoint a senior minister with sole responsibility over planning for pandemics and other areas of resilience is an \u201cerror\u201d, Oliver Letwin has said.At the UK Covid-19 inquiry, Sir Oliver Letwin said resilience was a \u201crelatively small part\u201d of his brief while Cabinet Office minister in charge of the area between 2011 and 2016.He spent a lot of time on \u201cendless discussions\u201d with Liberal Democrat colleagues in the coalition government in the \u201crather wide-ranging and unusual role\u201d.Sir Oliver said: \u201cActually there really ought to be a minister solely devoted to resilience at a senior level.\u201dAsked if anyone had ever had this role, he said: \u201cThere hasn\u2019t, as far as I\u2019m aware and I think that is an error.\u201cI came to that view very gradually but by the end of my time I was pretty convinced that we ought to have, and had I remained in situ I would\u2019ve tried therefore to move to a model, where somebody took that position.\u201dBut appointing a junior minister would \u201cachieve nothing\u201d, he said, and they must be senior and close to the prime minister.Martha Mchardy20 June 2023 10:501687253856Revolving door of ministerial appointments undermines training - LetwinAsked if the \u201crevolving door aspect\u201d of ministerial appointments undermines experiences, Letwin replied: \u201cI strongly believe it does.\u201dLetwin said: \u201cIf you\u2019re a minister responsible for anything for six months, you could have training for the first two months, but by the time you finish your training you\u2019ve practically finished your job.\u201dHe added: \u201cIt isn\u2019t just a question of training, it\u2019s a question of training and having a system of having ministers and officials in post long enough so they can use the training.\u201dMartha Mchardy20 June 2023 10:371687253514Sir Oliver Letwin giving evidenceSir Oliver Letwin is giving evidence to the Covid inquiry.Letwin was Minister for Government Policy between 2010-2016 and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster from 2014-2016.Sir Oliver Letwin (Screengrab)He described the role of minister as \u201cwide ranging and unusual,\u201d but explained resilience was only a \u201csmall part\u201d of the role.He added that there hasn\u2019t been a minister that\u2019s sole purpose was emergency preparedness.

Scientists therefore reccommend that a 30 minute nap per day may contribute to slowing down the process of brain shrinkage.Senior author Dr Victoria Garfield, MRC Unit for Lifelong Health & Ageing at UCL, said: \u201cOur findings suggest that, for some people, short daytime naps may be a part of the puzzle that could help preserve the health of the brain as we get older.\u201dRecommendedHow to sleep during hot weather, according to expertsGive it a rest: why afternoon naps can improve memory and alertnessAfternoon naps could improve thinking and memory skills, says new researchThe study, published in the journal Sleep Health, analysed data from people aged 40 to 69.Past research has suggested people who have had a short nap perform better in cognitive tests in the hours afterwards than those who did not nap.The new study looked at whether there was a causal relationship between daytime napping and brain health.Regular daytime naps could be good for brain health, new research suggests (PA Archive)Researchers looked at 97 snippets of DNA thought to determine people\u2019s likelihood of habitual napping.They compared measures of brain health and cognition of people who are more genetically programmed to nap with people who did not have these changes in DNA, using data from 378,932 people from the UK Biobank study.They found that, overall, people predetermined to nap had a larger total brain volume.The genetic variants \u2013 DNA changes \u2013 influencing the likelihood of someone to nap were identified in an earlier study looking at data from 452,633 UK Biobank participants.But the researchers did not find a difference in how well those programmed to be habitual nappers performed on three other measures of brain health and cognitive function.Lead author and PhD candidate Valentina Paz, University of the Republic (Uruguay) and MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing at UCL, said: \u201cThis is the first study to attempt to untangle the causal relationship between habitual daytime napping and cognitive and structural brain outcomes.\u201cBy looking at genes set at birth, Mendelian randomisation avoids confounding factors occurring throughout life that may influence associations between napping and health outcomes.Recommended6 hacks for handling the heatwave at a festivalBruce Willis\u2019 family shares first Father\u2019s Day posts since announcing his dementiaLouis Tomlinson\u2019s sister Phoebe, 19, announces pregnancy on social media\u201cOur study points to a causal link between habitual napping and larger total brain volume.\u201dIt is not yet known whether naps could help prevent diseases like Alzheimer\u2019s, but overall brain health is thought to be important for protecting against dementia."}, {"_id": "64917c3d51ac331becf3e819", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/hounslow-cause-of-deaths-wlodarczyk-family-b2360574.html", "primaryCategory": "Crime", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Hounslow deaths \u2013 latest:   Murder probe launched as mother and father\u2019s fatal injuries revealed", "lead": "<p>Bodies of four members of Wlodarczyk family, including 11-year-old Maja and three-year-old Dawid, discovered when police forced their way into their Hounslow home</p>", "author": "Holly Evans", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 04:05:36", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:15:25.130929", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-20T04:05:36+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/18/08/Wlodarczyk%20family.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "\u2715ClosePolice at the scene in Bedfont, Hounslow where a three-year-old boy and a girl, 11, are among four people who have been found dead in a flat in west LondonFor free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Johnson\u2019s former Cabinet ministers such as Nadine Dorries, Michelle Donelan, Oliver Dowden, Michael Gove and George Eustice.Others for whom no vote was recorded included Lee Anderson, Sir Iain Duncan Smith, Victoria Atkins, Steve Barclay, Jake Berry and Liz Truss.Andy Gregory19 June 2023 22:421687210433How did the evening unfold?In a further humiliation for Boris Johnson, MPs have voted overwhelmingly to strip him of his former member\u2019s pass to parliament, as they upheld the privileges committee\u2019s findings that he repeatedly lied to parliament.While a large number of Conservatives abstained, there were some 118 Tory MPs among the 354 who voted to uphold the committee\u2019s \u201cdamning\u201d report \u2013 versus just seven who voted against it.With his successor Rishi Sunak accused of \u201crunning scared\u201d with his absence during the debate, Commons leader Penny Mordaunt kicked off proceedings at 4:30pm by stating her intention to endorse the report, describing parliamentary rules as \u201cobligations we have to one another, to this place and to those that sent us here\u201d.Former PM Theresa May was among other senior Tories to do the same, as she accused her successor of being \u201cfound wanting\u201d in a scathing speech to MPs, who she called on to back the report to help \u201crestore faith in our parliamentary democracy\u201d.Of the few to speak in defence of the PM, loyalist Jacob Rees-Mogg compared the privileges committee to \u201ccommunist China\u201d, and said the move to strip Mr Johnson of his parliamentary pass was going \u201cfrom the vindictive to the ridiculous\u201d.His attempt to cast doubt over committee chair Harriet Harman\u2019s impartiality drew what one MP could be heard describing as a \u201cmic drop\u201d moment in response, as the Mother of the House replied that the government had told her it had confidence in her leadership, saying: \u201cI was assured that I should continue the work \u2026 and so I did just that.\u201dWhile Mr Johnson himself was not among those spotted in the viewing gallery \u2013 in contrast with Lord of the Rings actor Sir Ian McKellen, who was spotted on its benches \u2013 the ex-PM was reported to hit out at the \u201cbiased and wilfully ignorant\u201d committee in a simultaneous speech to the International Democratic Union, and to claim that there\u2019s \u201calways another innings\u201d.Those celebrating the results of the vote, however, which came after some five hours of debate, appeared to believe otherwise, with Labour MP Sir Chris Bryant telling The Independent: \u201cIt feels like justice takes a long time to turn the bend \u2013 finally, chickens are coming home to roost.\u201dAndy Gregory19 June 2023 22:331687209500Vote was triggered by

The payment reference on bank statements will appear as the person\u2019s national insurance number, followed by \u201cDWP COL\u201d.Those expecting a payment should watch out for scammers, who will use events such as cost-of-living payments to try to trick people into handing over personal details or money.People who may qualify for the payments being made between 20 June and 4 July include those on disability living allowance, personal independence payments, attendance allowance, Scottish disability benefits (adult disability payment and child disability payment), armed forces independence payments, constant attendance allowance and war pension mobility supplement.The DWP said a small number of payments will be made after 4 July, where claimants were still awaiting confirmation of their eligibility or entitlement to qualifying disability benefits on April 1.The new payment is in addition to the \u00a3150 disability cost-of-living payment that was paid last September.Louise Rubin, head of policy at disability charity Scope, said: \u201cThis \u00a3150 disability cost-of-living payment offered to people on disability benefits won\u2019t touch the sides.RecommendedJuly dates for DWP payments, benefits, pensions and cost of living top upsAge UK highlights evidence of \u2018great un-retirement\u2019 as living costs biteWhat is Pension Credit and how much financial support is paid out per week?\u201cWe\u2019ve heard from disabled people whose bills have risen to \u00a36,000 a year.

are not to blame.\u201dThe comic and Save The Children ambassador, who grew up in Beirut during Lebanon\u2019s civil war, recently visited the city of Mykolaiv and surrounding villages which have been subjected to shelling and missile attacks.Joly documented his time meeting families who are trying to rebuild their homes, school and communities after surviving months of intensive fighting in their hometowns.He told the PA news agency: \u201cWhatever your views on conflicts, who\u2019s right, who\u2019s wrong, what the political rightness is of the whole situation, kids certainly didn\u2019t ask to be in that situation.\u201cThey are not to blame and they\u2019re not making any choices in that.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine

\u201cdidn\u2019t quite realise how challenging it would be\u201d this time round.Joly noted that he found the impact on mental health was a \u201cmassive issue\u201d from just witnessing the children in these affected areas.\u201cWe met kids that had been literally standing on train stations with shells landing around them, not knowing whether their mother had survived,\u201d he recalled.\u201cBut apart from anything else, the fact that you\u2019ve had to leave your house, you leave all your friends, you move to a new area, you have no schooling.\u201cSo just even the fact that kids spent a vast amount of time in shelters at the moment underground in Ukraine, they do most of their education online, so it\u2019s very isolating.\u201dOne of the initiatives he explored which tackles this is a mobile digital learning centre which moves between villages to give children the opportunity to learn and play with friends.He explained that the impact on children physically can also be greater as they can require more medical attention while recovering from certain injuries due to their growth rate so in the case of prosthetics they may need multiple of them as they develop.While in Ukraine, he documented these experiences through video diaries to try to capture the daily life people in the war-torn country have to survive each day including how they rely on an air raid app to alert them to danger.He recalled: \u201cOne of the first things I did was three in the morning, I suddenly get woken up by the air raid sirens outside, which is a visceral sound.\u201cYou\u2019re completely in deep sleep, and you\u2019re up, you\u2019re stumbling around, and then you try to go down into the shelter, and you sit in the shelter for two hours till the app tells you can go back up and back, you go out and try and go to sleep, and then it happens again.\u201cI tried to capture that, not for shock value, but just as this is a daily routine for people.\u201cAnd honestly, people get to the stage where they ignore the alerts because you can\u2019t be in that state of heightened tension, which makes it even worse, so people just don\u2019t go and then a missile hits that apartment block, and they get killed.\u201cIt\u2019s a really strange existence.\u201dHaving grown up during Lebanon\u2019s civil war, Joly feels he can empathise with what the children are experiencing and understands the impact it has had on his life long term.The comic added that at times he tried to bring some light to the harrowing situations for those affected, saying: \u201cStrangely, humour is a really good way to cope.\u201cCertainly in Lebanon and in Ukraine, there\u2019s a very black humour.\u201cAnd comedies were massively important in that it is a way of expressing your deepest fears, your anxieties, and it\u2019s also just a release.\u201cYou need to laugh and however bad a situation is there are still funny moments.\u201dThe video diaries are being launched ahead of the Ukraine recovery conference being held in London between June 21 to 23 which will be attended by political leaders to discuss rebuilding the country after the war.Save The Children plans to campaign for children\u2019s needs to be at the front and centre of this plan.RecommendedSir Elton John: Phillip Schofield affair furore is homophobicFace of girl, 16, thought to be one of UK\u2019s first

this conflict is not going away, it hasn\u2019t been forgotten, it\u2019s still a massive thing.\u201cIt\u2019s in the middle of Europe and it\u2019s continuing, and that kids every single day have

This compares to an average age of almost 31 for women who conceive naturally.The regulator\u2019s report shows that patients in heterosexual relationships accounted for around 90% of all IVF patients in 2021.Meanwhile, the number of IVF patients in female same-sex relationships increased from 1,649 in 2019 to 2,201 in 2021 (a 33% rise) and single parents rose from 2,001 in 2019 to 2,888 in 2021 (a 44% rise).This means that single patients and patients in female same-sex relationships had the biggest increase in IVF use from 2019 to 2021.When it comes to success in getting pregnant using own eggs, the average overall IVF pregnancy rate using fresh embryos increased from 10% per embryo transferred in 1991 to 29% in 2021.Patients aged 18 to 34 had the highest pregnancy rate per embryo transferred at 41% in 2021.Meanwhile, pregnancy rates per embryo transferred increased from 8% in 1991 to 33% for patients aged 35 to 37, and was 25% for patients aged 38 to 39 in 2021.For patients aged 40 to 42, the pregnancy rate per embryo transferred increased from 6% in 1991 to 16% in 2021.\n\nOur report shows that the average age of IVF patients has increased to 36, around five years older than mothers who get pregnant naturally and these aftershocks could mean that the average age of an IVF patient continues to riseJulia Chain, HFEAFor patients aged 43 to 50, the pregnancy rate per embryo transferred increased from 1% in 1991 to 6% in 2021.Live birth rates per embryo transferred have increased from 7% in 1991 to 25% in 2021 for patients aged 35 to 37 and from 6% in 1991 to 17% in 2021 for patients aged 38 to 39.For those aged 40 to 42, the live birth rate per embryo stands at 10%, but plummets for women aged 43 and over.Meanwhile, the average IVF pregnancy rate using frozen embryo transfers has increased from around 7% in the 1990s to 36% in 2021.The average IVF birth rate using frozen embryo transfers also increased from around 6% in the 1990s to 27% in 2021.Julia Chain, chairwoman of the HFEA, said:\u00a0\u201cOverall, the new HFEA report paints a promising picture. It shows treatment numbers are back at pre-pandemic levels and thanks to improved clinical and laboratory practice, over time pregnancy rates are increasing.\u201cDespite the pandemic being declared officially over, the aftershocks are still being felt as delays across other areas of healthcare prevent some patients accessing fertility services.\u201cOur report shows that the average age of IVF patients has increased to 36, around five years older than mothers who get pregnant naturally and these aftershocks could mean that the average age of an IVF patient continues to rise.\u201cAlthough pregnancy rates have increased, the likelihood of success decreases with age.\u201cFor some patients, this may mean they never get the baby they hoped for and that\u2019s heartbreaking.\u201dRecommendedSir Elton John: Phillip Schofield affair furore is homophobicFace of girl, 16, thought to be one of UK\u2019s first Christians is reconstructedOxford children\u2019s choir has helped \u2018heal souls\u2019 of Ukrainian refugeesMore patients than ever before are paying privately for IVF.The number of IVF cycles funded by the NHS continued to vary across the UK with an overall 16% decrease to 20,000 cycles in 2021 from around 24,000 in 2019."}, {"_id": "64917c4151ac331becf3e829", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/government-labour-conservative-lib-dem-liberal-democrat-b2360521.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Tory voters think Government should prioritise social housing, polling suggests", "lead": "The majority of Labour, Conservative and Lib Dem voters said they felt housing issues in the UK had become worse since the last general election.", "author": "Aine Fox", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 23:01:00", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:15:29.260730", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-19T23:01:00+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/20/00/d1ea30da5d0c009825e1eb9cb55ded21Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg2OTg4OTM3-2.72482981.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe face of a 16-year-old girl thought to be one of the country\u2019s first Christians has been reconstructed following analysis of a skull unearthed at a 1,400-year-old Anglo Saxon burial site.Her remains, found with a gold cross that was dated to the third quarter of the 7th century, were discovered at Trumpington Meadows on Cambridge\u2019s southern limits in 2012.Forensic artist Hew Morrison has now created a likeness of the girl by using measurements of her skull and tissue depth data for Caucasian females.Without DNA analysis, he\u00a0could not be sure of the girl\u2019s eye and hair colour.\u201cIt was interesting to see her face developing,\u201d said Mr Morrison.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow live\u201cHer left eye was slightly lower, about half a centimetre, than her right eye.\u201cThis would have been quite noticeable in life.\u201dAnalysis of the girl\u2019s bones and teeth indicated that she moved to England from somewhere near the Alps, perhaps southern Germany, some time after she turned seven years old.Once the girl had arrived in England, the proportion of protein in her diet decreased by a small but significant amount, according to the work of bioarchaeologists Dr Sam Leggett and Dr Alice Rose, and archaeologist Dr Emma Brownlee, during PhD research at the University of Cambridge.This change occurred close to the end of the girl\u2019s young life, suggesting that the period between her migration and burial near Cambridge was tragically short.Dr Leggett, now at Edinburgh University, said: \u201cShe was quite a young girl when she moved, likely from part of southern Germany, close to the Alps, to a very flat part of England.\u201cShe was probably quite unwell and she travelled a long way to somewhere completely unfamiliar \u2013 even the food was different.\u201cIt must have been scary.\u201dPrevious analysis indicated that the young woman had suffered from illness but her cause of death remains unknown.She was buried in a remarkable way \u2013 lying on a carved wooden bed wearing the cross, gold pins and fine clothing.Hers is one of only 18 bed burials uncovered in the UK.Her ornate cross, combining gold and garnets, is one of only five of its kind found in Britain and identifies her as one of England\u2019s earliest converts to Christianity and as a member of the aristocracy, if not royalty.In 597 AD, the pope dispatched St Augustine to England on a mission to convert the pagan Anglo-Saxon kings, a process which continued for many decades.Dr Leggett said: \u201cShe must have known that she was important and she had to carry that on her shoulders.\u201cHer isotopic results match those of two other women who were similarly buried on beds in this period in Cambridgeshire.\u201cSo it seems that she was part of an elite group of women who probably travelled from mainland Europe, most likely Germany, in the 7th century, but they remain a bit of a mystery.\u201cWere they political brides or perhaps brides of Christ?\u201cThe fact that her diet changed once she arrived in England suggests that her lifestyle may have changed quite significantly.\u201dDr Sam Lucy, a specialist in Anglo Saxon burial from Newnham College, Cambridge, said: \u201cThese are intriguing findings, and it is wonderful to see this collaborative research adding to our knowledge of this period.\u201cCombining the new isotopic results with Emma Brownlee\u2019s research into European bed burials really does seem to suggest the movement of a small group of young elite women from a mountainous area in continental Europe to the Cambridge region in the third quarter of the 7th century.\u201cSouthern Germany is a distinct possibility owing to the bed burial tradition known there.\u201cGiven the increasingly certain association between bed burial, such cross-shaped jewellery and early Anglo-Saxon Christianity, it is possible that their movement related to pan-European networks of elite women who were heavily involved in the early Church.\u201dThe image and artefacts from the girl\u2019s burial, including the Trumpington Cross that she was buried with, will be displayed in a new exhibition at Cambridge\u2019s Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology.RecommendedSir Elton John: Phillip Schofield affair furore is homophobicDramatic rise in the number of women freezing their eggsOxford children\u2019s choir has helped \u2018heal

Just last week, I was called the day before my three-month scan to tell me it was cancelled once again. I rely on my scans; they are my lifeline. I shouldn\u2019t be ringing up my team begging for my appointments.\u201cI am living life heightened where I\u2019m so on edge about my appointments being cancelled, and so anxious that my phone is going to ring with another cancellation. It\u2019s affecting everybody around me; my family, my friends, my son, they\u2019re all suffering. I have the disease in my body, but my husband and my son are on the same journey with me.\u201dA Scottish Government spokesperson said: \u201cCancer remains a national priority for the NHS and Scottish Government which is why last week we published a new 10-year strategy, focused on improving cancer survival and providing equitable access to treatment.\u201cWe are committed to detecting cancer earlier and faster, continuing to invest in cancer diagnostics and waiting times. We have also established a network of Urology Diagnostic Hubs, are investing in optimal cancer diagnostic pathways and activating additional Rapid Cancer Diagnostic Services across Scotland.\u201cThe pandemic had a significant impact on all aspects of health and social care, and cancer services were no exception. This new Cancer Strategy will make sure we are properly delivering these vital services and clearly directing future investments.\u201d\n\nThe NHS in Wales has set out a detailed approach in the Cancer Improvement Plan for Wales and this includes a number of actions to improve diagnosis and treatment of cancers, such as the introduction of rapid diagnostic centresWelsh Government spokesperson A spokesman for the Department of Health in Northern Ireland said: \u201cThe Cancer Strategy 2022-2032 sets the direction of travel for cancer services for the next 10 years with the vision to ensure everyone in Northern Ireland has equitable and timely access to the most effective, evidence-based referral, diagnosis, treatment, support and person-centred cancer care.\u201cImplementation of the strategy is ongoing, however, the department is aware that there are very significant pressures currently impacting on the delivery of all aspects of cancer care in Northern Ireland and it is extremely disappointing that the department\u2019s performance targets for cancer waiting times are not being met.\u201dThe spokesman added that rapid diagnostic centres continue to be rolled out across Northern Ireland to reduce waiting times for diagnosis and that a wider review of \u201cclinical pathways\u201d was ongoing.A Welsh Government spokesperson later said: \u201cWe are investing heavily in cancer services to train additional staff, build new facilities, increase early detection and provide rapid access to high-quality cancer care to ensure people receive the right treatment as quickly as possible.\u201cThe NHS in Wales has set out a detailed approach in the Cancer Improvement Plan for Wales and this includes a number of actions to improve diagnosis and treatment of cancers, such as the introduction of rapid diagnostic centres.\u201cIn addition, we announced \u00a386 million for new cancer diagnostic and treatment facilities and are increasing the number of training places for specialists in cancer diagnosis, treatment and palliative care.\u201dA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \u201cCutting waiting lists is one of this Government\u2019s five priorities and the NHS has seen and treated record numbers of cancer patients over the last two years, with cancer being diagnosed at an earlier stage more often and survival rates improving across almost all types of cancer.\u201cWe have opened 108 community diagnostic centres that have delivered over four million additional tests, checks and scans \u2013 including for cancer which is also one of the six conditions we are looking to tackle as part of our Major Conditions Strategy.RecommendedGlastonbury drops Corbyn \u2018conspiracy theory\u2019 film booked \u2018in good faith\u2019Search continues for submersible with British billionaire among five onboardBowel cancer treatment breakthrough as scientists solve immune system mystery\u201cThere are more doctors, nurses and staff working in the NHS than ever before with 50% more cancer staff diagnosing and treating patients now compared to 2010 and we will soon set out plans to boost the healthcare workforce over the next five, 10 and 15 years.\u201d\u2013 Macmillan Cancer Support released the figures as part of its new campaign \u2018What Are We Waiting For?\u2019, which is calling for government action to tackle the delays to treatment."}, {"_id": "64917c4251ac331becf3e82d", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/kyiv-stephen-clarke-english-oxfordshire-europe-b2360526.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Oxford children\u2019s choir has helped \u2018heal souls\u2019 of Ukrainian refugees", "lead": "Choir tutor Yevheniia Diachenko said: \u2018They feel support from each other and music helps to heal their souls.\u2019", "author": "Danielle Desouza", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 23:01:00", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:15:30.270139", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-19T23:01:00+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/20/00/11135610-f4aed654-a434-4e0d-ba7b-52f41d67a3ea.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Until then we have a lot of preparations and briefings to do.\u201dOceanGate Expeditions said its focus was on those aboard the vessel and their families.\u201cWe are deeply thankful for the extensive assistance we have received from several government agencies and deep sea companies in our efforts to re-establish contact with the submersible,\u201d the company said in a statement.\u201cWe are working toward the safe return of the crew members.\u201dA court document filed by OceanGate in the US in April states that the submersible, named Titan, can dive to 13,120ft \u201cwith a comfortable safety margin\u201d, Associated Press reported on Monday.Titan weighs 20,000lb, is made of \u201ctitanium and filament wound carbon fibre\u201d and has proven to \u201cwithstand the enormous pressures of the deep ocean\u201d, OceanGate reportedly said.The submersible was taking part in OceanGate\u2019s third annual voyage to the monitor the decay of the ship\u2019s wreckage, following expeditions in 2021 and 2022.But in a tweet on Monday, CBS Sunday Morning correspondent David Pogue wrote: \u201cYou may remember that the @OceanGateExped sub to the #Titanic got lost for a few hours LAST summer, too, when I was aboard\u2026\u201dIn his broadcast from the time, he said: \u201cThere is no GPS under water so the surface ship is supposed to guide the sub to the shipwreck by sending text messages.\u201cBut on this dive communication somehow broke down, the sub never found the wreck.\u201dMr Harding holds three Guinness World Records, for longest duration and distance traversed at full ocean depth by a crewed vessel, and fastest circumnavigation via both Poles by aeroplane.Two of these feats were achieved by Mr Harding and fellow explorer Victor Vescovo when they dived to the lowest depth of the Mariana Trench \u2013 the deepest part of the ocean \u2013 in a two-person submergence vehicle in March 2021.They spent four hours and 15 minutes traversing the sea floor of the Challenger Deep, travelling 2.88 miles at that depth.Challenger Deep is about 186 miles south west of Guam in the western Pacific Ocean and has a depth in its Eastern Pool of 35,860ft.RecommendedLabour will focus on economic diplomacy with EU a priority, Lammy saysMPs vote overwhelmingly for report that found Boris Johnson lied about partygateDawn Butler: Curbs on MPs calling each other liars in the Commons are \u2018nonsense\u2019In July 2019, Mr Harding was part of a team that achieved the fastest circumnavigation of Earth via both geographic poles by plane with a time of 46 hours, 40 minutes and 22 seconds.In June last year, he travelled to space as a tourist with fellow billionaire Jeff Bezos\u2019s Blue Origin company."}, {"_id": "64917c4351ac331becf3e831", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/boris-johnson-uk-parliament-mps-bill-cash-rishi-sunak-b2360486.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "MPs vote overwhelmingly for report that found Boris Johnson lied about partygate", "lead": "The ex-prime minister will be denied special access to Parliament after MPs endorsed the Privileges Committee\u2019s sanctions.", "author": "Sophie Wingate", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 21:47:21", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:15:31.251041", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-19T21:47:21+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/19/22/ea2609c47fb567bdcd3a14e51a1ccd74Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg3MjkzNzkz-2.71203158.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Government chief whip Simon Hart also supported it.The seven who voted against it included senior backbencher Sir Bill Cash and Nick Fletcher, who during the earlier debate urged MPs to remember Mr Johnson was \u201chuman\u201d and that he \u201cnearly died\u201d during the pandemic.Conservative former prime minister Theresa May said backing the Privileges Committee\u2019s conclusions would be \u201ca small but important step in restoring people\u2019s trust\u201d in Parliament.In a veiled swipe at Mr Sunak\u2019s absence from the chamber, she urged her party to \u201cshow that we are prepared to act when one of our own, however senior, is found wanting\u201d.The Prime Minister\u2019s official spokesman said he had afternoon meetings on Monday, including hosting his Swedish counterpart, Ulf Kristersson, before attending a dinner in the evening.Mr Sunak has claimed his reticence about publicising his view on the report\u2019s conclusions was because he \u201cwouldn\u2019t want to influence anyone in advance\u201d of the vote.But publicly backing the report and its sanctions could have risked deepening the Tory civil war between Johnson loyalists and his own administration.Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper said: \u201cTonight Rishi Sunak committed a cowardly cop-out. His failure to vote says all you need to know about this Prime Minister\u2019s lack of leadership.\u201cSunak promised integrity yet when push came to shove, he was too weak to even turn up.\u201cThe British public doesn\u2019t yet have the opportunity to tell Sunak and his sleaze-ridden Conservative Government what they think of them but the people of Somerset and Bedfordshire definitely do.\u201dRecommendedBritish billionaire among five aboard missing submersible visiting Titanic wreckLabour will focus on economic diplomacy with EU a priority, Lammy saysDawn Butler: Curbs on MPs calling each other liars in the Commons are \u2018nonsense\u2019A Labour Party spokesperson said: \u201cRishi Sunak is too weak to lead a party too divided to govern and working people are paying the price.\u201cRather than distance himself from his disgraced predecessor, Rishi Sunak has repeatedly demonstrated he\u2019s just more of the same Conservative failure we\u2019ve had to put up with for 13 years now.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeA driver has been cleared over the Croydon tram disaster in which seven passengers were killed and 21 others were seriously injured.Alfred Dorris, 49, appeared visibly shaken when a jury at the Old Bailey acquitted him of failing to take \u201creasonable care\u201d of the health and safety of himself and his 69 passengers on Tram 2551 in November 2016.The jury deliberated for less than two hours on Monday to reach its unanimous verdict following the prosecution brought by the Office of Road and Rail (ORR).Transport for London (TfL) and Tram Operations Limited (ToL) have previously admitted health and safety offences relating to significant failings ahead of the catastrophic derailment and will be sentenced at a later date.Families of the victims had sat in Court One of the Old Bailey or attended the trial by video-link from Croydon.The people who died were Dane Chinnery, 19, Philip Seary, 57, Dorota Rynkiewicz, 35, Robert Huxley, 63, and Philip Logan, 52, all from New Addington, and Donald Collett, 62, and Mark Smith, 35, both from Croydon.The court had heard that Dorris, of Beckenham, south-east London, was doing three times the speed he should have been going when his tram derailed on a sharp corner at Sandilands in south London on the morning of November 9 2016.Dorris denied he had a \u201cmicro-sleep\u201d and said he became disorientated in the tunnel on approach to the curve, believing he was heading the other way.He blamed his confusion on a combination of external factors including poor lighting and signage in the Sandilands tunnel complex, darkness and bad weather.By the time he realised the fatal mistake the tram was already tipping over and he was thrown from his seat, causing him to hit his head and pass out, he said.\n\nI\u2019m a human being and sometimes as a human being things happen to you that you are not in control ofAlfred DorrisSpeaking publicly about the crash for the first time, the driver apologised to the victims\u2019 families and survivors during his tearful evidence at the Old Bailey.He told them: \u201cI\u2019m a human being and sometimes as a human being things happen to you that you are not in control of.\u201cI\u2019m sorry that I became disorientated. I\u2019m sorry I was not able to do anything to stop myself from becoming disorientated.\u201cAnd I\u2019m deeply sorry I was not able to do anything to reorientate myself and stop the tram from turning over. I\u2019m deeply sorry.\u201dThe court heard that it had been a wet, wintry morning when Tram 2551 embarked on its route from New Addington to Wimbledon via East Croydon.At a sharp left turn on the approach to Sandilands, drivers are instructed to reduce speed to 12mph (20kph) to safely negotiate the curve, with a sign on the bend confirming it.Dorris was travelling in excess of 43mph (70kph), causing the inner wheels to come off the track and the tram to tip over.Survivors described being \u201cflung\u201d about as if in a washing machine or a pinball machine, then a moment of silence before people began to scream and shout.Dorris was found in his cabin with his eyes shut and one passenger called for him to \u201cwake up\u201d.When he came to, he said: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, guys. Is everyone all right? I saw something in front of the tram.\u201dDorris broke down in court as he recalled the moments before the tragedy, saying: \u201cIt was like I went into shock. I could not do anything. I wanted to reach for the brake but at that stage the tram was already going over and I was thrown out of the chair and I could not do anything.\u201cI can remember being thrown from the chair to the side of the cabin and my shoulder took the impact and I hit the side of my head on the side of the cabin.\u201cI can remember lying on the floor and then it goes black; I passed out, because I cannot remember the tram sliding or becoming stationary.\u201cThe next thing, I remember hearing voices and people kicking trying to open the cabin door.\u201dProsecutor Jonathan Ashley-Norman KC said it was an \u201caccident waiting to happen\u201d.He told jurors: \u201cWhether by virtue of a micro-sleep, or by virtue of becoming disorientated in some other way, or a combination of the two, Mr Dorris failed to attend to the most basic of requirements of a driver of a passenger vehicle, namely remaining alert and attentive at the controls.\u201dDorris was described as having an \u201cimpeccable\u201d past record and was seen as one of the better drivers.The court heard of an alleged \u201cnear-miss\u201d 10 days before the derailment in an identical location at a similar time involving another driver.Defence barrister Miles Bennett said a passenger had \u201cgenuinely feared for their safety\u201d.But Sarah Claypole, who was a senior manager at the time, told jurors she was unaware of the alleged incident or of drivers failing to report errors.\n\nThe trial of Alfred Dorris concluded today; we note the decision reached and will consider this appropriatelyOffice of Road and RailIt was also suggested that other \u201cenvironmental and external factors outside his control\u201d relating to the infrastructure around the Sandilands area combined to cause the defendant to become disorientated.The Old Bailey jurors were not told that an inquest in 2021 concluded that the victims died as a result of an accident and were not unlawfully killed.At the time, several members of the victims\u2019 families walked out of the room at Croydon Town Hall in tears and there were demands for a new inquest with more witnesses called to give evidence about alleged safety failings.Dorris had been excused from attending the inquest because he was suffering from severe post-traumatic stress disorder.The ORR said in a statement: \u201cWe conducted an extensive, detailed and thorough investigation and took\u202fthe decision to prosecute\u202fTransport for London (TfL),\u202fTram Operations Limited (ToL) and driver Alfred Dorris\u202ffor what we believed to be serious health and safety failings relating to the Croydon tram derailment.\u201cThe trial of Alfred Dorris concluded today; we note the decision reached and will consider this appropriately.\u201cTransport for London (TfL) and Tram Operations Limited (ToL) entered guilty pleas in 2022 and will be sentenced at a later date.\u201cOur thoughts remain with those affected by the tragedy.\u201dJoe Collett, whose brother Donald died in the derailment, said there were \u201cno winners at all\u201d and felt the system had let him down.He told reporters outside the Old Bailey he was \u201cvery disappointed\u201d because \u201cthe only one who knows what happened and the truth is Mr Dorris\u201d.He said: \u201cHe had done the journey several thousand times and this day (he) said he had a bad day \u2013 but seven people had a worst day.\u201cHe knows what he\u2019s done. He knows the truth. He was the driver.\u201dHe added: \u201cI\u2019ve got no real feelings against him because he didn\u2019t intend to do what happened.\u201dVictim Mark Smith\u2019s mother Jean said she was \u201cspeechless\u201d and \u201cgobsmacked\u201d at the verdict.She said: \u201cAt the end of the day he may have been found not guilty, but he was driving that tram and nobody else was.\u201dMrs Smith said she felt failed by the judicial system \u201cbig time\u201d.She added: \u201cWe\u2019re not the first family to have gone through something like this and we certainly won\u2019t be the last.\u201cSo it needs a radical shake-up. I think it\u2019s geared to defend the wrong people and so people like us just don\u2019t get no justice. But hey ho.\u201cIf it hadn\u2019t been for the ORR, it was only through them we had the last crack of the whip. This is the end of the trial for us.\u201cWe\u2019ll get over this like we get over everything else and we\u2019ll just carry on our lives. Unfortunately it\u2019s a lot emptier without our Mark. And there\u2019s going to be a little eight-year-old boy who\u2019s going to wonder why nobody\u2019s responsible for what happened to his daddy.\u201d\n\nIt's something that I am going to have to live with for the rest of my life. And I would just like to end by saying there are no winners in this caseAlfred DorrisFather Colin Smith said \u201cIt\u2019s just a burden of shame basically at the end of the day. Whoever was responsible for it is beside the point now it\u2019s been proven the other way.\u201cSo if I was driving a car it would be a different outcome. I would be responsible and that\u2019s the way I see it.\u201dSister Stacey added: \u201cIt simply defies logic that you have 12 embankment lights on Sandilands exit, and somehow someone who was allegedly awake, alert and concentrating missed all of those in addition to 20kph speed limits.\u201dIn a statement outside court, Mr Dorris thanked his legal teams and family for their support over the past seven \u201cdifficult\u201d years.He said: \u201cI woke up that morning and turned up for work as a professional tram driver.\u201cI had every intention to carry out my duties as a professional, and that included to take reasonable care of my passengers and myself.\u201cUnfortunately, that morning went horribly wrong. And that was because of something I wasn\u2019t in control of.\u201cBut I am deeply and sincerely sorry I wasn\u2019t able to do anything to stop that tram from turning over.\u201cI\u2019m sorry that some of you have lost someone. Some of you have had life-changing injuries, and all of you have suffered and endured the mental trauma since the accident.\u201cI\u2019m truly and deeply sorry. It\u2019s something that I am going to have to live with for the rest of my life.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeA video of a party held at Conservative Campaign Headquarters (CCHQ) in December 2020 while Covid restrictions were in place \u201ctells a story way beyond the original photo\u201d, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner has said.Footage obtained by the Sunday Mirror, which appears to show Conservative staff dancing and joking about lockdown rules, has been handed to the force, the paper said on Monday evening.It comes after Downing Street suggested Boris Johnson\u2019s resignation honours could be reviewed by a special committee if nominees are deemed to have brought the honours system \u201cinto disrepute\u201d.The event was attended by former London mayoral candidate Shaun Bailey and Tory aide Ben Mallet, who were put forward for a peerage and an OBE respectively by Mr Johnson.Sir Mark Rowley also appeared to imply that action is likely to be taken over the footage.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow live\u201cThe team are looking at that with a view to whether that provides a basis for further investigation\u2026 I think we can all see the colourful nature of the video and how much it tells a story way beyond the original photo,\u201d he told the News Agents podcast.\u201cI need to let a team work through that but I think we can all guess which way it will go.\u201dThe Metropolitan Police confirmed it is reviewing new material in relation to the party.Tory activists were invited to what was described as a \u201cjingle and mingle\u201d party, according to the BBC, despite members of the public being banned from seeing each other under Covid regulations in place at the time.The comments come as Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said that Mr Bailey and Mr Mallet should not receive their honours, while former Tory justice secretary Sir Robert Buckland suggested they should decline them.\n\nMost people looking at that would say it is simply inappropriate for two of the people in that video to be getting honoursSir Keir Starmer, Labour leaderNo 10 said Rishi Sunak had followed a \u201clongstanding\u201d convention by refusing to interfere with a former prime minister\u2019s resignation honours.The Prime Minister\u2019s official spokesman, asked whether Mr Bailey and Mr Mallet should give up their honours following their attendance at the party, brought up\u00a0the work of the Forfeiture Committee.He said: \u201cIt is for the Forfeiture Committee to consider cases when put to it if there are claims about bringing the honour system into disrepute.\u201cIt\u2019s not an investigatory body and it does not decide on whether people have committed specific acts, but it reflects on the findings of investigations or makes recommendations about whether the system has been brought into disrepute.\u201cIt is for their committee to look at, if they wish to.\u201dAccording to the committee\u2019s website, a decision to forfeit an honour can be based on events that pre-date the award or conduct that occurs after the award is made.Since the video of the CCHQ lockdown party was published, the Metropolitan Police has confirmed the footage is part of new material it is reviewing into potential rule breaches dating back to 2020 and 2021.The Christmas event took place when indoor socialising was banned and people across the country were separated from family and friends.Sir Mark said: \u201cWe\u2019re not routinely opening every minor historic allegation. So, if you phoned up about your neighbour from three years ago, we\u2019re not going to reopen that. But clearly cases that are particularly serious, particularly concerning, we will do.\u201cAs people know, that case has been previously looked at based on a photo. It\u2019s very obvious a video tells a much richer, clearer story than a photo.\u201dHe also told the podcast: \u201cOne of the things we\u2019ve taken account of in the past, of course, has been those involved in sort of setting the law and setting the policy being an aggravating feature, for example.\u201dMr Bailey had reportedly left the gathering when the video was taken and has previously apologised for his involvement.Opposition leader Sir Keir, who has ruled out submitting his own resignation honours if he becomes premier, said it was an \u201copen matter\u201d as to whether the Tory figures should be stripped of their Lords\u2019 seat and gong respectively.He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cI certainly don\u2019t think they should be getting honours.\u201cI think the Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, should have said no. But he didn\u2019t, he waved it through.\u201cAnd whether that can now be reversed I think is an open matter.\u201cBut certainly, anyone looking at that video \u2013 it is only the latest videos or evidence of wrongdoing at Downing Street or Tory Party headquarters \u2013 most people looking at that would say it is simply inappropriate for two of the people in that video to be getting honours.\u201dRecommendedBritish adventurer among those on submarine missing near wreck of the TitanicGovernment assured me over Johnson judgment, Harriet Harman saysMore than 650,000 operations and appointments rescheduled due to strikesMr Johnson went on to resign as an MP only hours after his resignation honours were made public earlier this month, quitting after learning a cross-party Commons committee had concluded he lied to Parliament when he made assurances that Covid rules had been followed in No 10.There has been an ongoing row between Mr Johnson\u2019s allies and Mr Sunak\u2019s administration after a number of Tory MPs put forward for a place in the House of Lords did not appear on the final resignation list."}, {"_id": "64917c4651ac331becf3e83b", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/paddington-stabbing-city-westminster-college-b2360355.html", "primaryCategory": "Crime", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Teenage boy dies in stabbing near City of Westminster College in Paddington", "lead": "<p>Group of young people seen in tears on steps of City of Westminster College</p>", "author": "Joseph Draper", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 18:18:58", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:15:34.213432", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-19T18:18:58+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/19/18/0e4c6ec1098d3e1bf872fc000946925eY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg3MjgxNjM2-2.72676712.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

move\u201d.The cross-party committee concluded that Mr Johnson, who quit as an MP and labelled the probe a \u201ckangaroo court\u201d after being told in advance of its findings, should have faced a 90-day suspension for misleading the House when he told the Commons that Covid rules were obeyed in No 10 despite parties taking place.It also recommended banning the ex-premier from receiving a pass to access Parliament which is usually available to former MPs.It is not clear whether there will ultimately be a vote on the conclusions of the report, which could go through on the nod unless there are objections from Mr Johnson\u2019s supporters.The former prime minister was urging his allies not to oppose it, arguing that the sanctions have no practical effect, although critics argue that the level of support shown for him would have been very low anyway.Mr Johnson and his loyalists have sought to discredit the committee\u2019s inquiry, including by accusing its chairwoman, veteran Labour MP Harriet Harman, of holding \u201cprejudicial views\u201d.But during the debate, Ms Harman said the Government gave her assurances that she would not be seen as biased in her judgment of Mr

faith in our parliamentary democracy.\u201dConservative MPs will be given a free vote, but allies of Mr Johnson warned they could face battles with their local parties to remain as candidates at the next election if they back the motion.Mr Sunak has claimed his reticence about publicising his view on the report\u2019s conclusions is because he \u201cwouldn\u2019t want to influence anyone in advance\u201d of the potential vote.But publicly backing the report and its sanctions could risk deepening the Tory civil war between Johnson loyalists and his own administration.The Prime Minister\u2019s official spokesman said he had afternoon meetings on Monday, including hosting his Swedish counterpart, Ulf Kristersson, before attending a dinner in the evening.Pressed repeatedly on

every individual MP to make a decision of what they want to do when the time comes.\u201cIt\u2019s important the Government doesn\u2019t get involved in that because it is a matter for Parliament and members as individuals, not as members (of) Government.\u201dLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer told the programme the Prime Minister should participate if there is a Commons vote, saying: \u201cHe should show leadership \u2013 come along, get in the lobby, and show us where he stands on this.\u201dLiberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper said: \u201cRefusing to back this motion would be an insult

I did the same things to my friends in the pub that my co-stars did to me.\u201cI thought that only they knew the information and had leaked it to the press. I am guilty of the same thing to my friends.\u201cI treated them with immense suspicion, and eventually abandoned my local pub as I felt so paranoid. I now deeply regret this.\u201dHe also said in his statement he is a very private person and that he did not want to come to London, but wants to see \u201cjustice done for the injustices done by the defendant in the past\u201d.He added: \u201cThe whole thing is frustrating, annoying and needless.\u201cI don\u2019t want to be reopening my private life ,but have been forced to relive the past again throughout the course of this litigation.\u201cI have had my fair share of the courts already, and am annoyed that I may be required to go to court again as the defendant is being unreasonable and refusing to engage sensibly with my claim.\u201cI feel that they are wasting everybody\u2019s time. They know they have done wrong, and I cannot understand why they are unable to hold their hands up and admit it.\u201cHaving revisited all this material again, I have decided that I want my day in court.\u201cI need an acknowledgment from MGN that it has had a huge impact on my life and needs to face up to what it has done.\u201dDuring cross-examination by Richard Munden, for MGN, the actor was asked why he had compared being a mole to being a sex offender in his witness statement, and said he had made that comparison before he was charged.Mr Le Vell added that being a mole \u201cwas one of the worst things you could do in our business\u201d.He added: \u201cIf there\u2019s no trust, then there\u2019s nothing there.\u201cFor Craig Charles to come up to me and accuse me of being a mole, it was mortifying.\u201dAsked again about the suggestion that being a mole was worse than being a sex offender, Mr Turner said: \u201cIt\u2019s obviously not.\u201dMr Le Vell\u2019s case relates to 28 articles published in MGN titles between 1991 and 2011.The court also heard evidence from David Seymour, a former political editor of the Mirror, who said he had \u201cwitnessed the work and behaviour\u201d of the newspaper\u2019s former editor Piers Morgan and regarded him as \u201cunreliable and boastful who was apt to tell untruths when it suited him\u201d.Mr Seymour said in a witness statement that he had also witnessed Mr Morgan\u2019s \u201cinvolvement in relation to an incident relating to phone hacking\u201d.He referred to a 2006 Daily Mail article written by Mr Morgan in which he said he was played a tape of a message left by Sir Paul McCartney to Heather Mills towards the end of their marriage, in which he said the former Beatle sang We Can Work It Out into the phone.Mr Seymour said in his statement: \u201cWhat I know about this episode was that I was walking through the newsroom one day, I assume this was in March 2001, and Piers Morgan was standing in the middle with a group of reporters around him.\u201cHe was holding a tape machine and was very jolly. He said to us all \u2018listen to this\u2019, then switched on the machine and we could clearly hear Paul McCartney\u2019s voice singing the Beatles song \u2018And I love her\u2019.\u201cHe replayed it a couple of times, laughing each time, mockingly. I am pretty sure from my recollection that the song was And ILove Her, and that Mr Morgan gets this wrong in his article.\u201dMr Seymour said he had recounted this story while giving evidence to the Leveson Inquiry into press standards and ethics.Mr Munden said last week that Mr Le Vell\u2019s case is \u201cparticularly weak\u201d, saying some articles in the claim were before phone hacking started or when it had \u201csignificantly dropped off\u201d.The trial before Mr Justice Fancourt is due to continue with further evidence from Mr Le Vell on Tuesday and conclude at the end of the month, with a ruling expected at a later date."}, {"_id": "64917c4851ac331becf3e843", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/boris-johnson-mps-sinn-fein-conservative-covid-b2360370.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Johnson\u2019s premiership \u2018disastrous from start to finish\u2019, says O\u2019Neill", "lead": "The Sinn Fein vice president said the Conservative\u2019s time in government had been \u2018bad for everybody\u2019.", "author": "Claudia Savage", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 16:25:03", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:15:36.729466", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-19T16:25:03+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/19/17/c4f7781dd329ca3b443887070b57239aY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg3Mjc2NDk2-2.72614439.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

They had been in an Airbnb property and had been visited by strippers, they had then gone out to the bars in the Brighton area.\u201cIn July 2021, social distancing was still in place \u2013 many bars were not open or had closed early.\u201cThe group had been in the course of looking for somewhere to drink, met the group containing [the alleged victim] and indicated they were looking for somewhere to drink. The defendant and his group were complaining about the lack of choice.\u201c[The alleged victim] suggested that the bars in the beach area might still be open. The two groups ended up walking to the seafront together.\u201cAs they moved forward they were chatting, the defendant\u2019s group were unfamiliar with the Brighton area.\u201cAs the interaction between the groups continued you will see, because police obtained CCTV, [the alleged victim] was helping them, she was being friendly.\u201cAt various points she shares a bottle of wine with the defendant and one of his friends. At various points she hugs the defendant and one of his friends.\u201cThere\u2019s a point that she and the defendant hold hands then stop and continue walking separately.\u201dThe defendant and the woman then go to the seafront. In the alleged victim\u2019s police interview she told officers Knight wanted to go into the sea and she did not wish to but he persuaded her telling her \u201cit was his stag night, he was meant to be having fun but it was turning into a rubbish night\u201d, Miss Syed added.The defendant looked like he was going to cry, the prosecution told the jury, so the woman said yes and took off her dress as she did not want it to get wet.Knight moved behind the woman in the water then moved her underwear and that is when the alleged sexual activity took place, Ms Syed said.The woman asked the defendant \u201cwhat are you doing\u201d and said \u201cstop\u201d and he did not reply, she said in her police interview.\u201cI said you\u2019re getting married in two weeks, just stop, don\u2019t do that, and he just didn\u2019t stop,\u201d the prosecution said reading from the woman\u2019s police interview.The prosecution said the woman was then raped. The woman said during the interview she said \u201cstop\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t\u201d to the defendant and she did not move, she said she thought she was in shock.The woman said the defendant then got out of the water, then the woman got out, put her dress back on and went to sit by a friend.She said: \u201cI didn\u2019t say anything and then the guy who I was in the sea with, his friend came over to me and said \u2018oh Larry, Larry wants me to tell you that he\u2019s sorry, Larry wants to say like, sorry\u2019.\u201cI didn\u2019t look up at him, I didn\u2019t want to engage with any of them.\u201dThe woman said she then told her friend what happened and called 999, the prosecution added.Knight was arrested on July 28 2021 and provided a prepared statement in which he said the woman was being \u201cflirtatious with all of them\u201d. He said she suggested they go into the sea and said she reached behind and touched his genitals and said he did not penetrate her.The defendant returned for a second interview on January 5 2022 and provided another prepared statement saying he moved her underwear and it was consensual, but then she said \u201caren\u2019t you getting married\u201d and he stopped.The prosecution said the defendant \u201ctook advantage of this young woman who was clearly in drink\u201d.Knight, of Albert Road, Leyton, Waltham Forest, east London, who the Met said has been suspended from duty, is on trial at Southwark Crown Court where he denies charges of rape and sexual assault.The trial continues."}, {"_id": "64917c4951ac331becf3e845", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/covid-david-cameron-pandemic-flu-b2360203.html", "primaryCategory": "Home News", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Covid inquiry: David Cameron defends austerity \u2013 but admits weakness in preparing for pandemic", "lead": "<p>The Trades Union Congress said David Cameron is \u2018in denial about the huge damage caused by his austerity policies\u2019 </p>", "author": "Sam Blewett and Archie Mitchell", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 16:03:12", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:15:37.271728", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-19T16:03:12+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/19/12/b521a7618c475b922117c2a7911299d3Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg3MjU4MzMz-2.72672577.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Get the free Morning Headlines email for news from our reporters across the worldSign up to our free Morning Headlines email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Nobody from Stonegate had carried out any specific risk assessment of this measure. Nobody from the club had turned their mind to the dangersProsecutor Jamie Hill KCMs Burt, from Milford on Sea, Hampshire, was a member of the Sailing Club and social secretaries of the various sports teams would distribute wristbands to members so they could queue-jump at the back entrance, Mr Hill said.Door staff were supplied by an external company, and Mr Hill said there was \u201csome criticism\u201d of the way they managed the queues, but the legal responsibility for health and safety remained with the pub company.CCTV footage showed queues building up in the precinct after 11pm as the venue filled towards its capacity of 630, the court heard.Mr Hill said: \u201cFor at least 12 months, when queues formed, students were asked to stand along the side of the decorative screen.\n\nWe say that by bringing the decorative screen into use to direct and order the queue to the back door, the club were using it for a purpose for which it was entirely unsuitableProsecutor Jamie Hill KC\u201cNobody from Stonegate had carried out any specific risk assessment of this measure.\u201cNobody from the club had turned their mind to the dangers.\u201dA nightclub queue was different from that of a museum, he said, with some people having had a drink and at times there would be pushing and shoving, \u201cbut nothing like a football crowd\u201d.\u201cWe say that by bringing the decorative screen into use to direct and order the queue to the back door, the club were using it for a purpose for which it was entirely unsuitable,\u201d he said.\u201cAny kind of risk assessment would have made the company realise that the screen could be pushed over and someone may well be injured.\u201dAlthough the decorative screen was not suitable for crowd management, it was \u201cnevertheless heavy\u201d, Mr Hill said, and it had toppled over about half-an-hour before the fatal incident.Mr Hill said it took four people to lift it back into place.Two panels had come off it, and the structure which was \u201calready unfit for the purpose of crowd management had been further weakened\u201d, Mr Hill said.This earlier collapse of the screen was an \u201cimportant missed opportunity\u201d, the prosecution said, and students should have been moved away from it.\n\nOlivia fell through the panels, the screen went over, others fell and tragically Olivia died despite the attempts of initially students, door staff and then paramedics, nothing could be done. She had suffered a devastating head injuryProsecutor Jamie Hill KCMr Hill said: \u201cBy re-erecting that barrier, and allowing the queuing to continue, we say they allowed the conditions leading to Olivia\u2019s death to persist.\u201dMs Burt and her friends arrived after the first screen collapse and were unaware it had happened.Between 11.30pm and midnight, the venue was full and large numbers of people were waiting to get in, Mr Hill said.\u201cPart of the queue was lined up next to the decorative screen, and some students were leaning against it.\u201cThere was a holding area for others arriving, but those numbers were continuing to grow.\u201d\n\nThe prosecution says the fatal accident was foreseeable, predictable and preventableProsecutor Jamie Hill KCAt 11.48pm, the decorative screen gave way again, the court heard.Mr Hill said: \u201cOlivia fell through the panels, the screen went over, others fell and tragically Olivia died despite the attempts of initially students, door staff and then paramedics, nothing could be done.\u201cShe had suffered a devastating head injury.\u201dHe said: \u201cThe prosecution says the fatal accident was foreseeable, predictable and preventable.\u201dThe trial, which is expected to last up to three weeks, continues."}, {"_id": "64917c4a51ac331becf3e84c", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/boris-johnson-partygate-vote-live-b2360322.html", "primaryCategory": "UK Politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Watch: MPs vote on Partygate report after committee finds Boris Johnson misled Parliament", "lead": "<p>Watch as MPs vote on the <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/partygate\">Partygate</a> report on Monday, 19 June, after the Privileges Committee found that <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/boris-johnson\">Boris Johnson</a> misled <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/parliament\">Parliament</a> over rule-breaking parties at <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/downing-street\">Downing Street</a> during <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/covid\">Covid</a>-19 lockdowns.</p>", "author": "Holly Patrick", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 15:29:11", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:15:38.927752", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-19T15:29:11+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/19/00/8151c683434f2b70d8d4b7e02dc4e428Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg3MjE1Mzc5-2.72455784.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up for the View from Westminster email for expert analysis straight to your inboxGet our free View from Westminster email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

According to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics, 319 university students died by suicide between the academic years of 2016/17 to 2019/20. Natasha was a \u201cwonderful\u201d person, her parents, from West Bridgford, Nottingham, said. She was bright, played the piano and cello and loved cooking.She also suffered from crippling social anxiety. According to her friends, they would have to talk to assistants in shops on Natasha\u2019s behalf or order her drinks at the bar.So when the second-year physics student was first faced with an oral assessment, she was said to have run out of the room.Mr Abrahart said the University of Bristol \u201clet us down, they let Natasha down\u201d  (Bob and Maggie Abrahart)According to her parents, she was forced to continue with these assessments throughout the six months before her death otherwise, she was told she would have failed the year and potentially been kicked out of university.The University of Bristol said its staff offered Natasha \u201calternative options for her assessments to alleviate the anxiety she faced\u201d.But she became depressed and started having suicidal ideations. This was when her flatmate sent that email from her account on her behalf.University staff did accompany her to a GP appointment and followed up a couple of times, her parents said, \u201cbut that was it\u201d.

We put complete faith in them - they let us down, they let Natasha down.\u201dIn their subsequent quest for answers, which began shortly after they both retired, former NHS mental health worker Mrs Abrahart and her former university professor husband successfully sued the University of Bristol under the Equality Act last March.Judge Alex Ralton found the university had breached its duties to make reasonable adjustments to how it assessed Natasha, engaged in indirect disability discrimination and treated her unfavourably.He found that these breaches led to her death, noting that experts said the main cause of her depressive illness was academic oral assessments and the university was ordered to award her parents \u00a350,000 in damages. However, the university has been granted permission to appeal the ruling, so the couple said they have not yet received the compensation.The court also failed to accept the university had a duty of care towards Natasha, leaving her parents frustrated at the lack of long-term change that could potentially help others. Natasha\u2019s parents said she was a \u201cwonderful\u201d person, fiercely bright, played the piano and cello, and loved cooking (Maggie and Bob Abrahart)Her father said: \u201cThe worst thing about Bristol is that rather than make changes to save people like Natasha, they\u2019ve made no changes and instead decided to argue in court to not make life-protecting changes.

Unfortunately, it\u2019s a lot emptier without our Mark.\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a little eight-year-old boy who\u2019s going to wonder why nobody\u2019s responsible for what happened to his daddy.\u201dFather Colin Smith said: \u201cIt\u2019s just a burden of shame, basically, at the end of the day. Whoever was responsible for it is beside the point now it\u2019s been proven the other way.\u201dMr Collett\u2019s brother Joe there were \u201cno winners at all\u201d and also felt the system had let him down.He told reporters he felt \u201cvery disappointed\u201d because \u201cthe only one who knows what happened and the truth is Mr Dorris\u201d.He added: \u201cHe had done the journey several thousand times and this day he said he had a bad day \u2013 but seven people had a worst day.\u201dPhilip Logan\u2019s granddaughter Danielle Wynne said: \u201cA not guilty verdict to me is like someone stabbing me in the chest. It feels so deflating.\u201cI don\u2019t believe that morning (Mr Dorris) set out to kill anyone. But he did kill people. There has to be some kind of accountability.\u201dIn a statement outside court, Mr Dorris of Beckenham, south-east London, said: \u201cI woke up that morning and turned up for work as a professional tram driver.\u201cI had every intention to carry out my duties as a professional and that included to take reasonable care of my passengers and myself.\u201cUnfortunately, that morning went horribly wrong. And that was because of something I wasn\u2019t in control of.\u201cI am deeply and sincerely sorry I wasn\u2019t able to do anything to stop that tram from turning over.\u201cI\u2019m sorry that some of you have lost someone. Some of you have had life-changing injuries and all of you have suffered and endured the mental trauma since the accident.\u201cI\u2019m truly and deeply sorry. It\u2019s something that I am going to have to live with for the rest of my life. I would just like to end by saying there are no winners in this case.\u201dPreviously, the court heard it had been a wet, wintry morning when Tram 2551 embarked on its route from New Addington to Wimbledon via East Croydon.At a sharp left turn on the approach to Sandilands, drivers are instructed to reduce speed to 12mph (20kph) to safely negotiate the curve, with a sign on the bend confirming it.Mr Dorris was travelling in excess of 43mph (70kph), causing the inner wheels to come off the track and the tram to tip over.Survivors described being \u201cflung\u201d about as if in a washing machine or a pinball machine, then a moment of silence before people began to scream and shout.Mr Dorris broke down in court as he recalled the moments before the tragedy, saying: \u201cIt was like I went into shock. I could not do anything. I wanted to reach for the brake but at that stage the tram was already going over and I was thrown out of the chair, and I could not do anything.\u201cI can remember being thrown from the chair to the side of the cabin and my shoulder took the impact, and I hit the side of my head on the side of the cabin.\u201cI can remember lying on the floor and then it goes black; I passed out, because I cannot remember the tram sliding or becoming stationary.\u201cThe next thing, I remember hearing voices and people kicking trying to open the cabin door.\u201dProsecutor Jonathan Ashley-Norman KC said it was an \u201caccident waiting to happen\u201d.Mr Dorris was described as having an \u201cimpeccable\u201d past record and was seen as one of the better drivers.The court heard of an alleged \u201cnear-miss\u201d 10 days before the derailment in an identical location at a similar time involving another driver.The Old Bailey jurors were not told that an inquest in 2021 concluded that the victims died as a result of an accident and were not unlawfully killed.Dorris had been excused from attending the inquest because he was suffering from severe post-traumatic stress disorder."}, {"_id": "64917c4c51ac331becf3e851", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/boris-johnson-liz-truss-punishment-harsh-b2360135.html", "primaryCategory": "UK Politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Liz Truss says tabloid \u2018wet lettuce\u2019 gag was not funny", "lead": "<p>Former PM brands prophetic stunt \u2018puerile\u2019 </p>", "author": "Jon Stone", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 15:15:43", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:15:40.202425", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-19T15:15:43+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/05/09/10/debd6b6532c49d620b120ab8fb9567cfY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjgzNzA5MjEw-2.69452669.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up for the View from Westminster email for expert analysis straight to your inboxGet our free View from Westminster email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeA tabloid newspaper\u2019s running joke that Liz Truss\u2019s premiership would be outlasted by a lettuce was not funny, the former prime minister has said.Ms Truss on Monday broke her silence over the prophetic gag, telling a conference: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s funny, I just think it\u2019s puerile.\u201dThe Daily Star ran a series of irreverent front pages in the dying days of her premiership, provoking mirth on social media and beyond.But speaking at the News Xchange conference in Dublin, Britain\u2019s shortest-serving prime minister declined to say she could \u201csee the funny side\u201d of the joke.\u201cIf I\u2019ve got a criticism of the media \u2013 there\u2019s too much focus on the people and seeing it as a sort of entertaining story to follow\u2026 rather than discussions of the ideas. And I particularly find that true on economics,\u201d Ms Truss said.RecommendedRishi Sunak to meet King Charles as Truss defends her record - liveJohnson was \u2018begging people for votes\u2019 in a \u2018demeaning\u2019 way, says IDSWelcome, PM Sunak \u2013 the last best option to take over from Truss\u201cDid I and my colleagues get everything perfect about communication? No, we didn\u2019t. But I think we\u2019re operating in an environment where the economic ideas that I believe in are not widely understood.\u201dMs Truss was ultimately outlasted by the lettuce, resigning after just 49 days in the job after her economic policies unleashed a wave of chaos on the markets. A \u201cmini-budget\u201d meant to kickstart economic growth instead came close to collapsing the pension system and sent mortgage interest rates soaring.\u201cI think the British media are known around the world for being particularly vociferous\u2026 I don\u2019t think they\u2019re particularly deferential to politicians,\u201d she also told the conference.But she said \u201cirreverence\u201d could be a good thing and that she would \u201crather live in a country where there is a robust debate than what the alternatives look like\u201d.Speaking at the same conference on Monday Ms Truss also moved to defend her predecessor, telling her audience that Boris Johnson's punishment for repeatedly holding parliament in contempt while prime minister is \"overly harsh\".Mr Johnson's short-lived successor said: \"None of us are perfect\".A privileges committee investigation into Mr Johnson published last week said the ex-PM should not get the complementary lifetime parliamentary security pass enjoyed by most former MPs.It accused him of repeatedly misleading parliament over the Partygate scandal and attacking democratic institutions through a strongly-worded resignation statement that branded the inquiry a \"witch hunt\". But Ms Truss, who served as foreign secretary under Mr Johnson, said she would unfortunately not be back in London in time to vote on the report in the House of Commons. This means she will dodge the politically difficult choice of whether to vote for or against sanctions on Mr Johnson. Either choice could potentially alienate groups of political supporters, were she ever to attempt to return to front line politics \u2013\u00a0as has been claimed by some allies.But asked about the committee's findings, she said she believed its \"judgment was pretty harsh\".\"He himself has said he's made mistakes, and none of us are perfect,\" she said.\"I'm not questing the integrity of the report that parliamentarians have put forward. I think the judgment is pretty harsh, but I'm not questioning the integrity of those people.\"Ms Truss said her predecessor had motivated some people with his vision of Britain and is \"not popular among what you might call the sort of 'elite intelligentsia' in Britain\".\n\nUK news in picturesShow all 501/50UK news in pictures\n\nUK news in pictures17 June 2023Typhoon fighter jets fly over The

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe \u201cringleader\u201d of the notorious street gang Mali Boys has been found guilty of two murders amid a spate of tit-for-tat violence, it can now be reported.On November 16 2017, Hamza Ul Haq was involved in the fatal group stabbing of 18-year-old Kacem Mokrane in Walthamstow, east London.Months later, Ul Haq was involved in the mistaken identity murder of\u00a020-year-old Joseph Williams-Torres, who was shot dead as he sat with a friend in a van in March 2018.Both fatal attacks were in revenge for the murder of one of their own, 17-year-old Elijah Dornelly, in May 2017.The killers were associated with the Mali Boys gang which had been engaged in a bloody feud with the neighbouring Priory Court or Higham Hill gang in Walthamstow.In 2020, Ul Haq was found guilty of Mr Williams-Torres\u2019s murder and jailed for life.Following a three-month trial, Ul Haq was found guilty in May of Mr Mokrane\u2019s murder alongside Abdirisak Ali, 26, Luca Griffiths, 21, Kamil Kazmierski, 23.On Monday, Judge Angela Rafferty KC lifted reporting restrictions on reporting their convictions during a hearing at the Old Bailey .In a victim impact statement read to the court, Mr Mokrane\u2019s grandmother Marlene Sutton said: \u201cThe family have waited over five years for Kacem\u2019s murderers to be brought to court where the family have had to go through the whole event again due to these animals denying their guilt or making excuses for the part they played in Kacem\u2019s murder.\u201cIt has been impossible for the family to begin any form of healing process.\u201cThose who murdered Kacem, have demonstrated no remorse for their crime.\u201cThere are those in this pack who went on to commit further criminal activities and even another murder, identifying that they were out of control and dangerous.\u201dMr Mokrane was described by his family as a \u201cbig personality\u201d, who had been enjoying an apprenticeship at Thames Mead football club and had ambitions to become a professional footballer.His life was cut short when he was attacked as he made his way to a local trap house in Higham Hill Road.Two cars pulled up and 10 males got out and chased him down the road.Ul Haq was among those leading the chase with attackers brandishing knives, including a \u201cZombie flasher\u201d or \u201cpirate\u201d knife.In just 25 seconds, Mr Mokrane was surrounded, pushed up against a wall and suffered serious injuries including an eviscerated bowel and stab to the leg. He died four days later.The attacking group then ran back to the waiting vehicles which sped off.The court was told the immediate trigger for the \u201crevenge murder\u201d was an acid attack in Subway and Downtown Pizza in St James Walthamstow two days earlier.Ul Haq and others had been squirted with acid and one friend was stabbed, although not fatally.Jurors were told that incident happened amid a \u201cseries of violent retaliatory attacks\u201d between rival territorial gangs The Mali Boys, with whom the 10 attackers were associated, and the Priory Court/Higham Hill gang.The \u201cincreasingly bloodied and vengeful feud\u201d began in May 2017 with the murder of 17-year-old Elijah Dornelly. who was a friend of the defendants.Prosecutor Allison Hunter KC had said: \u201cAs a group, they were reckless and ruthless, and swift to seek revenge for any perceived challenge to their territorial supremacy.\u201cThey had grown increasingly angry, dangerous and confrontational since the murder of Elijah Dornelly which had marked the beginning of the tit-for-tat violence over the relevant period.\u201cTheir eagerness to exact their swift revenge typically resulted in either the careless mistaken identification of their specific target, or else in acts of indiscriminate violence against any member of a rival grouping.\u201dUl Haq, Ali, Griffiths, and Kazmierski will be sentenced for Mr Mokrane\u2019s murder on June 28 at the Old Bailey."}, {"_id": "64917c4c51ac331becf3e853", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/wiltshire-police-wiltshire-b2360316.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Police dogs given body armour by force \u2018when needed\u2019", "lead": "The new \u2018canine vests\u2019 will shield the animals from knife attacks and bullets, Wiltshire Police said.", "author": "Joseph Draper", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 15:12:58", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:15:40.652053", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-19T15:12:58+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/19/16/3b002ff9983594b62dc8043e3159c4a4Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg3MjczNjEx-2.43212857.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

The Home Office is not the right department, they are the perpetrators, it should be independent.\u201dHe said he wants to be proved wrong, but currently fears the compensation scheme could be closed entirely within a year \u201cwhich means thousands of people will miss out completely and they will be further retraumatised by the lack of intent and commitment from the Government to resolve this.\u201dBlack Equity Organisation chief executive Dr Wanda Wyporska said: \u201cIf the reports are correct, the Home Office, under Secretary of State Suella Braverman, will be near to completing the process of totally abdicating itself from the responsibility to right the wrongs done to the Windrush generation, and protect future generations from its cruel and discredited \u2018hostile environment\u2019 strategy.\u201cThe Prime Minister must step in and ensure that the Windrush generation and future migrants to this country aren\u2019t left to be preyed upon by a Home Office that appears to care little for their service, struggle or basic human rights. That would be a fitting tribute to the Windrush generation.\u201dThe 75th anniversary milestone is being marked with events across Britain, including the Windrush flag being raised in locations including the Houses of Parliament and the Home Office, and a national commemoration service at Southwark Cathedral on Thursday.RecommendedMother of family found dead in west London believed to have been murderedTracey Emin draws 45 portraits of women for National Portrait Gallery doorsPre-historic long-necked reptiles were decapitated by their predators \u2013 studyThe scandal, which erupted in 2018, saw many British citizens, mostly from the Caribbean, denied access to healthcare and benefits and threatened with deportation despite having the right to live in the UK.The HMT Empire Windrush first docked in England on June 22 1948 at Tilbury Docks in Essex, bringing people from the Caribbean who answered Britain\u2019s call to help fill post-war labour shortages."}, {"_id": "64917c4d51ac331becf3e855", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/mother-london-metropolitan-police-hounslow-b2360303.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Mother of family found dead in west London believed to have been murdered", "lead": "Detective are not yet sure when the family died.", "author": "Margaret Davis", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 15:05:38", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:15:41.137966", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-19T15:05:38+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/19/16/38d5375eade1bd7c4ee70400bff6fd36Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg3MjcyMDc4-2.72643880.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

constitution for the country to rule out Scotland being a home for nuclear weapons.With a final constitution only being developed after Scotland has voted for independence \u2013 and not coming into force until after people have backed it in a referendum \u2013 the First Minister and SNP leader conceded he could not\u00a0say for certain what would be in such a document.He said: \u201cBy helping enhance and protect important rights, it will make a genuine and significant difference to people\u2019s lives.\u201d\n\nIn the context of the Westminster system, these proposals do sound radicalFirst Minister Humza YousafRecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveHe spoke as he launched a new paper on plans for a written constitution, which is part of a series of papers from the Scottish Government as it seeks to make a fresh case for independence.The Tories, however, branded the new paper as being the \u201cheight of self-indulgence from Humza Yousaf\u201d, hitting out at the SNP leader for spending \u201ctaxpayers\u2019 money publishing yet another paper in relation to independence and trying to waste parliamentary time on it next week\u201d.Mr Yousaf said: \u201cA written constitution that protects, for example, an adequate standard of living, it is not abstract, I think it is fundamental to people\u2019s lives right now.\u201dHe told how having a written constitution would \u201cembody a set of longer-term, more fundamental values about what a country is for\u201d and set out a \u201ccommon understanding of a nation\u2019s priorities\u201d, as well creating a \u201cstandard below which no government should ever fall\u201d.He added: \u201cIn the context of the Westminster system, these proposals do sound radical.\u201dWith the UK not having a written constitution in place \u2013 something Mr Yousaf said made the country a \u201cglobal outlier\u201d \u2013 he claimed Westminster could abolish the Scottish Parliament, which has been in place since 1999.Speaking in Glasgow, the First Minister: \u201cThat\u2019s not an abstract concept \u2013 it is worth remembering the UK Government is already seriously considering the repeal of the Human Rights Act, one of the most significant achievements of any UK Parliament in the last 30 years.\u201cIn future, Westminster sovereignty could even allow the UK Parliament to repeal devolution through nothing other than a simple majority vote.\u201dA vote for independence would see the Scottish Parliament develop an interim constitution, which would then come into force when Scotland leaves the UK.After independence, a constitutional convention would be established to develop a permanent constitution, with this to be considered by Holyrood and also put to the people in a referendum.Mr Yousaf said such a document could \u201cprotect the right to take industrial action\u201d for workers and could also set out \u201cprovisions on the right to adequate housing, the right of communities to own land, or our right as citizens to access healthcare which is free at the point of need\u201d.He went on to state: \u201cIn the Scottish Government\u2019s view, it should also include provisions stating very clearly and explicitly that Scotland will not host nuclear weapons.\u201dThe First Minister insisted the \u201cvision\u201d in the Scottish Government paper \u201ccontrasts quite starkly\u201d with Westminster, where he said \u201crights are being systematically eroded\u201d.Scottish Conservative constitution spokesman Donald Cameron said: \u201cThe SNP are so obsessed with their push for independence that they are now pressing for not just one divisive referendum but two to take place if they ever get their way.\u201dThe Tory MSP said the First Minister \u201cknows that the obsession with breaking up the United Kingdom is the only issue that can keep the warring factions in his party together\u201d.Mr Cameron continued: \u201cHumza Yousaf has a total brass neck saying the cost of living is the number one issue for him, when he is happy to spend taxpayers\u2019 money publishing yet another paper in relation to independence and trying to waste parliamentary time on it next week.\u201cThe paper itself is full of holes and talks up completely misguided plans to ban nuclear weapons in an independent Scotland.\u201cUsing public money to campaign for independence is completely the wrong priority for Scotland.\u201cPeople want the SNP-Green government to be focused on their real priorities right now such as rising bills, fixing our NHS and strengthening our economy.\u201dScottish Labour constitution spokesperson Neil Bibby\u00a0said Mr Yousaf had been \u201cindulging in the same old constitutional pipe-dreams\u201d at the same time Sir Keir Starmer had been in Scotland to unveil Labour plans to \u201ctransform Scotland\u2019s economy and lead the way in the transition to clean energy\u201d.Mr Bibby added: \u201cHumza Yousaf may say that he wants to enshrine the NHS in the constitution, but under his watch our NHS is on its knees.\u201cHumza

They\u2019re in chimneys of old farmhouses. We can\u2019t get in but we know there are chicks there. Once they start to fledge, we\u2019ll be able to count them but we\u2019ll not get to ring those ones.\u201dMr Walsh said the newest chicks can be traced back to a then record brood of five chicks found in the area in 2018.It was then described as the largest barn owl brood recorded in Northern Ireland.He said: \u201cIt\u2019s pretty good, that all stems back to the very first nest with the five chicks, and those chicks moving out and finding mates and breeding, staying in the area and building up the local population.\u201cThe first nest with the five chicks in it, were fathered by one of the original five from 2018.\u201dMr Walsh said the numbers are good this year, but said conservation tends to have ups and downs.He said recent good weather has seen mice and rats breed more which the chicks have been eating, helping them to grow to a strong weight.\u201cWe knew it would come one day but it took its time,\u201d he said.\u201cThat\u2019s the way conservation is, you get a couple of steps forward then you\u2019ll have setbacks. It moves slowly but once it moves, it makes a big jump.\u201cThey\u2019re feeding well, one of the sites this morning we could see most of the prey were rats, and there has been a boom in young rats in that area and so the owl chicks are good and healthy as a result \u2013 the chicks were so healthy and heavy, his scales couldn\u2019t weigh them \u2013 they\u2019ve been eating well which is good as it sets them up well for the coming winter.\u201dThe Lough Neagh barn owls have tended to stay within a 12km radius.\u201cWe have put up loads of nest boxes, around 70 within a 12km radius, so hopefully they\u2019ll go to those boxes and that\u2019ll be next year\u2019s growth,\u201d he said.He described keeping a check on all the nest boxes across the countryside as at times soul destroying.He said: \u201cBut you do have to go and do it, we have boxes up at Toome, right out to the outskirts of Belfast and down to Moira so there is a lot of driving around, and most of the time they are just filled with jackdaws, not barn owls, so it is a bit soul destroying at times, but you know the good days will come like today.RecommendedMarine heatwaves \u2018catastrophic\u2019 for ocean life, say scientistsKeir Starmer pledges to cut bills by scrapping onshore wind farm banGlobal ocean temperatures hit record level for April and May\u201cThat makes it all worthwhile when you see the numbers starting to grow.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeMarine heatwaves have a \u201ccatastrophic\u201d effect on ocean ecosystems, leading to the devastation or replacement of certain species, scientists have said.The North Sea is currently experiencing one of the most extreme heatwaves on Earth, being 4-5C higher than its usual temperature for this time of year.It has been classified as category four, meaning extreme, by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.The North Atlantic is also experiencing record high temperatures for this time of year.Scientists believe this is a result of human-induced climate change pushing up the baseline of warming so that added heat from short-term natural climate processes results in record temperatures.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveThe added heat can be devastating for ecosystems that have evolved to live within a specific temperature niche.Professor Geraint Tarling, an ocean biologist at the British Antarctic Survey, (BAS) said: \u201cThe things in the North Sea adapted to the North Sea environment, which has its own level of variability, but if you\u2019re pushing things well outside of that variability, physiologically, they\u2019re not going to cope.\u201dHe said the Arctic is probably experiencing the most rapidly rising number of marine heatwaves than anywhere else and that many polar species are being replaced by more temperature ones in a process called Atlantification.\u201cWhat happens there is that you get replacements, you get winners and losers, things that respond really well, mostly things from lower latitudes, more tropical latitudes, will actually find these conditions conducive and that will replace things that are normally there,\u201d he said.\u201cThese are the things that can move.\u201cWe\u2019ve also got things on the bottom that can\u2019t and those could be extinction events, where the heatwave actually kills off a lot of things at once and it might take decades to replace them.\u201cSo then you\u2019re having a really catastrophic effect over a very short period of time.\u201dProfessor Yueng-Djern Lenn, an oceanographer at Bangor University, said: \u201cThere is no escape from the heat for sea creatures, they can\u2019t turn on the air conditioners, and this can exert heat stress on their bodies that can lead to death.\u201cWe don\u2019t know yet how long this UK event will last, but we would expect our marine ecosystems to not escape unscathed.\u201cIf there isn\u2019t enough of a break between such events, allowing the ecosystems time to recover, the only winners will be the open ocean swimmers in the short term.\u201dThe BAS said it is committing the next 60 years of research to understanding how climate change affects the polar regions and how they in turn impact on the rest of the world.They are using new technology, such as AI and autonomous vehicles, to document and understand the rapid changes now taking place in the Arctic and Antarctica, as well as how the warming atmospheres and oceans influence each other.Professor Dame Jane Francis, director of the BAS, said: \u201cWhat is happening in the polar regions affects us all.\u201cHumans are changing the climate in the areas where humans live.\u201cThat impact is going all the way to the polar regions and it\u2019s affecting the polar regions more than anywhere else in the world.RecommendedKeir Starmer pledges to cut bills by scrapping onshore wind farm banGlobal ocean temperatures hit record level for April and MayWarnings trophy-hunting ban could be \u2018thwarted\u2019 as Tory peers express concerns\u201cThose melting glaciers, those big volumes of ice and rivers of ice that are coming off the land are melting much quicker than we ever thought they would.\u201cAnd as they do, so that water from from glaciers is changing the global sea level.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64917c4f51ac331becf3e85c", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/christopher-nkunku-transfer-chelsea-leipzig-pochettino-b2360767.html", "primaryCategory": "Football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Chelsea sign \u00a352m Christopher Nkunku from Leipzig in first transfer under Mauricio Pochettino", "lead": "<p>The France international joins on a six-year deal </p>", "author": "Karl Matchett", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 10:10:01", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:15:43.308001", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-20T10:10:01+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/20/11/GettyImages-1494062728.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Miguel Delaney\u2019s Reading the Game newsletter sent straight to your inbox for freeSign up to Miguel\u2019s Delaney\u2019s free weekly newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeAnother year of UFC action is upon us, as fans anticipate Conor McGregor\u2019s long-awaited return to the Octagon as well as some major title fights.McGregor, who remains the face of the sport, has not competed since breaking his leg in July 2021 but is due to fight Michael Chandler this autumn, though new stars have emerged elsewhere to help keep audiences engaged.In one of the biggest fights of 2023, lightweight champion Islam Makhachev retained his title against featherweight king Alexander Volkanovski, narrowly winning a decision on the latter\u2019s home turf in Australia in February. Then, in March, light-heavyweight \u2018GOAT\u2019 Jon Jones moved up to heavyweight after three years away, submitting Ciryl Gane in the first round to win the title vacated by Francis Ngannou in January, when the latter left the UFC.Later in March, Britain\u2019s Leon Edwards retained the welterweight belt with a decision win over Kamaru Usman in London, seven months after taking the title from the \u201cNigerian Nightmare\u201d with a stunning head kick. April then kicked off with Israel Adesanya finally beating long-time rival Alex Pereira, the 33-year-old knocking out the Brazilian to regain the middleweight belt that he lost to Pereira in November.There are plenty more title fights to come, too.

Read our\u00a0privacy notice\u201cOne month before the fight, we were so happy; it was a dream,\u201d Ciryl Gane reminisces. Then comes a laugh. \u201cOne minute after the fight, it was a nightmare.\u201dIt is easy to forget, but the hype around Gane\u2019s title fight with Jon Jones in March was not based on the latter\u2019s long-awaited return alone. There was genuine anticipation for what could have been an intriguing contest between a light-heavyweight great, in Jones, and a heavyweight contender who moves like a welterweight, in Gane. Once the fight started, however, that intrigue was extinguished within moments. Gane, failing to do himself justice \u2013 as he would tell you \u2013 was taken down early and submitted as the clock ticked past the two-minute mark. \u201cMy coach told me every day, every time, every training [session]: \u2018Don\u2019t throw the backhand,\u2019\u201d Gane tells The Independent. \u201c\u2018If you want, [throw] the jab \u2013 maybe the uppercut \u2013 but not the backhand.\u2019 I threw the backhand, he caught me.\u201dRecommendedTyson Fury claims UFC has offered him \u2018hybrid fight\u2019 with Jon JonesJoe Rogan is right: Tyson Fury has \u2018no chance in hell\u2019 against Jon JonesJared Cannonier breaks UFC record in win over Marvin VettoriTopuria vs Emmett live stream: How to watch UFC Fight Night online and on TV this weekendIndeed, Jones dipped his head off the centre line as Gane overcommitted to a left cross, then engulfed the 33-year-old, hauling him to the canvas \u2013 weighing down on Gane with every ounce of his new, 248lbs heavyweight frame. Once Gane had been forced to the fence, there was no escape. Jones locked in a guillotine choke, and before the fans in Las Vegas had time to comprehend what had happened, the American had forced his opponent to tap. The vacant heavyweight title was vacant no longer.To many onlookers, Jones\u2019s status as the greatest ever was confirmed within those 124 seconds. And what of Gane, the former interim champion who was sitting with his back against the cage, staring up at his victorious opponent, and coming to terms with a second loss in an undisputed-title fight? The Frenchman was, suddenly, no longer an example of the \u2018modern\u2019 heavyweight, and instead a kickboxer with a gaping hole in his game\u00a0\u2013 a gap that Jones had exploited mercilessly.Ciryl Gane reveals key coaching tip that he ignored in Jon Jones loss\u201cI was confident in this position [on the mat],\u201d Gane insists, \u201cbut I did [something] wrong. When we went back to the gym after the fight, we did only wrestling and grappling, every day. I was already confident, but I know it\u2019s really normal to be more confident and have better reflexes when you do something every day. This is gonna help me for sure.\u201dTechnical faults can be addressed, of course, but fighters sometimes suffer from intangible issues in bouts of this magnitude \u2013 in moments of this magnitude \u2013 that can define results and careers, and that are less easily expelled. \u201cIt was really difficult to explain,\u201d Gane says. \u201cPeople asked me if I felt a lot of pressure during the fight, during the press conference, the waiting... Did you see me afraid? No, I was really happy to be there! I wanted to fight against the GOAT and prove that I\u2019m a good fighter. In the cage, in front of the opponent, everybody saw me really confident. But when we started, and during the fight, something switched \u2013 I don\u2019t know exactly why. I couldn\u2019t manage the distance, I was not there. I think when you have a bad feeling, it\u2019s harder to be good technically.Jones controls Gane before submitting the Frenchman to win the vacant UFC heavyweight title  (Getty Images)\u201cI was not \u2018here\u2019,\u201d Gane stresses again. \u201cIt was not me, it just was not me \u2013 everybody knows that. That\u2019s why today, when everybody asks me if I want revenge: Yes, I want revenge, just because I want to prove that I\u2019m better than that and can put Jon Jones through more adversity.\u201dIt is unclear whether Jones will still be around by the time Gane earns a prospective third shot at the UFC heavyweight title. The American, 35, was absent from the Octagon for three years before returning to fight Gane, and his plan to face heavyweight \u2018GOAT\u2019 Stipe Miocic before the end of the year looks fragile. Jones has also continually exchanged verbal barbs with Francis Ngannou \u2013 his predecessor as UFC heavyweight champion, and a former teammate and opponent of Gane.Prior to his loss to Jones, Gane knocked out Tai Tuivasa in Paris last September  (AFP via Getty Images)But while Jones\u2019s next step is ambiguous, Gane\u2019s is clear. The Frenchman, a year on from headlining the UFC\u2019s first-ever French card, will once again fight in a main event in Paris this September. Sergey Spivak, the Moldovan heavyweight with three stoppage wins in his last three fights, will be the tormented tourist at the Accor Arena.\u201cThis is my mindset: Every time people ask who I want to fight next, it doesn\u2019t matter who,\u201d Gane says. \u201cI just want to fight, do my job, my mission. I\u2019m a competitor, so any opponent you put in front of me is going to be my mission. Spivak is well rounded \u2013 good ground game, good wrestler \u2013 so yes, it\u2019s gonna be a test. I\u2019m really happy about that.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe heavyweight division is a bad pantomime now with Tyson Fury, Oleksandr Usyk, a chorus of fighters, a few promoters and some hefty backers all trying to work out what part of the dancing horse they are. Moving away from the ugly sisters, there is every chance that the gap between the last championship fight and the next will be the longest in over 50 years. This break is not common, ignore people telling you that. Fury defended his WBC title last December against his old, old friend, Derek Chisora, and Usyk beat Anthony Joshua for the second time last August in Saudi Arabia to retain his IBF, WBA and WBO titles. Fury has no date, just social media plans, and Usyk is due to defend in Poland in late August against Daniel Dubois. It is hard to find a solitary reason for the break and even more difficult to put the blame on just one single person. There are a lot of people on the stage, and they all have a role to play. And to be honest, during the last six months they have all said too much. Sure, greed, rivalries, stupidity, lies and ego are at the very core of the problem, but boxing at the highest level has always had the same flaws, the same fluid obstacles. The standard excuses are there to overcome - that is how boxing works. RecommendedTyson Fury claims UFC has offered him \u2018hybrid fight\u2019 with Jon JonesJoe Rogan is right: Tyson Fury has \u2018no chance in hell\u2019 against Jon JonesWhy has Saudi Arabia become big player in world sport and what does future hold?Fury and Usyk for all the tarnished marbles was meant to have been signed and sealed last September. It was scheduled for April and is now a plan for December. Both boxers have insulted the other, and the theme of their mutual abuse is simple: greed. Obviously, both deny they are the greedy, money-grabbing party in the sad affair. Actually, the righteous outrage from both sides is comedy gold at times. Fury\u2019s father, the unstoppable \u201cGypsy John\u201d Fury, has demanded that Usyk apologise for his criticism. He has warned that if there is no apology, there might be a straightener in a field somewhere, man-to-man. There is honour at stake. It is endless mirth, it really is. Fury (right) beat Derek Chisora in December to stay unbeaten and retain the WBC heavyweight title (Zac Goodwin/PA) (PA Wire)c. Some of boxing\u2019s wisest, richest and smartest brains have been involved in this ongoing lunacy. The men and women in the Fury camp blame Usyk, and the men and women in the Usyk camp blame Fury. The two main players in the Fury business, Bob Arum and Frank Warren, have a combined total of 98 years of promotion; they are both battling this madness. There is, according to some insiders, a one-off offer on the table from the government of Saudi Arabia for Fury and Usyk to fight there at the end of the year. Usyk has signed his deal. This offer is non-negotiable, and we know this because the media flown out to Saudi by the Saudi government have reported it as fact. As a guide to the way boxing works, there are seldom any facts involved when deals are being made, broken and made again. The real insiders are furious that Usyk and Fury, the biggest fight in boxing, is not yet across the line. The sanctioning bodies, who get paid a fee for fights, have promised to get tough with their heavyweight champions, but have not said a word or done a thing; everyone is holding out for a slice of the Saudi cash pie. \u2018Hey, it\u2019s a business,\u2019 they will say, but that little claim is wearing very thin. Usyk (right) last fought in August, outpointing Anthony Joshua for the second fight in a row  (Getty Images)Fury, meanwhile, has mentioned 10 possible opponents in his social media rants in the last few weeks, including a plan to fight two UFC icons in one night. Usyk and Dubois went to purse bids, which is one of boxing\u2019s ancient rituals, and Usyk\u2019s team won. The fight is scheduled for August. Looking in from the side of the crowded stage is Joshua. His fight with Fury was announced by Fury on 10 June, 2020; it would have been a fight for the ages, for all the belts and all the bragging rights. It never happened and it has come close a couple of times since then. Joshua, meanwhile, will fight in August and it might be Dillian Whyte. There is a rumour that Whyte wants too much for the fight; the flip side of that rumour is that Whyte was offered too little. In America, Deontay Wilder, twice beaten in classics by Fury, has not fought since last October.

Some involved see it as a key period for the Saudi Pro League in terms of keeping the momentum going by getting truly big players.Interest in Neymar and David De Gea is now well known, but representatives are also looking at Riyad Mahrez and Bernardo Silva, and there are offers for a series of Chelsea players.

Football officials have privately pointed to the strong relationship between Chelsea majority owners Clearlake and Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund [PIF], who have billions of pounds worth of assets managed by the American firm.RecommendedFirst golf, now football? Saudi Arabia\u2019s grand plan and the 72 hours that changed everythingSportswashing is about to change football beyond anything you can imagineThe year that sportswashing won: A season that changed football foreverMany within the game are now asking about Saudi influence on Chelsea but it has long been stressed there was no involvement in Clearlake\u2019s 2022 purchase, and consequently no concern about potential conflicts of interest given the ownership of Newcastle United. The Owners and Directors test would also require that any influence be declared. It is being insisted now at Stamford Bridge that the only discussions taking place are \u201ctransactional conversations about players they\u2019re interested in\u201d.Chelsea and the Premier League have been approached for comment.The London club look to have just benefitted from good timing, although the biggest question now is how many players will actually be convinced to move, and \u201cwhat actually gets done\u201d. Lukaku is already reluctant. Manchester City\u2019s Bernardo Silva would be unlikely to even consider a proposal if it arrives.The very fact such discussions are being had does raise two wider issues for the game.Chelsea\u2019s owners could sell unwanted players to Saudi Arabia  (Getty Images)One, in the abstract, is the growing influence of private equity in football. Part of the reason such questions are being asked is that it\u2019s unclear what money funds private equity in such takeovers. The Premier League, for example, doesn\u2019t have to know.There are an increasing number of people in football who see private equity\u2019s influence - going right up to possible deals with Serie A and La Liga - as just as problematic as state ownership, especially with how the potential is there for the two to overlap.There is then the big story of the summer, which revolves around one of the most ambitious and biggest of those states. Offers from the Saudi Pro League are expected to escalate in the next few weeks, as this is viewed as a key stage of the project. Bringing Ruben Neves from Wolves was a coup but they want bigger than that.It is also why there was some disappointment about the \u201ccomplacency\u201d of Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin about the extent the Saudi Pro League\u2019s growth could distort the game.The Slovenian official gave an interview in the Netherlands on the eve of the Nations League final, in which he said the European game should not be concerned about any player exodus.\u201cNo, no, no\u2026 I think that it's mainly a mistake for Saudi Arabian football. Why is that a problem for them? Because they should invest in academies, they should bring coaches, and they should develop their own players.\"Kalidou Koulibaly struggled during his debut season for Chelsea after joining for approximately \u00a334m from Napoli (Getty Images)\u201cThe system of buying the players that almost ended their career is not the system that develops football. It was a similar mistake in China when they all brought players who are at the end of their career.\u201d\u201cTell me one player who is top, top age and who starts his career and went to play in Saudi Arabia? But it's not about money only. Players want to win top competitions. And top competition is in Europe.\u201dRecommendedCarabao Cup 2023/24 fixture dates and schedule revealedChelsea fixtures released for Premier League 2023/24 seasonManchester, Merseyside and north London derby dates revealed for 2023/24That question is something currently being tested, but a growing view is that Ceferin is wrong to make the comparison to China. Saudi Arabia has a much more developed football culture, with a good level of quality, and part of this project is improving that. There is then the wider issue of the football authorities' general lack of regulation and foresight on the influence of states and private equity groups. The next few days will nevertheless tell a lot, but this is really about the next few years."}, {"_id": "64917c5451ac331becf3e871", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/chelsea-saudi-arabia-pif-clearlake-capital-b2360712.html", "primaryCategory": "Football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Saudi Arabia can help Chelsea solve headache \u2014 but talks raise more questions than answers", "lead": "<p>The Blues could sell a number of unwanted players to Saudi clubs to boost FFP concerns and help one of the most ambitious plans in football</p>", "author": "Miguel Delaney", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 08:30:11", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:15:48.564892", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-20T08:30:11+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/19/14/GettyImages-1252573718.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Miguel Delaney\u2019s Reading the Game newsletter sent straight to your inbox for freeSign up to Miguel\u2019s Delaney\u2019s free weekly newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

It is being insisted now at Stamford Bridge that the only discussions taking place are \u201ctransactional conversations about players they\u2019re interested in\u201d.Chelsea and the Premier League have been approached for comment.The London club look to have just benefitted from good timing, although the biggest question now is how many players will actually be convinced to move, and \u201cwhat actually gets done\u201d. Lukaku is already reluctant. Manchester City\u2019s Bernardo Silva would be unlikely to even consider a proposal if it arrives.The very fact such discussions are being had does raise two wider issues for the game.Chelsea\u2019s owners could sell unwanted players to Saudi Arabia  (Getty Images)One, in the abstract, is the growing influence of private equity in football. Part of the reason such questions are being asked is that it\u2019s unclear what money funds private equity in such takeovers. The Premier League, for example, doesn\u2019t have to know.There are an increasing number of people in football who see private equity\u2019s influence - going right up to possible deals with Serie A and La Liga - as just as problematic as state ownership, especially with how the potential is there for the two to overlap.There is then the big story of the summer, which revolves around one of the most ambitious and biggest of those states. Offers from the Saudi Pro League are expected to escalate in the next few weeks, as this is viewed as a key stage of the project. Bringing Ruben Neves from Wolves was a coup but they want bigger than that.It is also why there was some disappointment about the \u201ccomplacency\u201d of Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin about the extent the Saudi Pro League\u2019s growth could distort the game.The Slovenian official gave an interview in the Netherlands on the eve of the Nations League final, in which he said the European game should not be concerned about any player exodus.\u201cNo, no, no\u2026 I think that it's mainly a mistake for Saudi Arabian football. Why is that a problem for them? Because they should invest in academies, they should bring coaches, and they should develop their own players.\"Kalidou Koulibaly struggled during his debut season for Chelsea after joining for approximately \u00a334m from Napoli (Getty Images)\u201cThe system of buying the players that almost ended their career is not the system that develops football. It was a similar mistake in China when they all brought players who are at the end of their career.\u201d\u201cTell me one player who is top, top age and who starts his career and went to play in Saudi Arabia? But it's not about money only. Players want to win top competitions. And top competition is in Europe.\u201dRecommendedCarabao Cup 2023/24 fixture dates and schedule revealedChelsea fixtures released for Premier League 2023/24 seasonManchester, Merseyside and north London derby dates revealed for 2023/24That question is something currently being tested, but a growing view is that Ceferin is wrong to make the comparison to China. Saudi Arabia has a much more developed football culture, with a good level of quality, and part of this project is improving that. There is then the wider issue of the football authorities' general lack of regulation and foresight on the influence of states and private equity groups. The next few days will nevertheless tell a lot, but this is really about the next few years."}, {"_id": "64917c5451ac331becf3e872", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/andy-murray-alex-de-minaur-time-when-queens-b2360346.html", "primaryCategory": "Tennis", "subCategories": "test", "title": "When is Andy Murray vs Alex de Minaur?

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeEngland earned another win in their Euro 2024 qualifying campaign with a ruthless display against North Macedonia at Old Trafford. The visitors had never lost in England and for 20 minutes looked up to the task of keeping the Three Lions quiet despite the gulf in quality. Harry Kane\u2019s opener, turned in from a Luke Shaw pass, opened the floodgates and Gareth Southgate\u2019s men feasted on a plethora of chances. No more so than Bukayo Saka, the brightest rising star of England\u2019s next cohort. He opened his own account with a fine twist and finish inside the box before adding two more after half-time to earn a first career hat-trick. He is forming a cut-throat partnership with Trent Alexander-Arnold, once again pushed into midfield, which could become the foundation stone of Southgate\u2019s next European Championship campaign. There were impressive performances elsewhere too. Marcus Rashford was a constant threat on the left and became the first Mancheser United player to score for England at Old Trafford since David Beckham. He made a strong case to start ahead of Jack Grealish and Raheem Sterling tonight and there was also a first international goal for substitute Kalvin Phillips who was left with a tap-in inside the box.Relive all the action as England battered North Macedonia at Old Trafford: RecommendedWhy England will head into 2024 with their sense of optimism restoredBukayo Saka cements his place as England\u2019s next leading man with first career hat-trick\u2018Exceptional\u2019 Bukayo Saka lauded by Gareth Southgate after England hat-trickEngland vs North MacedoniaBukayo Saka cements his place as England\u2019s next leading man with first career hat-trickEngland hammer North Macedonia 7-0 in a Euro 2024 qualifierThe Three Lions sit top of Group C after wins over Ukraine, Italy and Malta73\u2019 GOAL! - Kane converts the penalty before being taken off (ENG 7-0 MKD)64\u2019 GOAL! - Phillips scores his first international goal (ENG 6-0 MKD)51 GOAL! - Saka completes his hat-trick for England (ENG 5-0 MKD)47\u2019 GOAL! - Saka brings down Alexander-Arnold\u2019s pass and smashes it home (ENG 4-0 MKD)45\u2019 GOAL! - Rashford adds a third before half-time (ENG 3-0 MKD)38\u2019 GOAL! - Saka doubles England\u2019s lead with a good finish (ENG 2-0 MKD)29\u2019 GOAL! - Kane meets Shaw\u2019s pass and turns in a simple shot (ENG 1-0 MKD)Show latest update \n \n\n1687249610Why England will head into 2024 with their sense of optimism restoredIn 2023, as in 2022, a marathon season ended for England\u2019s players in June, north of their Wembley home, against eastern European opposition. And there, it is fair to say, the similarities ended. A year ago came the historic low, the 4-0 loss to Hungary at Molineux that was England\u2019s heaviest home defeat since 1928, the night Gareth Southgate was told he did not know what he was doing and when both he and many another concluded his reign was nearing an undignified end.Twelve months and five days later, a 7-0 thrashing of North Macedonia at Old Trafford capped a restorative spell. Euro 2024 beckons, a broadly positive World Cup has been followed by a quartet of qualifying wins and the feel of Southgate\u2019s reign, of youthful progressiveness, has largely been restored.The torrid June of 2022 has started to look like the anomaly, not the start of the slide. The encouraging June of 2023 has more in keeping with most of Southgate\u2019s tenure. \u201cWe look back at last summer, with four matches, [playing] behind closed doors for two and we needed to look at new players,\u201d he reflected. \u201cThere were a lot of circumstances around those.\u201dA year on, England could have been forgiven for suffering from a similar tiredness. Yet if the fixtures were easier now, there was a relish and a sharpness. Southgate fielded a forward line with three of the outstanding players of the Premier League campaign, in Harry Kane, Bukayo Saka and Marcus Rashford: they scored six of the seven goals to take their combined tally to 96 goals for the season for clubs and country. They were emblematic of a side who still showed a sharpness.\u201cPost World Cup, we have hit a sweet spot,\u201d Southgate said. The most seismic result of England\u2019s season was actually the victory over Italy in Naples but, after the 6-2 demolition of Iran in the World Cup, North Macedonia can testify that teams with the ability to get excellent results can find themselves eviscerated by England.By Richard Jolly Why England will head into 2024 with their sense of optimism restoredGareth Southgate has once again brought the feelgood factor back to England after a year that has represented the changing of the guard Jamie Braidwood20 June 2023 09:261687208410Bukayo Saka cements his place as England\u2019s next leading man with first career hat-trickThere was a period when it seemed that Bukayo Saka\u2019s golden season would end with him a Premier League champion, perhaps even anointed as Footballer of the Year. And if neither quite came to pass, he still conjured a fitting finish to a wonderful campaign.The first hat-trick of his career came in just 13 minutes and in his country\u2019s colours. As England football team\u2019s No. 7 made off with the match ball, they scored seven. North Macedonia have claimed the scalps of Italy and Germany in their recent past but they were demolished. If this could have been a group laced with pitfalls for England, with the reigning European champions, Euro 2020 quarter-finalists and a side who almost qualified for the World Cup, they have the maximum 12 points and are turning their journey to Germany next summer into a procession.If Saka\u2019s last European Championships ended with the trauma of a penalty miss in the final shootout, he has rendered it highly likely England will go to next summer\u2019s. If he started this season outside Gareth Southgate\u2019s strongest side, he ends it very much in it. A treble took his tally to six goals in his last nine caps; for country as well as club, Saka has proved more prolific than most envisaged.Bukayo Saka cements his place as England\u2019s leading man with first career hat-trickEngland 7-0 North Macedonia: Harry Kane, Marcus Rashford and Kalvin Phillips also scored as Gareth Southgate\u2019s men ran rampant at Old Trafford Mike Jones19 June 2023 22:001687207867FT England 7-0 North MacedoniaEngland hat-trick hero Bukayo Saka to Channel 4: \u201cIt\u2019s a feeling I can\u2019t put into words.

I couldn\u2019t have ended it in a better way. Time to relax and have a break.\u201cPerfect end to the season.

He was not beaten far in the Lockinge Stakes at Newbury when he tried to bite Modern Games and William Buick as they passed him Jockey Pat Dobbs felt he was in front too soon that day so this straight mile is perfect for him. He can pull off a bit of a surprise in the first race at Royal Ascot.\u201d15:05 \u2013 Army Ethos - 14/1 (each-way)\u201cTrainer Archie Watson won this last year with Bradsell for the same connections. He sent Army Ethos up to Ayr to win his maiden and he made no mistake. It was the manner of the victory that impressed and he has to be a player in this contest. Aidan O\u2019Brien\u2019s River Tiber is the likely market leader and as long as there is cut in the ground, he will take some pegging back.

She has the services of Royal Ascot regular James McDonald, which is a plus. Highfield Princess is an unbelievable story and it would be remarkable were she to win but the Aussie raider can repel her.\u201d16:20 \u2013 Paddington - 9/4\u201cThey didn\u2019t seem to go much of a gallop in the early part of the Irish 2,000 Guineas but Paddington quickened up very smartly to put the race to bed at the business end. The St James\u2019 Palace Stales is run on the round course and the best horse doesn\u2019t always win. However, Paddington has plenty of speed which will stand him in good stead and help the Ballydoyle runner edge it over Chaldean.\u201d17:00 \u2013 Calling the Wind - 9/1\u201cRichard Hughes was no stranger to the winner\u2019s enclosure as a jockey at Royal Ascot and it would mean the world to him to have a winner as a trainer.

He is the retained rider for Qatar Racing and Buckaroo got beaten in a Derby Trial last year at Leopardstown. He was only beaten and neck in a Group One in France recently and that form is good enough to win this Listed contest.

He was not beaten far in the Lockinge Stakes at Newbury when he tried to bite Modern Games and William Buick as they passed him Jockey Pat Dobbs felt he was in front too soon that day so this straight mile is perfect for him. He can pull off a bit of a surprise in the first race at Royal Ascot.\u201d15:05 \u2013 Army Ethos - 14/1 (each-way)\u201cTrainer Archie Watson won this last year with Bradsell for the same connections. He sent Army Ethos up to Ayr to win his maiden and he made no mistake. It was the manner of the victory that impressed and he has to be a player in this contest. Aidan O\u2019Brien\u2019s River Tiber is the likely market leader and as long as there is cut in the ground, he will take some pegging back. His price reflects that.\u201d15:40 \u2013 Coolangatta - 7/2\u201cThe Australian sprinters are normally a fair way ahead of the home team, so I\u2019ll side with Coolangatta. She has the services of Royal Ascot regular James McDonald, which is a plus. Highfield Princess is an unbelievable story and it would be remarkable were she to win but the Aussie raider can repel her.\u201d16:20 \u2013 Paddington - 9/4\u201cThey didn\u2019t seem to go much of a gallop in the early part of the Irish 2,000 Guineas but Paddington quickened up very smartly to put the race to bed at the business end. The St James\u2019 Palace Stales is run on the round course and the best horse doesn\u2019t always win. However, Paddington has plenty of speed which will stand him in good stead and help the Ballydoyle runner edge it over Chaldean.\u201d17:00 \u2013 Calling the Wind - 9/1\u201cRichard Hughes was no stranger to the winner\u2019s enclosure as a jockey at Royal Ascot and it would mean the world to him to have a winner as a trainer.

He is the retained rider for Qatar Racing and Buckaroo got beaten in a Derby Trial last year at Leopardstown.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeIn 2023, as in 2022, a marathon season ended for England\u2019s players in June, north of their Wembley home, against eastern European opposition. And there, it is fair to say, the similarities ended. A year ago came the historic low, the 4-0 loss to Hungary at Molineux that was England\u2019s heaviest home defeat since 1928, the night Gareth Southgate was told he did not know what he was doing and when both he and many another concluded his reign was nearing an undignified end.Twelve months and five days later, a 7-0 thrashing of North Macedonia at Old Trafford capped a restorative spell. Euro 2024 beckons, a broadly positive World Cup has been followed by a quartet of qualifying wins and the feel of Southgate\u2019s reign, of youthful progressiveness, has largely been restored.The torrid June of 2022 has started to look like the anomaly, not the start of the slide. The encouraging June of 2023 has more in keeping with most of Southgate\u2019s tenure. \u201cWe look back at last summer, with four matches, [playing] behind closed doors for two and we needed to look at new players,\u201d he reflected. \u201cThere were a lot of circumstances around those.\u201dA year on, England could have been forgiven for suffering from a similar tiredness. Yet if the fixtures were easier now, there was a relish and a sharpness. Southgate fielded a forward line with three of the outstanding players of the Premier League campaign, in Harry Kane, Bukayo Saka and Marcus Rashford: they scored six of the seven goals to take their combined tally to 96 goals for the season for clubs and country. They were emblematic of a side who still showed a sharpness.\u201cPost World Cup, we have hit a sweet spot,\u201d Southgate said. The most seismic result of England\u2019s season was actually the victory over Italy in Naples but, after the 6-2 demolition of Iran in the World Cup, North Macedonia can testify that teams with the ability to get excellent results can find themselves eviscerated by England.RecommendedBukayo Saka cements his place as England\u2019s next leading man with first career hat-trick\u2018Exceptional\u2019 Bukayo Saka lauded by Gareth Southgate after England hat-trick\u201cWe have a hunger to go further than we\u2019ve been and keep pushing forward, confidence from big nights we\u2019ve been involved in,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good place but we have to keep pushing. We have set a standard in the last four games where anything possible. There is a brilliant feel around the squad and that creates a strong team.\u201dFew players are better at engendering a positivity feeling than Saka with his infectious enthusiasm. \u201cHe\u2019s talented, he\u2019s humble, he\u2019s incredibly popular,\u201d said Southgate. There was a certain symbolism to Saka\u2019s hat-trick. There has seemed something of a changing of the guard over the last year. Southgate has been a loyalist to the core of the team who gave him breakthrough tournaments in 2018 and 2021 but he has also recognised talent when it has emerged.Saka scored his first career hat-trick at Old Trafford  (REUTERS)England\u2019s player of the World Cup was Jude Bellingham. Even though he missed their June fixtures, Real Madrid\u2019s newest signing may have been their outstanding individual of the season. But if not, then Saka has a compelling case.When the campaign began, perhaps neither was an automatic choice. Now each is. Bellingham shifted the equation in the World Cup, to the detriment of Mason Mount; if Southgate plays 4-3-3 \u2013 as he does now, though last summer it still felt as though he wanted the security blanket of a third centre-back \u2013 then the Bundesliga player of the year suits the role as the most attacking midfielder. In attack, if Raheem Sterling used to be the guaranteed starter on the flanks now it should be Saka; it helps that he has become a regular scorer.A third player of rare gifts may yet join them in the strongest side. Trent Alexander-Arnold had felt the conundrum Southgate could not solve; until Jurgen Klopp gave him a helping hand, anyway. The Liverpudlian\u2019s end-of-season shift into midfield for his club led to two encouraging performances for his country. A remarkable pass for Saka\u2019s terrific second goal, the kind of 50-yard ball that invokes mentions of quarterbacks, was an illustration of his passing range.RecommendedEngland vs North Macedonia LIVE: Euro 2024 qualifier result and reactionBukayo Saka cements his place as England\u2019s leading man with first career hat-trickMarcus Rashford\u2019s complicated England relationship could be at turning pointIt was nevertheless notable that Southgate singled out another Liverpool player for praise. \u201cOur senior players set a brilliant tone. [Jordan] Henderson won\u2019t get the headlines but the way he set the tone, mixing the game up was really important.\u201d Yet the thought of a midfield trio of Bellingham, Alexander-Arnold and Declan Rice is tantalising. A department where England felt short of options in the 2018 World Cup could be one where they boast enviable class.It helps, too, to have players on the rise. Saka, Rashford and Bellingham have just had the best seasons of their careers so far. Five of their England teammates did a treble for their club. If a theme of Southgate\u2019s reign has been to give the national team back a feelgood factor and a sense of optimism, it has been a feature of the last year, too. Southgate won\u2019t be defined by the summer of 2023, but nor will he be by the summer of 2022. But now he can get for the summer of 2024 with renewed hope of a defining achievement."}, {"_id": "64917c5651ac331becf3e878", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/wimbledon-anett-kontaveit-retiring-injury-b2360702.html", "primaryCategory": "Tennis", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Former world No.2 to retire at age 27 after Wimbledon due to degenerative back injury", "lead": "<p>Anett Kontaveit has not played since the French Open in May </p>", "author": "Hritika Sharma", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 08:18:09", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:15:50.465266", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-20T08:18:09+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/20/09/GettyImages-1464226212.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free sport newsletter for all the latest news on everything from cycling to boxingSign up to our free sport email for all the latest news\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

But I\u2019ve spoken to people and the main thing was to stay patient, goals will come.\u201cMy job is to score goals and that\u2019s probably the toughest part about it, not scoring.

He has shown great faith in me.\u201cI haven\u2019t scored in a lot of games. For him to keep playing me and bringing me on gives me great confidence and belief.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThere was a period when it seemed that Bukayo Saka\u2019s golden season would end with him a Premier League champion, perhaps even anointed as Footballer of the Year. And if neither quite came to pass, he still conjured a fitting finish to a wonderful campaign.The first hat-trick of his career came in just 13 minutes and in his country\u2019s colours. As England\u2019s No. 7 made off with the match ball, they scored seven. North Macedonia have claimed the scalps of Italy and Germany in their recent past but they were demolished. If this could have been a group laced with pitfalls for England, with the reigning European champions, Euro 2020 quarter-finalists and a side who almost qualified for the World Cup, they have the maximum 12 points and are turning their journey to Germany next summer into a procession.If Saka\u2019s last European Championships ended with the trauma of a penalty miss in the final shootout, he has rendered it highly likely England will go to next summer\u2019s. If he started this season outside Gareth Southgate\u2019s strongest side, he ends it very much in it. A treble took his tally to six goals in his last nine caps; for country as well as club, Saka has proved more prolific than most envisaged.And yet it is never just about the numbers with Saka. A wonderfully endearing footballer scored the goal of the night against North Macedonia \u2013 and England had six others to pick from \u2013 with a spectacular half-volley from 20 yards, sent crashing in after a similarly brilliant pass from Trent Alexander-Arnold, a 50-yard ball from Southgate\u2019s new midfielder.RecommendedBukayo Saka cements his place as England\u2019s next leading man with first career hat-trickOn an evening when Harry Kane extended his national record to 58 goals and Marcus Rashford, a lifelong Manchester United fan, struck for his country on his home ground, Saka nevertheless upstaged both. He became the youngest player to score a hat-trick for England since Theo Walcott against Croatia, and if an earlier Arsenal winger is an illustration that potential does not always lead to greatness, for now England can enjoy his promise.His goals were very different, illustrating his range. First came a rising shot, rifled in with his less favoured right foot, following a low cross from Kyle Walker. Then, after his superb second, came the sort of strike Raheem Sterling used to get; Harry Kane dropped deep to act as playmaker, feeding a pass into the path of an onrushing winger. Saka made the dart behind the Macedonia defence and slotted in his shot.Bukayo Saka completes a first career hat-trick with a composed finish at Old Trafford  (AFP via Getty)It was England\u2019s fifth goal of the night and a sign they had turned what could have been an awkward fixture into a rout. Southgate had cited the fact England had never beaten North Macedonia at home before; in a soporific start in the Old Trafford sunshine, perhaps the visitors imagined that sequence could continue. But each of Southgate\u2019s front three found the net; perhaps they will be his first-choice forward line next summer, too.Certainly, Rashford advanced his case. He had missed a fine chance a minute before he scored, with Harry Maguire the unlikely provider, but then slotted in from Jordan Henderson\u2019s low cross. Meanwhile, it was eminently predictable that Kane struck. A brace took his tally to 40 goals in the season for club and country, and he bookended the scoring.Harry Kane added two more goals to his impressive England tally  (The FA via Getty)The first was a goal made in Manchester and scored by a man United\u2019s left-back is trying to persuade to join him at Old Trafford. Rashford was England\u2019s brightest player in the first half-hour and made the initial incursion, drawing in two defenders and feeding the underlapping Luke Shaw. His cutback was tucked in by Kane; it may be a goal Shaw envisages United scoring next season, though Kane is unlikely to ply his trade at Old Trafford then. His second stemmed from a foul on a Manchester City player, with John Stones wrestled to the ground by Egzon Bejtulia and Kane converting the penalty.Before then, substitute Kalvin Phillips tapped in his first international goal after Jack Grealish\u2019s cross was not cleared. For him, it has been a strange season, with a treble but a bit-part role at City and a threat to his place in the international pecking order from Alexander-Arnold. RecommendedMarcus Rashford\u2019s complicated England relationship could be at turning pointMidfield role my best shot of becoming England regular \u2013 Trent Alexander-ArnoldTrent Alexander-Arnold experiment means England may have found their \u2018quarterback\u2019For Kane, it felt like a typical occasion: he has scored in each of his last six games for England, even if one of those was more notable for the skied penalty against France in Qatar. For Saka, though, it was another breakthrough night. England have a phalanx of gifted wingers but, in the last dozen years, only Kane and Sterling had scored hat-tricks for them. Such nights do not come around often but, given the speed of Saka\u2019s rise, a first may not be a last for him."}, {"_id": "64917c5751ac331becf3e87c", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/queens-tv-channel-time-andy-murray-b2360065.html", "primaryCategory": "Tennis", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Is Queen\u2019s on TV?

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeToothless Northern Ireland were stunned as Kazakhstan substitute Abat Aimbetov struck at the death to snatch a 1-0 Euro 2024 qualifying victory at Windsor Park.As Northern Ireland had been piling forward in search of a late winner themselves, Aimbetov broke from his own half, riding Craig Cathcart\u2019s challenge and capitalising when a sliding Paddy McNair got in the way of Ciaron Brown, slotting the ball past Bailey Peacock-Farrell to stun the home crowd.Michael O\u2019Neill had said he was not thinking about qualifying for next summer\u2019s finals in the wake of Friday\u2019s 1-0 defeat in Denmark, and this result is another huge blow as they have only three points, earned against minnows San Marino, from their opening four games.When Northern Ireland left Copenhagen after Friday\u2019s 1-0 defeat there was optimism about the way they had battled, only denied a late equaliser by a marginal offside, but the mood was very different here as the final whistle was greeted with boos.Northern Ireland\u2019s inability to overcome a side 50 places below them in the rankings at home showed the limitations of this young squad, robbed of experience by injuries to senior players.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveAnother blank means Northern Ireland have only scored two in their last nine home matches in qualifying campaigns, with the lack of quality in the final third thwarting their ambitions.O\u2019Neill had spoken about the difficulty of adjusting his side\u2019s mindset from the predominantly defensive outlook they had in Copenhagen on Friday to playing on the front foot at home, but even though they kept Kazakhstan pegged back for long patches, there were only occasional threats.Cathcart returned from the back injury that kept him out on Friday but there was no Conor Bradley, sidelined after hyperextending his knee in Copenhagen, and his attacking threat was missed.Trai Hume, switched to right back in place of Bradley, sent an early shot over from the edge of the box before Dion Charles, back in ahead of Shayne Lavery, failed to keep a shot down after being played in by Shea Charles.But arguably the best chance of the half belonged to Kazakhstan as Maxim Samorodov raced away from McNair and turned inside Hume, only to drag his shot wide of the post from eight yards with just Peacock-Farrell to beat.Northern Ireland responded well. Isaac Price\u2019s shot from the edge of the box deflected off Abzal Beysebekov, looping away from the goalkeeper and heading just wide of the post.From the resulting corner, McNair headed back into the danger zone but Cathcart could not keep it down from only four yards out.The tempo soon dipped, Northern Ireland seemingly struggling for new ideas, and they did not threaten again until the 44th minute. Dion Charles stood the ball up for George Saville but the Millwall midfielder, still without an international goal after 46 caps, headed over from close range.The half ended with Baktiyor Zainutdinov flashing a shot wide while surrounded by Northern Ireland defenders.Northern Ireland\u2019s frustrations continued after the break. Saville flashed the ball across the face of goal early in the half \u2013 the cross only needed a touch but there was nobody there to add it.Price had the chance to release Dion Charles as Northern Ireland tried to break from a Kazakhstan corner, but he played the ball behind the Bolton forward when there was half a pitch to run in to.RecommendedFootball rumours: Marcus Rashford set to sign long-term Man United dealDay five of first Ashes Test: Thrilling finale in store at EdgbastonStephen Kenny says \u2018nothing is impossible\u2019 ahead of France and Netherlands testsThe Windsor Park atmosphere was flat, the tiny pocket of Kazakhstan fans audible over the murmurs coming from the Kop.Conor McMenamin replaced Jonny Evans, soon seen with an ice pack on his shoulder, and more attacking reinforcements came in the shape of Lavery and Dale Taylor, but besides an angled McMenamin shot tipped over by Igor Shatskiy, there was little to excite the crowd before Aimbetov\u2019s killer late blow."}, {"_id": "64917c5851ac331becf3e87f", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/thibaut-courtois-belgium-tedesco-captain-lukaku-b2360637.html", "primaryCategory": "Football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Thibaut Courtois hits back over claim that left Belgium boss \u2018shocked\u2019", "lead": "<p>Domenico Tedesco insisted Courtois had refused to travel for a match due to being \u2018offended\u2019 at being overlooked for the captaincy against Austria</p>", "author": "Pa Sport Staff", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 06:30:33", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:15:52.515127", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-20T06:30:33+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/20/07/GettyImages-1476300760.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Miguel Delaney\u2019s Reading the Game newsletter sent straight to your inbox for freeSign up to Miguel\u2019s Delaney\u2019s free weekly newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Key to that result was a nail-biting two-run win here in Birmingham, where Steve Harmison had Michael Kasprowicz caught behind just as Australia looked to have won it. The target that day was 282, just one more than today\u2019s magic number. The tourists were much worse off on that occasion, ending on 175 for eight overnight, but could it possibly go as close again?RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveWhat they said\n\nThe 2005 series inspired our group to want to play and win Ashes series.

He surprised everyone in the stadium by attempting to reverse scoop Pat Cummins over slip from the first ball of the day. The shot did not come off on that occasion but in the next over, he hit Scott Boland for six and four in successive deliveries with the same stroke. Root\u2019s innings of 46 in 55 balls featured five boundaries and ended in unexpected fashion\u2026Stats cornerIn England\u2019s second innings, Root came charging down the pitch to Nathan Lyon and was out stumped for the first time in a career spanning 131 games and 240 innings.

He finished the series with 18 wickets in three Tests and arrived at Edgbaston with an impeccable record. His effectiveness has been built around his meanness \u2013 with an economy rate of 2.31 prior to this week. England appear to have made a point of knocking him off stride, scoring at 5.61 against him over the course of the Test. It was telling that Australian wicket-keeper Alex Carey began to stand up to the stumps to Boland to prevent the English batters from charging down the pitch.Top five fourth-innings chases at Edgbaston387/3 - England beat India, 2022283/5 - South Africa beat England, 2008211/3 - England beat New Zealand, 1999157/3 - West Indies beat England, 1991124/2 - England beat Australia, 2015RecommendedStephen Kenny says \u2018nothing is impossible\u2019 ahead of France and Netherlands tests\u2018Exceptional\u2019 Bukayo Saka lauded by Gareth Southgate after England rompRob Page insists Wales can still qualify despite Turkey defeatMo blowThe final day of a Test frequently means bringing a spinner into play but concerns abound about Moeen Ali\u2019s index finger \u2013 the digit he uses to spin the ball which is blistered because of his increased workload in his first red-ball appearance since September 2021.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeRepublic of Ireland boss Stephen Kenny has insisted \u201cnothing is impossible\u201d as he plots Euro 2024 qualifying victories over European superpowers France and the Netherlands in September.Kenny\u2019s men belatedly opened their Group B account with a 3-0 victory over Gibraltar at the Aviva Stadium on Monday evening to ease at least a little of the disappointment of Friday night\u2019s 2-1 defeat in Greece.Ireland\u2019s hopes of securing one of the top two spots look forlorn unless they can pull off a series of shock results, but that is exactly what Kenny intends to do.Asked what his message was to the players, he replied: \u201cIt\u2019s a seven-day window just, it\u2019s a short window. It\u2019s France on a Thursday night in Paris and Holland on a Sunday night here in the Aviva Stadium, so it\u2019s a really, really exciting window.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow live\u201cThey\u2019re two really tough games, there\u2019s no doubt about it, but very exciting games. We\u2019ve just got to make sure we\u2019re well prepared for them. They\u2019re epic games.\u201cAt the same time, nothing is impossible, that\u2019s how we feel about it.\u201cObviously we pushed France very close [at home]. I know this is different in Paris, but it will be an interesting game for us and very exciting, the two games.\u201dFor 45 minutes, Ireland hammered away at the visitors, but without the craft, pace or guile to break them down, although it took a fine reaction save from goalkeeper Dayle Coleing to deny Jamie McGrath seconds before the break.The game changed, however, with Celtic winger Mikey Johnston\u2019s half-time introduction and he had already sparked terror in the Gibraltar defence on three occasions when he ran on to Will Smallbone\u2019s half-blocked free-kick and stabbed into the empty net for his first senior international goal.Evan Ferguson increased the lead within seven minutes and substitute Adam Idah finally opened his Ireland account in stoppage time to secure the first points of the campaign at the third attempt.Asked if Johnston, whose four caps to date have come from the bench, could make a similar impact over 90 minutes, Kenny said: \u201cHe\u2019s been terrific. Definitely he can start matches. I had it in my head that probably he was going to start, but it didn\u2019t happen for him in Greece.\u201cWe\u2019re still obviously a bit disappointed about Greece, we\u2019re not getting away from that, we were disappointed with that. It wasn\u2019t his night, certainly, when he came on, but he has terrific talent, I really appreciate his talent.\u201cHe\u2019s a Celtic player and it will be interesting if he goes back there or not, we\u2019ll see how his career goes over the summer.\u201dVictory over the team ranked 201st in the world \u2013 Gibraltar have now lost 3-0 to all four of the other teams in the group \u2013 is unlikely to silence Kenny\u2019s critics, but it at least gets them off the mark.Kenny said: \u201cWe obviously made life difficult for ourselves after Friday night. But Greece are a good team. They have to play Holland twice, we have to play Holland twice, and France in France.\n\nWe still have every chance and we just have to back ourselves in those windows.Republic of Ireland manager Stephen KennyRecommended\u2018Exceptional\u2019 Bukayo Saka lauded by Gareth Southgate after England rompRob Page insists Wales can still qualify despite Turkey defeatMichael O\u2019Neill feels Northern Ireland did not deserve to lose to Kazakhstan\u201cIn my opinion, France will win the group, so we just have to have good September and October windows.\u201cThe return game with Greece will be a different game, and obviously tough games against Holland and France.

Completely changes the game.\u201cUp until the 70th minute I thought we defended our box really well, only one cross into our own box and it cost us, that first goal.\u201cHe (Morrell) is not intentionally doing it. He\u2019s got his eye on the ball, but when you put your foot that high, you run the risk of getting a red card.\u201cHe knows it.

In the second half I think the game looked like it was drifting a bit but I think the substitutes gave us a lift.\u201cWe lost Jonny (Evans, who came off with a shoulder injury) at that point, we had to change the shape and we were a little bit patched up in the back four, and then we lose a goal right at the end, a real sucker-punch.\u201cI think Kazakhstan were more than happy to settle for a point and they came away with all three and it\u2019s a very disappointing result.\u201cFor us to lose the game in that way is extremely disappointing. We\u2019ve lost three games 1-0, we\u2019ve conceded goals that if you\u2019re going to progress at this level you can\u2019t concede and we\u2019re learning the hard way at the moment that the mistakes we\u2019re making are costing us.\u201dO\u2019Neill has spent much of this international window and the one in March preaching caution given Northern Ireland\u2019s injury predicament, talking about how much was being asked of young players, many of whom lack first-team experience at club level, let alone international.Conor Bradley was missing through injury but there were still two teenagers in the starting line-up in Shea Charles and Isaac Price, with Dale Taylor among those coming off the bench.Patience could be a key word, but after a second half in which the atmosphere at Windsor fell flat, some fans booed as the players walked off.\u201cFans are entitled to boo,\u201d O\u2019Neill said. \u201cWe lost the game 1-0.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThere was a period when it seemed that Bukayo Saka\u2019s golden season would end with him a Premier League champion, perhaps even anointed as Footballer of the Year. And if neither quite came to pass, he still conjured a fitting finish to a wonderful campaign.The first hat-trick of his career came in just 13 minutes and in his country\u2019s colours. As England\u2019s No. 7 made off with the match ball, they scored seven. North Macedonia have claimed the scalps of Italy and Germany in their recent past but they were demolished. If this could have been a group laced with pitfalls for England, with the reigning European champions, Euro 2020 quarter-finalists and a side who almost qualified for the World Cup, they have the maximum 12 points and are turning their journey to Germany next summer into a procession.If Saka\u2019s last European Championships ended with the trauma of a penalty miss in the final shootout, he has rendered it highly likely England will go to next summer\u2019s. If he started this season outside Gareth Southgate\u2019s strongest side, he ends it very much in it. A treble took his tally to six goals in his last nine caps; for country as well as club, Saka has proved more prolific than most envisaged.And yet it is never just about the numbers with Saka. A wonderfully endearing footballer scored the goal of the night against North Macedonia \u2013 and England had six others to pick from \u2013 with a spectacular half-volley from 20 yards, sent crashing in after a similarly brilliant pass from Trent Alexander-Arnold, a 50-yard ball from Southgate\u2019s new midfielder.RecommendedBukayo Saka cements his place as England\u2019s next leading man with first career hat-trickOn an evening when Harry Kane extended his national record to 58 goals and Marcus Rashford, a lifelong Manchester United fan, struck for his country on his home ground, Saka nevertheless upstaged both. He became the youngest player to score a hat-trick for England since Theo Walcott against Croatia, and if an earlier Arsenal winger is an illustration that potential does not always lead to greatness, for now England can enjoy his promise.His goals were very different, illustrating his range. First came a rising shot, rifled in with his less favoured right foot, following a low cross from Kyle Walker. Then, after his superb second, came the sort of strike Raheem Sterling used to get; Harry Kane dropped deep to act as playmaker, feeding a pass into the path of an onrushing winger. Saka made the dart behind the Macedonia defence and slotted in his shot.Bukayo Saka completes a first career hat-trick with a composed finish at Old Trafford  (AFP via Getty)It was England\u2019s fifth goal of the night and a sign they had turned what could have been an awkward fixture into a rout. Southgate had cited the fact England had never beaten North Macedonia at home before; in a soporific start in the Old Trafford sunshine, perhaps the visitors imagined that sequence could continue. But each of Southgate\u2019s front three found the net; perhaps they will be his first-choice forward line next summer, too.Certainly, Rashford advanced his case. He had missed a fine chance a minute before he scored, with Harry Maguire the unlikely provider, but then slotted in from Jordan Henderson\u2019s low cross. Meanwhile, it was eminently predictable that Kane struck. A brace took his tally to 40 goals in the season for club and country, and he bookended the scoring.Harry Kane added two more goals to his impressive England tally  (The FA via Getty)The first was a goal made in Manchester and scored by a man United\u2019s left-back is trying to persuade to join him at Old Trafford. Rashford was England\u2019s brightest player in the first half-hour and made the initial incursion, drawing in two defenders and feeding the underlapping Luke Shaw. His cutback was tucked in by Kane; it may be a goal Shaw envisages United scoring next season, though Kane is unlikely to ply his trade at Old Trafford then. His second stemmed from a foul on a Manchester City player, with John Stones wrestled to the ground by Egzon Bejtulia and Kane converting the penalty.Before then, substitute Kalvin Phillips tapped in his first international goal after Jack Grealish\u2019s cross was not cleared. For him, it has been a strange season, with a treble but a bit-part role at City and a threat to his place in the international pecking order from Alexander-Arnold. RecommendedMarcus Rashford\u2019s complicated England relationship could be at turning pointMidfield role my best shot of becoming England regular \u2013 Trent Alexander-ArnoldTrent Alexander-Arnold experiment means England may have found their \u2018quarterback\u2019For Kane, it felt like a typical occasion: he has scored in each of his last six games for England, even if one of those was more notable for the skied penalty against France in Qatar. For Saka, though, it was another breakthrough night. England have a phalanx of gifted wingers but, in the last dozen years, only Kane and Sterling had scored hat-tricks for them. Such nights do not come around often but, given the speed of Saka\u2019s rise, a first may not be a last for him."}, {"_id": "64917c5b51ac331becf3e88b", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/turkey-wales-nottingham-forest-ben-davies-danny-ward-b2360479.html", "primaryCategory": "Football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Wales\u2019 Euro 2024 qualification hopes further dented by defeat in Turkey", "lead": "The Dragons are fourth in Group D and have won only once in their last 12 games.", "author": "Phil Blanche", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 20:57:58", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:15:55.728019", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-19T20:57:58+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/19/22/19-c278b5b55c8b4c3fb45f7dd915e6a38d.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Miguel Delaney\u2019s Reading the Game newsletter sent straight to your inbox for freeSign up to Miguel\u2019s Delaney\u2019s free weekly newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

follow liveThere was more bad news before kick-off as Armenia\u2019s stoppage-time penalty secured a 2-1 win over Latvia and took them above Wales, who dropped to fourth in Group D.After a poor World Cup when Wales finished bottom of their group and scored a solitary penalty, some fans voiced their frustration as Page attempted to explain the reasons behind a terrible run of one win in 11 games.Page said Wales were a team in transition after the departures of Gareth Bale, Joe Allen and others, and two more senior players were also absent at a noisy Samsun 19 Mayis Stadium.Vice-captain Ben Davies had stayed at home for the birth of his first child and Kieffer Moore was suspended after being sent off against Armenia.Neco Williams and Morrell filled the gap as Page began by using Brennan Johnson as a lone striker.Turkey were buoyed by Friday\u2019s last-gasp 3-2 win in Latvia that had taken them top and were seeking to avenge their defeat to Wales at the Euro 2020 finals in Baku.Johnson showed his pace early on to fire into the side-netting, but there was a worrying moment for Wales as the Nottingham Forest forward gingerly got back on his feet.Turkey thought they had taken the lead after nine minutes when Chris Mepham turned Zeki Celik\u2019s cross into his own net.But after a VAR glitch where the usual on-screen lines to determine offside could not be used, referee Fabio Maresca went to the pitchside monitor himself to judge whether the goal should stand.Much to Wales\u2019 relief, the Italian official ruled that Celik was in an offside position when he received the ball and the goal was disallowed.Kerem Akturkoglu sent the first shot in anger over the crossbar and Harry Wilson\u2019s free-kick was deflected for a corner.But the contest tilted Turkey\u2019s way near half-time as Morrell left Kadioglu in a heap with a tender thigh \u2013 a challenge that Maresca correctly ruled as serious foul play.Danny Ward held Orkun Koku\u2019s stinging effort but Turkey goalkeeper Mert Gunok was stretched even further just after the restart by Wilson\u2019s 25-yard free-kick, with Dan James unable to make the most of the rebound.The match was being played almost entirely in the Wales half and Turkey were presented with a golden opportunity to break the deadlock after 64 minutes when skipper Aaron Ramsey handled Kadioglu\u2019s cross.Calhanoglu smashed his penalty to Ward\u2019s right but the goalkeeper guessed correctly and pushed the ball away.Turkey did have the ball in the Wales net moments later, only for Umut\u2019s effort to be ruled out for handball.RecommendedFootball rumours: Marcus Rashford set to sign long-term Man United dealDay five of first Ashes Test: Thrilling finale in store at EdgbastonStephen Kenny says \u2018nothing is impossible\u2019 ahead of France and Netherlands testsBut Nayir was not to be denied a second time after 72 minutes, the substitute\u2019s header crossing the line despite the best efforts of Ward to keep it out.Guler ended the contest 10 minutes from time with a spectacular effort, leaving Wales with much to do in the second half of the campaign to book an automatic qualifying place for next summer\u2019s finals in Germany and not rely on the play-offs route."}, {"_id": "64917c5b51ac331becf3e88c", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/stephen-kenny-ireland-football-gibraltar-republic-of-ireland-celtic-b2360480.html", "primaryCategory": "Football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Mikey Johnston helps Republic of Ireland to much-needed win over Gibraltar", "lead": "The Celtic winger scored within seven minutes of his introduction as a half-time substitute.", "author": "Damian Spellman", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 20:56:21", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:15:55.965553", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-19T20:56:21+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/19/22/b5c2c709204024058486079bf7861095Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg3Mjk0MTk2-2.72679142.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Miguel Delaney\u2019s Reading the Game newsletter sent straight to your inbox for freeSign up to Miguel\u2019s Delaney\u2019s free weekly newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeSubstitute Mikey Johnston belatedly ignited the Republic of Ireland\u2019s Euro 2024 qualifying campaign to spare manager Stephen Kenny further punishment at the hands of Gibraltar.The Celtic winger, who spent last season on loan with Portuguese side Vitoria Guimaraes, scored his first senior international goal within seven minutes of his half-time introduction with his team-mates having left the pitch to a less than rapturous reception after being kept at bay by the side ranked 201st in the world.Evan Ferguson helped himself to his second Ireland goal seven minutes later and substitute Adam Idah his first in stoppage time to cement at 3-0 victory on a night when anything other than a comfortable victory would have heaped further pressure on Kenny, who had found himself in the firing line once again in the wake of Friday night\u2019s 2-1 Group B defeat in Greece.A fifth win in 24 competitive matches, particularly given the nature of the opposition, is unlikely to silence his critics and qualification still looks distinctly unlikely unless they can beat either France or the Netherlands \u2013 or perhaps both \u2013 in September.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveHowever, Johnston\u2019s second-half cameo finally injected the pace and devilment his side had lacked before the break to bring a little light relief.Kenny made five changes to the side which turned in such a laboured display in defeat in Greece, one of them enforced by Matt Doherty\u2019s red card in Athens with James McClean, winning his 100th cap, Dara O\u2019Shea, Jamie McGrath, Jason Knight and Michael Obafemi replacing the former Atletico Madrid full-back, Darragh Lenihan, Callum O\u2019Dowda, Jayson Molumby and Idah.His side might have been ahead within seconds of kick-off when Knight, starting at right wing-back, crossed for McGrath to shoot first time and keeper Dayle Coleing needed two attempts to gather the ball, and defender Kian Ronan sliced another teasing Knight delivery anxiously over his own crossbar with three minutes gone.As expected, the visitors sat deep and invited Ireland to break them down with defenders Nathan Collins and O\u2019Shea repeatedly finding themselves with time and space, but not the craft to slide the ball through the massed ranks of white shirts.O\u2019Shea curled a 17th-minute shot straight into Coleing\u2019s midriff and Obafemi should have scored two minutes later, completely missing his kick as he attempted to convert Knight\u2019s near-post cross.As Kenny\u2019s men warmed to their task, Ferguson thumped a drive at Coleing from the edge of the box and then glanced a 30th-minute header across goal from McClean\u2019s cross with the keeper in no man\u2019s land.McClean headed wide from yet another Knight cross after the Derby midfielder had surged past defender Jayce Olivero five minutes later, and Josh Cullen whipped an attempt into Coleing\u2019s waiting arms as half-time approached.It took a fine save from the Gibraltar keeper to keep out McGrath\u2019s rasping 44th-minute strike after Obafemi and Ferguson had used their strength to grind out an opportunity for him, but Ireland largely lacked both penetration and tempo and the half-time whistle was greeted by a smattering of boos.Kenny made a significant change at the break when he withdrew central defender Collins and replaced him with Johnston and switched to a 4-3-3 formation, and it took the newcomer little time to make an impact.RecommendedNorthern Ireland stunned as Kazakhstan substitute Abat Aimbetov nets late winnerTen-man Wales\u2019 Euro 2024 qualification hopes further dented by defeat in TurkeyI\u2019ve been there \u2013 Nathan Lyon feels for Moeen Ali over finger problemIt was he who made the breakthrough with 52 minutes gone when, after Will Smallbone\u2019s free-kick, awarded for handball against Bernardo Lopes, had squirmed through the defensive wall, he tapped gleefully into the empty net to ease the tension among a crowd of 42,156 at the Aviva Stadium.The mood took a further turn for the better seven minutes later when Ferguson met McClean\u2019s cross with a firm downward header to effectively wrap up the points, and the centurion was provider once again at the death, setting up Idah to finally open his account with a simple header."}, {"_id": "64917c5c51ac331becf3e88d", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/cricket/nathan-lyon-moeen-ali-england-edgbaston-jonny-bairstow-b2360468.html", "primaryCategory": "Cricket", "subCategories": "test", "title": "I\u2019ve been there \u2013 Nathan Lyon feels for Moeen Ali over finger problem", "lead": "Moeen is struggling with a badly blistered finger.", "author": "Shubi Arun", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 20:22:30", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:15:56.190919", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-19T20:22:30+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/19/21/787d205a0022d25e1c9a0a9e889decc7Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg3MjkyMTg1-2.72676556.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free sport newsletter for all the latest news on everything from cycling to boxingSign up to our free sport email for all the latest news\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeA delighted Venus Williams fought for more than three hours to defeat Camila Giorgi at the Rothesay Classic in Birmingham and post her best victory for nearly four years.Two days after her 43rd birthday and with a right knee problem restricting her\u00a0 movement, the former world number one showed that her competitive spirit has not diminished as she ground out a 7-6 (5) 4-6 7-6 (6) win.Williams plays sparingly these days, returning at a grass-court event in the Netherlands last week for her first tournament since January, and this was only her second victory since Wimbledon 2021, and her first over a top-50 opponent since 2019.Giorgi is a former Wimbledon quarter-finalist and a player very much at home on grass but Williams still possesses a fearsome strike, while her serve touched 120mph.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveA heavy fall in the first set did not help her knee and she noticeably limped but she kept her nose in front, putting aside the disappointment of failing to serve out the match at 5-3 in the decider to take her second match point in the tie-break.Williams held her arms aloft and repeatedly pumped her fist as the crowd, who had been drowned out at times by the support from the Ashes Test down the road, cheered.\u201cThis one is especially sweet because I have been away from the tour for so long,\u201d she said. \u201cThe last couple of years I\u2019ve had little to no matches and long stretches between matches and that\u2019s very challenging.\u201cI almost feel like when I\u2019m on the court I\u2019m reminded of things I used to do that worked really well, so there\u2019s a lot of memories and deja vu \u2013 I\u2019ve never had that experience before. I felt like I played well the whole match and that felt great.\u201cTennis is awesome. There\u2019s so many people that would love to do what I\u2019m doing right now so I don\u2019t take it for granted. I faced some huge challenges in the match. I thought I didn\u2019t do much wrong and I found myself still not winning. I think that brought the emotion out.\u201dThere were different emotions for another former top-10 player returning to grass, with Elina Svitolina beaten 6-2 6-0 by Czech 18-year-old Linda Fruhvirtova in less than an hour.Svitolina made a brilliant comeback on clay following the birth of daughter Skai last October, reaching the quarter-finals of the French Open, but was unable to find her feet on the grass.Wearing the colours of her native Ukraine, the 28-year-old quickly lost the first four games and made far too many errors against a much steadier opponent.\u201cLinda played really well today, from the start until the end,\u201d said Svitolina. \u201cI don\u2019t think she did anything wrong at any point.\u201cI was struggling at the beginning and obviously on the grass you have no time to adjust. For me, it didn\u2019t happen today but I\u2019ll go on the practice court and try to do better next time.\u201dSvitolina chose not to use her protected ranking from before her pregnancy to enter Wimbledon so must wait to find out whether she will receive a wild card.RecommendedStuart Broad hoping to \u2018inspire a nation\u2019 like England\u2019s 2005 Ashes heroesDavid De Gea relaxes on holiday \u2013 Monday\u2019s sporting socialSheffield Wednesday boss Darren Moore leaves club three weeks after play-off winThird seed Magda Linette had to battle her way into round two, coming from a set down to defeat Italy\u2019s Jasmine Paolini 3-6 7-5 6-4.Nottingham champion Katie Boulter begins her campaign on Tuesday against China\u2019s Lin Zhu while Jodie Burrage and Harriet Dart play each other."}, {"_id": "64917c5c51ac331becf3e88f", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/cricket/australia-england-stuart-broad-steve-smith-david-warner-b2360462.html", "primaryCategory": "Cricket", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Stuart Broad hoping to \u2018inspire a nation\u2019 like England\u2019s 2005 Ashes heroes", "lead": "England go into the final day of the first Test against Australia at Edgbaston needing seven wickets while the tourists require 174 more runs to win.", "author": "David Charlesworth", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 20:11:32", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:15:56.655271", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-19T20:11:32+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/19/21/f57d57ae3c5834bff42ec5c88ff23eecY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg3MjkwNjA2-2.72677360.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free sport newsletter for all the latest news on everything from cycling to boxingSign up to our free sport email for all the latest news\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeStuart Broad senses England can inspire a nation in the Ashes akin to the class of 2005 but he is desperate to avoid a repeat of the grandstand Edgbaston finale from 18 years ago.A mouthwatering final day awaits in this LV= Insurance series curtain-raiser as England require seven more wickets to draw first blood against Australia, who closed on 107 for three in pursuit of 281.The target is one run fewer than what Australia were set in one of the greatest Tests of all-time at this venue, when Ricky Ponting\u2019s tourists fell two runs short in a nerve-shredding denouement.While Broad believes England can rouse the country across this summer\u2019s five much-anticipated Tests, he is keeping everything crossed they can draw first blood long before any crescendo is reached.\u201cYou can tell this group is massively inspired and motivated by that series,\u201d Broad said. \u201cIt\u2019s great the series are being related because 2005 inspired our group to want to play and win Ashes series.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow live\u201cHonestly as a group we\u2019ve got so much energy around, we can feel the energy of the country. Each player has had a lot more messages and a lot more engagement from friends of the Ashes coming around.\u201cTo have this series being talked about in the same sort of sentences as \u201905 gives us a huge boost. If the series can be half as good as that one I think we\u2019ll be inspiring the nation.\u201cBut I\u2019m not sure we want (this Test) going to two runs (on Tuesday). Hopefully, it doesn\u2019t get as close as that and we get a few wickets early because that won\u2019t do much for the heart, will it?\u201dBroad was 19 and in his first season with Leicestershire when England levelled the Ashes in Birmingham in 2005 and the fast bowler admitted he finds watching from the sidelines more anxious than playing.\u201cI remember watching it almost like hiding behind the sofa,\u201d he added. \u201cI find it really difficult to watch and now I\u2019ve played a lot of tight games myself, it\u2019s way harder watching than playing.\u201cIt\u2019s weird. You feel the nerves and the anxiety way more when you can\u2019t control anything about it. When you\u2019re involved in the game you\u2019re just focused on your style and your process.\u201dAfter England were all out for 273, David Warner and Usman Khawaja, a first-innings centurion, helped Australia off to an ideal start with a half-century opening partnership on a lifeless surface.While Warner escaped the clutches of his nemesis Broad this time, he was out for 36 after nicking off to Ollie Robinson. But there was no keeping Broad out of the game as he kissed the outside edges of Marnus Labuschagne and Steve Smith, ranked respectively at one and two in the Test batting rankings.\u201cIt\u2019s all set up to be a fantastic day,\u201d Broad said. \u201cWe\u2019re obviously delighted to have Warner, Marnus and Smith back in the pavilion because they\u2019re world class players.\u201cBut we know the Aussies have got a lot of danger to come so we\u2019ve got to be right on the money.\u201cI don\u2019t think any batter is going to come in and say it\u2019s a fantastic pitch to bat on. It\u2019s turgid and hard to time the ball on. And no bowler\u2019s going to say it\u2019s not carrying or moving particularly.\u201cIt\u2019s a hard working pitch, you\u2019ve got to create pressure and hit the pitch as hard as you can.\u201dThere is rain forecast for Tuesday which could add another layer of drama to proceedings while Moeen Ali seemed inhibited by the blister on his spinning finger on Monday \u2013 although he bowled seven overs.\u201cI think Mo\u2019s fine,\u201d Broad added. \u201cHe\u2019s got a bit of a gouge out of his finger but he\u2019s doing as much as he can to heal that and deal with the pain.\u201cHopefully, as a seamers\u2019 group we can help him out a bit by taking some early poles in the first hour.\u201dAustralia, meanwhile, will be attempting to banish the ghosts of 2005 at a sold-out Edgbaston, with off-spinner Nathan Lyon quipping there are constant reminders of what occurred.RecommendedI\u2019ve been there \u2013 Nathan Lyon feels for Moeen Ali over finger problemVenus Williams fights for over three hours to beat Camila Giorgi in BirminghamDavid De Gea relaxes on holiday \u2013 Monday\u2019s sporting social\u201cI\u2019ve obviously seen the game,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s always on Sky Sports here in England.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeStuart Broad lit the fuse on England\u2019s victory push with two huge wickets as a compelling Ashes opener built towards a thrilling conclusion at Edgbaston.Broad got England\u2019s \u2018fortress\u2019 rocking in the evening session as he had Marnus Labuschagne and Steve Smith \u2013 numbers one and two in the Test batting rankings \u2013 caught behind during an electric spell.With adrenaline coursing through his veins Broad would have loved nothing more than a crack at the man who occupies third place on that list, but Australia opted to shield Travis Head from the late pressure and sent out Scott Boland as nightwatchman.Australia ended a gripping fourth day on 107 for three chasing 281, with all results on the table heading into what is set up to be a classic finale.The tourists had made an assured start to the chase, with Usman Khawaja and David Warner putting on 61 for the first wicket before Ollie Robinson got one to clip the latter\u2019s outside edge to get his side up and running.RecommendedEngland set Australia target of 281 on day four of thrilling first Ashes TestEngland vs Australia LIVE: Ashes scorecard and first Test updatesDay four of first Ashes Test: England seek match-winning leadEngland had earlier been bowled out for 273, an erratic but entertaining innings punctuated with dashing strokeplay but haunted by a feeling of impermanence.There was not a single half-century on the card, with Joe Root and Harry Brook both reaching 46 and Ben Stokes contributing 43.Had any of the three lasted the course, the game might have slipped away from Australia entirely, but Root was stumped for the first time in his 131 Test career as he charged Nathan Lyon and Brook tried too hard to generate a boundary that was not on offer.Stokes, whose attacking principles run through the DNA of his side, played a notably responsible knock but was stopped in his tracks by his excellent opposite number Pat Cummins.Resuming on 28 for two, Root set an audacious tone, attempting his trademark reverse ramp off Cummins\u2019 first delivery of the morning and hitting fresh air. Root has all but mastered the stroke but, even by his own standards, attempting it so early \u2013 with a crucial Test match on a knife-edge \u2013 showed remarkable chutzpah.Undeterred, he went back to the well twice in the next over, launching Boland over the wicketkeeper\u2019s head for six and then flicking four more beyond the slip cordon. It was a faintly surreal, but utterly exhilarating opening salvo.Boland\u2019s reputation for giving nothing away had taken a battering in England\u2019s first innings and there was more where that came from as he shipped 31 from his first three overs before being pulled from the attack.Cummins, by contrast, was working up a head of steam at the Pavilion End and produced a gem of a yorker to see off Ollie Pope (14). He went on to claim four for 63 \u2013 an outstanding effort amid the chaos.The arrival of Brook ensured the tempo did not slow. He took just three balls to register his first four, punching Cameron Green down the ground and spraying 13 off Lyon\u2019s first over. England were going nicely but Root took a gamble too far when he ran down the pitch and allowed Alex Carey to swipe the bails.It fell to Stokes to calm things down and he reined in his natural aggression as he slowed Australia\u2019s roll with some measured accumulation. Instead, it was Brook who lost his patience as Lyon dried up the scoring options.Within sight of a first Ashes fifty he swiped at the spinner and was well caught by the diving Labuschagne at midwicket. England headed to lunch at 155 for five and neither side allowed the other to get away in the afternoon with 118 scored and five more wickets tumbling.Jonny Bairstow was trapped in front by Lyon and Stokes was cut off by the relentless Cummins after almost two hours of studied observance, a tight lbw decision going against the captain.Moeen Ali added 19, Robinson scrapped hard for 27, while England\u2019s last two wickets squeezed out a vitally important 44.Faced with a target eerily close to the 282 the Australian class of 2005 missed by just two runs in one of the rivalry\u2019s most famous clashes, the tourists stood tall. Khawaja nicked James Anderson in the opening over, but Bairstow was slow to react following three errors earlier in the match and a tough chance went begging between keeper and slip.The openers chipped away at the total as the trail began to go cold, but Robinson opened the door when he got one to straighten up off the seam and take Warner\u2019s edge for 36.RecommendedEngland earn slender lead in Ashes opener as Ollie Robinson shines with the ballDay three of first Ashes Test: England and Australia look to take controlUsman Khawaja\u2019s first ton in England \u2018a bit more emotional\u2019 after crowd tauntsEngland\u2019s spirits were lifted and Broad picked his moment to take centre stage. Having dismissed Labuschagne for a golden duck on day two, Broad produced a similar dismissal as he prodded an edge through to Bairstow.Broad was unusually calm as he stomped off with a grin on his face, but neither he nor the 25,000 in attendance could not contain their emotions when a skittish Smith followed suit with just six to his name."}, {"_id": "64917c5d51ac331becf3e891", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/cameron-norrie-ryan-peniston-queens-wimbledon-results-b2360427.html", "primaryCategory": "Tennis", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Cameron Norrie targeting deep Wimbledon run after impressive start at Queen\u2019s", "lead": "<p> Britain\u2019s Ryan Peniston also reached the second round with a surprise victory over French No.1 Ugo Humbert</p>", "author": "James Reid", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 18:48:38", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:15:57.157461", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-19T18:48:38+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/19/19/1499770338.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free sport newsletter for all the latest news on everything from cycling to boxingSign up to our free sport email for all the latest news\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

But once you get going it is a lot of fun out there.\u201dRecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveWorld number 37 Humbert is one of the players Murray needs to overtake in the rankings if he is to be seeded at Wimbledon next month, so his early exit will only help the Scot\u2019s cause.\n\nOnce you get going it is a lot of fun out thereRyan PenistonA place in the quarter-finals at Queen\u2019s might be enough to place the two-time champion back in the top 32, meaning he can avoid drawing one of the big names in the early rounds at SW19.Murray, on a 10-match winning streak on the grass, faces Australian world number 18 Alex de Minaur in the first round on Tuesday.Cameron Norrie followed Peniston on to Centre Court and got his grass-court season off to a winning start by beating Miomir Kecmanovic.The British number one was given a decent work-out by Serbian Kecmanovic, fending off one break point in the first set with some heroic defending at the net.The 27-year-old, runner-up at Queen\u2019s two years ago, was taken to a second-set tie-break and let three match points slip before converting a fourth to wrap up a 6-4 7-6 (5) victory.British tennis fans are in for an extra treat this week as Norrie and Murray will team up for the first time in the doubles competition.Murray memorably won the doubles title at Queen\u2019s with Feliciano Lopez in 2019 as he began his comeback from hip surgery.\u201cI just asked him, \u2018Do you want to play doubles at Queen\u2019s?\u2019. He said, \u2018Yeah, let\u2019s do it\u2019. It was pretty simple,\u201d said Norrie.\u201cI\u2019m just going to enjoy it and get another match on the grass and hopefully just pick his brains on a few things. Obviously he\u2019s got a lot of confidence at the moment, a good guy to play with.\u201dThere was first-round disappointment for British number two Dan Evans, who lost 6-4 7-5 to American Sebastian Korda.It was a seventh defeat in eight matches for Evans and the 33-year-old was not exactly upbeat about his chances at Wimbledon.\u201cI have to compete harder than I did today and be better mentally. But it\u2019s becoming difficult to do that with the amount of losses,\u201d he said.\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating and also a little bit embarrassing. So there\u2019s a lot of emotion in that.

That's the honest truth for youDan Evans\u201cI\u2019m not looking forward to playing any tennis at the minute. It\u2019s tough.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe UFC is home to some of the best mixed martial artists on the planet, so it is no surprise that fans often debate how the elite fighters compare to one another.Alongside its weekly-updated rankings for each weight class, the UFC has its own pound-for-pound rankings, containing 15 names \u2013 as with each list for every division.Here, The Independent has constructed its own top 10, pound-for-pound rankings for men\u2019s UFC fighters, to be updated throughout the year. While there is no exact science to putting together lists such as this, a number of factors have been considered in making the rankings, including each fighter\u2019s overall record, recent record, level of activity and calibre of opposition.Before diving into the top 10, here are a couple of honourable mentions:RecommendedUFC 2023 schedule: Every major fight happening this yearBest seat in the house: UFC\u2019s commentary team on what it\u2019s like to be cageside for the biggest fights in the world\u2018The only rules? No biting and no eye gouging\u2019: UFC\u2019s first ever champion Royce Gracie on the night MMA was bornColby Covington (17-3, welterweight)The former interim welterweight champion is one of the best 170lbers on the planet. While the American, 35, has lost both of his shots at undisputed gold, he pushed then-champion Kamaru Usman to the brink in both fights. Covington, a wrestling specialist, responded to his second defeat by Usman with a dominant points win over friend-turned-rival Jorge Masvidal in March 2022. He has not fought since.Stipe Miocic (20-4, heavyweight)The consensus heavyweight GOAT, the part-time firefighter holds the record for most successful title defences in the division \u2013 the hardest weight class at which to put together a sustained run. The American surrendered the belt to Francis Ngannou and the French-Cameroonian\u2019s freakish knockout power in March 2021, but prior to that achieved back-to-back wins against one of the greatest ever in Daniel Cormier. The veteran, 40, also holds a decision victory over Ngannou, plus wins against more UFC champions in Junior dos Santos, Fabricio Werdum and Andrei Arlovski. However, he has dropped out of our top 10 due to two years of inactivity. Miocic is expected to return in July, to challenge current heavyweight champion Jon Jones.Brandon Moreno (20-6-2, flyweight champion)Mexico\u2019s first ever UFC champion has just one loss in the last five years, though he has also competed in two competitive draws in that period \u2013 the most recent kickstarting the most entertaining run of his career. There was no winner when Moreno challenged Deiveson Figueiredo in 2020, but the \u201cAssassin Baby\u201d submitted the Brazilian in their 2021 rematch to win the gold. Figueiredo wrestled the belt back in a close trilogy bout last year, but Moreno claimed the interim title by stopping Kai Kara-France and went on to stop Figueiredo again this January. In doing so, he became a two-time undisputed champion.Top 1010. Dustin Poirier (29-7, 1 No Contest; lightweight)Former interim lightweight champion Dustin Poirier  (Getty Images)The American has only two defeats in the last six years \u2013 coming against the greatest lightweight of all time in Khabib Nurmagomedov and one of the best active lightweights right now in Charles Oliveira. The \u201cDiamond\u201d holds eight wins against six different world champions of the sport, having beaten Conor McGregor twice in 2021 before most recently submitting Michael Chandler to improve that tally.9. Robert Whittaker (24-6, middleweight)Robert Whittaker holds one of the most impressive resumes in MMA (Zuffa LLC)The Australian has tasted defeat just twice in the last eight years. Both of those losses came against the phenomenal Israel Adesanya, with Whittaker losing the middleweight belt to his rival by TKO in 2019 before dropping a debatable decision to the \u201cLast Stylebender\u201d last February. Between those bouts, the \u201cReaper\u201d earned three straight wins against elite competition, and his earlier run to the belt saw him successfully navigate a murderers\u2019 row of opponents that is almost incomprehensible. He bounced back from his second loss to Adesanya with a masterful points win against Marvin Vettori.8. Aljamain Sterling (23-3, bantamweight champion)Aljamain Sterling has recorded three title defences, all against ex-champions  (Getty Images)The Jamaican-American was mocked by some fans after winning the bantamweight title via disqualification in 2021, when Petr Yan landed an illegal knee while leading the bout. In a rematch 13 months later, Sterling silenced some doubters and irked others by winning a narrow decision. He then dominated former champion TJ Dillashaw en route to a TKO in October, as the challenger battled a dislocated shoulder, and went on to beat another ex-champion in Henry Cejudo this May, defeating the American \u2013 who had not fought in three years \u2013 via split decision. Some observers attach asterisks to each of Sterling\u2019s title defences, but each has come against a former world champion, and \u201cFunk Master\u201d has now won nine fights in a row.7. Charles Oliveira (34-9, 1 NC; lightweight)Charles Oliveira has the most finishes and submissions in UFC history  (Getty Images)The Brazilian\u2019s 2010 debut in the UFC gave way to an inconsistent record with numerous failed weight-cuts along the way, but the former featherweight then turned his career around). An 11-fight win streak over five years saw Oliveira claim and retain the lightweight title vacated by the retired Khabib, then submit Justin Gaethje in May 2022 \u2013 one day after being stripped of the belt for a narrow weight-miss. That win positioned him as No 1 contender as he looked to regain the gold. However, he was submitted by Makhachev in October as the Russian won the vacant title. Oliveira bounced back in June 2023, though, with a TKO win over Beneil Dariush in the first round. That result extended Oliveira\u2019s records for most finishes (19) and most submissions (16) in UFC history.6. Kamaru Usman (20-3, welterweight)Kamaru Usman was a dominant welterweight champion from 2019 until 2022  (AP)In 2021, Usman was arguably the best mixed martial artist in the world, let alone the UFC, and our pound-for-pound No 1. The Nigerian-American is perhaps the most clinical wrestler in the promotion and has added knockout power to his game in recent years, and he was unbeaten for nine years between 2013 and 2022 \u2013 with a dominant welterweight title reign for the last three years of that run. After five successful defences \u2013 two against Colby Covington, two against Jorge Masvidal, and one against Gilbert Burns \u2013 Usman dropped the belt to Leon Edwards last August, dominating his old opponent for much of the fight but falling to an incredible, late head kick. Edwards then outpointed Usman in London this March to retain the gold.5. Israel Adesanya (24-2, middleweight champion) (Getty Images)One of the most exciting fighters to watch in the history of the sport. The former kickboxer routinely produces striking masterclasses against his opponents, simply proving too slick and too clever for his competition. Adesanya has faced a who\u2019s-who of 185lbers, knocking out a number of them and losing to just one. The \u201cLast Stylebender\u201d suffered his first defeat in pro MMA in 2021, but there was even merit in that as the Nigerian-born New Zealander moved up a weight class to challenge then-champion Jan Blachowicz for the light-heavyweight title.He then began to \u201clap the opposition\u201d with back-to-back rematch wins against Vettori and Whittaker prior to his decision victory over Jared Cannonier at UFC 276. Adesanya then suffered just his second MMA defeat \u2013\u00a0and first at middleweight \u2013 in losing the title to old foe Alex Pereira in November. Pereira, who twice beat Adesanya in kickboxing bouts across 2016 and 2017, stopped the Kiwi in the final round to dethrone \u201cStylebender\u201d at the end of a thrilling encounter. But Adesanya finally exorcised his demon by knocking out Pereira in the second round in April, regaining the title and reasserting himself as the best middleweight in the UFC.4. Leon Edwards (21-3, 1 NC; welterweight champion)Leon Edwards made a successful first defence of the welterweight title in March  (Action Images via Reuters)Edwards became Britain\u2019s second ever UFC champion with a stunning, last-gasp knockout of Usman in August. After taking down the Nigerian-American \u2013\u00a0something no fighter had ever done in the UFC \u2013 in Round 1, Edwards continually rose to his feet amid an onslaught of grappling pressure from the champion over the next few frames, keeping himself in the fight. Then, with a minute left on the clock, Edwards knocked Usman out cold with a perfect head kick to take his gold, beating the man who outpointed him seven years earlier. Then, this March, Edwards outpointed Usman in London to solidify his status as champion. Edwards\u2019 first win over Usman saw him enter our list, while the second propelled him up the rankings. Since his 2015 loss to the \u201cNigerian Nightmare\u201d, Edwards is unbeaten with 11 straight wins (save for a No Contest against Belal Muhammad in 2021).3. Islam Makhachev (24-1, lightweight champion)Islam Makhachev won the UFC lightweight title by submitting Charles Oliveira in November  (AFP via Getty Images)Some used to question the Russian\u2019s credentials, given a lack of top-tier opponents on his record, though that was arguably due to highly-ranked fighters\u2019 tentativeness to risk their spots against a dangerous up-and-comer. Others accused Makhachev of benefiting from his connection to Khabib \u2013 his childhood friend and now one of Makhachev\u2019s coaches. Regardless, the 31-year-old banished any doubt in October when he submitted Oliveira \u2013 the fighter with the most submission wins in UFC history \u2013 to win the vacant lightweight title, suggesting that he would have done the same to most contenders at 155lbs.Makhachev then made it 12 wins in a row by outpointing Alexander Volkanovski in February, matching the Australian\u2019s record streak for an active fighter while retaining his title against the featherweight champion in a very close contest. In advance of that fight, many suggested that a Makhachev win would make him the new pound-for-pound No 1, but Indy Sport was more impressed by Volkanovski\u2019s showing in a higher weight class and would like to see Makhachev add some more notable names to his resume. As such, the Russian was our No 2, until...2. Jon Jones (27-1, 1 NC; heavyweight champion)Jon Jones returned to the UFC in March to collect a title in a second division  (Getty Images)When Jon Jones returned to the UFC in March after a three-year absence, winning the heavyweight title by submitting Ciryl Gane in the first round, many believed that the American confirmed himself as the greatest of all time. A lot of fans also felt that he should go straight to the top of any and all pound-for-pound lists. And Jones\u2019 victory certainly was impressive, particularly due to the manner in which it was achieved and the factors around the 35-year-old\u2019s heavyweight debut. It was also enough for the former two-time light-heavyweight champion to shoot straight into our rankings at No 2, with his long-term resume standing out more than Makhachev\u2019s (Jones has beaten numerous world champions), but his lack of activity keeping him below our No 1 \u2013 for the time being, at least.1. Alexander Volkanovski (25-2, featherweight champion)Alexander Volkanovski is riding a 22-fight winning streak  (Getty Images)After suffering the sole defeat of his professional career in 2013, Volkanovski won a stunning 22 fights in a row. In fact, his only pro loss came against a welterweight champion, until this February. Seven of the Australian\u2019s last eight fights have pitted him against \u2018elite\u2019 fighters, and in 2022 Volkanovski put on a clinic against fan favourite Chan Sung Jung before producing a masterclass to outpoint Max Holloway for the third time, leaving no doubt about his superiority over the man he dethroned in 2019. In doing so, the 34-year-old enhanced his own claim to be labelled the 145lbs GOAT. He even holds a win against the other standout contender for that title \u2013\u00a0Jose Aldo \u2013 as well as Chad Mendes and Brian Ortega.RecommendedHow Ciryl Gane\u2019s Jon Jones dream turned into a nightmareJared Cannonier breaks UFC record in win over Marvin VettoriTopuria vs Emmett and full UFC Fight Night card this weekendVolkanovski is as dynamic, composed and well rounded as they come. He had the chance to confirm his status as pound-for-pound king when he challenged lightweight champion Makhachev on home turf in February, in a bid to become just the fifth ever dual-weight UFC champion, and \u2013\u00a0although he narrowly lost on points \u2013\u00a0he remained our No 1. That is due to the stunning performance produced by the Aussie in that fight, with Volkanovski dropping Makhachev twice, neutralising the Russian in many of the grappling exchanges, and arguably winning the bout despite a significant size disadvantage. Volkanovski also keeps the returning Jon Jones at bay, for now..."}, {"_id": "64917c5e51ac331becf3e898", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/golf/pga-tour-jay-monahan-tom-watson-liv-golf-saudi-arabia-b2360360.html", "primaryCategory": "Golf", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Tom Watson calls for answers from PGA Tour commissioner over new partnership", "lead": "Prior to the announcement, PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan had been an outspoken critic of LIV Golf and Saudi Arabia.", "author": "Pa Sport Staff", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 16:14:38", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:15:58.947686", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-19T16:14:38+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/19/17/bf8b8aab23176d74d1341552d72fe252Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg3Mjc2Mzc0-2.67847339.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free sport newsletter for all the latest news on everything from cycling to boxingSign up to our free sport email for all the latest news\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

He was not beaten far in the Lockinge Stakes at Newbury when he tried to bite Modern Games and William Buick as they passed him Jockey Pat Dobbs felt he was in front too soon that day so this straight mile is perfect for him.

He sent Army Ethos up to Ayr to win his maiden and he made no mistake. It was the manner of the victory that impressed and he has to be a player in this contest. Aidan O\u2019Brien\u2019s River Tiber is the likely market leader and as long as there is cut in the ground, he will take some pegging back. His price reflects that.\u201d15:40 \u2013 Coolangatta - 7/2\u201cThe Australian sprinters are normally a fair way ahead of the home team, so I\u2019ll side with Coolangatta. She has the services of Royal Ascot regular James McDonald, which is a plus. Highfield Princess is an unbelievable story and it would be remarkable were she to win but the Aussie raider can repel her.\u201d16:20 \u2013 Paddington - 9/4\u201cThey didn\u2019t seem to go much of a gallop in the early part of the Irish 2,000 Guineas but Paddington quickened up very smartly to put the race to bed at the business end. The St James\u2019 Palace Stales is run on the round course and the best horse doesn\u2019t always win. However, Paddington has plenty of speed which will stand him in good stead and help the Ballydoyle runner edge it over Chaldean.\u201d17:00 \u2013 Calling the Wind - 9/1\u201cRichard Hughes was no stranger to the winner\u2019s enclosure as a jockey at Royal Ascot and it would mean the world to him to have a winner as a trainer.

He is the retained rider for Qatar Racing and Buckaroo got beaten in a Derby Trial last year at Leopardstown.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeEngland\u2019s commitment to high-risk, high-impact cricket hurried the first Ashes Test towards a gripping conclusion, setting Australia 281 to win on day four at Edgbaston.Resuming on 28 for two, England put their foot to the floor as they moved to 273 all out at the end of an elongated afternoon session.The hosts would have loved one of their middle-order batters to kick on to a substantial score, but saw Joe Root (46), Harry Brook (46) and Ben Stokes (43) dismissed one by one just as they were dragging control away from the Australians.There were important runs too from from the tail, Ollie Robinson making 27 as the last two wickets put on 44.Despite delivering emphatically on their promise to entertain, even those who roared their approval from the stands may reflect that England over-reached against Nathan Lyon at times.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveRoot was stumped for the first time in 131 Tests when he ran down the pitch and swiped fresh air and Brook cut short a highly promising stay when he dragged to midwicket trying to force a boundary.Former captain Root set the tone for a colourful day with an audacious start, attempting his trademark reverse ramp off Pat Cummins\u2019 first delivery of the morning.Root has become a master of that audacious stroke but, even by his own standards, attempting it so early \u2013 with a crucial Test match balanced on a knife-edge \u2013 showed remarkable chutzpah.Undeterred, he went back to the well twice in the next over, launching Scott Boland over the wicketkeeper\u2019s head for six and then flicking four more beyond the slip cordon. It was a faintly surreal, but utterly exhilarating opening salvo.England continued to go after Boland, who shipped 31 off his first three overs as his reputation for economy took its second battering in four days.By contrast, Cummins was working up a head of steam at the Pavilion End and he produced a picture-perfect inswinging yorker to see off Ollie Pope (16), thudding the base of off stump as the batter groped for contact. He finished with four for 63 \u2013 an outstanding effort by any measure.That left England 84 ahead and three down, but the arrival of Brook ensured the tempo did not slow. He took just three balls to register his first four, punching Cameron Green down the ground and quickly dialling up the aggression.He helped himself to 13 off Lyon\u2019s first over \u2013 not the kind of reception the spinner would have anticipated on a wearing pitch \u2013 and later launched him over extra-cover with a clean swing of the bat.Lyon got his rewards for sticking at it, Root overly giddy as he ran down the pitch and left Alex Carey a simple stumping.Stokes unexpectedly cooled things down, playing safely as he realised the importance of slowing Australia\u2019s roll, but Brook lost his patience as Lyon dried up the scoring options.Within sight of a first Ashes fifty he swiped at the spinner and was well caught by the diving Marnus Labuschagne at midwicket.Jonny Bairstow successfully overturned an lbw decision just before lunch, with England heading in at 155 for five. They made another 118 in the middle session, but were bowled out in the extra half-hour as they wrestled for the upper hand.Bairstow took the lead past 200 with successive fours \u2013 an impeccable square drive and a thick edge to deep third \u2013 but he was undone lbw by the wily Lyon for 20.That left Stokes in charge of building the lead and he batted with deliberate focus, putting away the slogs that have too often followed him around as captain.He hit five boundaries in almost two hours of observance, before his opposite number Lyon trapped him leg-before with the lead at 217.RecommendedA closer look at Rory McIlroy\u2019s long wait for a fifth major crownAndoni Iraola takes over at Bournemouth after Gary O\u2019Neil\u2019s surprise sackingNatasha Jonas to face Kandi Wyatt in bid to become two-weight world championEngland will have been happy with their finishing position from there, Moeen Ali making a scratchy 19 and Robinson showing real composure as he chipped away vital runs.He was close to being out for five, but Labuschagne brushed the ball across the ground after claiming the catch at short leg.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeAndy Murray returns to the Queens Championship for the first time since 2021, aiming to secure a potential seeding at this year\u2019s Wimbledon.Murray, who withdrew from Queens in 2022, returns to the tournament as the club\u2019s most successful champion. The grass-loving Murray captured a total of five Queen\u2019s singles titles, including four out of six between 2011 and 2016.The 38th-ranked Murray has attained his highest ranking since April 2018, following two consecutive titles in Grass court challengers - the Surbiton trophy and the Rothesay Open Nottingham.Murray enters Queen\u2019s on a 10-match winning streak, but he will find a step-up in competition in his first-round match on Tuesday against the speedy Australian Alex De Minaur. De Minaur is the tournament\u2019s seventh seed and is currently ranked 18th in the world.To achieve seeding at Wimbledon the ever-determined 36-year-old Murray will need to advance to at least the quarter-finals, while reaching the semi-finals would guarantee a top-32 seeding at this year\u2019s tournament.RecommendedDefending champion Matteo Berrettini withdraws from Queen\u2019s due to injuryKatie Boulter wins battle of the Britons with Jodie Burrage in Nottingham finalAndy Murray feeling \u2018really positive\u2019 over fitness as winning run continuesMurray is fully aware of the importance of obtaining seeding at this year\u2019s Wimbledon and the wins needed at Queens to achieve this. Murray stated after his challenger victory at Nottingham,\u00a0 \u201cI pretty much know what I have to do and if I make semis I will definitely make seeding. Quarters may be enough.\u201dIf Murray manages to overcome the speedy De Minaur, where he enters as a slight underdog, he will be welcomed in the round of 16 by the winner of Diego Schwartzman vs Mackenzie Mcdonald.McDonald, currently ranked 67th in the world, is the likely winner over the struggling Argentinian Schwartzmann.\u00a0 This likely match-up versus McDonald in the round of 16 would provide Murray with a relatively fortunate draw, as he would likely enter the match as a favorite.This route to the quarter-finals, which would likely involve facing De Minaur and McDonald, might be sufficient to secure a seeding for Murray. However, a spot in the semi-finals would guarantee the Scot his first Wimbledon seeding since 2017 when he held the tournament\u2019s No. 1 seed and eventually lost to American Sam Querrey in the quarter-finals.If Murray manages to win his first two matches, he would likely face American Taylor Fritz in the quarter-finals, with a spot in the semi-finals on the line. Fritz, a skilled grass player, won the ATP 250 Rothesay International at Eastbourne in 2022 and reached the quarter-finals at last year\u2019s Wimbledon.While success at Queen\u2019s is clearly important for form heading into Wimbledon, Murray\u2019s ability to achieve seeding at Wimbledon appears the main priority.So why is this special top 32 club at Wimbledon so important?Being a seed at Wimbledon means that one avoids playing another top 32 ranked player for each of the first two rounds, resulting in most likely a considerably easier draw. Having the opportunity to face lower-ranked players early on is precisely what Murray needs to potentially avoid prolonged matches in the early rounds of Grand Slams, a persistent issue that has significantly affected him in recent years.With a generally weak cast of players headed to Wimbledon where there isn\u2019t really a formidable No 2 on grass behind Djokovic; Murray is presented with a massive opportunity to get back to his first fourth round at a major since 2017.RecommendedRyan Peniston springs another Queen\u2019s surprise with win over Ugo HumbertAndy Murray\u2019s road back as he reaches top 40 with hope of Wimbledon seedingIn-form Andy Murray looking to secure Wimbledon seeding at Queen\u2019s this weekMurray, even with his relative lack of success at grand slams recently, is the 10th favorite to win Wimbledon this year, with a price of 35/1 available at Betfair.The 36-year-old Murray continues to defy expectations since his horrid 2018 and 2019 hip surgeries and will once again be a crowd favourite at both Queen\u2019s and Wimbledon.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeIf Mauricio Pochettino is the great lost Manchester United manager, forever tipped for the top job at Old Trafford, always seemingly suitable for it, never actually getting it, maybe Harry Kane will go down as their great lost centre-forward. There is time yet for England\u2019s record scorer to become United\u2019s main striker, perhaps when his Tottenham contract expires in 2024, but a move north seems unlikely this summer. United would argue they have not pulled out of the race for Kane: because they were never in it.Which doesn\u2019t mean he is short of admirers at Old Trafford. \u201cA great player, a great personality as well,\u201d said Erik ten Hag in April. The Dutchman has a belief United ought to be interested in high-class footballers; he stated last month they needed \u201cbetter players\u201d to reach the next level.In particular, there is a glaring need for a superior No 9; it is his major priority. The argument for Anthony Martial, which Ten Hag made eloquently for much of the campaign, felt damaged by the end of it: the Frenchman only scored two goals in his last 12 games, did not start a game in February or March and then missed the FA Cup final with injury. United cannot rely on him. Marcus Rashford had a career-best season, but he needed to: United\u2019s three, and very different, No 9s scored just seven league goals between them. Martial got six, the departed Cristiano Ronaldo one, the loanee Wout Weghorst none.There seemed two obvious upgrades, before Kylian Mbappe informed Paris Saint-Germain he will not sign a new contract there. And yet at least two of the three \u2013 Mbappe, Kane and Victor Osimhen \u2013 can probably be discounted: partly on grounds of cost. There is a reluctance to spend all summer negotiating with Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy, who does not want to sell to a Premier League rival, risking ending up empty-handed and after other strikers have already moved. There is a consciousness that Napoli could be similarly obdurate about Osimhen, who could command a nine-figure fee, though his talent is undeniable and recognised at Old Trafford.RecommendedLuke Shaw turns agent in bid to woo England teammates to Manchester UnitedEngland stars must ignore transfer talk, says Gareth SouthgateEngland\u2019s future is about to be defined \u2013 and it\u2019s out of Gareth Southgate\u2019s controlBut it leaves a vacancy and amid a troubled backdrop. The ongoing delays about a takeover make it far less likely funds will be available from a new owner to bolster Ten Hag\u2019s budget; the manager is frustrated by the delays. In any case, Financial Fair Play limits United\u2019s leeway. As it is, they overspent last summer, some of the cost of Antony coming from the 2023 pot. The impasse about David de Gea\u2019s contract and the chances he leaves on a free transfer could make it more urgent some of the money is redirected towards a new goalkeeper. And then there is the Mason Greenwood situation, with the forward still suspended amid an ongoing investigation. If United hope for a silver bullet to resolve their dilemma, one appears unlikely: they may still be weighing up whether the footballing case to keep him outweighs the moral case to dismiss him, along with implications involving lawyers, sponsors and supporters.The Mason Greenwood situation has left Manchester United with a dilemma  (Getty Images)Assume Greenwood is out of the picture and the reinforcements can only come from the transfer market. That poses problems: the supply-and-demand equation for strikers counts against buyers, the resurgence of the No 9 after a period of false nines, No 10s, wingers and attacking midfielders meaning there are relatively few players who want to lead the line. Ivan Toney might have been the best candidate in the Premier League but is banned until 2024; Ollie Watkins may instead be the finest available English option.Elsewhere, sizeable sums could be paid for potential, not proven performance. Rasmus Hojlund only scored nine Serie A goals for Atalanta last season, though the 20-year-old Dane is expected to become more prolific. Randal Kolo Muani is another on the rise, though Bayern Munich may be in pole position to secure the Eintracht Frankfurt forward. Goncalo Ramos has only been potent at club level for one season, though that was long enough for the Benfica attacker to displace Ronaldo during the World Cup.None has a track record to compare with Kane\u2019s. Maybe United only need to buy themselves time, to find someone who can do a job for a season if they are confident of getting Kane in 2024, when Levy would not be a factor. Yet Weghorst both did and did not prove a short-term option, helping United to third but ending with a miserable return of two goals in 31 games in all competitions.There is a destructive striker in Manchester who United allegedly could have had for \u00a34m; Ole Gunnar Solskjaer claimed last month he recommended Erling Haaland in 2018 and said United did not listen to him. If that was damning, it may suggest Solskjaer, Haaland\u2019s manager for Molde, was not particularly persuasive. But while United were interested in some strikers, including Darwin Nunez, last summer and prioritised other positions, now their most pressing need is clear. The far more difficult part, with three of the best appearing distinctly unlikely, is who they can get."}, {"_id": "64917c6251ac331becf3e8a5", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/cricket/tammy-beaumont-england-heather-knight-australia-ben-stokes-b2360221.html", "primaryCategory": "Cricket", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Tammy Beaumont has eyes on a first Test victory as England launch Ashes campaign", "lead": "Beaumont is set for her eighth Test cap when a much-anticipated multi-format series starts on Thursday.", "author": "David Charlesworth", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 12:49:13", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:02.166940", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-19T12:49:13+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/19/13/b5bbe85d7dc9058469ac486a1180c3b5Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg3MjY0MTAw-2.72632851.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free sport newsletter for all the latest news on everything from cycling to boxingSign up to our free sport email for all the latest news\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Lewis was briefly England men\u2019s bowling coach under Stokes and McCullum before joining the women\u2019s side late last year.England have shown their hand in the warm-ups last week, with Beaumont\u2019s 201 off 238 balls the jewel in a total of 650 in 118.2 overs at Derby against Australia A. A separate England A side, meanwhile, racked up 562 in 115.1 overs against a full-strength Australia side at Grace Road.Ahead of the one-off Test in the series which also features three T20s and three ODIs, Beaumont said: \u201cAustralia have led the way for the last five or six years, everyone is playing catch up.\u201cBut the way that we are playing and the way we want to play can certainly challenge them and compete with them.\u201cOnce you put good teams under pressure, you never know how they\u2019re going to react and you never know what can happen.\u201dBeaumont could face the opening ball of the series if England bat first, an occasion she has encountered in the past and one she likens to one of the most nerve-wracking of her career.She added: \u201cIt\u2019s probably second only to facing the first ball of a World Cup final.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeEngland\u2019s commitment to high-risk cricket kept all results in play as the first Ashes Test moved forward at pace on the fourth morning at Edgbaston.The hosts hit 127 runs in the opening session as they came out at a gallop, but also lost the wickets of Ollie Pope, Joe Root and Harry Brook to allow Australia some serious inroads.At lunch England were 162 ahead on 155 for five, with captain Ben Stokes for once providing a calming presence and Jonny Bairstow new to the crease.Despite easily delivering on their promise to entertain, England were probably guilty of over-reaching against Nathan Lyon, with Root stumped as he charged down the pitch and Brook dragging to mid-wicket in search of a boundary. Both fell for 46 with big scores seemingly in the offing.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveRoot set the tone with an audacious start to the day\u2019s play, attempting his trademark reverse ramp off Pat Cummins\u2019 first delivery of the morning.Root has become a master of that high-risk stroke but, even by his own standards, reaching for it so early with a crucial Test match balanced on a knife-edge was remarkable. Undeterred, he went back to the well twice in the next over, launching Scott Boland over the wicketkeeper\u2019s head for six and then flicking four more beyond the slip cordon. It was a faintly surreal, but utterly exhilarating opening salvo.England continued to go after Boland, with Root and Pope racking up 31 off his first three overs. For a bowler who has built a reputation for giving nothing, boasting an economy rate of 2.31 prior to this week, it was brand new territory.By contrast, Cummins was working up a head of steam at the Pavilion End and he produced a picture perfect inswinging yorker to see off Pope (16), thudding the base of off stump as the batter groped for contact.That left England 84 ahead and three down, but the arrival of Brook ensured the tempo did not slow. He took just three balls to register his first four, punching Cameron Green down the ground and quickly dialling up the aggression.He helped himself to 13 off Lyon\u2019s first over, not the kind of reception the spinner would have anticipated on a wearing fourth day pitch, and later launched him over extra-cover with a clean swing of the bat.Lyon got his rewards for sticking at it, Root overly giddy as he ran down the pitch and left Alex Carey a simple stumping \u2013 Root\u2019s first such dismissal in 131 Tests.Stokes unexpectedly cooled things down, playing safely as he realised the importance of slowing Australia\u2019s role, but Brook lost his patience as Lyon dried up the scoring options.RecommendedAndy Murray\u2019s road back as he reaches top 40 with hope of Wimbledon seedingIn-form Andy Murray looking to secure Wimbledon seeding at Queen\u2019s this weekMan City chairman vows to give \u2018very blunt views\u2019 on FFP charges once concludedWithin one shot of a first Ashes fifty he swiped at the spinner and was well caught by the diving Marnus Labuschagne at mid-wicket.Another wicket would have put England in big trouble and there were huge roars in the stands when Bairstow successfully overturned an lbw decision in Boland\u2019s favour in the final over before the break."}, {"_id": "64917c6251ac331becf3e8a8", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/golf/wyndham-clark-rory-mcilroy-us-open-b2360170.html", "primaryCategory": "Golf", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Wyndham Clark believes he deserves place among golf elite after US Open triumph", "lead": "<p>The 29-year-old American held his nerve in a tense final round to finish top of the leaderboard on 10 under par</p>", "author": "Phil Casey", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 12:39:29", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:02.963382", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-19T12:39:29+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/19/12/19-d3d813bf9c3a4f28a232e973ff718307.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free sport newsletter for all the latest news on everything from cycling to boxingSign up to our free sport email for all the latest news\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeNewly-crowned US Open champion Wyndham Clark believes he deserves his place among the game\u2019s elite after claiming his maiden major title in impressive fashion.Despite winning his first PGA Tour title six weeks ago, Clark was an 120/1 outsider at Los Angeles Country Club, having made just two cuts in six previous majors with a best finish of 75th in the 2021 US PGA.Yet it was the 29-year-old American who held his nerve in a tense final round to finish top of the leaderboard on 10 under par, with major champions Rory McIlroy, Scottie Scheffler and Cameron Smith filling the minor places.Clark\u2019s victory will take him from 32nd to a career-high 13th in the world rankings and also up to second in the qualifying race for the US Ryder Cup team.\u201cI feel like I belong on this stage and even two, three years ago when people didn\u2019t know who I was, I felt like I could still play and compete against the best players in the world,\u201d Clark said.RecommendedMcIlroy reacts to missing out on US Open victory by a single strokeWyndham Clark knows he made late mother \u2018proud\u2019 with US Open winThe sporting weekend in pictures\u201cI feel like I\u2019ve shown that this year. I\u2019ve come up close (to winning) and obviously everyone sees the person that hoists the trophy, but I\u2019ve been trending in the right direction for a long time now.\u201cI\u2019ve made a lot of cuts. I\u2019ve had a handful of top 10s and top 20s and I feel like I\u2019ve been on a great trajectory to get to this place.\u201cObviously it\u2019s gone faster than I thought as far as just starting to do some stuff mentally that I\u2019ve never done before, but I feel like I\u2019m one of the best players in the world.\u201cObviously this just shows what I believe can happen.\u201cBut at the same time I\u2019m a pretty humble, calm guy and I don\u2019t try to get too high or too low on things. I\u2019m obviously going to celebrate this, but I like to compete.\u201cI\u2019m so competitive. I want to beat everybody but also be friends with everybody. So I try to have a good mix of that.\u201dClark\u2019s victory came on Father\u2019s Day but it was no surprise that his thoughts immediately turned to his late mother Lise, who was a huge influence on his career before her death from breast cancer in 2013.Lise\u2019s death hit Clark hard and he seriously considered quitting the sport as he battled bouts of depression and frustration throughout his college career and early years in the professional ranks.\u201cI didn\u2019t show any emotion off the course, but when I was on the golf course, I couldn\u2019t have been angrier,\u201d Clark recalled.\u201cI was breaking clubs when I didn\u2019t even hit that bad of a shot. I was walking off golf courses. When I transferred from Oklahoma State to Oregon was another low point and I think that was a lot of carryover from my mom passing.\u201cSo when I went to Oregon and Casey Martin then took over as my head coach, he instilled that I was one of the best players in the world and he goes, \u2018you\u2019re good enough to play on this stage but also in college and win\u2019.\u201cThen I had my best year ever. I got out here (on Tour) pretty quick, but even those first few years, I felt like I under-performed.\u201cI\u2019ve had many times where I\u2019ve gone home and was yelling in my car and punching things and just so mad that I\u2019m like, \u2018Why can\u2019t I do what my peers are doing that I know I can play with and against and beat?\u2019Recommended\u2018Mom was watching over me\u2019 says US Open champion Wyndham ClarkRory McIlroy suffers more major heartbreak as Wyndham Clark shockingly wins US OpenUS Open 2023 LIVE: Leaderboard, result & reaction as Wyndham Clark beats Rory McIlroy\u201cI\u2019ve probably had three to four really defining moments in my career since college, but I\u2019m really glad that I stuck it through.\u201cBeing here now, I just feel so blessed.

Cannonier landed 249 significant strikes against Vettori across five rounds, with the record previously standing at 186.Cannonier, 39, and Vettori, 29, are both former title challengers in the UFC, with both having been outpointed by incumbent champion Israel Adesanya during the Nigerian-New Zealander\u2019s first title reign.

After dipping back as low as 70 in February, he has now spent five straight weeks in the top 50 since the May 8 update.Tournament winsMurray\u2019s only tournament win on the main ATP Tour since his surgeries came at the 2019 European Open in Antwerp.That came via an impressive win over fellow three-time grand slam champion Stan Wawrinka in the final, while his semi-final opponent Ugo Humbert would go on to win the event the following year.He reached further finals in Sydney and Stuttgart last year and Doha this February, where he lost to Daniil Medvedev.His grass-court wins in Surbiton and Nottingham made it three titles for him on this year\u2019s ATP Challenger Tour, having also won on the clay of Aix-en-Provence in May.Queen\u2019s recordMurray now takes his form to the biggest grass-court tournament outside of Wimbledon, knowing a deep run in the cinch Championships at The Queen\u2019s Club could earn him a spot among the 32 seeds at SW19.His past record there offers plenty of encouragement, with a record five titles to his name.He won the event ahead of his two Wimbledon triumphs in 2013 and 2016 as well as in 2009, 2011 and 2015 to stand alone as Queen\u2019s Club\u2019s most successful player.RecommendedWyndham Clark believes he deserves place among golf elite after US Open triumphIn-form Andy Murray looking to secure Wimbledon seeding at Queen\u2019s this weekMan City chairman vows to give \u2018very blunt views\u2019 on FFP charges once concludedHe will need to reach at least the quarter-finals this year to have a chance of being seeded at Wimbledon and the less-encouraging omen is his somewhat boom-and-bust record \u2013 outside of his five wins he has reached just one other quarter-final, which he lost to Andy Roddick in 2008.Murray has lost in the last 16 four times \u2013 most recently two years ago against Matteo Berrettini \u2013 and the last 32 three times with a solitary last-64 exit back in 2006."}, {"_id": "64917c6451ac331becf3e8ad", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/cricket/drs-ashes-england-australia-umpires-b2359430.html", "primaryCategory": "Cricket", "subCategories": "test", "title": "What is DRS and how does it work?", "lead": "<p>DRS was first introduced in 2008 and could have a key role to play in the Ashes</p>", "author": "Harry Latham-Coyle", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 11:41:21", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:04.139698", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-19T11:41:21+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/13/13/newFile-1.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free sport newsletter for all the latest news on everything from cycling to boxingSign up to our free sport email for all the latest news\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeCricket has long embraced the use of technology to aid officiating, with the Decision Review System (DRS) a by-now familiar feature of international and some domestic The system was introduced in a bid to help the on-field umpires make fewer obvious errors, granting power to batters and bowlers to challenge decisions that they feel have been made incorrectly. In time, the use of the third umpire has become more and more prevalent, with even marginal calls now often reviewed, but the system can prove pivotal if employed shrewdly. Indeed, two of the most thrilling Ashes series in recent memory might have ended differently had the system been available or better utilised: in 2005, before DRS was in place, Australia may well have squeaked home at Edgbaston and gone on to win the series had Michael Kasprowicz been able to review a caught-behind decision; in 2019, Australia\u2019s misuse of the system at Headingley proved costly as they found themselves out of reviews after Ben Stokes survived a late LBW appeal on his way to an extraordinary match-winning innings.Here\u2019s what you need to know about the system:RecommendedMoeen Ali could not turn down Ashes series under Ben Stokes\u2019 captaincyWomen\u2019s Ashes points system explainedWhat is Bazball? How England revolutionised Test cricketWhat is DRS and what does it stand for?DRS stands for Decision Review System, and was first brought in to Test cricket in 2008. It enables players to challenge decisions made by the on-field umpires - a bowling side can challenge a \u201cnot out\u201d decision, while a batter can ask to review after being given out.How does it work?After a decision is made by the on-field umpires, or the ball otherwise becomes dead, the players have up to 15 seconds to decide if they wish to review it. An intention to review is signalled by either the batter on strike or the fielding captain making a \u2018T\u2019 sign, at which point the umpires refer their decision to the third umpire, who has the benefit of replays.The third umpire then takes as long as required to either stay with or overturn the on-field decision, using a range of technologies at his disposal and all available television camera angles to make their final ruling, before returning to the on-field standing umpire to make a signal.Each team has three unsuccessful reviews per Test innings - this was upped from two during Covid to compensate for the pandemic-enforced use of non-neutral umpires, and has remained since.What technology can the third umpire use?Beyond pure footage, there are three technologies utilised during the DRS process. Ultra-Edge or Real Time Snicko (RTS)Ultra-Edge, also known as Real Time Snicko (RTS), uses a sensitive microphone placed near the stumps to generate a waveform displaying the soundwave of a connected oscilloscope. This waveform is then automatically synchronised with television footage to show sounds as they happened, with clear spikes on the waveform showing contact with the bat or pad. The one drawback of the technology is that it cannot distinguish what was struck, relying on the third umpire to interpret whether the ball has hit bat or pad when the two are close together - though this is reasonably rare.Hot SpotHot Sport is an infrared imaging system also used to determine if the ball has made contact with the bat. It requires two infrared cameras on either side of the ground that continuously record footage, which is then made available to the third umpire. Contact with the bat, or the batter\u2019s body, is typically evidenced by a bright, white spot where friction has elevated the temperature of the contacted area. While once preferred to RTS, improvements in the accuracy of the Ultra-Edge technology means that it is now generally used as the primary form of determining if a batter has edged the ball.Ball trackingGenerally using the computer vision system Hawk-Eye, also employed in tennis, ball tracking is used to assess leg before wicket (LBW) decisions. After a batter is struck on the pad or body, the ball tracking technology plots the trajectory the delivery would have continued on if not interrupted, predicting whether or not it would have hit the stumps. The technology can also assess whether the ball pitched or struck the batter in line with the stumps.What is umpire\u2019s call?Umpire\u2019s call will be commonly sighted when the third umpire asks for ball tracking. Put simply, it means that the benefit of the doubt is given to the on-field umpire\u2019s decision when no clear error has been made. RecommendedOllie Robinson defends Ashes send-off for Usman Khawaja after criticismEngland vs Australia LIVE: Ashes scorecard and first Test updatesThe sporting weekend in picturesWhile the ball tracking technology is good, there is a small margin for error. For this reason, both the point at which the batter was struck and whether the ball would go on to hit the stumps can be assessed as umpire\u2019s call, sticking with the on-field decision. If the centre of the ball was outside what is called the \u201cImpact Zone\u201d as it struck the batter, an umpire\u2019s call is returned; similarly, if less than half of the ball is projected to go on to hit the stumps, the on-field call will also be upheld.If an LBW decision is upheld on umpire\u2019s call, the team that took the review does not lose it.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeBoxing matches tend to be organised as one of three types: professional, amateur or exhibition. But what is the difference between them?Generally speaking, most \u2018major\u2019 fights \u2013 including title fights \u2013 are professional bouts, while exhibition contests are those staged with more of a focus on the audience and entertainment. Most professional fighters have an amateur career before turning pro, and Olympic fights count as amateur bouts.For example, Anthony Joshua\u2019s Olympic gold-medal win in 2012 was part of his amateur career. Meanwhile, his heavyweight title fights with Oleksandr Usyk in 2021 and 2022 were professional bouts. Elsewhere, Floyd Mayweather\u2019s recent matches against YouTubers Logan Paul and Deji were exhibitions.All fights \u2013 professional, amateur and exhibition \u2013 must be licensed by a commission (e.g. fights in Las Vegas are regulated by the Nevada State Athletic Commission), but exhibition bouts do not need to be sanctioned by a governing body. In contrast, the World Boxing Council (WBC) sanctioned Tyson Fury\u2019s three fights with Deontay Wilder, as the WBC heavyweight title was on the line.Professional fights do not need to be title bouts, but they tend to have an effect on the rankings in the weight class in which they take place, as seeded by the governing body sanctioning the fight. I.e. Andy Ruiz Jr is the World Boxing Organization (WBO)\u2019s No 1-ranked fighter below its champions, while Wilder is ranked sixth. If Wilder were to fight and beat Ruiz Jr, Wilder would likely overtake the Mexican-American in the rankings.RecommendedFloyd Mayweather vs John Gotti III fight ends with mass brawl in ringThe Independent\u2019s pound-for-pound boxing rankingsBehind the scenes, laughter is turning to anger in the Fury vs Usyk sagaFurthermore, rules are more flexible in exhibition fights. For example, a world title fight in men\u2019s boxing \u2013 a professional bout \u2013 will always be scheduled for 12 three-minute rounds; and a women\u2019s world title fight will always be scheduled for 12 two-minute rounds. In contrast, an exhibition fight could be set as six three-minute rounds, or eight two-minute rounds (these are random examples).Fights can of course end earlier if there is a knockout/TKO (technical knockout, where the referee or a ringside doctor halts the action, or a towel is thrown in), but such results are less frequent in exhibition bouts, where wins and losses do not count towards a fighter\u2019s record \u2013 and there is often no winner declared at all. For example, former multi-weight world champion Mayweather retired unbeaten in 2017 with a professional record of 50-0, and he has since fought in five exhibitions. While the 46-year-old has been somewhat aggressive in beating three of his exhibition opponents via TKO, two of his exhibition fights lasted the full number of rounds and no winner was declared.Sometimes, however, fights that one would expect to be exhibition bouts are in fact professional contests. For example, YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul has boxed six times professionally, taking on former mixed martial arts champions Anderson Silva, Tyron Woodley (twice) and Ben Askren, as well as ex-NBA star Nate Robinson and YouTuber AnEsonGib. Readers might expect such fights to be exhibitions, but they have in fact been organised as professional bouts, meaning Paul has a 6-0 record (4 KOs).

Juan Francisco Estrada (44-3, 28 KOs)Juan Francisco Estrada celebrates a 2017 win against Carlos Cuadras (Getty Images)The diminutive Mexican is a two-weight world champion, having obtained the WBA super-flyweight title with his split-decision victory over Roman Gonzalez in March 2021. That win saw Estrada, 33, avenge a 2012 defeat by \u201cChocolatito\u201d, but its narrow nature meant the old rivals were set to rematch last March, until Estrada had to withdraw due to Covid symptoms. Estrada has since outpointed Argi Cortes and triumphed in his delayed trilogy bout with \u201cChocolatito\u201d in December, winning a close fight by majority decision. His creative use of angles is one of his standout attributes, making him a fun watch each time out.9. Vasiliy Lomachenko (17-3, 11 KOs)Vasiliy Lomachenko (left) during his fight with Devin Haney in May  (AP)The Ukrainian southpaw (one of two on this list...) saw off Jorge Linares in 2018 to become a three-weight title holder, before adding further belts with notable wins against the likes of Luke Campbell and Jose Pedraza. \u201cLoma\u201d was somewhat surprisingly beaten by Teofimo Lopez in 2020, but the 35-year-old bounced back with three straight wins to maintain his status as one of the best boxers in the world. The two-time Olympic champion is in the twilight of his career now, which only made his terrific showing against the next fighter on this list even more impressive. Lomachenko came up narrowly short, but many observers felt that he had won.8. Devin Haney (30-0, 15 knockouts)Devin Haney (right) was a unanimous-decision winner against George Kambosos Jr in two fights in 2022  (Getty Images)The unbeaten American entered our list following his second straight clinic against George Kambosos Jr. Haney eased to a unanimous-decision win against the Australian on Kambosos\u2019 home turf in June 2022 to become undisputed champion at lightweight, before retaining that status in the pair\u2019s rematch in October \u2013 also in Melbourne. Prior to those clashes, Kambosos Jr was undefeated. At just 24 years old, the best is still ahead of Haney, though he must learn from his most recent bout, with Lomachenko in May.\u00a0It was a fight that Haney won, but not without controversy.7. Dmitry Bivol (21-0, 11 KOs)Dmitry Bivol outpointed Saul \u2018Canelo\u2019 Alvarez for a stunning win  (Copyright 2022 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.)Entered our list in May 2022, following his stunning victory over Saul \u201cCanelo\u201d Alvarez. The Russian remained unbeaten and retained the WBA light-heavyweight title with that result, which he achieved by fighting on the front foot, picking his shots wisely, and almost doubling the output of his opponent. Bivol, 32, won by two points on all three judges\u2019 scorecards, though the margins should have been much wider. A clinical showing that raised the Russian\u2019s profile immensely and likely sets up a rematch with Canelo down the line. Before that, though, Bivol was tasked with getting past the unbeaten Gilberto Ramirez in November. Bivol won on points with an aggressive and sharp performance, which saw him rise from ninth to seventh on our list. 6. Tyson Fury (33-0-1, 24 KOs)Tyson Fury after stopping Deontay Wilder again in a heavyweight epic in 2021  (Getty Images)Has eclipsed Anthony Joshua as the household name in British boxing. Fury, 34, returned to the sport in 2018 after three years off due to a long struggle with his mental health. Since then, he has established himself as one of the greatest heavyweights of all time, dethroning Deontay Wilder to become WBC champion in the pair\u2019s 2020 rematch, having controversially drawn with the American in their first clash, in 2018. In October 2021, Fury stopped Wilder for the second fight in a row to retain the belt, which he did again in April by knocking out Dillian Whyte with ease and once more in December with a late stoppage of Derek Chisora. A creative fighter who has demonstrated remarkable resilience and heart in the ring, Fury previously held the WBA, WBO, IBF and IBO titles and was looking to regain them in a fight with Oleksandr Usyk this spring. However, the fight \u2013 which would have crowned an undisputed heavyweight champion \u2013 fell through.5. Errol Spence Jr (28-0, 22 KOs)Errol Spence Jr leaving AT&T Stadium with another welterweight belt (Getty Images)The American has not been the most active fighter in recent years, but he has been slowly building a fine resume. Spence Jr holds impressive wins against the likes of Shawn Porter, Mikey Garcia, Danny Garcia and Carlos Ocampo. The southpaw stopped the latter, as well as notably finishing Kell Brook on the Briton\u2019s home turf earlier in his career, and a cancelled clash with Manny Pacquiao would surely have built up Spence even further had it come to fruition. Last time out, the 33-year-old beat Yordenis Ugas by brutalising the Cuban\u2019s eye, collecting another welterweight belt and rising up our rankings in the process. If he can increase his activity, Spence will likely only continue to climb here, especially if a long-awaited meeting with Terence Crawford comes to pass and Spence can win...4. Terence Crawford (39-0, 30 KOs)Terence Crawford stopped Shawn Porter in November 2021 to stay unbeaten  (AP)The WBO welterweight champion has one of the most impressive resumes in the sport, and it just keeps getting better. Four of the American\u2019s last 10 opponents were undefeated before facing him, and all 10 were stopped by Crawford \u2013 who has a tremendous number of knockout and TKO victories to his name. Wins against big-name boxers Brook and Porter in 2020 and 2021 further enhanced the 35-year-old\u2019s profile, especially his victory over the latter, before Crawford stopped David Avanesyan in December 2022.3. Saul \u2018Canelo\u2019 Alvarez (59-2-2, 39 KOs)Saul Alvarez following his stoppage win against Caleb Plant in 2021  (AP)In the 10 years since his loss to Floyd Mayweather, the Mexican has established himself as the face of boxing, with wins against Erislandy Lara, Miguel Cotto, Amir Khan, Gennadiy Golovkin, Daniel Jacobs, Billy Joe Saunders and many more of note. The effectiveness of the 32-year-old\u2019s counter-punching, slickness of his head movement and beauty of his body work make him a joy to watch.Detractors will point to Alvarez\u2019s clenbuterol controversy in 2018 and the fact that a few of his victories have come via controversial scorecards. Supporters will give more credence to Canelo\u2019s admirable level of activity and the great number of formidable foes he has fought and beaten. His three victories in 2021 \u2013 all stoppages \u2013 saw him ultimately become boxing\u2019s first ever undisputed super-middleweight champion. A title holder in four weight classes, the Mexican failed to add a second light-heavyweight title to his collection when he was outpointed by unbeaten Russian Bivol in May 2022.That result, which surprised a number of fans, marked just the second defeat of Canelo\u2019s professional career and saw him drop from No 1 in our list to No 4. He rebounded with a decisive points win against ageing rival Golovkin, though that result proved little at this point and only saw him climb one spot here. The ambitious Mexican then defended his super-middleweight belts against John Ryder in Guadalajara, dropping the Briton en route to a decision win that sees him stay put at No 3.2. Oleksandr Usyk (20-0, 13 KOs)Oleksandr Usyk (left) has outpointed Anthony Joshua twice in a row  (Getty Images)Was the only ever undisputed cruiserweight champion of the four-belt era before moving up to heavyweight, where he became WBA, WBO, IBF and IBO champion in 2021 by outpointing Anthony Joshua with relative ease. The Ukrainian, 36, is undefeated and most recently beat Joshua on points a second time to retain his heavyweight titles and climb two spots here. The southpaw, an Olympic gold medalist, is as technical and awkward as they come in the heavier weight classes, making a potential match-up with Fury an intriguing prospect \u2013 though that bout collapsed this spring.1. Naoya Inoue (24-0, 21 KOs)Naoya Inoue (left) stopped Paul Butler in Round 11 in December  (AP)One of the lesser-known names on this list to the more casual fan, the Japanese does not lack in prowess what he may lack in profile. Inoue has the best stoppage percentage of any fighter on this list, part of what makes him such an exciting fighter to watch \u2013 along with his effortless evasiveness, brutal body attacks, and frightening level of output. In June, \u201cMonster\u201d lived up to his nickname once again by eviscerating Nonito Donaire in a rematch, having narrowly outpointed the Filipino in their first fight.

Read our\u00a0privacy notice\u201cClash\u201d is a word that can cause any Glastonbury ticketowner to break out in cold sweats.When organisers first release the poster, which is fit to bursting musicians booked to perform at the Worthy Farm festival, there is nothing more fun than putting together a list of all the performances you plan on seeing.But then the set times are announced, and you come to the crushing realisation that you may have to skip a few of your favourites.Below, we run through the biggest clashes at the 2023 festival.However, don\u2019t fret \u2013\u00a0we\u2019ve also worked out some possible workarounds, meaning you may be able to see at least some of the sets you\u2019re sad about missing.RecommendedGlastonbury 2023: Full line up and stage timesGlastonbury Festival 2023: How to watch the BBC\u2019s live coverageFoo Fighters drop huge hint for mystery Glastonbury band in touching fan letterFriday 23 JuneArctic Monkeys (10pm-11.45pm) vs Hot Chip (10.20-11.30pm)Warpaint (9pm-10pm) vs Sparks (9.15pm-10.15pm)It\u2019s no stretch to assume that those wanting to witness Sheffield quartet Arctic Monkeys\u2019 third headline set since 2007 would have also liked to have bopped along to synthpop heroes Hot Chip. Sadly, this won\u2019t be able to happen unless you ditch Arctic Monkeys midway through their performance. Elsewhere, two titans battling for your attentions are Warpaint and Sparks, an unfortunate clash that will no doubt cause headaches among fans of both. The workaround here is watching half of Warpaint\u2019s set on Woodsies before trekking 15-20 minutes to Park Stage to catch the end of Sparks. You\u2019ll have to sneak around the back of the crowd, though, as Park notoriously gets busy once the first performance kicks off.Saturday 24 JuneLana Del Rey (10.30-11.45) vs Christine and the Queens (10.30-11.45)Rina Sawayama (9pm-10pm) vs Melanie C (9.35pm-10.35pm)Lewis Capaldi (5.35pm-6.35pm) vs Maggie Rodgers (5.15pm-6.15pm)Christine and the Queens  (Christopher Victorio/Shutterstock)Three huge clashes occur on the Saturday, the chief of which is perhaps Other Stage and Woodsides headliners Lana Del Rey and Christine and the Queens, who play at exactly the same time. This is yet another example of a head-scratching slice of scheduling that may or may not have been decided in an attempt to split the crowds, which last year somewhat marred the Glasto experience. Melanie C returns to Worthy Farm after a heroic welcome in 2021 \u2013 however, scheduling her at the same time as Rina Sawayama is a particularly cruel move as it\u2019s understandable that fanbases of each would have enjoyed watching both sets. ]We suggest leaving Sawayama after 30 minutes to catch the end of Melanie C. Similarly, those wanting to watch two exceptionally good singers croon away on a lazy afternoon will have to pick their fighters out of Lewis Capaldi and Maggie Rodgers. Whoever you select, if the sun is shining, it could be a terrific calm before the storm (hopefully metaphorical) that is the Saturday night of Glastonbury. Our suggestion? Pick one and enjoy them.Sunday 25 JuneElton John (9pm-11.05pm) vs Queens of the Stone Age (9.45pm-11.15pm)Phoenix (9.30pm-10.45pm) vs Alt-J (9.15pm-10.15pm)It\u2019s feasible that fans of all genres of music would opt to see Elton John considering it\u2019s \u2013 let\u2019s call it what it is \u2013 a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. However, the singer, who finally headlines the Pyramid Stage after a five-decade career, will test prospective viewers\u2019 loyalties: Queens of the Stone Age, Phoenix and Alt-J are all playing at the same time.

The streaming giant made the entire series of Friends available for UK subscribers at the end of 2017, meaning that fans have been able to watch the series in high-definition quality, allowing them to pick up on errors that previously went unnoticed.

Read our\u00a0privacy notice\u201cClash\u201d is a word that can cause any Glastonbury ticketowner to break out in cold sweats.When organisers first release the poster, which is fit to bursting musicians booked to perform at the Worthy Farm festival, there is nothing more fun than putting together a list of all the performances you plan on seeing.But then the set times are announced, and you come to the crushing realisation that you may have to skip a few of your favourites.Below, we run through the biggest clashes at the 2023 festival.However, don\u2019t fret \u2013\u00a0we\u2019ve also worked out some possible workarounds, meaning you may be able to see at least some of the sets you\u2019re sad about missing.RecommendedGlastonbury 2023: Full line up and stage timesGlastonbury Festival 2023: How to watch the BBC\u2019s live coverageFoo Fighters drop huge hint for mystery Glastonbury band in touching fan letterFriday 23 JuneArctic Monkeys (10pm-11.45pm) vs Hot Chip (10.20-11.30pm)Warpaint (9pm-10pm) vs Sparks (9.15pm-10.15pm)It\u2019s no stretch to assume that those wanting to witness Sheffield quartet Arctic Monkeys\u2019 third headline set since 2007 would have also liked to have bopped along to synthpop heroes Hot Chip. Sadly, this won\u2019t be able to happen unless you ditch Arctic Monkeys midway through their performance. Elsewhere, two titans battling for your attentions are Warpaint and Sparks, an unfortunate clash that will no doubt cause headaches among fans of both. The workaround here is watching half of Warpaint\u2019s set on Woodsies before trekking 15-20 minutes to Park Stage to catch the end of Sparks. You\u2019ll have to sneak around the back of the crowd, though, as Park notoriously gets busy once the first performance kicks off.Saturday 24 JuneLana Del Rey (10.30-11.45) vs Christine and the Queens (10.30-11.45)Rina Sawayama (9pm-10pm) vs Melanie C (9.35pm-10.35pm)Lewis Capaldi (5.35pm-6.35pm) vs Maggie Rodgers (5.15pm-6.15pm)Christine and the Queens  (Christopher Victorio/Shutterstock)Three huge clashes occur on the Saturday, the chief of which is perhaps Other Stage and Woodsides headliners Lana Del Rey and Christine and the Queens, who play at exactly the same time. This is yet another example of a head-scratching slice of scheduling that may or may not have been decided in an attempt to split the crowds, which last year somewhat marred the Glasto experience. Melanie C returns to Worthy Farm after a heroic welcome in 2021 \u2013 however, scheduling her at the same time as Rina Sawayama is a particularly cruel move as it\u2019s understandable that fanbases of each would have enjoyed watching both sets. ]We suggest leaving Sawayama after 30 minutes to catch the end of Melanie C. Similarly, those wanting to watch two exceptionally good singers croon away on a lazy afternoon will have to pick their fighters out of Lewis Capaldi and Maggie Rodgers. Whoever you select, if the sun is shining, it could be a terrific calm before the storm (hopefully metaphorical) that is the Saturday night of Glastonbury. Our suggestion? Pick one and enjoy them.Sunday 25 JuneElton John (9pm-11.05pm) vs Queens of the Stone Age (9.45pm-11.15pm)Phoenix (9.30pm-10.45pm) vs Alt-J (9.15pm-10.15pm)It\u2019s feasible that fans of all genres of music would opt to see Elton John considering it\u2019s \u2013 let\u2019s call it what it is \u2013 a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeI wasn\u2019t conceived at Glastonbury, but for the first decade of my life I may as well have been. I was, in many respects, a Glastonbury baby. Born and raised in nearby Bristol, I first visited in 1994, aged two with potty in hand, and attended for the five years that followed. I have not been back since. But even if Glastonbury has changed hugely in the decades in between, it still exists as a joyous, creative paradise of jugglers, acrobats and enormous fire-breathing spiders for those lucky enough to experience it as a child. Enough to grant it an almost mythical hold over many of the children who have passed through over the years, like a soothing imprinton the soul.Back then, against the withering judgements of outraged co-workers, my parents saw it as an adventure and an education, for themselves and for me. My dad sometimes worked there as a steward, picking up litter and ushering in guests in exchange for a free ticket. But the tickets themselves were also relatively affordable \u2013 around \u00a350 each, picked up from a local ticket shop, with under-12s getting in for free. Too broke to afford any sort of overseas holiday, Glastonbury was our version of an annual family sojourn, and a bargain considering what was on offer.Music lovers and former punks, my parents felt at home there primarily for political reasons. As alien as it might appear today in the era of Wayne and Coleen Rooney arriving by private helicopter, Glastonbury was formally the main fundraiser for the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, and widely recognised as a space for anarchist bands and protest, both of which my parents were active in. To me, unaware of the anti-capitalist ethos that historically underpinned it all, it was mainly a land full of pretty colours and loud noises, a sensory dream factory that felt earthy and magical and escapist.It was also terrifying. I was a nervous child at the best of times, but there was something in Glastonbury\u2019s lawless energy that felt particularly disquieting, with every part of it somehow ripe with danger. I remember spending the entirety of REM\u2019s headlining set in 1999 with my eyes locked on the chunky yellow lantern we had bought from Woolworths several weeks earlier, so sure that someone would come along and scoop it up. And that same paranoia permeated my time there over the years. It appeared whenever I ventured into the site\u2019s long drop toilets, erected above enormous communal pits holding a festivals\u2019 worth of human waste, with seats wide enough that I felt constantly at risk of falling in. And the tents in which we rested were natural incubators for childhood fear; I was certain that they would be unzipped and rifled through by maniacs, likely when we were sleeping. And that was only if they hadn\u2019t been stolen altogether while we were out exploring. Every walk back from one stage or another was buoyed by a persistent feeling of dread. I\u2019d be certain that we\u2019d return to a gaping patch of grass where our makeshift home used to be, the tent having been pilfered by some imagined criminal hippie.The irony of it all is that Glastonbury has long been safe for kids. Certainly it is now, having become about as dangerous as your average Hay Festival. But even 25 years ago and in the last gasps of its more unpredictable youth, where the only newspaper headlines Glastonbury regularly spawned involved criminality and overdoses, it was always strictly PG unless you went out of your way to look for the badness. And for the children there, many of us being exposed for the first time to alternative lifestyles or individuals under the influence, it served as an unparalleled education.RecommendedGlastonbury 2022: Full lineup and set timesMusic festivals have saved me so many timesFestivals are a kind of magic trick \u2013 a surreal joy full of glitter, hangovers and heartbreakFreelance arts worker and PhD student Megan Vaughan regularly went to Glastonbury with her dad throughout the Nineties, and remembers a specific moment from one of their first trips there. \u201cIt started raining one afternoon and everyone obviously ran for shelter under the nearest tree or marquee,\u201d she recalls. \u201cBut there were a group of people who stayed dancing in the rain outside a burger van, and I remember my dad stopping me and pointing out that those people were \u201con drugs\u201d.\n\nMy parents skipped this really big band they loved so that 12-year-old me could see Jessie J\u201cI threw more awkward questions at him in those four days every summer than at any other time in his life as a father. I was hearing new terminology for different kinds of drugs, new swear words and new sexual references \u2013 I had certainly never encountered anything like that back in Macclesfield. I guess I was very lucky that I had a cool dad who was ready to answer those difficult questions in an adult way for me.\u201dOne of the odd side effects of the Glastonbury experience for a child is that sudden dissolving of shame, where sights or words that we recognise, consciously or not, as \u201cadult things\u201d suddenly become less frightening or at least OK to be talked about. It\u2019s likely a product of so much forced intimacy \u2013 we\u2019ve already seen each other caked in mud, and heard the neighbours in the next-door tent make noises that no four-year-old should ever hear, so what difference would an awkward question make?And it applies to the music, too. The acts I have vivid memories of seeing as a kid are often of the more commercial Top of the Pops variety, purely because those were the big pop anthems I unashamedly loved as a kid. I have absolutely no memory of seeing Johnny Cash on the Pyramid Stage in 1994, which my mum always insists that I witnessed, but I sure as hell remember sitting on my dad\u2019s shoulders while Heather Small sang \u201cMoving on Up\u201d the day before. And while any self-respecting six-year-old can lose their minds to Hole\u2019s \u201cCelebrity Skin\u201d and I might tell people that my highlight of 1999\u2019s festival was seeing Hollywood-glam-phase Courtney Love sing \u201cMalibu\u201d while Melissa Auf der Maur wafted away behind her, I can\u2019t deny that I was mostly hyped for The Corrs that year. But being a child at Glastonbury also means a brilliant absence of good taste, with no awareness of what it means to be cool or the importance of being seen at the right places.Enjoy unlimited access to 70 million ad-free songs and podcasts with Amazon MusicSign up now for a 30-day free trialSign upEnjoy unlimited access to 70 million ad-free songs and podcasts with Amazon MusicSign up now for a 30-day free trialSign up\u201cWe used to print off a clash list and highlight what we all wanted to see and compare what sacrifices we had to make,\u201d recalls film journalist Millicent Thomas, who went to Glastonbury three times with her parents between the ages of 11 and 13. \u201cBecause obviously they couldn\u2019t let me just go off and see the bands I wanted to see. I can\u2019t remember who it was they skipped, but I remember they were really gutted about it because they skipped this really big band they loved so that 12-year-old me could see Jessie J. I feel so bad looking back on it.\u201dMillicent, aged 11, with her dad at Glastonbury 2011  (Millicent Thomas)Most of all, childhood is the best way to spot just how transformative Glastonbury can be, its excess and noise not only creating a vast new world unlike anything you\u2019ve seen before, but shifting how you see yourself.Glastonbury threw me into a state somewhere between childhood and adulthood. I had never felt more young, nor more aware of my physical size, but I also remember feeling oddly defiant and assertive. Glastonbury was terrifying in its loose recklessness, but not so much that I didn\u2019t feel like it could bend to my will if I thought hard enough. Here was a space where typical rules didn\u2019t apply, where my parents wouldn\u2019t be as firm or as protective as they were at home, I thought. I recall being genuinely hurt that they refused to let me see Scream 2 at the festival\u2019s cinema tent in 1998, as if merely being at Glastonbury meant it would be OK for a six-year-old to watch.And it\u2019s a strange power that feeds into why I\u2019m in no rush to go back. Those years were so formative that the idea of returning would feel like the worst kind of nostalgia, with its inevitable disappointment and awareness of the changes that have occurred. And where once speculation that Kate Moss had been spotted walking around the campground was written off as an unlikely rumour, the festival is now so bombarded with celebrities, gourmet food trucks and luxury tents that there\u2019s little chance of it feeling the same.Millicent agrees. \u201cI can\u2019t see myself wanting to go again,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are different kinds of crowds that go now, and it\u2019s got a lot bigger \u2013 I just don\u2019t think I could manage it. I think I\u2019d be very anxious there now.\u201dA far younger Adam White, aged around 2 or 3, at an early 1990s Glastonbury (Adam White)But Glastonbury still lingers in other ways, regardless of how alien it is to me today. I still get a nostalgic rush from seeing a truly pitch-black night sky unburdened by street lights or buildings, throwing me back to seeing it for the first time in Pilton, and the acts I remember enjoying back then are still in semi-regular rotation on my phone.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeI wasn\u2019t conceived at Glastonbury, but for the first decade of my life I may as well have been. I was, in many respects, a Glastonbury baby. Born and raised in nearby Bristol, I first visited in 1994, aged two with potty in hand, and attended for the five years that followed. I have not been back since. But even if Glastonbury has changed hugely in the decades in between, it still exists as a joyous, creative paradise of jugglers, acrobats and enormous fire-breathing spiders for those lucky enough to experience it as a child. Enough to grant it an almost mythical hold over many of the children who have passed through over the years, like a soothing imprinton the soul.Back then, against the withering judgements of outraged co-workers, my parents saw it as an adventure and an education, for themselves and for me. My dad sometimes worked there as a steward, picking up litter and ushering in guests in exchange for a free ticket. But the tickets themselves were also relatively affordable \u2013 around \u00a350 each, picked up from a local ticket shop, with under-12s getting in for free. Too broke to afford any sort of overseas holiday, Glastonbury was our version of an annual family sojourn, and a bargain considering what was on offer.Music lovers and former punks, my parents felt at home there primarily for political reasons. As alien as it might appear today in the era of Wayne and Coleen Rooney arriving by private helicopter, Glastonbury was formally the main fundraiser for the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, and widely recognised as a space for anarchist bands and protest, both of which my parents were active in. To me, unaware of the anti-capitalist ethos that historically underpinned it all, it was mainly a land full of pretty colours and loud noises, a sensory dream factory that felt earthy and magical and escapist.It was also terrifying. I was a nervous child at the best of times, but there was something in Glastonbury\u2019s lawless energy that felt particularly disquieting, with every part of it somehow ripe with danger. I remember spending the entirety of REM\u2019s headlining set in 1999 with my eyes locked on the chunky yellow lantern we had bought from Woolworths several weeks earlier, so sure that someone would come along and scoop it up. And that same paranoia permeated my time there over the years. It appeared whenever I ventured into the site\u2019s long drop toilets, erected above enormous communal pits holding a festivals\u2019 worth of human waste, with seats wide enough that I felt constantly at risk of falling in. And the tents in which we rested were natural incubators for childhood fear; I was certain that they would be unzipped and rifled through by maniacs, likely when we were sleeping. And that was only if they hadn\u2019t been stolen altogether while we were out exploring. Every walk back from one stage or another was buoyed by a persistent feeling of dread. I\u2019d be certain that we\u2019d return to a gaping patch of grass where our makeshift home used to be, the tent having been pilfered by some imagined criminal hippie.The irony of it all is that Glastonbury has long been safe for kids. Certainly it is now, having become about as dangerous as your average Hay Festival. But even 25 years ago and in the last gasps of its more unpredictable youth, where the only newspaper headlines Glastonbury regularly spawned involved criminality and overdoses, it was always strictly PG unless you went out of your way to look for the badness. And for the children there, many of us being exposed for the first time to alternative lifestyles or individuals under the influence, it served as an unparalleled education.RecommendedGlastonbury 2022: Full lineup and set timesMusic festivals have saved me so many timesFestivals are a kind of magic trick \u2013 a surreal joy full of glitter, hangovers and heartbreakFreelance arts worker and PhD student Megan Vaughan regularly went to Glastonbury with her dad throughout the Nineties, and remembers a specific moment from one of their first trips there. \u201cIt started raining one afternoon and everyone obviously ran for shelter under the nearest tree or marquee,\u201d she recalls. \u201cBut there were a group of people who stayed dancing in the rain outside a burger van, and I remember my dad stopping me and pointing out that those people were \u201con drugs\u201d.\n\nMy parents skipped this really big band they loved so that 12-year-old me could see Jessie J\u201cI threw more awkward questions at him in those four days every summer than at any other time in his life as a father. I was hearing new terminology for different kinds of drugs, new swear words and new sexual references \u2013 I had certainly never encountered anything like that back in Macclesfield. I guess I was very lucky that I had a cool dad who was ready to answer those difficult questions in an adult way for me.\u201dOne of the odd side effects of the Glastonbury experience for a child is that sudden dissolving of shame, where sights or words that we recognise, consciously or not, as \u201cadult things\u201d suddenly become less frightening or at least OK to be talked about. It\u2019s likely a product of so much forced intimacy \u2013 we\u2019ve already seen each other caked in mud, and heard the neighbours in the next-door tent make noises that no four-year-old should ever hear, so what difference would an awkward question make?And it applies to the music, too. The acts I have vivid memories of seeing as a kid are often of the more commercial Top of the Pops variety, purely because those were the big pop anthems I unashamedly loved as a kid. I have absolutely no memory of seeing Johnny Cash on the Pyramid Stage in 1994, which my mum always insists that I witnessed, but I sure as hell remember sitting on my dad\u2019s shoulders while Heather Small sang \u201cMoving on Up\u201d the day before. And while any self-respecting six-year-old can lose their minds to Hole\u2019s \u201cCelebrity Skin\u201d and I might tell people that my highlight of 1999\u2019s festival was seeing Hollywood-glam-phase Courtney Love sing \u201cMalibu\u201d while Melissa Auf der Maur wafted away behind her, I can\u2019t deny that I was mostly hyped for The Corrs that year. But being a child at Glastonbury also means a brilliant absence of good taste, with no awareness of what it means to be cool or the importance of being seen at the right places.Enjoy unlimited access to 70 million ad-free songs and podcasts with Amazon MusicSign up now for a 30-day free trialSign upEnjoy unlimited access to 70 million ad-free songs and podcasts with Amazon MusicSign up now for a 30-day free trialSign up\u201cWe used to print off a clash list and highlight what we all wanted to see and compare what sacrifices we had to make,\u201d recalls film journalist Millicent Thomas, who went to Glastonbury three times with her parents between the ages of 11 and 13. \u201cBecause obviously they couldn\u2019t let me just go off and see the bands I wanted to see. I can\u2019t remember who it was they skipped, but I remember they were really gutted about it because they skipped this really big band they loved so that 12-year-old me could see Jessie J. I feel so bad looking back on it.\u201dMillicent, aged 11, with her dad at Glastonbury 2011  (Millicent Thomas)Most of all, childhood is the best way to spot just how transformative Glastonbury can be, its excess and noise not only creating a vast new world unlike anything you\u2019ve seen before, but shifting how you see yourself.Glastonbury threw me into a state somewhere between childhood and adulthood. I had never felt more young, nor more aware of my physical size, but I also remember feeling oddly defiant and assertive. Glastonbury was terrifying in its loose recklessness, but not so much that I didn\u2019t feel like it could bend to my will if I thought hard enough. Here was a space where typical rules didn\u2019t apply, where my parents wouldn\u2019t be as firm or as protective as they were at home, I thought. I recall being genuinely hurt that they refused to let me see Scream 2 at the festival\u2019s cinema tent in 1998, as if merely being at Glastonbury meant it would be OK for a six-year-old to watch.And it\u2019s a strange power that feeds into why I\u2019m in no rush to go back. Those years were so formative that the idea of returning would feel like the worst kind of nostalgia, with its inevitable disappointment and awareness of the changes that have occurred. And where once speculation that Kate Moss had been spotted walking around the campground was written off as an unlikely rumour, the festival is now so bombarded with celebrities, gourmet food trucks and luxury tents that there\u2019s little chance of it feeling the same.Millicent agrees. \u201cI can\u2019t see myself wanting to go again,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are different kinds of crowds that go now, and it\u2019s got a lot bigger \u2013 I just don\u2019t think I could manage it. I think I\u2019d be very anxious there now.\u201dA far younger Adam White, aged around 2 or 3, at an early 1990s Glastonbury (Adam White)But Glastonbury still lingers in other ways, regardless of how alien it is to me today. I still get a nostalgic rush from seeing a truly pitch-black night sky unburdened by street lights or buildings, throwing me back to seeing it for the first time in Pilton, and the acts I remember enjoying back then are still in semi-regular rotation on my phone. And that includes, with zero shame, The Corrs.Megan has gone back with friends as an adult, her trips with her dad brought to a close after a year in which she \u201cgot off with a teenage boy a couple of years older than me on the second day and then completely disappeared\u201d.

There\u2019s a raft of new novels to choose from, whether you\u2019re after contemporary, historical or word-of-mouth recommendations.Here are 10 of the best\u20261. Talking At Night by Claire Daverley (Michael Joseph, Jul 6, \u00a314.99)Talking At Night is a generation-spanning romance about opposites Will and Rosie who meet as teenagers and fall in love over secret walks and phone calls. Despite events outside their control driving them apart, their lives come back together at different stages, rekindling that romantic chemistry.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow live2. The Rachel Incident by Caroline O\u2019Donoghue (Virago, Jun 22, \u00a316.99)This novel centres on Rachel and her gay best friend James, who form a close relationship while he tries to help her get closer to an attractive married professor, with complications and emotional turmoil following in their wake. It\u2019s set in Catholic Ireland so there are even more crosses to bear, but it will make you laugh and wince with its depiction of 20-something life, from the author of Promising Young Woman.3. Love, Theoretically by Ali Hazelwood (Sphere, \u00a39.99)A science-backdrop romcom from the author of TikTok hits The Love Hypothesis and Love On The Brain sees a theoretical physicist by day make up her earnings as a fake girlfriend to her clients. All goes swimmingly, until she meets an attractive, arrogant older brother of her favourite client.4. The Situationship by Taylor-Dior Rumble (#Merky Books, Aug 17, \u00a38.99)Contemporary romcom in which a 20-something heroine goes on a dating app and instantly connects with a handsome photographer, who is everything she wants.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe idea for The Quiet Tenant came to me a few years ago, in early 2020. I was living in a house with my husband\u2019s family in upstate New York. I was grateful to be there, given the exigencies of our world at the time, but also struck by the disruption we were experiencing. After years of having our routines dictated by our respective commutes and jobs, suddenly, we were spending a lot of time together without reprieve.This got me thinking: what if someone had a dark secret they had been able to keep from their family because they never saw them during the day? And what if, suddenly, they were no longer apart, and the secret they were keeping risked being exposed?I played with a few scenarios, eventually landing on a serial killer who keeps someone captive on his property. But then he must move, and as a result, his captive becomes somewhat adjacent to his life and family. To me, there was something irresistible about this narrative of worlds colliding.Since the serial killer here victimizes women, I wanted to center the narrative on female voices. Telling the story through the voices of three women\u2014my serial killer\u2019s captive (who knows about his crimes), a woman who has a crush on him (who doesn\u2019t), and his teenage daughter (ditto)\u2014felt right.***RecommendedRichard Ford on ageing and literary feuds: \u2018At my age I can\u2019t get into fistfights\u2019The mysterious and beguiling life of Dottie Wellesley Men are now a minority in fiction but we shouldn\u2019t scrap the Women\u2019s PrizeCHAPTER 5The woman in the shedYou wait for dinner, for splashes of tepid water. For anything. Even the groan of zippers being pulled up and down.He doesn\u2019t show.You picture the shed, hidden in the trees. It has to be fall by now. He took away the fan and brought in the heater a couple of weeks ago. You close your eyes. What you remember of this time of the year: short days, the sun setting at six o\u2019clock. Naked branches against the turning sky. What you picture: In the distance, hidden from you, his house. Yellow squares of light at the windows, orange leaves scattered across the yard. Maybe hot tea. Maybe apple cider doughnuts.In the distance, the purr of his truck. He is here, on the property. Living his life. Tending to his needs. Not yours, though. You wait and you wait and still he doesn\u2019t come.You try to meditate the hunger pangs away. You flip through the books he brought you, taken to the shed in no particular order. Stephen King\u2019s It. A tired paperback of A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. Mary Higgins Clark\u2019s Loves Music, Loves to Dance. The books came used. Dog-eared pages, notes in the margins. You asked him one day, a long time ago, if they were his. He shook his head. More trinkets, you figured. Things he took from the ones who weren\u2019t as lucky as you.You squat in a corner of the shed. Without him to bring you the bucket, you have no other choice. He\u2019ll be furious, if he gets back. He\u2019ll wrinkle his nose, throw a bottle of bleach in your direction. Start scrubbing and don\u2019t stop until I can\u2019t smell it anymore.You try not to worry, because worrying gets in the way of staying alive.He has left you before. Not like this, though. Nine months into the first year, the man who kept you in the shed told you he was going somewhere. He brought you the bucket, a box of granola bars, and a pack of small water bottles.\u201cI need to leave,\u201d he said. Not I want. Not I have to. I need.\u201cYou will not,\u201d he said, \u201cdo anything. You will not move. You will not scream. I know you won\u2019t.\u201dHe grabbed you by the shoulders. You felt the urge to wrap your hands around his. To hold on to him, just a little bit. You are Rachel. He found you. All you know is what he has taught you. All you have is what he has given you.He shook you. You allowed the tremor to rock you. \u201cIf you try anything,\u201d he said, \u201cI will find out. And it won\u2019t be good for you. Do you understand?\u201dYou nodded. By then, you knew how to nod so that he\u2019d believe you.He was gone for three days and returned the happiest man on earth. A pep in his step, something like static buzzing through his limbs. He took deep, gluttonous breaths, like the air had never tasted so sweet to him.This wasn\u2019t the man you knew. A man of duties and responsibilities. He did what he came to do to you. Buzzing. A little wild.Then he told you. He didn\u2019t say much. Just that she went along with it. That she was perfect. That she didn\u2019t know, until she knew, but by then it was too late.It happened again. Right before last Thanksgiving. You knew because he brought you leftovers. Has done so every year. You don\u2019t know if he knows that\u2019s how you keep track of time. You suspect he hasn\u2019t thought about it.That\u2019s two, total. Two he killed while he let you live. Two now added to the rule while you remained the exception.Each time he left you, he prepped. This time, he gave you nothing. Did he forget about you? Did he find another project to devote himself to?Without his visits, it\u2019s hard to count the days. You think his truck signals when he leaves in the morning and when he returns at night, but you can\u2019t be sure. Your body tells you when to sleep and when to wake up. Palm against the wall, you try to feel the warmth of the sun and the cold of the night. Based on your estimates, one day goes by, then another.By the end of what feels like day two, your mouth is lined with sandpaper. Bats zoom around your brain. You suck on your fingers to make saliva, lick the wall of the shed in search of condensation, anything to relieve the thirst. Soon you are just a body, a skull and a spine and a pelvis and feet lying flat on the wooden slats, your skin clammy, your breath labored.Maybe he overestimated your resilience. Maybe he\u2019ll kill you without meaning to. He\u2019ll return, open the shed, and find you cold and unresponsive, as you were always meant to be.On what you tell yourself is day three, the padlock rattles. He\u2019s a silhouette in the doorframe, bucket in one hand, a bottle in the other. You should sit up, snatch the water away, unscrew the cap, and drink, drink, drink until the world comes back into focus. But you can\u2019t. He has to come to you, kneel at your side, position the neck of the bottle against your lips.You swallow. Wipe your lips with the back of your hand. He doesn\u2019t look like himself. Most days, he\u2019s a man who takes care of his appearance. Nicks from a manual razor turn up on his cheekbones and down his neck. His hair smells of lemongrass. His teeth are white, his gums healthy. You\u2019ve never seen him do it, but you can tell he flosses assiduously, every morning or every night, a swish of mouthwash to finish the job. But tonight, he looks rough. His beard is unkempt. His gaze bounces, unfocused, from one end of the shed to the other.\u201cFood?\u201dYour voice comes out raspy. He shakes his head no.\u201cShe\u2019s still up. Packing.\u201dYou assume he means his daughter.\u201cSo there\u2019s nothing? Nothing at all?\u201dYou\u2019re pushing your luck, you know, but it\u2019s been three days, and without the thirst numbing your body, you feel it all, the hollowness of hunger below your rib cage, the soreness in your back, a thousand alarm bells pointing to the broken parts of you.He holds up his hands. \u201cWhat? You think I can microwave a TV dinner and walk out the door and she won\u2019t ask any questions?\u201dThe food he brings you is always one part of a whole. A portion of lasagna, a bowl of stew, the center square of a casserole. Meals that can go missing unnoticed. Much more discreet than a slice of pizza, a whole cheeseburger, the leg of a roasted chicken. For all this time he\u2019s been cooking in bulk, squirreling away parts of his dishes and bringing them to you. It\u2019s one of the ways he\u2019s found to keep you a secret.He sits next to you with a groan. You wait for him to pull at the zipper on your jacket, wrap his hands around your neck. Instead, he reaches around his waistband. There is a glimmer, a flash of metal.You recognize the gun. It\u2019s the same one he pointed at you five years ago, a black pistol and the glossy length of a silencer.Your toes twitch as if to prepare for a sprint. The chain tightens, cold and heavy against your ankle. Dragging you down as if to suck you into the ground, first your foot and then the rest of you.Focus. Stay with him.His chest moves up and down, one deep breath after the other. Without the fuzz of dehydration, you read him more clearly. Tired but not weary. Dizzy but not sick. He\u2019s a mess, yes, but he\u2019s happy. Like after an exhausting task, a long run or a steep hike.Like after a kill.He reaches into his pocket and drops something on your lap, a cat offering up a dead mouse.Sunglasses. Designer, judging by the heavy frame and the logo on the side. Entirely worthless inside the shed, but the sunglasses aren\u2019t the point. The point is these used to belong to someone, and she doesn\u2019t need them anymore.You feel it on him now. The triumph. The boundless thrill of a successful hunting trip.She calls out to you. What kind of a job did she have to be able to afford sunglasses like these? What did her fingers look like when she slid them up her nose? Did she ever use them to hold her hair back? Did she wear them one summer afternoon in the passenger seat of a convertible with the top down, loose hair whipping at her cheeks?You can\u2019t go there. You can\u2019t think about her. You do not have time to be shocked or devastated.RecommendedRichard Ford on ageing and literary feuds: \u2018At my age I can\u2019t get into fistfights\u2019The mysterious and beguiling life of Dottie Wellesley Men are now a minority in fiction but we shouldn\u2019t scrap the Women\u2019s PrizeThis is a chance.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeA festival on the Tuscan coast sounds like a dream. The idyllic town of Camaiore, just a 30-minute drive from Pisa, provides a lush backdrop for La Prima Estate, a festival still very much in its infancy. (The first-ever edition took place last year). The sandy coast of Versilia stretches for miles to the west of Camaiore, while the Apuan Alps hug the city towards the east. It\u2019s hot, dry and salty; the glittering sea beckons.It\u2019s the right place for a festival that bills itself as \u201cmore than a music festival\u2026 a holiday experience\u201d. Last year, La Prima Estate took place over six consecutive days, bringing in big names including The National, Bonobo, Duran Duran, Anderson Paak, and Jamie xx. This year, the organisers have split the festival over two weekends in an attempt to draw more long-weekenders. Nas and Bon Iver headline the first weekend, with Alt-J, Jamiroquai and Metro Boomin fronting the second. Other artists on the line-up include Japanese Breakfast, Kings of Convenience, Chet Faker, and Bicep, as well as a smattering of Italian bands and DJs.The stage is set in the Bussola Domani park, an expansive green space that had been a cornerstone for live music in the Seventies and Eighties. Given the organisers\u2019 experience with the month-long Lucca Summer Festival, one of the most anticipated events in Italy, the excellent sound quality and staging is hardly surprising. The music on offer is faultless, from Nas\u2019 fiery 90-minute performance to Bon Iver\u2019s emotional rendition of \u201cSkinny Love\u201d, which prompted tears from some of the audience. Norwegian indie darlings Kings of Convenience put on a standout show, taking the crowd from twee acoustic singalongs to a mass dance party with their fan favourite \u201cI\u2019d Rather Dance With You\u201d.RecommendedGlastonbury has abandoned its roots, and it desperately needs them backPrimavera Sound 2023 Porto, review: The star power of Blur, Kendrick and Rosalia trumps a weekend of dreadful weatherThe 11 best music festivals in the UK for 2023But there is something missing. La Prima Estate hopes to differentiate itself by offering experiences beyond the music (the site advertises day activities from \u201cart to sport, to food and wine\u201d) but in reality, these are few and far between. Sure, festival-goers can book into a 9am yoga class or a 10am surf lesson, but these aren\u2019t particularly special or interesting activities \u2013 particularly given it\u2019s a calm sea with no waves in sight to actually surf. One activity that did stand out was a three-hour cycle around the Versilia hinterland with Italian professional cyclist Manuel Quinziato. Be warned, though: this specific offering only appeals to those in tip-top physical shape. Bon Iver plays La Prima Estate 2023 in Lido di Camaiore (La Prima Estate)Where are the cooking lessons? Where are the wine and craft beer tastings? Even an excursion into the mountains would have gone down a treat, or simply a guided walking tour around the historic sites of Camaiore. These are activities that would have helped La Prima Estate fulfill the \u201choliday\u201d part of their \u201cfestival-holiday hybrid\u201d promise. There are some special moments \u2013 the fact that attendees can book a special lunch at a partner restaurant is a nice touch, as is the opportunity to speak with leading figures in the music industry \u2013 but most of the incredible experiences and activities La Prima Estate had advertised turn out to be non-existent. The festival leans heavily on its musical attractions \u2013\u00a0which makes sense given how the experiential elements of the event are in need of some refining. La Prima Estate 2023 showcases the festival\u2019s ability to attract brilliant artists and put on some seriously stellar shows but if it wants to be seen on the same level as say, the UK\u2019s Wilderness festival, then the organisers have a long way to go. The vibes of Camaiore are immaculate, and La Prima Estate would do well to make full use of its incredible location if it wants to, as it says, show the world that it\u2019s \u201cone of the big boys\u201d on the festival circuit.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe smell of BBQ and leather hangs in the air. All around, you hear the strum of banjos, the swoop of fiddles, and the occassional thud of an axe splintering wood. A mustachioed man with a microphone announces that a chili-eating contest is about to begin on the Live Fire stage. This is Black Deer Festival, the UK\u2019s annual celebration of country and Americana music.Far from your bogstandard tailgate party, Black Deer is a decidedly genteel affair that begins with a stroll through a flower-filled meadow in Eridge Park (the oldest deer park in Britain) and down to the main festival site. Dust kicks up underfoot as punters amble across the sun-beaten grass, hauling those cursed fold-out chairs (one of the few blights on an otherwise perfect weekend) and their kids in four-wheeled carts. It\u2019s Stetsons as far as the eye can see, along with neckerchiefs, cowboy boots and denim cut-offs.You don\u2019t have to throw on a fringed leather jacket to get into the mood, though. That\u2019s what the music is for. And the festival\u2019s curators have outdone themselves this year. Kelly Jones of Stereophonics fame sounds right at home with Far From Saints, his folk/Americana project with Ohio-based singer Patty Lynn and musician Dwight Baker. Meanwhile, US singer-songwriter Kurt Vile and his band kick back with some hazy stoner rock. After the sun goes down, Nathaniel Rateliff & the Night Sweats raise merry hell with their full-throated, foot-stomping blues.A smattering of rain on Saturday fails to dampen spirits. Thunderstorms have been threatening all weekend, but the drizzle stops right in time for recent Grammy-winner Bonnie Raitt, who takes command of the stage like the seasoned pro she is. Perhaps it\u2019s unusual to follow up with a rock band as your headliner, but no one seems to mind when The Pretenders get everyone dancing to \u201cDon\u2019t Get Me Wrong\u201d and \u201cBack on the Chain Gang\u201d.The last day of Black Deer opens to blazing sunshine, brunch and a stirring gospel choir belting out Bob Marley\u2019s \u201cOne Love\u201d. The afternoon, however, is a different story. Ominous storm clouds gather overhead; the firepit in the VIP bar is swiftly extinguished. Suddenly, the field seems empty compared to the buzzing crowds of yesterday.

The son of everyone\u2019s favourite outlaw, Willie Nelson, washes away any \u201cnepo baby\u201d accusations with one of the best sets of the weekend. He kicks back on \u201cMore Than Friends\u201d, his sweetly tempered single with Nashville\u2019s Lainey Wilson, before taking on the swampy swing and grind of \u201cFour Letter Word\u201d. Together, they rival the tempestuous weather with \u201cSomething Real\u201d, an exhilarating blast of thundering guitars and thrashing drums. Steve Earle, one of the greatest living songwriters, deserves a bigger crowd for his acoustic set. Bearded, bespectacled and banjo\u2019d, he cuts a lonely figure but doesn\u2019t seem to mind being without his band, The Dukes. \u201cThat was crap,\u201d he growls to his audience. \u201cYou gotta sing better than that.\u201d They do their best, chanting back at him for \u201cThe Galway Girl\u201d and \u201cCopperhead\u201d. He seems satisfied as he makes way for Sheffield\u2019s Johnny Cash, Richard Hawley, who closes the main stage with a rousing set of career highlights. For one weekend, it feels as though country music\u2019s finest aren\u2019t in Nashville, Tennessee, but right here in Tunbridge Wells, Kent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeOne of the standout islands in Indonesia\u2019s vast archipelago when it comes to tourism, Bali has become synonymous with beautifully varied landscapes, unique heritage and paradise-like beaches. The southern province, sandwiched in between Java (home to the capital, Jakarta) and Lombok, only began to attract larger numbers of tourists in the middle of the 20th century, but the industry has grown substantially even over the last decade.Data from Statista shows that the number of foreign tourist arrivals rose from just under two million in 2008 to over six million in 2019, before the pandemic drastically reduced accessibility until last year. But the so-called \u201cIsland of Gods\u201d is already bouncing back, and with such a dizzying variety of towns, diverse geography and rich cultural history, it\u2019s easy to see why. Whether sunning yourself on idyllic beaches, exploring lush rice terraces and rainforest resorts or discovering the island\u2019s religious and cultural heritage, here\u2019s our pick of places to stay on this holiday favourite. RecommendedTourists could be banned from Bali\u2019s mountains due to bad behaviourTourist denied entry to Bali over tiny passport errorThe ultimate Bali travel guideCOMO Uma Ubud, UbudThe Tegallalang rice terraces are found just north of Ubud (Getty Images/iStockphoto)Rice terraces, temples and rainforest adorn the serene area of Ubud in the uplands of Bali. Known as one of the island\u2019s cultural centres, the town itself is famous for its range of traditional markets, galleries and a vibrant arts scene. The inland surroundings are characterised by rainforest and raised rice terraces, through which visitors can hike and cycle surrounded by greenery. The scenic views of locations like the Tegalallang rice terraces or Tegenungan waterfall are complemented several manmade attractions. Among them are the Saraswati Temple and Ubud Palace, surrounded by tall trees and giant lotus ponds. COMO Uma Ubud is found right in the middle of one such area of rainforest, surrounded on all sides by trees, plants and wildlife. Overlooking Tjampuhan Valley, the large pool serves as a focal point for the hotel \u2013 though several room options offer private pools \u2013 with a large, Balinese-style pavilion hut housing the main reception area. With spacious, open-plan rooms featuring sleek contemporary decor, COMO Uma offers a mix of modern luxury and secluded Balinese nature. The Slow, Canggu A coastal town near the southern tip of the island, Canggu is more cosmopolitan and party-focused than Ubud, with its surfing and buzzy nightlife scene a world away from the laid-back tranquility of the latter. The beaches are picture perfect \u2013 from Echo Beach to Batu Bolong \u2013 and offer surfing, swimming and relaxation in the day and several beach clubs by night. They\u2019re also near Tanah Lot, a popular rock formation, temple and tourist attraction). The streets are lined with trendy bars, cafes and restaurants dishing up a range of cuisines. While the coastal beauty steals the show, inland there is much of the tropical beauty of places like Ubud, with the rice paddies at Pererenan among some of the most famed on the island. Just five minutes away from the town\u2019s closest amenities, The Slow has several suites with their own private pools, surrounded by nature in small, exclusive complexes. The interiors are laid-back chic, with bare stone walls and concrete floors complemented by natural colours and contemporary art. With plenty of indoor and outdoor space, it\u2019s a mini-retreat among the hustle and bustle of Canggu.

It has become one of the island\u2019s famous diving spots due to presence of the wreck of the USAT Liberty, an American cargo ship that was sunk during the Second World War. The general area is home to dozens of coral reefs and different marine species, from turtles to reef sharks.Diving (and related activities) are certainly the most popular thing to do on this part of the island, but the area itself is not short on natural beauty. Imposing mountains and scenic beaches are plentiful, with several of the latter covered in black stones due to previous volcanic activity from Mount Agung, the island\u2019s most sacred mountain. The town itself has a more calm, laid-back style than Bali\u2019s tourist hotspots, making it a great spot for sampling a more authentic experience of Balinese culture. Relax Bali combines breathtaking coastal views with several diving courses and tour packages. The bungalows and villas are spacious and traditional in style (some have their own private pools), while the restaurant, pool and terrace areas have incredible sea views.

It\u2019s a place where the VIP with an extra V come to get away from it, but the beaches are still public, so the slower pace will suit families as well as holidaymakers looking for a little more paradise than party.The Laguna Resort & Spa, part of Marriott\u2019s Luxury Collection, is just about to complete a year-long renovation that covered its 287 rooms, suites and villas, as well as its restaurants and other facilities.

From July, there will also be the new beachfront Arwana restaurant, where cocktails and fresh seafood will keep you content during the most languorous days in the sun. Contribution by Benjamin Parker.Potato Head Suites & Studios, SeminyakThe pool at Potato Head Suites (Purple PR)Seminyak is another beach resort on the south of the island, not far from Canggu and with much of the same attraction for potential visitors. With white sands and azure waters, beaches such as Seminyak Beach, Double Six, and Petitenget stand out (and also offer great opportunities for snorkelling, diving and surfing), though Seminyak\u2019s location means that trips to other hotspots are also easy. Another location that comes alive after dark, Seminyak is also one of the island\u2019s most popular nightlife spots, with an array of beach clubs, bars and restaurants. Those who enjoy a bit of shopping during their trips abroad can also explore local crafts markets and high street stores. Potato Head Suites sits just a few steps from Batu Belig beach (and close to several others), with a swimming pool overlooking the coastline. Its restaurant serves a mix of Indonesian, Mediterranean and Italian food (with options for Asian and American-style breakfasts), and features a terrace that also capitalises on the impressive views. Rooms are modern yet simple, with stone walls, large floor-to-ceiling windows and a mix of tiled and wooden flooring accompanied by local touches such as hammocks or thatched chairs. Six Senses Uluwatu, Uluwatu A villa at Six Senses Uluwatu (Six Senses )The Uluwatu region is located on the southwestern tip of Bali, on a coastline that is equally as famous for its rugged, towering cliffs as it is its beautiful beaches. The famous Uluwatu Temple is perched on one such limestone cliff, with spectacular sunset views over the Indian Ocean. Another popular surfing destination, Uluwatu has several pristine beaches, including Padang Padang, Dreamland and Bingin, where relaxation and sunbathing are just as easy as catching waves. There\u2019s an emphasis on relaxation and cultural exploration rather than nightlife and partying in this area. Aside from the Temple, visitors can see local Kecak dance performances and find locally made souvenirs in traditional arts and crafts markets. The area is also known for its range of high-end accommodation that makes excellent use of cliffside locations. Six Senses Uluwatu is one such hotel, with a cliffside spot boasting dramatic ocean views. Its own pool sits excitingly close to the edge, while several accommodation options have excellent views from their balconies, terraces and private pools. Its two restaurants serve an eclectic mix of Indonesian, Peruvian and Japanese cuisine, with a spa, sauna and 24-hour gym to visit between meals. If you\u2019re still craving being at sea level, there are several beaches within a mile of the hotel. The Samata by LifestyleRetreats, SanurThe gym building and pool at The Samata (The Samata Sanur )Unlike its other southern counterparts, Sanur (on the southeast of the island) has engineered a reputation as a relaxed, calm alternative to places such as Canggu or Seminyak. Popular with families and expats, the area has a slower pace of life, with a large range of independent bars and restaurants (read: not owned by resorts), as well as places to stay. Jl Danau Tamblingan is the main street, and while you will find resorts and upmarket bars here, there\u2019s a variety of more laid-back options. The white sands and clear waters are also popular with families due to the lack of high waves or strong currents thanks to the coral reefs, with Sanur, Cemara and Karang among the best beaches. Many of them also have a promenade, so walking and cycling (especially at sunrise) are recommended activities. The calm waters are also perfect for a number of water sports. The Samata is found near one such bit of Sanur coastline, with a postcard-worthy setting of lush greenery and rice fields that sit next to the ocean. Situated on the outskirts of town, the hotel has an on-site restaurant that serves international and Indonesian cuisine. Rooms here range from suites to two-bedroom villas with a private pool. Suites are more simple, with an industrial feel to them, while villas come with contemporary, large, tiled rooms to go with a private patio and terrace \u2013 and all for a price that\u2019s much more affordable than much of the rest of the island.

A herd of antelope disappears into the horizon: first chased by the thick dust cloud of their own doing, and then by three cowboys on horseback with revolvers. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to tell you that those cowboys have made it onto the train,\u201d announces our conductor, as the town marshal rushes through the carriage.Sure enough, those desperadoes would soon skulk from seat to seat, parting unsuspecting passengers from their cash along the way. \u201cGet your hands where I can see \u2019em!\u201d shouts the leader of the Cataract Creek Gang; this is an old fashioned train robbery featuring every darn Wild West cliche imaginable \u2013 except the dynamite, obviously. Butch Cassidy would be proud.I\u2019m travelling on the Grand Canyon Railway, a 65-mile stretch of single track heritage railroad that, until this point, was gently swaying its way between Williams and the Grand Canyon\u2019s South Rim. The cowboys are, of course, part of the act. We all hide dollar bills in creative places \u2013 under hats, between book pages, in hair \u2013 as gratuities for the actors to find.All aboard the Grand Canyon train (Richard Franks)It\u2019s so much of an act that I\u2019d already seen these dastardly bandits and the town marshal before boarding the train, at the 9am-on-the-dot, 364-days-a-year slapstick show in the Williams railway depot\u2019s faux Old West town. The show continues during the journey. The town marshal \u2013 an (actual) authentic marshal, originally from the Netherlands and with seven horses at his private ranch \u2013 teases us by saying a bobcat has been spotted a couple of miles ahead.

Having first operated in 1901 \u2013 to be followed in 1908 by the historic Fray Marcos Hotel and Williams Depot \u2013 passenger services were stopped in 1968 due to the rise in popularity of the motor vehicle. The line would later reopen for passenger service in 1989, followed by the current incarnation of the Fray Marcos Hotel: the Grand Canyon Railway Hotel. By 1993, the railway was carrying 105,000 passengers each year and removing 40,000 cars from the road.Read more on rail travel:What it\u2019s like onboard the newest Rocky Mountaineer rail routeA child-friendly train adventure through Spain, France and SwitzerlandLooking to see the real Sri Lanka? Explore by trainAs a knock-on effect of the railroad\u2019s initial closure, Williams experienced major hardship in the 1970s and 1980s and was in danger of becoming a ghost town. To preserve it, in 1984 Downtown Williams was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is now known as a thriving Route 66 stopover, and as the gateway to the Grand Canyon.And over Christmas, Williams turns into something else entirely. The town\u2019s railway boom applies year-round, but from November onwards the town is usually full of people walking around in their pyjamas and slippers \u2013 often in the snow.The traditional train carriages date from the 1950s  (Richard Franks)During the festive season, the Grand Canyon Railway turns into the Polar Express train ride, where staff dress up as characters from the movie and the train\u2019s final destination is its own version of the North Pole. And just like in the movie, everyone gets a hot chocolate and the children receive a sleigh bell gift.This train is clearly big business for Williams; 10 per cent of its residents are directly employed by the railway, with other businesses benefiting from its popularity. The proof is in the pudding: some 200,000 guests ride the famous railway each year, with 50 per cent catching the train during the two-month Polar Express schedule alone.Departing daily at 9.30am, passengers can enjoy a two-hour journey to the Grand Canyon where they then have three hours to explore the compact Historic Village before returning to Williams. I find myself in the super spacious, first-class Yavapai rail car \u2013 built by the Budd Manufacturing Company in 1950 for original use on the Southern Pacific railroad.

I spend a few hours milling around the South Rim, where a lesser-spotted California condor soars above a few moments after my first glimpse of these billion-year-old rocks. I don\u2019t know what I had imagined, but I didn\u2019t expect goosebumps. The midday sun accentuates its vivid rock layers \u2013 a myriad of red, orange, yellow, even green \u2013 as tiny hikers the size of garden ants tackle the Bright Angel Trail far below.The South Rim is peppered with restaurants, taverns, gift shops and galleries \u2013 all of which are easily accessible on foot within the three-hour time frame, which is just about enough time to explore. I head into the famous El Tovar hotel \u2013 whose lobby alone is worth a visit \u2013 for a quick beer in the cocktail lounge. I order a prickly pear IPA, served by bartending stalwart Raymond with a side of dry wit, before heading back to the station.Williams railway depot\u2019s faux Old West town (Richard Franks)The train eventually rolls back into Williams, where I\u2019m greeted by a deep blue sky and the earthy smell of hops emanating from the Grand Canyon Brewery, my next stop.

He said: \u201cOnce again, we find ourselves with no alternative but to take this action. We have continually come to the negotiating table in good faith, seeking to resolve this dispute.\u201cSadly, it is clear from the actions of both the train operating companies and the government that they do not want an end to the dispute.

They rejected a fair and affordable offer without putting it to their members.\u201cTrain companies will work hard to minimise the impact of the overtime ban, but the impact of Aslef\u2019s action will vary across the 16 train operators so customers are advised to check their travel plans before setting off.\u201cWe ask Aslef to recognise the very real financial challenge the industry is facing and work with us to deliver a better railway with a strong long-term future.\u201dThe train operators affected include all the leading long-distance firms:Avanti West CoastCrossCountryEast Midlands RailwayGreat Western RailwayLNERTransPennine ExpressIn addition, the industrial action is designed to affect most commuter links to and from London:ChilternGreater AngliaGTR (Gatwick Express, Great Northern, Southern and Thameslink)SoutheasternSouth Western Railway (including the Island Line)Outside the capital, Northern Trains and West Midlands Trains will be affected.

This is the same as the number listed last year.Many of the beaches, including spots in Alicante, Barcelona and the Canary Islands, are popular with international tourists. In one particularly damning assessment, Calzoa beach in Pontevedra, Galicia, was dubbed the worst dog beach in Spain, with the Black Flag report stating that the country is facing problems with \u201cthe proliferation of designated dog beaches without a prior environmental impact assessment.\u201dOther affected areas include the Basque Country, Andalusia (such as beaches in Malaga and Almeria), and Valencia.RecommendedThe best Malaysia holiday destinations: Where to stay and when to travelBest beaches in Northern Ireland to visit this summerThe best islands in Thailand to visit for holidays for couples, families and moreThe Balearic Islands received a Black Flag due to the proliferation of jet skis, as well as for pollution from parties around Colonia de Sant Jordi, a resort town in south-east coast of Mallorca.More than 10 of the Black Flags issued were due to chemical spills, faulty sanitation and purification problems, while other issues included chemical, noise and light pollution, the accumulation of marine litter, and the urbanisation of the coast, \u201csometimes even invading the maritime-terrestrial public domain\u201d.Ana Aldarias, a spokesperson for Ecologistas en Acci\u00f3n, said: \u201cWe have to emphasise that ecological attacks will continue to occur as long as economic growth prevails over any other criteria and respect for the environment is conspicuous by its absence.

The Mexican revolutionary was apparently offended by the opulence of the venue, with its hand-carved walnut bar shipped from New Orleans, and fired off a few rounds to express his displeasure.I can\u2019t help but think he\u2019d be more supportive of the latest trend shaping Mexico City\u2019s food scene \u2013 a determination to showcase homegrown produce in new, innovative ways. Davide Preziuso, Andaz Mexico City Condesa\u2019s executive chef, is particularly excited about the current passion for sustainable seafood. \u201cI\u2019m trying to show people that it\u2019s not just about salmon and sea bass,\u201d says Davide during a chat on the hotel\u2019s rooftop, with its colourful food truck. \u201cPersonally, I love Mexico\u2019s octopus \u2013 you can fish it without having a massive impact.\u201d This approach has allowed Mexico to showcase its offerings to new audiences. \u201cThe Japanese have started buying our octopus and red tuna,\u201d says Davide. Granted, Japan ordering plane-loads of seafood doesn\u2019t scream sustainability, but it\u2019s a reminder that much of Mexico\u2019s bounty remains untapped.Joe Gelato boasts some seriously niche flavours (Tamara Hinson)Davide believes the Juarez neighbourhood could soon steal Condesa\u2019s crown when it comes to culinary coolness. Until recently, Juarez was the place to buy (mostly stolen) car parts. Shady types who came for pre-loved pistons made it a no-go zone, but a recent influx of entrepreneurs lured by cheap rent kick-started its transformation.

His mezcal gelato is legendary, although agave-based gelato is now standard fare here. Flavours like olive oil, worm salt and sea urchin, all made using fresh ingredients, put him on the map. Sea urchin, apparently, is perfectly suited to Mexico\u2019s stifling summers. \u201cIt\u2019s really refreshing, with hints of seawater,\u201d he says. Other hits include mole gelato \u2013 a tribute to the cocoa-based marinade known as Mexicans\u2019 mother sauce \u2013 and a lollipop sprinkled with chicatanas, protein-rich Mexican flying ants. \u201cIt\u2019s got a wonderful, coffee-like smokiness,\u201d says Jos\u00e9, producing a dead ringer for a Magnum, albeit sprinkled with ants, not almonds. It\u2019s absolutely delicious.Rosetta chef Elena Reygadas (Ana Hop)Another fan of Mexico\u2019s ants is chef Elena\u00a0Reygadas, recently named Latin America\u2019s Best Female by the World\u2019s 50 Best Restaurants organisation. She\u2019s the owner of Rosetta, a restaurant in the Roma neighbourhood. It\u2019s a fitting setting for someone who doesn\u2019t play by the rules \u2013 Roma\u2019s famous for its Art Deco buildings, which contrast sharply with the Baroque architecture dominating the city centre.Like a growing number of Mexican chefs, Elena, whose restaurant is inside a beautifully restored Beaux Arts mansion, returned here after stints abroad \u2013 including one at London\u2019s Locanda Locatelli. Her USP is her passion for highlighting connections between food and the environment, and her Rosetta Notebooks \u2013 musings on subjects such as food security, which diners can purchase for a few pesos \u2013 have become collectables.Rosetta\u2019s most popular items include sourdough topped with a butter made from chicatanas, and beignet-style pastries made with mamey, a cacao pod-shaped fruit. But Elena honed in on a seldom-used part. \u201cMamey pits have an almond flavour, and we use them to make a cream for our pastries.\u201d Other bestsellers include sourdough versions of Mexico\u2019s traditional pan\u00a0dulce pastries. \n\nMexican gastronomy has so many historic influences and they\u2019re still presentElena\u00a0Reygadas, chef\u201cMexican gastronomy has so many historic influences and they\u2019re still present,\u201d says Elena. \u201cYou can still see ancient pre-Hispanic ingredients and techniques, but you\u2019ll also see ingredients which arrived through migration \u2013 with the Lebanese who migrated here, for example. But we\u2019ve definitely become more proud of our roots.\u201dThe drinks scene has experienced a makeover, too. While bars worldwide clamour to stock the latest mezcal brands, at Polanco\u2019s Ticuchi, beverage director Javier Gomez champions lesser-known Mexican spirits. The Not Pimm\u2019s Cup cocktail, for example, is made with pepino (a melon-like fruit) and Liquor de Chile Ancho (a poblano pepper-based spirit), while the CDMX is made with Xtabent\u00fan, an anise-based liquor from Mexico\u2019s Yucatan region.Javier\u2019s favourite brands are ones you\u2019re unlikely to find outside of Mexico, and Ticuchi\u2019s dimly lit, bat cave-like vibe is a nod to an often-overlooked hero of the agave spirits industry. \u201cIn the Zapotec language, ticuchi means bat, which is an important pollinator in the agave industry,\u201d says Javier, who claims Ticuchi\u2019s popularity relies heavily on his army of so-called agave nerds sniffing out lesser-known spirits producers motivated by passion, not pesos.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeA British Airways flight from Singapore to London Heathrow hit such severe turbulence over the Bay of Bengal that the plane had to return to its starting point where possible damage was checked. Several BA cabin crew were injured in the incident in the early hours of 16 June.One newspaper report was headlined: \u201cWe were in freefall for 1,000ft.\u201d That did not happen.But just how dangerous is turbulence \u2013 and is it getting worse? These are the key questions and answers.What happened in this incident?British Airways flight BA12 was flying normally from Singapore to London Heathrow on Friday 16 June across the Bay of Bengal, midway between Sri Lanka and Thailand and about two hours into what was expected to be a 13-hour flight. About 260 passengers were on board.RecommendedLondon-Sydney direct flights a step closer as Qantas reveals \u2018anti-jet lag\u2019 measuresWhy does flight cancellation misery always hit BA at Heathrow and easyJet at Gatwick?British Airways cancels 60 more flights as storm disruption continuesThe Boeing 777-300ER was cruising at a ground speed of 598mph at an altitude of 30,000ft when it encountered severe clear-air turbulence (CAT). While the seat belt signs were on, meaning passengers should all have been strapped in, cabin crew were active.Several members of cabin crew were injured. The captain decided to return to Singapore, which it did at an altitude of 29,000ft; this may account for some of the reports that the aircraft \u201cfell\u201d 1,000 feet, even though it will have been a controlled descent.The plane landed safely just after 3am local time and was checked for structural damage, while medical care was arranged for the injured. The aircraft later positioned (flew without passengers) to its base at London Heathrow. What does British Airways say?\u201cSafety is always our priority and we\u2019re looking after our crew after one of our flights experienced a rare episode of severe turbulence. Our highly trained team on board reassured customers and the aircraft returned to Singapore as a precaution.\u201cWe\u2019ve apologised to customers for the delay to their flight and provided them with hotel accommodation and information on their consumer rights. We\u2019re rebooking customers onto the next available flights with us and other airlines.\u201dThere and back: Flightpath of British Airways flight BA12 from Singapore, which turned back after severe turbulence (Flightradar24)What is clear-air turbulence?The US National Weather Service says: \u201cTurbulence is caused by abrupt, irregular movements of air that create sharp, quick updrafts/downdrafts. These updrafts and downdrafts occur in combinations and move aircraft unexpectedly.\u201dThe Federal Aviation Administration defines clear-air turbulence as \u201csudden severe turbulence occurring in cloudless regions that causes violent buffeting of aircraft \u2026 CAT is especially troublesome because it is often encountered unexpectedly and frequently without visual clues to warn pilots of the hazard.\u201dHow much danger was the aircraft in?The experience was doubtless highly alarming and uncomfortable for passengers, but turbulence at high altitude does not bring down modern commercial jet aircraft.Planes are designed and tested to withstand severe forces, and weather radar is good at avoiding the worst visible turbulence. But injuries on board an aircraft are alarming \u2013 with cabin crew particularly vulnerable.Writing for the British Airline Pilots\u2019 Association (Balpa), former pilot and flight safety specialist Steve Landells says: \u201cThe injuries we see tend to occur when people aren\u2019t strapped in. This may be because the turbulence is encountered without warning but we also see quite a lot of people hurt because they don\u2019t obey the \u2018fasten seat belt\u2019 instructions.How often does this sort of incident happen?One study suggests aircraft encounter severe clear air turbulence at least 790 times a year, which works out at once every 11 hours. But climate researchers say the incidence at a typical point over the North Atlantic increased by 55 per cent between 1979 and 2020.According to Paul Williams, professor of Atmospheric Science in the Department of Meteorology at the University of Reading, a doubling of carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the atmosphere would increase the average amount of severe clear air turbulence at 36,000 feet over the North Atlantic by 149 per cent. As a result, hazardous turbulence on commercial flights could increase to five serious cases a day on average.Environmentalists will say that airline passengers are causing the very problems that they are alarmed about \u2013 since aviation contributes to the amount of carbon in the atmosphere.Should passengers worry if they\u2019re planning a flight?No. You would be extremely unlucky be one of those 790 annual cases; severe turbulence affects only one departure in 50,000. If the science is correct, the numbers will increase \u2013 but only slowly. Passengers should already be taking precautions about the risk of hitting turbulence \u2013 the most basic of which is keeping your seatbelt at least loosely fastened whenever seated. (In any event that is good practice because it means the crew don\u2019t have to wake you up if the seatbelt sign goes on).Steve Landells of Balpa says: \u201cDon\u2019t be tempted to get up when the captain has told you to strap in; we are always talking to the pilots of aircraft ahead of us and, even if it is smooth when we put the signs on, we may know it is going to get bumpy soon.\u201dIn my experience, if the pilot instructs the cabin crew to strap in, you know you\u2019re in for a particularly lively ride.What\u2019s the worst turbulence you have encountered?Both while flying over south-east Europe: a small Airbus flying from Vienna to Cairo, and a very large Airbus flying from London Heathrow to Singapore. On both occasions it was very uncomfortable. I\u2019d liken it to a theme-park ride in which you keep going round and round without a chance to get off.It was made all the most disconcerting because the pilots did not fully explain what was happening and why, and what \u2013 if anything \u2013 they were doing about it. (Neither flight was on British Airways \u2013 the carriers were Austrian Airlines and Singapore Airlines respectively).There have been a lot of storms lately \u2013 what happens if a plane is struck by lightning?Aircraft should be in no danger. Steve Landells of Balpa says: \u201cWhen an aircraft is struck by lightning, the energy within the lightning is kept on the outside of the fuselage either by the metal that the aircraft is made of or, in the case of modern composite materials, by a metal mesh that is built into the skin.\u201cThis allows the lightning to track around the aircraft to a point where it can be discharged into the atmosphere. On occasion, some energy from a lightning strike will not stay on the outside so all electrical components within the aircraft are shielded against lightning and it has been many, many years since lightning caused an airliner to crash.\u201dWhat other sorts of weather changes might impact flying in the future?Storms: already this summer they are causing very large numbers of cancellations, with easyJet grounding around 100 flights to and from London Gatwick on Sunday 18 June alone \u2013 blaming \u201cadverse weather conditions\u201d.RecommendedEasyJet cancels over 100 Gatwick flights, stranding at least 15,000 passengers Good news for rail passengers (at last) as hundreds of fares almost halve overnightAir Defender 23: Nato exercise will divert and delay hundreds of planes each dayHigh winds: these cause problems mostly on take-off or landing. Particularly on crosswind landings, of the sort that happened in February 2022 with Storm Eunice creating some spectacular scenes at Heathrow \u2013 but also causing diversions, with implications for passengers and airlines.Flooding: as we saw at Gatwick over Christmas 2013, when hundreds of flights were cancelled on 24 December. In addition, a number of airports are very close to the sea, and rising sea levels could cause problems \u2013 as could storms that bring waves onto the runway."}, {"_id": "64917c7e51ac331becf3e90a", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/ivf-b2360779.html", "primaryCategory": "Health &amp; Families", "subCategories": "test", "title": "What is egg freezing and how does it work?", "lead": "Here\u2019s what you need to know if you\u2019re considering putting your eggs on ice.", "author": "Lauren Taylor", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 10:07:02", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:30.148065", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-20T10:07:02+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/20/11/20105944-b003c8a1-f1a8-4e08-a24b-634524eedb1a.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Stay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletterStay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeNew figures show a dramatic rise in the number of women deciding to freeze their eggs.A report from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HEFA) found that egg and embryo freezing are now the fastest growing fertility treatments in the UK.Egg freezing and storage saw a 64% rise between 2019 and 2021 \u2013 increasing from 2,576 cycles to 4,215 completed.What is egg freezing?It\u2019s where a woman\u2019s eggs are extracted and frozen immediately for fertilisation at a later date.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveGynaecologist Dr Larisa Corda\u00a0said it\u2019s a \u201cmeans of helping preserve fertility for the future\u201d.Freezing the eggs at the point of extraction means they avoid the decline in quality that\u2019s associated with ageing.\u201cIt essentially means that a woman becomes her own egg donor later in life, when she decides she wishes to have children,\u201d she said.What\u2019s the process?\u201cIt involves the same sort of procedure as the first part of IVF, where a woman takes injections to stimulate her ovaries, to encourage follicles to grow and lead to egg maturation over several days.\u201cAfter that, the eggs are collected via a simple surgical technique using a needle placed into the vagina and then into the ovaries, to aspirate the eggs which are there,\u201d Corda said.The daily injections (usually for eight to 11 days) involved in the first part of the process is to encourage the ovaries to produce more eggs. \u201cThey may be uncomfortable and lead to side-effects like bloating, abdominal pain, nausea, headaches and other hormonal symptoms, such as breast soreness and changes to your mood,\u201d she added.Women are usually put to sleep for the egg retrieval, during which, a long needle is inserted into the vagina to reach the ovaries and remove the fluid in each follicle that contains an egg.\u201cThis is all done under direct ultrasound guidance and normally takes around 30 minutes. You will not feel anything during the procedure, but afterwards, you may have some cramps and a bit of bleeding, which all normally settles down within 24-48 hours.\u201dHow many eggs are usually frozen each time?It really depends how many are produced by the patient at the time. Corda said the number of eggs doesn\u2019t give a good indication on the quality though \u2013 which is only revealed after the eggs are fertilised to create embryos further down the line, when the woman or couple want to try to have a baby.\u201cBecause of this reason, women are advised to freeze between 10-15 eggs, to give themselves a good, reasonable chance. This may involve doing several rounds of egg freezing, but there\u2019s no guarantee of success,\u201d she said.The aim varies depending on the clinic though, and the \u201cnumbers needed when older become much more unpredictable, and it also becomes much harder to get a good number of eggs too\u201d.What\u2019s the success rate?The success rates are dependant on age and the quality of the eggs.\u201cNot surprisingly, the highest live birth rates from previously frozen eggs are shown to come from women who undergo the procedure before they are 30,\u201d she noted.\u201cHowever, the average age at which women freeze their eggs is around 37, with many women closer to 40 by the time they consider doing this.\u201dShe said it\u2019s generally agreed that the best time is before age 36, when most women\u2019s eggs are still a sufficient quality and you\u2019re more likely to use them in the future (as opposed to someone age 25 and more likely to fall pregnant without medical assistance).It\u2019s important to know that some eggs won\u2019t actually make it, even if they were fine at the freezing stage.Dr Suvir Venkataraman, from the Harley Street Fertility Clinic, added: \u201cFor a good prognosis patient, i.e. under 35 with no known fertility issues, roughly 90% of eggs survive freezing and thawing by vitrification.\u201cApproximately 70% of those will be fertilised by good sperm to create embryos. Approximately 50% of those embryos will develop well. And there\u2019s approximately 30% chance of live birth per embryo transferred.\u201dHow much does it cost?The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) estimate the average cost of freezing eggs is \u00a37,000-\u00a38,000 \u2013 including medication, storage costs and the later process of thawing and transferring to the womb. But it varies from clinic to clinic.What else should you consider?Arm yourself with all the facts on the costs, and understand it\u2019s not a guaranteed insurance policy for getting pregnant in the future.RecommendedHow can you save money on your wedding food?Regular napping could be good for brain health, research suggestsDramatic rise in the number of women freezing their eggs\u201cIt\u2019s important to see a fertility specialist to get assessed before considering egg freezing, as the decline in egg number and quality can start much earlier for some women,\u201d Corda said. \u201cIf you\u2019re not sure what clinic to go to, the HFEA website has lots of great and useful information to help you to decide and check out their credentials.\u201cEgg freezing does not offer any guarantees, but for a lot of women, it is the best possible chance of having their own biological children later in life.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64917c7e51ac331becf3e90b", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/royal-family/harry-meghan-dior-deal-rumours-b2360720.html", "primaryCategory": "Royal Family", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Harry and Meghan \u2018Duke and Duchess of Dior\u2019 rumours untrue, report says", "lead": "<p>Speculation over the Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u2019s next business deal has risen since they parted ways with Spotify </p>", "author": "Kate Ng", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 08:54:44", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:30.387210", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-20T08:54:44+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/20/09/newFile-2.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Stay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletterStay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeYou\u2019ve set the date, your family and friends are thrilled, and now it\u2019s all about planning your big day. Naturally, your wedding menu is a key element \u2013 but this is where you really need to do your sums.\u201cPlanning the food and drinks for your wedding can be a daunting task,\u201d says Matthew Shaw, founder and creative director of sauveur. \u201cIt often ends up being one of the largest budget sections and comes with a lot of work.\u201dWhile it\u2019s tempting to cut corners on the catering, Shaw says one of the most important elements at any event is that people are \u201cwell fed, watered and happy \u2013 it\u2019s such a central part to the day\u201d.Wondering how to save money on your wedding catering? Here\u2019s how to tie the knot in style, without blowing the budget\u2026Choose courses wiselyRecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveWhen deciding where to prioritise your spending, Shaw says it\u2019s important to think about this cleverly \u2013 and what the impact will be. If you\u2019re looking to remove courses or options to keep costs in line, his advice is to do this later on in the evening, not near the beginning.\u201cWedding days involve an early start for everyone, not just the couple, and it can be a while before people have something to eat or drink,\u201d notes Shaw.Plentiful canap\u00e9s and a generous dinner are crucial. After that, people will be more forgiving, says Shaw. He points out that desserts, over-sized wedding cakes and cheese stations are all wonderful additions to a wedding celebration, but more likely to be wasted.\u201cA hot and flavoursome late-night snack will often be much more appreciated than a spoonful of dessert after lots of wine with dinner.\u201dThink about the dining formatFrom food stations and casual set-ups to formal seated dinners, all options have their pros and cons.\u201cFor seated dinners, most people consider either a plated or feasting option,\u201d says Shaw. \u201cThere is a belief feasting dinners are often more cost-effective, which is not true.\u201dHe says both options require similar staff and equipment, so consider what atmosphere you want to create. \u201cFeasting is lovely and convivial, but you\u2019ll have to ensure you have space for everything on the tables \u2013 and guests who are happy to get stuck in and share food.\u201dA format which works really well and helps keep costs down is to favour a longer, more substantial drinks reception and canap\u00e9s instead of a starter, says Shaw.\u201cThis gives guests plenty of time to mingle and enjoy lots of delicious canap\u00e9s. You can then seat everyone for the more formal part of the evening, while keeping your dinner shorter.\u201cIf you\u2019re considering removing a course, always stick to two courses at the table, no fewer,\u201d he adds.Time of day countsMichelle Harle, general manager at Newcastle\u2019s Royal Station Hotel, says: \u201cTwilight weddings have seen a surge in demand, as couples are maximising time with their guests and also saving money, which is often used towards a more lavish honeymoon.\u201cBy starting the wedding later in the day, after 3pm or 4pm, guests have time to enjoy more of the journey or time at the venue, so it\u2019s not a rushed start to the day,\u201d Harle suggests. \u201cStarting later in the day also means you can avoid what is sometimes perceived as a formal, longer and sometimes costly wedding breakfast.\u201dAs she points out, guests can go straight into celebration mode with a buffet served in the evening time. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity to invest less money into a more elaborately presented food offering, rather than the traditional set wedding breakfast menu,\u201d she adds.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s a combination of the traditional ceremony, but with a modern twist.\u201dThink seasonal and sustainable menuOf course, what\u2019s on the menu comes into it too. \u201cChoose a menu based around products that are locally grown and in season \u2013 not only is this cost-effective, it\u2019s also beneficial for the environment,\u201d says Holly Congdon, director at Lettice Events.Some caterers (including Lettice Events) offer reduced-price fully plant-based menus to incentivise couples to opt for a more sustainable wedding menu.Rework the wedding cakeRecommendedRegular napping could be good for brain health, research suggestsDramatic rise in the number of women freezing their eggs9 glorious gardens to visit this summer\u201cLook at non-traditional wedding cakes, such as doughnut towers, a croquembouche or cupcakes, as these can provide a cheaper alternative to a traditional tiered cake,\u201d suggests Tracey James-Heyes, wedding co-ordinator at Stoke Place Hotel in Buckinghamshire.\u201cAlternatively, a champagne tower instead of a cake is also a great option \u2013 and will give guests an extra drink to save money at the bar.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64917c7f51ac331becf3e90e", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/love-sex/proposal-etiquette-mistake-engagement-graduation-tiktok-b2360490.html", "primaryCategory": "Love &amp; Sex", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Man sparks debate about engagement etiquette after proposing at girlfriend\u2019s college graduation", "lead": "<p>\u2018One celebration at a time,\u2019 one critic says </p>", "author": "Chelsea Ritschel", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 08:26:02", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:31.164541", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-20T08:26:02+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/19/22/proposal.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Stay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletterStay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThere has been a dramatic rise in the number of women freezing their eggs in the UK, while more single people are now opting for IVF, new figures show.A report from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HEFA) found\u00a0 that more people than ever before are undergoing procedures, with egg and embryo freezing now the fastest growing fertility treatments in the UK.Egg freezing and storage increased from 2,576 cycles in 2019 to 4,215 in 2021 (a 64% rise), while embryo storage also rose.Some experts have said the Covid-19 pandemic had a big impact on the numbers of women wanting to freeze their eggs in the hope of preserving their fertility.\n\nRestrictions on socialising may have prompted some women to think more about their fertile window, and decide to try to increase their reproductive choicesSarah Norcross, Progress Educational TrustRecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveSarah Norcross, director of the Progress Educational Trust, said of the latest data: \u201cThe dramatic rise in the number of egg freezing cycles could be linked to the pandemic.\u201cRestrictions on socialising may have prompted some women to think more about their fertile window, and decide to try to increase their reproductive choices.\u201dThe HFEA data also shows there was a 10% rise in IVF and donor insemination cycles between 2019 and 2021 (around 7,000 more cycles).Meanwhile, the average age at which women have fertility treatment with IVF has risen \u2013 to 36. This compares to an average age of almost 31 for women who conceive naturally.The regulator\u2019s report shows that patients in heterosexual relationships accounted for around 90% of all IVF patients in 2021.Meanwhile, the number of IVF patients in female same-sex relationships increased from 1,649 in 2019 to 2,201 in 2021 (a 33% rise) and single parents rose from 2,001 in 2019 to 2,888 in 2021 (a 44% rise).This means that single patients and patients in female same-sex relationships had the biggest increase in IVF use from 2019 to 2021.When it comes to success in getting pregnant using own eggs, the average overall IVF pregnancy rate using fresh embryos increased from 10% per embryo transferred in 1991 to 29% in 2021.Patients aged 18 to 34 had the highest pregnancy rate per embryo transferred at 41% in 2021.Meanwhile, pregnancy rates per embryo transferred increased from 8% in 1991 to 33% for patients aged 35 to 37, and was 25% for patients aged 38 to 39 in 2021.For patients aged 40 to 42, the pregnancy rate per embryo transferred increased from 6% in 1991 to 16% in 2021.\n\nOur report shows that the average age of IVF patients has increased to 36, around five years older than mothers who get pregnant naturally and these aftershocks could mean that the average age of an IVF patient continues to riseJulia Chain, HFEAFor patients aged 43 to 50, the pregnancy rate per embryo transferred increased from 1% in 1991 to 6% in 2021.Live birth rates per embryo transferred have increased from 7% in 1991 to 25% in 2021 for patients aged 35 to 37 and from 6% in 1991 to 17% in 2021 for patients aged 38 to 39.For those aged 40 to 42, the live birth rate per embryo stands at 10%, but plummets for women aged 43 and over.Meanwhile, the average IVF pregnancy rate using frozen embryo transfers has increased from around 7% in the 1990s to 36% in 2021.The average IVF birth rate using frozen embryo transfers also increased from around 6% in the 1990s to 27% in 2021.Julia Chain, chairwoman of the HFEA, said:\u00a0\u201cOverall, the new HFEA report paints a promising picture. It shows treatment numbers are back at pre-pandemic levels and thanks to improved clinical and laboratory practice, over time pregnancy rates are increasing.\u201cDespite the pandemic being declared officially over, the aftershocks are still being felt as delays across other areas of healthcare prevent some patients accessing fertility services.\u201cOur report shows that the average age of IVF patients has increased to 36, around five years older than mothers who get pregnant naturally and these aftershocks could mean that the average age of an IVF patient continues to rise.\u201cAlthough pregnancy rates have increased, the likelihood of success decreases with age.\u201cFor some patients, this may mean they never get the baby they hoped for and that\u2019s heartbreaking.\u201dRecommended9 glorious gardens to visit this summerHow to keep flying insects out of your home6 hacks for handling the heatwave at a festivalMore patients than ever before are paying privately for IVF.The number of IVF cycles funded by the NHS continued to vary across the UK with an overall 16% decrease to 20,000 cycles in 2021 from around 24,000 in 2019."}, {"_id": "64917c8051ac331becf3e912", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/testosterone-injections-men-ejaculation-b2360294.html", "primaryCategory": "Lifestyle", "subCategories": "test", "title": "I couldn\u2019t climax, so I let \u2018big testosterone\u2019 take me for a ride", "lead": "<p>After being bombarded with adverts for testosterone-checking kits, Oliver Keens embarked on a journey of medical self-discovery</p>", "author": "Oliver Keens", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 08:00:26", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:32.192755", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-20T08:00:26+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/19/16/newFile-1.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Stay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletterStay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThis is a bit intimate, perhaps, but between you and me: a few months ago, out of the blue, I started having problems climaxing during sex. It wasn\u2019t bugging me particularly, but everyone likes a nice conclusive ending to things. I was living healthily and my head seemed happy and uncluttered \u2013 with no obvious signs of stress or anxiety. So I googled around the subject (\u201cI\u2019m having problems coming during sex\u201d, \u201cwhy can\u2019t I ejaculate?\u201d) for about 10 minutes one evening, and then got distracted, moved on and went to bed. From the next day onwards, I was under siege.I started getting repeated adverts for testosterone-checking kits and testosterone supplements on social media and elsewhere online. I initially tittered at the overdramatic stock pictures used to get my attention, often of a man cradling his head in a despairing, woe-is-me pose (it\u2019s treatable, chill dude). But very quickly the adverts seemed to gain momentum. It felt like they were aggressively competing for my attention \u2013 ironic, given that testosterone is regarded as a hormone that exists to encourage cisgender men like me to procreate, by being competitive and aggressive to love rivals.Taken as a treatment (either injections or a gel, which can cost up to around \u00a330 a month), it\u2019s said to help with things beyond sex, such as fatigue. Actor and TV personality Ayda Field revealed in 2018 that her husband Robbie Williams had the testosterone levels of an 80-year-old man, and that injections had freed him from depression. Testosterone exists in small amounts in most women, just as oestrogen exists in small amounts in most men. High levels of oestrogen in men can also cause related sexual issues, but of course I didn\u2019t get any adverts for oestrogen-checking kits. Ultimately, this is about retail, and testosterone has quite an incredible, all-conquering brand \u2013 a fact referenced in the title of philosopher and science writer Cordelia Fine\u2019s 2017 book Testosterone Rex. It\u2019s the Marlboro Red of hormones.I definitely didn\u2019t feel like I had a waning libido, but I couldn\u2019t provide hard data. So, I caved. For the first time ever (OK, second \u2013 damn those irresistible sunset lamps of 2021), an advert on social media \u2013 something cravenly tailored to my intimate needs through a nefarious system of data brokers \u2013 groomed me into being an obedient chump of capitalism.I splashed out around \u00a330 on a testing kit that measured my testosterone levels. It was a simple blood test, much like an STI testing kit. Easy peasy, once you ace how to milk the blood from a fingerprick into a 450mm microtainer. One reason I folded was out of an almost grudging respect for the advert\u2019s tenacity. The sheer force of these ads made me appreciate a very modern truth: someone had gone to great lengths to try to monetise my inability to ejaculate. I don\u2019t know why I was surprised: female friends have told me for ages about being trapped in a loop of adverts for fertility checkers or collagen products.Recommended\u2018Gentlemen\u2019 like Boris Johnson are over. Instead, all hail the true gentI\u2019m a DJ \u2013 I beg you, please stop asking for requestsQueer parents need everyone\u2019s support, not people calling us \u2018breeders\u2019But I also got it done because I was interested in \u2013 apologies for the lofty language \u2013 \u201chaving a conversation\u201d with my testosterone, the way a lot of my peers currently do. No, not men. By and large, men seldom have to think about testosterone \u2013 even during puberty, when testosterone rates shoot up about 30 times higher than previously (and we tend to get 30 times smellier). No, in my head were the small handful of people in my life transitioning from female to male, for whom testosterone arguably means a whole lot more.In the past few years, I\u2019ve casually dated a few people who are transitioning from female to male. I was lucky enough to see small parts of very big journeys, happening to people who were lucky enough to be taking a life-affirming hormone that \u2013 despite the often short supplies \u2013 worked for them really well. \u201cT\u201d, as it\u2019s colloquially known, is a wonder drug.Seeing someone delight in growing hairs in new places, vocal tones lowering \u2013 even sexual behaviours changing \u2013 really exposes you to the power of T. Yes, it can slowly transform a body (it can make fat sit in different places around the body, even in the face) but it can also transform a person\u2019s spirit and soul too. Remember the woe-is-me man from the online adverts \u2013 gender dysphoria tends to create a despair that I suspect that guy could barely conceive of.\u2018I initially tittered at the overdramatic stock pictures used to get my attention, often of a man cradling his head in a despairing, woe-is-me pose\u2019  (iStock)Anyway, with a rather delicious irony, my test result came back and it was quite literally an anticlimax. It turns out I actually have quite a high level of testosterone, thank you very much. I\u2019m absolutely jacked up to the eyeballs with the stuff. It\u2019s a miracle I don\u2019t secrete a natural ooze of testosterone whenever I walk, like a passing slug. Lovely. But what does it mean? And what does it matter?In the realm of malehood, it provokes a rather poised question: does my high testosterone define me as a manly man, even if I was struggling to do the archetypical manly deed? The problem went away, by the way \u2013 upon closer introspection, I realised looking back that I was broke, tired, had family problems and was worried about 77 tiny things that seemed to loom way larger than I\u2019d realised. Having gone through the testing malarkey, I realised how little I care about the idea of testosterone. Nobody should feel anxiety or shame that they sit low or high on a scale of anything, which is the appeal of these adverts. We\u2019re each just our own unique mix of hormones.RecommendedVegan landlord seeks tenants for $5,750 New York apartment.

As the mercury rises, so do those swarms of pests playing havoc with our picnics, outdoor entertaining \u2013 and ultimately zeroing into our homes.Whether they\u2019re targeting our drinks or food, flying insects top our list of unwanted household guests at this time of year.\u201cThe heatwave has brought some glorious sunshine \u2013 and the scorching temperatures mean windows and doors are likely to be wide open to draw in some fresh air,\u201d says Rachael Kiss, marketing manager for Alliance Online.\u201cUnfortunately, flying insects such as flies, mosquitoes, wasps and hornets all seek refuge indoors to escape the heat, which can be incredibly frustrating.\u201dTo help reduce the numbers, check out these handy hacks and recommendations\u2026RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveSet DIY traps\u201cA great hack to remove insects from the home is making DIY traps using what\u2019s already in your cupboards\u201d says Kiss.Fill a small bowl or jar with apple cider vinegar or a combination of dish soap and red wine. Cover the container with plastic wrap and strategically poke small holes into the plastic wrap that will be large enough for flies and other insects to get into.\u201dKiss says the scent will attract insects, and they\u2019ll get trapped when they try to reach the liquid.Use essential oils to deter waspsWasps are notoriously a little trickier to deal with than flies, notes Kiss, but essential oils can do the trick.\u201cPeppermint oil has been shown to be a natural repellent for wasps \u2013 mix a few drops with water in a spray bottle and apply it to entry points, such as doors and windows, where wasps are active,\u201d says Kiss.In the same vein, clove oil, lemon essential oil and eucalyptus oil work too \u2013 and you can go one step further by utilising them in your cleaning routine.\u201cAdd lemon and peppermint essential oils to your homemade cleaners as many flying insects hate these scents,\u201d says Robert Collins, pest control expert for Myjobquote.co.uk.\u201cWiping around kitchen surfaces and windowsills regularly with your fragrant cleaner not only keeps your home clean and smelling fresh, but also repels flies, wasps and hornets.\u201dStrategically place plants and cut flowersSuzie Woolley, head of product for Serenata Flowers, suggests extending your scented trail by using flowers and greenery to deter flying insects.\u201cCut stems you can use to repel bugs include chrysanthemums \u2013 favourites of florists because of the variety of bold colours and longevity of life \u2013 they contain high levels of pyrethrum which is often used in insecticides,\u201d she explains.\u201cYou can also use types of eucalyptus, including lemon eucalyptus, which contain high levels of citronella, known and widely used for its bug-repellent abilities.\u201dWoolley goes on to say potted lavender, peppermint, thyme, etc are also great options as they can easily be moved to open doors and windows in the summer months.Invest in window treatmentsCollins suggests screening open windows and doors, so you can bring in sunlight and ventilate your home without letting flies, wasps and other insects in.\u201cYou can buy mesh screens and chain curtains, but they are not everyone\u2019s cup of tea,\u201d notes Collins. \u201cVoile curtains over the doors, and night and day blinds on the windows, can work just as well \u2013 and look more attractive.\u201dKeep food coveredRecommended6 hacks for handling the heatwave at a festival6 hacks for handling the heatwave at a festivalMeghan \u2018set to sign\u2019 Dior deal: 4 times she\u2019s worn the brand\u201cA simple, but often forgotten, hack in reducing flying insects in the home is to keep food covered!\u201d expllains Kiss.\u201cDuring a heatwave, insects are more attracted to food sources.

Find shade \u2013 anywhere on the siteWhen you see photos and videos of festival sites, it can look pretty exposed to the elements.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow live\u201cAt festivals, seek shade in festival tents or near stages, or by going to bars\u2026 Even take a gazebo to go with your tent [if the festival allows],\u201d says associate medical director of St John Ambulance, David Monk.When out in the field, take an umbrella or parasol if you are worried, Monk explains. And also, consider \u201cwearing light layers and a cap\u201d, he says. \u201cPerhaps take a wet cloth to pop on the back of your neck, or wet the cap and wear it to cool you.\u201d2. Put sun cream everywhere\u201cMake sure you wear a good head covering, at least SPF 30, and reapply regularly, so take it into the festival with you. When you get sweaty, it will need reapplying,\u201d Monk explains.If you are dressing up in wild clothing, \u201capply sun cream before putting it on and reapply it, and make sure you take something to wear when it starts getting cooler\u201d, he explains. \u201cPut sun cream under make-up and glitter, and look at a sun cream spray for your scalp\u201d \u2013 especially important if you don\u2019t want to wear a hat.3. Know what to look out forKnowing the signs of heatstroke and severe burns is vital.The main risks are sunburn, heatstroke and heat exhaustion. \u201cHeat exhaustion is something you can self-treat by drinking lots of water or weak squash and eating salty foods. If you think you have heatstroke, seek help from the medical teams,\u201d Monk says. Signs of heatstroke include not sweating despite being hot and a reduced level of consciousness, he adds.\u201cIf you get burnt, think how bad it is. If it blisters, you feel unwell or are shivering, seek help from the festival medical teams.\u201d They should be fairly easy to find and signposted \u2013 ask around if you can\u2019t see any.However, if it is less severe, just do lots of moisturising and rehydrating, he suggests.4. Drink water and\u00a0know how hydrated you are\u201cDrink alcohol in moderation, and drink water alongside it. When you go to the loo, check how dark your urine is,\u201d Monk suggests. This isn\u2019t always possible in festival toilets, but you might detect darker and more dehydrated urine from its smell.5. Pack the electrolytesWhen you sweat, you lose a lot of electrolytes, like salt.\u201cTake an electrolyte drink with you \u2013 things like sports drinks, or Dioralyte, to replace whatever you lose,\u201d says Monk. \u201cMake sure you\u2019re eating things with salt in, and carbohydrates, to give you energy.\u201d6.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeRegular daytime naps could be good for brain health, new research suggests.Daytime napping could slow the rate at which brains shrink as we age, the study led by researchers at UCL and the University of the Republic in Uruguay found.The researchers hope their findings into the health benefits of sleeping during the day will reduce any stigma that still exists around daytime napping.The study suggests the average difference in brain volume between people programmed to be habitual nappers and those who were not was equivalent to 2.6 to 6.5 years of ageing. Scientists therefore reccommend that a 30 minute nap per day may contribute to slowing down the process of brain shrinkage.Senior author Dr Victoria Garfield, MRC Unit for Lifelong Health & Ageing at UCL, said: \u201cOur findings suggest that, for some people, short daytime naps may be a part of the puzzle that could help preserve the health of the brain as we get older.\u201dRecommendedHow to sleep during hot weather, according to expertsGive it a rest: why afternoon naps can improve memory and alertnessAfternoon naps could improve thinking and memory skills, says new researchThe study, published in the journal Sleep Health, analysed data from people aged 40 to 69.Past research has suggested people who have had a short nap perform better in cognitive tests in the hours afterwards than those who did not nap.The new study looked at whether there was a causal relationship between daytime napping and brain health.Regular daytime naps could be good for brain health, new research suggests (PA Archive)Researchers looked at 97 snippets of DNA thought to determine people\u2019s likelihood of habitual napping.They compared measures of brain health and cognition of people who are more genetically programmed to nap with people who did not have these changes in DNA, using data from 378,932 people from the UK Biobank study.They found that, overall, people predetermined to nap had a larger total brain volume.The genetic variants \u2013 DNA changes \u2013 influencing the likelihood of someone to nap were identified in an earlier study looking at data from 452,633 UK Biobank participants.But the researchers did not find a difference in how well those programmed to be habitual nappers performed on three other measures of brain health and cognitive function.Lead author and PhD candidate Valentina Paz, University of the Republic (Uruguay) and MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing at UCL, said: \u201cThis is the first study to attempt to untangle the causal relationship between habitual daytime napping and cognitive and structural brain outcomes.\u201cBy looking at genes set at birth, Mendelian randomisation avoids confounding factors occurring throughout life that may influence associations between napping and health outcomes.Recommended6 hacks for handling the heatwave at a festivalBruce Willis\u2019 family shares first Father\u2019s Day posts since announcing his dementiaLouis Tomlinson\u2019s sister Phoebe, 19, announces pregnancy on social media\u201cOur study points to a causal link between habitual napping and larger total brain volume.\u201dIt is not yet known whether naps could help prevent diseases like Alzheimer\u2019s, but overall brain health is thought to be important for protecting against dementia."}, {"_id": "64917c8151ac331becf3e919", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/paris-jackson-michael-jackson-fathers-day-b2360165.html", "primaryCategory": "Lifestyle", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Paris Jackson shares rare photo with late dad Michael Jackson to mark Father\u2019s Day", "lead": "<p>The daughter of the music icon does not discuss her father\u2019s legacy publicly often </p>", "author": "Ellie Muir", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 06:47:00", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:33.844598", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-20T06:47:00+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/19/12/paris.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Stay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletterStay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeWith the heatwave stretching on this summer, festival-goers may be worried about handling the hot temperatures.The medical team at the Isle of Wight Festival said they saw fewer heat-related issues than expected, but there has still been a 15% rise in incidents since last year.With Glastonbury temperatures predicted to fall between 21 and 25 degrees, how can you make sure you stay safe?1. Find shade \u2013 anywhere on the siteWhen you see photos and videos of festival sites, it can look pretty exposed to the elements.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow live\u201cAt festivals, seek shade in festival tents or near stages, or by going to bars\u2026 Even take a gazebo to go with your tent [if the festival allows],\u201d says associate medical director of St John Ambulance, David Monk.When out in the field, take an umbrella or parasol if you are worried, Monk explains. And also, consider \u201cwearing light layers and a cap\u201d, he says. \u201cPerhaps take a wet cloth to pop on the back of your neck, or wet the cap and wear it to cool you.\u201d2. Put sun cream everywhere\u201cMake sure you wear a good head covering, at least SPF 30, and reapply regularly, so take it into the festival with you. When you get sweaty, it will need reapplying,\u201d Monk explains.If you are dressing up in wild clothing, \u201capply sun cream before putting it on and reapply it, and make sure you take something to wear when it starts getting cooler\u201d, he explains. \u201cPut sun cream under make-up and glitter, and look at a sun cream spray for your scalp\u201d \u2013 especially important if you don\u2019t want to wear a hat.3. Know what to look out forKnowing the signs of heatstroke and severe burns is vital.The main risks are sunburn, heatstroke and heat exhaustion. \u201cHeat exhaustion is something you can self-treat by drinking lots of water or weak squash, and eating salty foods. If you think you have heatstroke, however, seek help from the medical teams,\u201d Monk says. Signs include not sweating despite being hot, and a reduced level of consciousness, he adds.\u201cIf you get burnt, think how bad it is. If it blisters, you feel unwell or are shivering, seek help from the festival medical teams.\u201d They should be fairly easy to find and signposted \u2013 ask around if you can\u2019t see any.However, if it is less severe, just do lots of moisturising and rehydrating, he suggests.4. Drink water and\u00a0know how hydrated you are\u201cDrink alcohol in moderation, and drink water alongside it. When you go to the loo, check how dark your urine is,\u201d Monk suggests. This isn\u2019t always possible in festival toilets, but you might detect darker and more dehydrated urine from its smell.5. Pack the electrolytesWhen you sweat, you lose a lot of electrolytes, like salt.\u201cTake an electrolyte drink with you \u2013 things like sports drinks, or Dioralyte, to replace whatever you lose,\u201d says Monk. \u201cMake sure you\u2019re eating things with salt in, and carbohydrates, to give you energy.\u201dRecommended6 hacks for handling the heatwave at a festivalMeghan \u2018set to sign\u2019 Dior deal: 4 times she\u2019s worn the brandDesigner JW Anderson wears Irish rugby top on the runway6.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeA 3D model created by a furniture company that allegedly depicts how remote workers will look in 70 years has sparked widespread amusement on social media.Last week, the DailyMail published an article about a \u201cgrotesque\u201d 3D model dubbed \u201cAnna\u201d, which purportedly shows the impacts of working from home on the body.According to the outlet, the model, which was created by office furniture company Furniture At Work, \u201crevealed what home-workers could look like by the year 2100\u201d, with the graphic showing a woman with a hunchback, dark eye bags and wrinkled features, and \u201cclaw-like hands\u201d from years spent working remotely.\u201cAnna displays many physical effects because of consistent use of technology, screen exposure and poor posture, as well as highlighting potential mental health issues,\u201d Furniture at Work said of the model, which was dressed in a pink workout set and which could be seen holding its elbows at a right-degree angle and its hands in a tense, clawed position.In the article, the outlet noted that the furniture company created Anna following \u201cresearch from the University of Leeds, which found that a third of UK home-workers have no dedicated workspace at home\u201d. According to the furniture company, in addition to \u201cscientific research\u201d, it \u201cworked with healthcare experts to reveal what the remote worker of the future could look like\u201d.RecommendedWhat will work look like in 2030?Why Gen Z could be the answer to your workforce woesWoman shocks viewers after revealing she is commuting by plane to internship each weekAs for why Anna\u2019s hands are depicted in the claw-like position, the company said it was meant to show the impact of hours spent with one\u2019s hands curled around a mouse, while Anna\u2019s hunched back is due to time spent working bent over in bed.However, on social media, the exaggerated depiction has largely been met with amusement from viewers, with many suggesting the model is \u201ccorporate propaganda\u201d intended to encourage workers to return to the office.\u201cThis return-to-office propaganda is getting wild,\u201d one person tweeted in response to the article, while another said: \u201cThey are doing anything and everything to get us back into the office.\u201dSomeone else sarcastically claimed that the model was proof the only way to avoid turning into a \u201cmisshapen goblin\u201d was to return to in-office work. \u201cAvoid turning into a misshapen goblin by sitting in a car for an hour to come sit at a desk for eight hours every day. It\u2019s much healthier,\u201d they wrote.Others joked about the differences between in-office workers and remote workers, with one person suggesting that, unlike Anna, those who have returned to the office will \u201cdevelop long, gorgeous, prehensile tails that can easily pluck slightly-expired luna bars from the office kitchen\u201d.The article also inspired various memes, with someone else tweeting: \u201cThis is what remote workers will look like in 2100,\u201d along with a photo of a crab illustration, while another person tweeted a photo of a skeleton along with the caption: \u201cWhat I, a remote worker, will look like by 2100.\u201d\u201cJokes on you, I already look like that,\u201d one person jokingly tweeted, while another said: \u201cAh yes, because using a computer at home is way worse for you than using a computer at the office!!\u201dAccording to someone else, the \u201cmost unrealistic thing about the prediction is that there will still be a recognisable human civilisation in 2100\u201d.The DailyMail\u2019s recent article also prompted many to point out that this isn\u2019t the first time the outlet has published a story about the impacts of work on the body, as it previously published an article about the negative ways in-office work will affect the body. The 2019 article showed a \u201cgrotesque model of how office workers could look in 20 years\u2019 time thanks to hours at their desk\u201d.\u201cLol this is just rehashing this from...Oct 2019. Note the spin\u2026\u201d one person tweeted alongside a screenshot of the article, which included a model named \u201cEmma\u201d.The furniture company\u2019s model also prompted many to defend the idea of remote work, with one person revealing that they are \u201cmore productive\u201d and now enjoy a better work-life balance as a result of working from home.\u201cHmm I\u2019ve lost 20lbs, do yoga daily, am more productive, and my work life balance is 70,000 per cent better since starting remote working,\u201d they wrote. \u201cMust be doing something wrong? Or, ya know, this is some incredible bulls**t propaganda. TBD.\u201dOn Twitter, where the DailyMail\u2019s link to the article has been viewed more than 16.7m times, users have attached a context section to the tweet that reads: \u201cNobody has predicted that this is what home workers will look like by 2100.\u201cThese images were created by an office furniture company \u2018to visualise the effects of not having a proper place to work at home\u2019 and \u2018to reveal what the remote worker of the future could look like\u2019\u201d.The article and the 3D model have since been added to the KnowYourMeme website, a database that defines meme-worthy moments on the internet. \u201cMany commenters chalked \u2018Anna\u2019 up to fearmongering sensationalism on the part of the DailyMail and Furniture at Work, and were much more apt to crack jokes and make memes about the paper\u2019s bleak prognostication than fear for the future of humanity,\u201d the outlet notes.As of 19 June, Furniture at Work\u2019s blog post about \u201cAnna\u201d appears to have been taken down.RecommendedMartha Stewart says America will \u2018go down the drain\u2019 if employees work remotelyWoman sparks debate for refusing to be a bridesmaid in future sister-in-law\u2019s weddingKing Charles tickles Princess Charlotte in sweet Trooping the Colour momentAccording to data from the US Census Bureau, between 2019 and 2021, the number of people primarily working from home tripled from 5.7 per cent (roughly nine million people) to 17.9 per cent (27.6 million people).The Independent has contacted the DailyMail and Furniture at Work for comment."}, {"_id": "64917c8851ac331becf3e932", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/royal-family/king-charles-trooping-the-colour-princess-charlotte-b2360358.html", "primaryCategory": "Royal Family", "subCategories": "test", "title": "King Charles tickles Princess Charlotte in sweet Trooping the Colour moment: \u2018Just being grandad\u2019", "lead": "<p>King Charles III and Princess Charlotte shared sweet interaction on Buckingham Palace balcony at Trooping the Colour  </p>", "author": "Meredith Clark", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 16:22:32", "dateScraped": "2023-06-20 12:16:40.100710", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-19T16:22:32+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/19/17/charles%20tickles%20charlotte.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Stay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletterStay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

However, that doesn\u2019t mean that all Americans will receive a day off from work, as employees in the private sector may or may not get the day off, depending on their employer.RecommendedCinco de Mayo: What is the celebration and why is it significant?Take Our Kids to Work Day turns 30, hopes donations reboundLabor Day meaning: What is it and how did it start?From Memorial Day to Thanksgiving, these are the dates of the 2023 federal holidays.2023 federal holidays:New Year\u2019s Day: Sunday, January 1 (Observed Monday, January 2)Martin Luther King Jr Day: Monday, January 16Presidents\u2019 Day: Monday, February 20Memorial Day: Monday, May 29Juneteenth: Friday, June 16Independence Day: Tuesday, July 4Labor Day: Monday, September 4Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day (also observed as Columbus Day): Monday, October 9Veterans\u2019 Day: Saturday, November 11 (Observed Friday, November 10)Thanksgiving: Thursday, November 23Christmas: Monday, December 25Other important days to note:Valentine\u2019s Day: Tuesday, February 14St Patrick\u2019s Day: Friday, March 17Passover: Thursday, April 6Good Friday: Friday, April 7Easter: Sunday, April 9RecommendedBeauty advent calendars 2021: Our guide to this year\u2019s top treats13 best tech gifts to spoil a gadget geek this Christmas10 best luxury Christmas crackers for dressing up your dining tableMother\u2019s Day: Sunday, May 14Father\u2019s Day: Sunday, June 18"}, {"_id": "64917c8a51ac331becf3e93c", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/strawberry-recipes-salad-eton-mess-b2360120.html", "primaryCategory": "Food and Drink", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Four berry sweet recipes that go beyond strawberries and cream", "lead": "<p>The miserable spring weather has paid off in the form of bigger, juicier and sweeter strawberries.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeBritish strawberry season has finally arrived, albeit a month later than last year\u2019s first harvests due to the unsettled spring weather. A cooler than average April and May means the nation can expect to enjoy bigger, juicier and sweeter strawberries this year due to a slower ripening period. But it\u2019s the iconic summer occasions that mark peak popularity for the British strawberry. The slightly later season this year means British strawberries will be in their prime for Wimbledon, Royal Ascot, the Lord\u2019s Test Match and Henley Royal Regatta.Nick Marston, chairman of British Berry Growers, the industry body that represents 95 per cent of berries supplied to UK supermarkets says: \u201cOur strawberry crop has arrived a little later this year \u2013 but the good news is that they are well worth the wait. Cooler spring weather means that strawberries have ripened a little more slowly which allows them to grow particularly large \u2013 and the recent bright weather has boosted their sugar content ensuring they\u2019re incredibly sweet tasting too.\u201cAdvanced growing techniques now mean we now produce fresh British strawberries from May right through to October. That\u2019s great news for UK shoppers and it means big business for the UK economy too.\u201dRecommendedCan you whip up the perfect burger in just five minutes?These are the viral TikTok recipes you have to make this Father\u2019s DayEddie Huang: \u2018I\u2019ll never eat at BAO London \u2013 I know mine\u2019s better\u2019Despite the UK spending a whopping \u00a3778m on strawberries in the past 12 months, most of us (two-thirds) are storing them all wrong, according to a survey by the group. Marston says: \u201cWhen it comes to storing berries, wash them and pop them in the fridge to keep them fresher for longer. However, remember to take them out a couple of hours before eating so they can warm up to room temperature to release their wonderful natural flavours and sugars.\u201cStoring berries in glass mason jars or airtight containers can also help them last longer. Whilst laying berries on a paper towel to absorb moisture can also help maintain freshness\u201d.They\u2019re not just for covering in chocolate or dipping in cream either. From a superfood salad to a cooling punch, these strawberry recipes make the most of the cream of the British summer fruit crop.

Preheat the oven to 110C (225F)/gas mark \u00bc. Line a large baking sheet with non-stick baking paper.2. Puree the strawberries and raspberries in a liquidiser or food processor then press through a sieve.3. Whisk the egg whites in a large clean dry bowl until they form stiff moist looking peaks and you feel confident that if the bowl was turned upside down the egg whites wouldn\u2019t fall out! Gradually whisk in the sugar a teaspoonful at a time then continue whisking for a minute or two until really thick and glossy.4. Add 2 tablespoons of the berry puree then very briefly mix until marbled. Spoon into a large piping bag fitted with a 1.5cm (\u00be inch) plain piping tube, pipe small rounds on to the lined baking sheet. Bake for 1\u00bc-1\u00bd hours or until the meringues may be easily lifted off the paper. Leave to cool.5. To serve, lightly whip the cream until it forms soft swirls then fold in the fromage frais. Crumble the meringues then layer in jam jars or plastic containers with the remaining berry puree and diced strawberries. Decorate with the raspberries. Add the lids and keep in the fridge until ready to serve or transport to a picnic in a cool bag with a frozen ice block to keep them cold. Serve within 1\u00bd hours or the meringues tend to lose their crunch.Strawberry basil \u00e9clairsA favourite... with a twist  (British Berry Growers)Strawberries and cream get the French treatment, what\u2019s not to love!Makes: 16Prep time: 30 minutes | Cook time: 20 minutesIngredients:50g (2oz) butter, plus a little extra for greasing150ml (\u00bc pint) water65g (2\u00bdoz) plain flour, sifted2 medium eggs\u00bd tsp vanilla extractTo finish:400g (14oz) strawberries, hulled, chopped2 tbsp icing sugar, plus extra sifted icing sugar to decorate3 tbsp fresh chopped basil leaves300ml (\u00bd pint) double creamMethod:1. Preheat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas mark 6. Lightly butter 2 baking sheets and set aside.2. Add the measured butter to a saucepan with the water, heat gently until the butter has melted then bring to the boil. Take off the heat add the flour and stir together then put the pan back on the heat and cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring continuously until the mixture forms a smooth glossy ball that leaves the sides of the pan clean. Cool for 15 minutes.3. Gradually beat in the eggs and vanilla, beating well after each addition until all the eggs have been added and you have a smooth thick paste. If you have a food processor or electric mixer you might like to use this to save time.4. Spoon the choux pastry into a piping bag fitted with a 1cm (\u00bd inch) wide plain piping tube. Pipe 7.5cm (3 inch) long \u00e9clairs, leaving space between them to rise in the oven.5. Bake for 20 minutes until well risen and golden, pierce each \u00e9clair with a small knife so that the steam can escape then transfer to a wire rack to cool.6. Meanwhile mix the strawberries, 2 tablespoons icing sugar and basil together, cover the dish and leave at room temperature.7. About 1 hour before you are ready to serve the \u00e9clairs, slit open the sides with a serrated knife. Whisk the cream until it forms soft peaks then fold in any strawberry juices. Spoon into the \u00e9clairs and top with the strawberries and basil.8. Dust with sifted icing sugar and transfer to a plate and serve.Cook\u2019s tip: Choux pastry isn\u2019t as tricky as you might think to make, the secret is to weigh the ingredients accurately, don\u2019t be over generous with one of the ingredients or the mixture may be too soft to pipe and use either metric or imperial not a mix of both!For chocolate fans: Spoon a little melted white chocolate over the top of the \u00e9clairs instead of adding the icing sugar.Iced berry punchMake this the day before your garden party and chill in the fridge overnight  (British Berry Growers)This can be made in advance and chilled in the fridge overnight.
