Their voices lilt and lift, as their bodies sway. The audience clap, smile and tap their feet.On the surface, there are little signs of the shared trauma they've suffered. But look closer at this joyful scene, and several spectators are weeping. Others hold their heads in their hands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKyiv under attack - latest updates on Ukraine warThe memory of \"28 days of horror\" - when Russian soldiers trapped almost the entire population in a school basement - is still raw.In the middle of their performance, the singers fall silent, their heads bowed to honour those who lost their lives when the Russians took over the village.\"We went in as children and came out as adults. Your values change when you can't eat, sleep or go for a shower,\" says 16-year-old Marina, one of the singers. \"It's hard to forget and hard to remember.\"Back in late February 2022, in the violent first month of war, almost the entire village - with a population of around 400 before the Russian invasion - was held captive below ground in dark, freezing temperatures with little electricity.They were starved of food and water, tormented and tortured by their kidnappers. Ten of them died in captivity, while others spoke of enduring humiliating and brutal conditions where disease and fear ran rampant.Now more than a year after their ordeal, these villagers are about to be the star witnesses in Ukraine's biggest war crimes trial to date which will see 15 Russian soldiers go on trial.Prosecutors believe the case is so strong it could end up in the International Criminal Court.Sky News has been given access to a mass of evidence gathered over more than a year of investigations. Our team has also interviewed more than a dozen survivors and seen the 3D scanners that are being used to recreate the crime scene in forensic detail. \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nA list of names of villagers killed by the Russians\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\nDuring that time, 368 of the villagers including 69 children were kept in appalling, cramped conditions. The 10 who died during their confinement were mainly elderly people who deteriorated due to the unhygienic conditions and lack of sustenance.Corpses lay among the living for hours, sometimes days, until the Russians could be persuaded to bury them.'They deliberately starved us'Valentyna Lohrynchuk was among those held captive. \"How can I describe something like that?,\" she says, with horror in her voice. \"One minute we'd be talking to a granny and then next, we'd realise they were dead. They deliberately starved us. They had food but they didn't give us any.\"Even then when a group of seven was allowed to go to the village cemetery to dig graves for those who had died, within minutes they were shelled from Russian positions. \n\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\n\n\n1:18\n\n\n\n\n\nUkraine war: Inside hostage scene\n\n\n\nThe village priest, Dimetry Yarema, who was conducting the burial prayers, says: \"It was definitely the Russians who shelled us. I feel it was a deliberate tactic to try to kill us or scare us.\"The Ukrainian lawyers will attempt to prove the Russian soldiers violated a string of international laws centring on the treatment of civilians during wartime.These include setting up their military base inside a protected building and using the villagers as human shields to stave off attacks by the Ukrainian military who were fighting to reclaim Yahidne.The 34-year-old prosecutor who has been working non-stop on this case for more than a year is optimistic about the outcome. Serhil Krupko unlocks the safe in his office and shows us some of the vital evidence.War crimes cases, he explains, rest on multiple factors. \"It is necessary to have physical evidence which can prove the individuals were there. As well as witnesses who can identify them.\"The documents Krupo and his team have collected include army files with photographs of the soldiers and all their personal details. He says Ukrainian journalists, who are part of a group called the Reckoning Project, helped gather a stash of evidence.Some of the journalists tracked down Russian sim cards, traced them to Russia and even interviewed some of the soldiers involved who'd returned there.Read more:Ukraine 'probing Russian defences'Iran is helping Russia build drone factory, White House says \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nUkrainian prosecutor, Serhil Krupko, shows Sky News's Alex Crawford some of the evidence in this case\n        \n\n\n\nOn top of that, the prosecutors have more than 300 survivors who were also witnesses to the crimes and have been able to identify the Russian soldiers involved, as well as give detailed accounts about what they did and how they behaved.Villagers regularly unable to stretch or move for 16 hoursIn the windowless basement, villagers were kept confined to separate cell-like rooms, which were all so overcrowded that there was no space to lay down. Many spoke about regularly spending 16 hours straight in a single position, unable to stretch or move.There was limited access to urinate or defecate and they were given buckets to use in the corner of some of the rooms.School teacher, Valentyna Danilova, says she believes it was a deliberate tactic to break them: \"They didn't want us to feel human,\" she says. \"We had no hygiene - we couldn\u2019t even wash our hands the first 10 days.\"Many of the elderly people were terrified to drink very much, she adds, because they feared going to the toilet with little privacy or worse, being forced to urinate where they sat. \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\n'No War' painted on the wall by children \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\nThe walls of the basement still have some paintings drawn by the children and maybe some of the adults. We find the words of the Ukrainian anthem as well as hearts coloured in red and the words \"no war\" inscribed above in big letters.Perhaps the most poignant image though is of a line of stick figures, stark in the simplicity of the drawing but with some of the figures clearly shooting those next to them in the head.Occasionally, the soldiers opened the basement door to let them out to go to the toilet behind the main school building but every time they ventured out from the basement, they risked being shelled in the battle over the village.The Russians told them they had already taken Kyiv and that President Zelenskyy had fled. They even presented their captives with a Russian newspaper detailing this 'news' of the Ukrainian collapse. \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nIvan, the school caretaker, shows the calendar that was marked on the wall\n        \n\n\n\n'None of us expected to leave alive'The teacher, Valantyna, managed to smuggle a bit of charred wood into the basement and started a calendar where she chalked off the days and kept a note of the dead - those who were killed as the Russian troops entered the village and another list of those who died while being held in the underground school rooms.With so little light, they struggled to differentiate between day or night.\"None of us expected to leave alive,\" Valantyna says, \"and there was an understanding among us that one day our children would come and find this place and at least they should know who was here and what happened\".She describes how some of the guards seemed to enjoy tormenting their prisoners. It was freezing cold in the basement, so she asked to collect a blanket for her elderly mother.\"They agreed but the moment I got outside, the soldiers started shooting at my feet. I stumbled and they laughed. It was funny to them.\" \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nMykhailo Shevchenko's son was killed\n        \n\n\n\nSeveral villagers were killed before making it into the basement. Mykhailo Shevchenko said his son Viktor was one of the first killed as the Russian troops entered Yahidne.His death will be investigated too after post-mortems appeared to show he was tied up and tortured before being shot in the head. His body then lay in the garden of his home for more than two weeks.\"Seventeen days he was lying there barefoot and his hands were tied behind his back,\" says Mykhailo.The villagers' hopes have been raised by the guilty verdicts handed out to soldiers involved in terrorising local resident Nadiia Radchenko's family. \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nNadiia Radchenko in front of her husband's grave\n        \n\n\n\nHer husband was killed, her house looted and guns put to their heads. Ukrainian lawmakers sentenced three Russian soldiers to 12 years in prison in absentia.\"It's good to get a verdict,\" Nadiia says, \"but not good they're still walking free because everyone needs to be held accountable and if you deliberately came to attack us, you need to be punished.\"Serhil Krupko, the Ukrainian prosecutor, emphasised to us how important he thinks this case is. \"We believe his case will show how the Russians were using ordinary civilians as human shields,\" he says. \"And our international criminal court partners were very interested in this.\"\n"}, {"_id":

conducting a review to \"determine whether appropriate steps were taken\" before his resignation.Home Secretary Suella Braverman said at the time that she took \"immediate action\" after she was made aware he was the subject of a police investigation and instructed her officials to ask him to resign or face immediate suspension.He is due to appear before magistrates in Hull on 28 June.\n"},

But attendance is mandatory.If children do not go to school their parents can be fined or face up to three months in prison.Already fined thousands of pounds Charlie's dad James has already been fined thousands of pounds because his son has missed so much school.He says he has tried everything, but adds that he believes the curriculum fails to inspire his son, who has ambitions to be a professional boxer. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The way he looks at it, he's doing lessons that he doesn't need for his future plans,\" said James.\"And I do agree with that.

morning, his school uniform is placed at the end of his bed by his nan, Teresa.\n\n\n\nAnd each morning Charlie refuses to put it on.\"I don't like the people, the teachers, the classes or the uniform,\" he tells me.I've come to meet 13-year-old  Charlie, who lives with his nan and father James in Blackpool, to try to understand why he is missing so much school and what is being done about it.Charlie is bright and friendly, with a huge passion for boxing, training regularly at a local gym.\n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nCharlie is a passionate boxer\n        \n\n\n\n\"I think COVID has a lot to do with this,\" says Teresa.\"He didn't want to go back after COVID. He was asking why he couldn't continue learning at home on his computer. I said everyone is getting back to normal.\"An urgent national crisisCharlie is not alone.Since the pandemic, tens of thousands of children have not returned to school. It's an urgent national crisis.And witnessing Charlie's refusal takes us to the heart of that crisis.The latest figures from the Department for Education show that more than 125,000 children were out of school more than in school for the first term of this academic year. That is double the number before the pandemic.To see what is being done about it, Sky News has been given rare access to a special unit whose job it is to make sure children are in school. \n\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\n\n\n2:55\n\n\n\n\n\n A generation missing out on school\n\n\n\nThe Pupil Welfare Service, run by Blackpool Council, works with children who have attendance problems to get them into class.Natasha Armstead, who manages the service, says demand is high.\"I've worked for the council in this area for 23 years now, and this is literally the busiest we've ever been,\" said Natasha.\"We have done just over 5,000 family home visits since September just to address the attendance issue.\"If we can get families talking to us and start to understand the challenges they are facing then we can start to help and make a difference to the child's attendance at school.\"The service has worked with Charlie - liaising with school to arrange a reduced timetable, learning in isolation - steps to coax him back through the gates.The Pupil Welfare Officer working with him says when he's at school he is well behaved and has lots of friends.The law says all school-age children must receive a formal education whether at school, home school, or an alternative provision. But attendance is mandatory.If children do not go to school their parents can be fined or face up to three months in prison.Already fined thousands of pounds Charlie's dad James has already been fined thousands of pounds because his son has missed so much school.He says he has tried everything, but adds that he believes the curriculum fails to inspire his son, who has ambitions to be a professional boxer. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The way he looks at it, he's doing lessons that he doesn't need for his future plans,\" said James.\"And I do agree with that. I think people should be pushed really into what they really want to do, not just sitting down learning science or whatever that they don't need for their future.\"James says he worries the next time he will get more than a fine.'Next step... prison'\"I think the next step from what I've been told is behind bars. Prison. If it means he doesn't have to put himself through all this trauma then so be it. My son comes first.\"Last year, more than 16,000 parents were fined an average of \u00a3250 for their children missing school. \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\n'My son comes first', says Charlie's dad James\n        \n\n\n\nThe government says it is trying to address the issue piloting so-called attendance hubs and mentors in the worst affected areas.Poverty is one of the main causes of low attendance. Three times as many children receiving free school meals are absent from school than those who don't get them.And children with special educational needs and disabilities are also more likely to miss school than other children - 400,000 persistently absent children have a special educational need.Read more:Absence in schools is now at crisis point.

Many spoke about regularly spending 16 hours straight in a single position, unable to stretch or move.There was limited access to urinate or defecate and they were given buckets to use in the corner of some of the rooms.School teacher, Valentyna Danilova, says she believes it was a deliberate tactic to break them: \"They didn't want us to feel human,\" she says. \"We had no hygiene - we couldn\u2019t even wash our hands the first 10 days.\"Many of the elderly people were terrified to drink very much, she adds, because they feared going to the toilet with little privacy or worse, being forced to urinate where they sat. \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\n'No War' painted on the wall by children \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\nThe walls of the basement still have some paintings drawn by the children and maybe some of the adults. We find the words of the Ukrainian anthem as well as hearts coloured in red and the words \"no war\" inscribed above in big letters.Perhaps the most poignant image though is of a line of stick figures, stark in the simplicity of the drawing but with some of the figures clearly shooting those next to them in the head.Occasionally, the soldiers opened the basement door to let them out to go to the toilet behind the main school building but every time they ventured out from the basement, they risked being shelled in the battle over the village.The Russians told them they had already taken Kyiv and that President Zelenskyy had fled. They even presented their captives with a Russian newspaper detailing this 'news' of the Ukrainian collapse. \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nIvan, the school caretaker, shows the calendar that was marked on the wall\n        \n\n\n\n'None of us expected to leave alive'The teacher, Valantyna, managed to smuggle a bit of charred wood into the basement and started a calendar where she chalked off the days and kept a note of the dead - those who were killed as the Russian troops entered the village and another list of those who died while being held in the underground school rooms.With so little light, they struggled to differentiate between day or night.\"None of us expected to leave alive,\" Valantyna says, \"and there was an understanding among us that one day our children would come and find this place and at least they should know who was here and what happened\".She describes how some of the guards seemed to enjoy tormenting their prisoners. It was freezing cold in the basement, so she asked to collect a blanket for her elderly mother.\"They agreed but the moment I got outside, the soldiers started shooting at my feet. I stumbled and they laughed. It was funny to them.\" \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nMykhailo Shevchenko's son was killed\n        \n\n\n\nSeveral villagers were killed before making it into the basement. Mykhailo Shevchenko said his son Viktor was one of the first killed as the Russian troops entered Yahidne.His death will be investigated too after post-mortems appeared to show he was tied up and tortured before being shot in the head. His body then lay in the garden of his home for more than two weeks.\"Seventeen days he was lying there barefoot and his hands were tied behind his back,\" says Mykhailo.The villagers' hopes have been raised by the guilty verdicts handed out to soldiers involved in terrorising local resident Nadiia Radchenko's family. \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nNadiia Radchenko in front of her husband's grave\n        \n\n\n\nHer husband was killed, her house looted and guns put to their heads. Ukrainian lawmakers sentenced three Russian soldiers to 12 years in prison in absentia.\"It's good to get a verdict,\" Nadiia says, \"but not good they're still walking free because everyone needs to be held accountable and if you deliberately came to attack us, you need to be punished.\"Serhil Krupko, the Ukrainian prosecutor, emphasised to us how important he thinks this case is. \"We believe his case will show how the Russians were using ordinary civilians as human shields,\" he says. \"And our international criminal court partners were very interested in this.\"\n"}, {"_id":

When we got there, it was an extraordinary sight - a fishing boat that had been converted to carry as many people as possible.It looked almost exactly the same as the one that has sunk off the southern Greek coast - a similar rich blue paintwork, apparently the same structure, with an upper deck and then a hugely crowded main deck.On the boat we filmed, there was a lower area, called an underbelly, in which hundreds more people were crowded. On both boats, you can see the signs that it had previously been a fishing vessel, and you can also see the rust and wear of a long life.My guess is that you could probably get about 40 people on to a boat like that before it started to feel too crowded.At the end of a rescue mission we saw, which lasted several hours, more than 600 people had been transferred off the boat, and on to the Geo Barents.When we spoke to some of those who were rescued, a story emerged that is now being echoed by survivors in Greece - of a boat that set off from the Libyan port of Tobruk, under the control of a captain. \n\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News\nInstall the Sky News app for free\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHunger, thirst and fearOn the Geo Barents, people told me that they had initially left the port with even more passengers on board but the vessel was so heinously overloaded that it could not be moved safely.So, at gunpoint, around 150 people were then ordered off before the trip could start again.They told a story of food and water running out; of people having to sit in the underbelly cramped together and of being ordered to stay in place so the boat would not sway from side to side. And of fearing that they would die on the journey.We were also told that the captain left the ship one night, collected by a small boat that arrived alongside. After that, the passengers were left to their own devices, even though none of them knew how to control the boat.Already, similar reports are emerging from the shipwreck - of a captain abandoning his ship, and those on board.Read more:'This is my chance': The aftermath of mass migrant rescueOn board the mission to rescue 600 peopleMediterranean boat disaster survivors say they were left to die - how the night's tragedy unfoldedIn both cases, the boats had actually been tracked by Frontex, the European Union's border agency.They scan the Mediterranean for vessels such as this and try to monitor their progress, handing on the information to the various nations that run search and rescue operations in the area.But what is different is that the people we encountered were happy to be rescued. Many thought they were genuinely facing death and they willingly clambered off the boat and into the fast dinghies that took them to safety.They wanted to reach Italy and, having been rescued by a boat in Italian waters, that was now going to happen. \n\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\n\n\n0:46\n\n\n\n\n\nDozens of people have died off the coast of Greece after a small boat carrying migrants capsized and sank.\n\n\n\nThe boat that sank seems also to have been determined to reach Italy, or perhaps Italian waters.Maybe that's why, as it meandered through the Greek zone, it repeatedly denied that it was in trouble - because it wanted to reach Italy's jurisdiction before accepting any help.But if the captain had left, then who was making that call? At times like this, there is a surfeit of questions and a paucity of answers.Whatever - the sight of a dangerously overloaded vessel that won't ask for help places the authorities in a difficult position.Maritime law dictates that you must attend to a vessel that says it is in distress, or which is sinking or on fire.But when a boat denies there's a problem, then things become more complicated. \n\n\n\n\n\nSpreaker\nDue to your consent preferences, you\u2019re not able to view this.\nOpen Privacy Options\n\n\nClick to subscribe to the Sky News Daily wherever you get your podcasts'A night-time rescue is the worst'To an extent, all you can do is watch, hope for the best and prepare for the worst. The problem for the rescue teams is that the worst happened at 2am.The rescue that we filmed happened on a sunny afternoon on a relatively flat sea. But operations at night, especially with so many people in the water, are notoriously difficult.A person does not have to drift far before they are effectively out of sight.

Its managing director, Richard Clarke, admitted Mr Ashton was not flagged as an \"at-risk\" gambler on Wednesday, the second day of the hearing.The company uses a \"machine learning algorithm\" to detect customer risk levels and track customer data.It is designed to identify behaviour among people that have previously decided to \"self-exclude\" themselves from the Betfair website - meaning they take a \"break\" by locking their account for six months to prevent access.However, the algorithm failed to detect Mr Ashton - who \"self-excluded\" himself in 2013, 2014 and 2016 - as being high risk, the inquest heard.If he had been deemed at risk, measures could have been taken including a permanent ban or a telephone call from Betfair. \n\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\n\n\n0:35\n\n\n\n\n\n'Gambling destroyed my life'\n\n\n\nRead more:'Gambling kills' warning should be on every betting advert, bereaved mothers sayBetting safeguards under fire as problem gambler spends thousands after dodging checksMr Clarke said he was confident the company complied with regulations in place at the time.But he conceded: \"Looking at Luke's activity in March 2021, it does look like we should've done more.\"Looking at the tragic outcome we have here, we would have loved to have done more.\"\"Things have changed a lot since then,\" he told the hearing.Mr Ashton mostly placed bets on horse and greyhound racing events in the UK and abroad.He almost always used Betfair's Exchange platform - described by Mr Clarke as \"generally more low risk\" and used by \"sophisticated and highly-skilled\" customers.Around 10,000 customers were placing more bets than Mr Ashton on Betfair's busiest days in March 2021 - the month when the horseracing season starts, Mr Clarke said. \n\nClick to subscribe to the Sky News Daily wherever you get your podcastsA number of changes have since been implemented including a strict monthly net deposit limit for every customer who returns from a period of self-exclusion, following a detailed phone-based assessment.Financial vulnerability checks are also imposed using a leading third-party reference agency which looks for markers including a history of bankruptcy, county court judgements and short-term loans. \n\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News\nInstall the Sky News app for free\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\n\n\n1:52\n\n\n\n\n\nThe proposed new gambling laws\n\n\n\nA mandatory \u00a3500 per month deposit limit for all under-25s - a statistically more vulnerable age group - and a \u00a310 maximum stake limit on online slot games have also been introduced.Mr Nicholls, representing Mr Ashton's family, said it was their view Betfair should have enforced an exclusion on his account.However, the inquest heard it was possible for problem gamblers to \"slip through the net\".The hearing comes as the government unveiled further gambling reforms in April designed to \"force companies to step up their checks\", in a crackdown on online addiction.The inquest continues on Friday.Anyone feeling emotionally distressed or suicidal can call Samaritans for help on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org in the UK.

Shares of both now languish deep below their flotation price. So do those of other high-profile flotations of recent years - including Moonpig and Deliveroo.Accordingly, companies looking to come to market need to do a great deal more to convince investors to buy their shares.And, that, ultimately, comes down to valuation.Stock markets, in essence, involve a price discovery process in which buyers attempt to establish the price at which vendors are prepared to sell and where vendors try to establish the price at which they will find buyers.What appears to have happened in the case of WE Soda is that the current owner of the business, the industrialist Turgay Ciner, looks to have wanted too much.On the face of it, WE Soda had a good tale to tell. It claims to be the biggest and one of the lowest cost producers of the world's tenth most consumed industrial ingredient, boasting impressive operating margins of 60%. \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nPic: WE Soda\n        \n\n\n\nIts growth prospects were also enviable: the business was looking to more than double its total soda ash production from 5 million tonnes per year to 11 million tonnes per year by the end of the decade.The company assumed that these metrics were sufficient to justify seeking a premium against its sector peers such as Solvay, the \u20ac11.4bn Belgian company, which is valued by the market at an enterprise value (a company's stock market valuation taking into account its debt) of 4.6 times its expected EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation).At a stock market valuation of $7.5bn, WE Soda was looking at an enterprise value of more than 7 times its expected EBITDA this year.That was a valuation too rich for the market's blood and particularly at a time when soda ash prices have been pumped up by inflated demand following the reopening of economies around the world post-pandemic. There were plenty of signs of soda ash prices coming off the boil and particularly with new supplies becoming available around the world.None of this is to decry WE Soda. It is obviously a decent business with exciting growth prospects and which - another key selling point in an environmentally-conscious investor community like London's - could point to some solid credentials in sustainability.But, ultimately, buyers were not prepared to pay the price that the seller - Mr Ciner - was looking for.That's not an indication that investors were being overly cautious or, necessarily, the blow to the London market that some have suggested.\n"}, {"_id": "648c526d51ac33af8933fca8", "url":

to the overall rise of 9.7%.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt amounts to two thirds of the 0.3% added by hotels and restaurants.Mr Grahn told the Financial Times it was an \"astonishing\" development and not something Sweden had experienced before.Some fans booked hotel rooms up to 40 miles outside Stockholm, the economist said.He added on Twitter: \"We expect this upside surprise to be reversed in June as prices on hotels and tickets reverse back to normal.\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News\nInstall the Sky News app for free\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more

For them, the die was cast way before this report was even out.Is a comeback possible for Johnson?The biggest question - the answer to which will take time to unfold - is whether the conclusions of this investigation are so damning that it effectively kills off any hope of a political comeback for the former prime minister.

I believed Boris before and I believe him today. This punishment is absolutely extraordinary to the point of sheer vindictiveness, and I will vote against this report on Monday\".Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg, another ally also knighted by his old friend Mr Johnson, told me the 90-day suspension was \"extraordinary\" and \"shows that the report is deliberately trying to do damage to Boris Johnson. It is way beyond a judicial sanction\". He too will vote against the report on Monday, which also happens to be Mr Johnson's 59th birthday.An unedifying momentIt will be an unedifying moment for the party as the Conservative \"Boris haters\", as Sir Jacob calls them, line up to support the privileges committee and another group of his supporters back the former PM. He will want to see a show of support - a key thing to watch on Monday is how Conservatives choose to vote.What is clear from all of this - be it Mr Johnson's attacks on fellow Conservative Sir Bernard Jenkin, who sits on the privileges committee, or the howls of rage from Mr Johnson supporters over his treatment - is that Mr Sunak simply doesn't have a strong enough grip on the party to stop the infighting and perform the reset he needs.Mr Johnson might be quitting parliament, but the current prime minister still has two by-elections to fight because of it before the summer recess and one later in the year as Nadine Dorries opts to delay her resignation to prolong the pain for Mr Sunak. \n\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\n\n\n6:22\n\n\n\n\n\nKey findings from Boris Johnson report\n\n\n\nWhat about his long-term political career?

He thinks there is a route back for Mr Johnson - although not this side of an election.\"I think many people will look at 90 days and will think that that is simply too harsh, too aggressive, and shows what the committee was really trying to do.

Chequers is the official country residence of British prime ministers.An accompanying statement from the government had said: \"As part of their work preparing Boris Johnson's witness statement for the COVID Inquiry (due to be filed on 29 May), the counsel team supporting Mr Johnson identified a number of diary entries as potentially problematic.\"These entries [\u2026] are based on an assessment by Government Legal Department as to events/activities which could reasonably be considered to constitute breaches of COVID Regulations.\"The committee said this was disclosed to Mr Johnson the next day. \n\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\n\n\n1:52\n\n\n\n\n\n'The evidence is overwhelming'\n\n\n\n6.

politics latestDavid Neal, the independent chief inspector of borders and immigration, listed a litany of failures at the camps - although noted there had been some improvements since 2022 when there were outbreaks of diphtheria and people staying for over a month in temporary accommodation.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite Rishi Sunak's pledge to \"stop the boats\" and the announcement of three ships and a set of ex-military facilities to hold people having asylum claims processed, Mr Neal raised significant concerns the Manston facility in Kent would not be able to handle the expected number of people.While the prime minister claimed the number of people arriving this year was down compared to last year, numbers tend to rise rapidly in latter parts of the year. \n\nMore on Migrant Crossings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  At least 79 dead and dozens feared missing after fishing boat carrying migrants sinks off Greece\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  Plan for cruise ship to house asylum seekers near Liverpool scrapped\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  Rishi Sunak says two more barges will be used to house about 1,000 asylum seekers\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Topics:\nMigrant crossings\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said the capacity of the barges and camps announced recently will be \"limited\".\"Worryingly, I have received no clear answer from senior officials or ministers as to where the tens of thousands of migrants expected this year will be accommodated,\" he said in his summary. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Neal said the facility \"remains in danger of overcrowding if sufficient onward accommodation is not available -

although only 20-30% of people going through get an interview before leaving due to a number of factors including a lack of staff, delays, blockages and failures of communication.This, combined with issues in hotels, \"could mean that vulnerability and/or security risks are not being detected and addressed\".In terms of staffing, Mr Neal said the Home Office was struggling to attract recruits and also properly train them.He said fewer than half of the people working at the sites had the \"basic\" DBS criminal check.A lack of interpreters has led to security guards being used as translators, which Mr Neal said was \"inappropriate if a migrant is sharing personal information\".New safeguarding and vulnerability improvements had just been - or were about to be - put in place at the time of the January report.When migrants arrive in the UK, they have their possessions placed into two blue bags - one for wet and one for dry belongings. \n\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\n\n\n0:35\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Manston looked like last year\n\n\n\nWhile the current system sees people stay with their possessions, Mr Neal noted there were \"large numbers of these bags\" dating from times of overcrowding still being kept at Manston - including people's mobile phones.Officers told the inspectors that, on quiet days, they do try and return the bags to hotels where people were sent in a move that should be \"commended\" - but the impact of someone being separated from their phone \"should not be underestimated\".Report 'damning', say LabourAs part of his response to the report being published, Mr Neal was scathing about the fact it was released more than eight weeks after being submitted - contrary to a \"commitment\" from the Home Office.\"In office calls to the home secretary and to the immigration minister late last year, I forcefully made the point that the effective suppression of my reports through publication delays was unacceptable.\"Out of the 28 reports released during my tenure, only one has been published on time.\"Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, branded the report \"damning\" - saying the \"Conservatives' appalling mishandling of the asylum system is putting both our border security and vulnerable individuals at risk\".A Home Office spokesperson said they welcomed the report which shows \"significant improvements\" to the processing of migrants arriving by small boats at Western Jet Foil and Manston. \n\n\n\n\n\nSpreaker\nDue to your consent preferences, you\u2019re not able to view this.\nOpen Privacy Options\n\n\nClick to subscribe to the Sky News Daily wherever you get your podcasts The spokesperson added: \"This report acknowledges the great work already done by our staff and recognises the positive changes made across a range of areas including infrastructure, welfare support, biometrics, health screening and communication with migrants.\"As part of our ongoing work to stop the boats, we have already taken action to address the report's recommendations and we will continue to ensure there is sufficient onward accommodation to prevent overcrowding at Manston.\"\n"}, {"_id": "648c527151ac33af8933fcb3", "url": "https://news.sky.com/story/glenda-jackson-oscar-winning-actress-and-former-labour-mp-dies-ages-87-12902904", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Glenda Jackson, Oscar-winning actress and former Labour MP, dies aged 87", "lead": "Glenda Jackson, the Oscar-winning actress and former Labour MP, has died at the age of 87.", "author": "None", "datePublished": "2023-06-15 15:23:00", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:15:45.783384", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "SkyNews", "image": "https://e3.365dm.com/23/06/70x70/skynews-glenda-jackson-obit_6188061.jpg?20230615113641", "body": "\nGlenda Jackson, the Oscar-winning actress and former Labour MP, has died at the age of 87.In a statement, her agent Lionel Larner said: \"Glenda Jackson, two-time Academy Award-winning actress and politician, died peacefully at her home in Blackheath, London, this morning after a brief illness with her family at her side.\n\n\n\n\"She recently completed filming The Great Escaper in which she co-starred with Michael Caine.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nSir Michael Caine and Jackson pictured together for their new film The Great Escaper\n        \n\n\n\nFollow latest updates -

we spend multi-millions of dollars on hosting fees and Reddit needs to be fairly paid to continue supporting high-usage third-party apps,\" it said in a statement to Sky News.\"Our pricing is based on usage levels that we measure to be comparable to our own costs.\"The company said developers could make their apps \"more efficient\" to reduce the number of API calls required, adding that access would also remain free for moderator tools and bots.It added: \"We're committed to fostering a safe and responsible developer ecosystem around Reddit - developers and third-party apps can make Reddit better and do so in a sustainable and mutually-beneficial partnership, while also keeping our users and data safe.\"Reddit chief Steve Huffman doubled down on the company's stance in a Q&A on the platform on Saturday, saying it needs to be \"self-sustaining\" and \"can no longer subsidise commercial entities that require large-scale data use\".It comes as the company lays off 90 employees, about 5% of its workforce, to cut costs.\n"}, {"_id": "648c527551ac33af8933fcbc", "url": "https://news.sky.com/story/lucy-the-worlds-most-famous-human-ancestor-could-walk-just-like-us-new-research-suggests-12902139", "primaryCategory": "technology", "subCategories": "test", "title": "World's most famous human ancestor 'could walk just like us'", "lead": "The world's most famous early human ancestor could walk upright like a modern-day human thanks to fully bendable knee joints, research suggests.", "author": "None", "datePublished": "2023-06-14 11:35:00", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:15:49.249092", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "SkyNews", "image": "https://e3.365dm.com/23/06/70x70/skynews-human-ancestor-museum_6186971.jpg?20230614104042", "body": "\nThe world's most famous early human ancestor could walk upright like a modern-day human thanks to fully bendable knee joints, research suggests.'Lucy' was from an extinct ape-like species that lived in Africa more than three million years ago.\n\n\n\nShe was dug up in Ethiopia in 1974, and at the time was the most complete known early human ancestor.But only now have her lower limb muscles been fully digitally reconstructed, by researchers hoping to put an end to a decades-old debate among scientists regarding how she walked.The results from a team at the University of Cambridge, published in the Royal Society Open Science journal, show Lucy could straighten her knee joints, stand upright, and walk on two legs like we do today.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut her legs were also found to be far bigger and more powerful than ours, allowing her to live in trees like apes, meaning she was equally well-equipped to adapt to life in open grasslands and dense forests alike.The Cambridge scientists said the findings may help shed light on how physical movement has evolved in humans, \"including those capabilities we have lost\". \n\nMore from Science & Tech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  Blood test to detect 50 types of cancer could be given to 'one million people next summer'\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  Scientists create synthetic human embryos using stem cells in major breakthrough\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  Artificial Intelligence a 'threat to democracy' says government expert ahead of 2024 elections\n                \n\n\n\n\n\nHow Lucy's legs were reconstructedA team led by Dr Ashleigh Wiseman made a 3D model of Lucy's legs and pelvis muscles, with 36 in each leg. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe major muscles in her calves and thighs were more than twice as large as those in modern humans - the only remaining animal that can stand upright with straight knees.Dr Wiseman, of Cambridge's McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research, said: \"Lucy's ability to walk upright can only be known by reconstructing the path and space that a muscle occupies within the body.\"She added: \"Lucy's muscles suggest that she was as proficient at bipedalism as we are, while possibly also being at home in the trees.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nLucy's leg and pelvis muscles were digitally recreated.
