The voice of the novel\u2019s narrator \u2013 known as Verika, Vero, Oca, Scarafona, Smilzi and a host of other names \u2013 is wry and detached, often knowingly droll, as though she is sitting at a bar and telling you her story in disarranged fragments, each one polished to become a \u201cbit\u201d. We follow as she jumps about in time through a childhood marked by constipation, flashers, parental anxiety and shared boredom, and on into an adolescence in which subterfuge of various kinds becomes a necessary form of psychological escape. We learn that as an adult, she is a child-free writer and translator who has spent a lot of time in Berlin, as Raimo has, and are given glimpses \u2013 largely absurdist, but occasionally poignant \u2013 of heartbreak, an abortion and her father\u2019s death."}, {"type": "text", "text": "The extent to which these experiences are 'true' is perhaps the book\u2019s real subject"}, {"type": "text", "text": "The extent to which these experiences are \u201ctrue\u201d is perhaps the book\u2019s real subject, something its Italian title alludes to: Verika\u2019s first creative success is an act of appropriation, and as an adult she describes how she and her brother Christian routinely complete one another\u2019s work. At school she provokes a crisis among the teaching staff for saying something she swears she didn\u2019t actually say; and she creates an entirely made-up diary for the sole benefit of her mother, who she knows will read it \u2013 perhaps just as she is doing here. In other words, we are warned not to believe her; and yet it\u2019s very hard not to."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Although happy to polish anecdotes in the service of humour, Raimo deliberately resists the way in which memory shapes events to give them a significance they didn\u2019t have at the time. For example, Lost on Me\u2019s narrator is unclear about when she first had sex: \u201cI didn\u2019t feel what I should\u2019ve felt because I didn\u2019t know what it was I should\u2019ve been feeling \u2026 to me, every experience needs a precise linguistic or empirical explanation \u2026 otherwise I\u2019m oblivious to the fact that I\u2019m experiencing it,\u201d she states \u2013 a fascinating and revealing insight. When her father is dying, she says goodbye to him well before she has to and, in fact, tells an acquaintance on the street that he\u2019s dead long before he is even taken ill; in this way the moment of ultimate significance is diffused. In one aside to the reader, she notes that \u201csometimes we write not to process grief, but to make it up\u201d \u2013 yet her description of wanting to call her father when she turned 40, the age he was when she first had distinct memories of him, has the distinct, and moving, ring of truth."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Yet elsewhere, Raimo herself eludes us \u2013 perhaps on purpose, given that her narrator describes how, as an adult, people often seem not to recognise her, as though she cannot clearly be seen. While links can be postulated between the formative experiences of the little girl and the glimpses we\u2019re given of the adult narrator, somehow they don\u2019t quite add up to a plausible whole. It\u2019s possible that some of this is an effect of reading the book in translation: Leah Janeczko lends the text an American flavour (\u201csneakers\u201d, \u201cscrewing\u201d, \u201cchick\u201d) that feels distancing to British ears when combined with its European locations and descriptions of Italian family life. More importantly, while the humour comes through brilliantly there\u2019s a slight instability in terms of voice that makes it hard to connect with the interior life of the adult woman, something that was surely not present in the original Italian. It feels like looking at an unfamiliar view through the sheerest of voile curtains: everything is there, yet it\u2019s somehow hard to fully embrace."}, {"type": "text", "text": "But perhaps this is all part of a deliberate game Raimo is playing \u2013 and Lost on Me does feel like a gleeful autofictional tarantella danced by truth and fiction, authenticity and disguise. Still, it feels somehow unsatisfying that Raimo seems almost always to be turned away from us: a silhouette slipping quietly out of the side door of a theatre even as her narrator holds court on stage."}, {"type": "text", "text": "\u2022 Lost on Me by Veronica Raimo, translated by Leah Janeczko, is published by Virago (\u00a316.99).

Back in 2012, the case of Sam Hallam, one of the youngest victims of a UK miscarriage of justice whose murder conviction was eventually quashed, made its way to the court of appeal. This followed an incredible community campaign led by Paul May (the veteran campaigner of the Birmingham Six and Bridgewater Four) and supported by the actor Ray Winstone. Hallam had spent seven years in prison for the murder of Essayas Kassahun in a gang attack in October 2004. During that time his father killed himself."}, {"type": "text", "text": "His case had similarities with Malkinson\u2019s, as it was based on unreliable identification evidence. This was subsequently undermined by the discovery of police material that suggested a different Sam was mentioned as a potential suspect, and which had not been disclosed prior to the trial. The Criminal Cases Review Commission ordered an independent Thames Valley police report, which made serious criticism of the Metropolitan police investigation, with untold errors including the failure to interrogate Hallam\u2019s phone. Evidence on the phone supported Hallam\u2019s interview statement that he had not been at the scene of the murder. Fourteen people were also identified who said Hallam was not there, including the intended victim of the murder, who was right next to his friend when he was killed. There was no forensics, no CCTV, no phone evidence to place Hallam at the scene."}, {"type": "text", "text": "On the first day of Hallam\u2019s appeal, straight after lunch, the prosecution counsel stood up and announced they no longer contested the appeal.

It reflected a sense of relief across the working-class community of Hoxton that finally this injustice had come to an end.

And yet it remains as mysterious to most as Hafnia was in the 1980s or whatever it was CR Smith actually did. The energy drink you will see people slugging down on trains or in vans in the mornings is still that associated with top-division clubs in Austria and Germany. The old League Cup is the first major trophy of the season and later on in the season, Manchester United will be defending it. Before that, before the Premier League can even begin, it\u2019s clubs from the lower three divisions.

Their return to the EFL didn\u2019t go so well, being on the end of a 5-3 humping by MK Dons, that well-known force for authenticity in Our Leagues. So, Wigan, who pulled off a rather decent 2-1 win over Derby in League One, are their opponents. Perhaps the jet lag from the US tour might have been shaken out by the Wrexham players. Their manager, Phil Parkinson, guided Bradford City to the 2013 final of this competition, and loves a cup run. Their owners don\u2019t mind a bit of exposure. Beyond that, the pick of the ties is Southampton, outstanding in winning 2-1 at Sheffield Wednesday on Friday, and their trip to Gillingham, who opened their League Two campaign with a good 1-0 win at Stockport.
