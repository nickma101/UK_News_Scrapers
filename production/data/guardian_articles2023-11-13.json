Now the broadcaster, author and former doctor is turning his attention to our ears, encouraging anyone who has noticed a change in their hearing to take a free test. 'Hearing change is completely normal and is nothing to be embarrassed or ashamed about,' he stresses. He should know: Mosley has been experiencing hearing loss for several years. 'At 66, my hearing’s not great,' he tells me over the phone. 'I really struggle in social settings such as pubs and restaurants.' I assume he wears hearing aids these days. 'I’m not quite ready for a hearing aid yet!' he protests. 'My hearing’s not bad enough. I’ll go back in a year or so for another test.'"}, {"type": "text", "text": "This might make Mosley an odd choice to front Specsavers’ hearing-test campaign – but his attitude reflects a society-wide reluctance to wearing hearing aids. And at least he has actually taken a hearing test. A much-cited 2007 study showed that, on average, it takes people 10 years from noticing hearing loss to getting it checked out. Ten years later, another study found the situation has only slightly improved: that figure is now 8.9 years. And Specsavers’ survey of 2,000 UK adults in September found that one in three Britons had noticed changes in their hearing over the past decade but more than half (57%) had taken no action. Reasons given include embarrassment, not feeling it was needed, being too busy and because no one else they know gets their hearing checked. My boyfriend is one of them – he has been struggling to follow conversations in noisy pubs for the past few years, but feels the problem isn’t bad enough to do anything about it."}, {"type": "text", "text": "So does it really matter if you have to ask colleagues to repeat themselves, or turn up the volume on the TV more than you used to, or nod along to half-heard conversations at social gatherings? 'There is a lot of evidence that people with untreated hearing loss are at significantly increased risk of depression and anxiety,' says Mosley. Katie Ogden, a hearing-aid dispenser with the maker ReSound, says this is partly because hearing loss can be isolating. 'People say to me: ‘I used to love going to the pub on a Friday night – but it’s so difficult to hear, I’ve stopped going.’ Changing your behaviour is a red flag.'"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Hearing and balance are connected, sharing a common nerve pathway to the brain, so untreated hearing loss is also linked to an increased risk of falls. One US study found that mild hearing loss tripled the chance of falling in people aged between 40 and 69. And, perhaps most alarming, hearing loss is linked with dementia. A study of 437,704 people published in the Lancet in April found that those with untreated hearing loss were 42% more likely to develop dementia. Those with treated hearing loss were at no increased risk."}, {"type": "text", "text": "The first barrier to treatment is the test itself. 'A lot of people are unaware you can get hearing tests for free,' says Mosley. There are lots of online hearing tests, such as one by the charity RNID. GPs can also refer patients for NHS assessments, while large pharmacies and opticians often offer free checks. Many people find the prospect of a test daunting. But, unlike eye tests, there are no wrong or right answers, says Gurleen Brar, an audiologist at Specsavers. 'Hearing is subjective and the test is such an easy thing – you simply press a button when you hear a sound,' she says. 'Today, I saw someone who was so anxious about taking a test, it had taken her five or six years to pluck up the courage. She kicked herself for not coming earlier.'"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Should hearing tests be as routine as eye tests and dental appointments? Brar recommends taking a hearing test every 18 months from the age of 55, or earlier if you have noticed any issues. Boots suggests those over 50 take a test every two years, while the NHS offers a free assessment every three years. Not everyone who has noticed a problem will need to start wearing hearing aids.

People remember the big clunky devices"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Yet even those diagnosed with hearing loss tend to resist wearing hearing aids. Prof Dongshan Zhu, the lead author of the Lancet dementia study, reported that almost four-fifths of people experiencing hearing loss do not use hearing aids in the UK. In the US, 28.8 million adults could benefit from using hearing aids. Of these, only 30% of over-70s and just 16% of those between 20 and 69 have ever used them. A friend of mine can relate: he was fitted with a hearing aid in one ear in 2015 but has stopped wearing it, despite struggling to hear colleagues every day."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Is there still a stigma around hearing aids? 'Absolutely. People remember the big clunky devices,' says Mosley. 'And people are embarrassed by hearing loss. There’s a feeling that hearing aids are an obvious sign of being old and decrepit.'

'I suppose we almost wholly associate hearing loss with older people, whereas glasses are worn at any age,' he says."}, {"type": "text", "text": "The truth is, hearing loss affects people of all ages. Research shows that approximately 28% of people aged between 16 and 60 in the UK have some form of hearing impairment and could benefit from hearing aids. Furthermore, 1 billion young people globally are at risk of hearing loss from loud music, according to a study last year."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Ogden says that a number of other myths deter people from wearing hearing aids. One is that they feel uncomfortable and are noticeable. In fact, she says, behind-the-ear hearing aids are now sleek and discreet, and in-the-ear aids are invisible. Myth two is that using hearing aids worsens hearing. The truth is the opposite: hearing aids keep the ears and brain stimulated, whereas failing to wear them can result in the brain 'forgetting' sounds and losing the ability to process them. A third misconception is that hearing aids make sounds appear robotic. Actually, 'Modern hearing aids produce a natural sound and they adapt to background noise,' she says. 'They recognise when you’re in a quiet place, and if you move to a busy restaurant, they change how they behave.'"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Brar believes any stigma is slowly being broken down. 'I’m testing more people in their 30s and 40s now – if I test 10 people in a day, three or four will be under 50,' she says. 'And people that age are more willing to wear hearing aids than people in their 60s or 70s.' That rings true. My 80-year-old father huffs that his hearing aids make him look like an old man and rarely wears them; my sister, who recently had hearing aids fitted, is just delighted to hear the customers in the post office where she works."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Brar also credits the Strictly effect: after the actor Rose Ayling-Ellis, who is deaf, won the BBC dancing show in 2021, many new patients mentioned her at their hearing appointments.

However, many people still struggle with them despite their best efforts. 'It’s so, so common to have difficulties with your hearing aid at first,' says Brar. People should have a follow-up appointment to adjust the sound and discuss how the device is working, she says; they may need one or two more appointments to get it right, or to try a different hearing aid. 'With any problems, go back and see your audiologist. Nine out of 10 issues can be fixed.'"}, {"type": "text", "text": "What if wearers still feel self-conscious? 'Any embarrassment is in your head!' says Brar. 'People don’t care if you’re wearing hearing aids – they just want you to hear them.' It surely helps that every other person on the street is now wearing headphones or earbuds – there is certainly nothing unusual about having a device in your ear any more. Still, 'Perhaps we need some really fancy designers to make hearing aids cool,' suggests Mosley."}, {"type": "quote", "text": "'What do you mean?' asks Ogden. 'They’re already cool! Hearing aid technology is evolving – just like smartphones. They blow my mind.' She thinks wearers are starting to embrace the things modern hearing aids can do. 'People can connect to smart devices and wirelessly stream phone calls to their hearing aid. They can directly link into their laptops for video calls. People see so much benefit, they can’t live without them.' Even some of her most reluctant wearers have been converted, she says.

Why didn’t I do it sooner?’'"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Brar agrees that hearing aids can be life-changing.

One may not recall the detail of all the allegations, yet the essence has lingered and settled in our collective psyche.

So many teams seek safety in numbers, massing numbers behind the ball and taking their chances on the break.

Reece James dealt so handily with Jérémy Doku on the right flank that Pep Guardiola was forced to take him off.

For much of his Chelsea career, Sterling has jogged around the pitch like a man staging a mellow protest at the madness unfolding around him. He no longer makes the England squad. Cole Palmer now takes the penalties. Occasionally Sterling would pop up with a cursory goal against Nottingham Forest or Luton or somebody like that.

This was the game when he finally burst into flames."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Was it the fact that it was his old club? Probably not. But perhaps it was no coincidence that the two players who unlocked City here were those who know how the Guardiola mainframe works. While Sterling ran at Kyle Walker, dragging him inside, Palmer ghosted into the open spaces left behind, wriggling through gaps, taking the ball on the sidestep in the classic Guardiola style. It was Palmer who helped create Sterling’s first-half goal – his first for Chelsea against a top-half club – and Sterling who created the injury-time penalty that Palmer converted."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Occasionally Chelsea would regret their decision to turn the game into an arm wrestle. Cucurella conceded the City penalty by allowing Erling Haaland to steal ahead of him, a place from which there are no good options. The second-phase defending for Manuel Akanji’s equalising goal was a free-for-all.

'To change hearts and minds.'"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Such positivity, though, is not always easy to sustain. In 2018, Bonnin made a feature-length documentary for BBC One, Drowning in Plastic. It was a harrowing watch: she cried on-screen as she watched 20 shards of plastic being vomited by a three-month-old shearwater chick that had never even been in the sea. When she returned home, the experiences stayed with her.

'I had this ridiculously embarrassing awakening where I said to my therapist: ‘Wait a minute, so what you’re telling me is, I’ll do all this work and still life won’t be easy? I’m paying all this money, but I’m not going to be happy all the time?’'"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Bonnin laughs, but one of the low points came in September with the release of a report, compiled from 2,000 studies, that the Earth was so damaged it was 'well outside the safe operating space for humanity'.

The rest that survive will continue and the planet will go on.'"}, {"type": "headline", "text": "Another place you might have seen Bonnin is on the BBC family-history series Who Do You Think You Are? Her episode in 2016 was an absolute humdinger. Bonnin knew a little of her heritage going in: her mother was from Trinidad with Indian and Portuguese ancestors, and her father was from French Martinique. But she wasn’t fully prepared for where the research would take her. The most dramatic line of inquiry led to her discovery that her great-great-great-great grandfather, François Alexandre Gros Désormeaux, was an enslaver in Martinique. Then there was the twist when Bonnin learned that he freed one of his enslaved people, Pauline Zoé, with whom he had children. Ultimately, Pauline would inherit François’s estate, including his enslaved people, and receive compensation from the French government following abolition."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Bonnin describes the Who Do You Think You Are? experience as 'just ridiculous' and it still resonates with her now. 'One of the more positive aspects of the fallout was, for months afterwards, when I was brushing my teeth, I’d look in the mirror and, it’s probably a romanticised thing, but I could see in my eyes, the eyes of the freed slave who six generations ago ended up running the plantation in Martinique. And I felt strong. And I felt like my stubbornness probably came from that.'"}, {"type": "text", "text": "'Ridiculous' is not a bad description for Bonnin’s own path. She was born in Paris, but moved to Dublin aged nine, because her mother wanted her to have a convent education (Bonnin herself was less keen). She studied biochemistry at Trinity College Dublin and, on graduation, she had to choose between doing a PhD at Oxford or joining an all-girl pop band, Chill. She went with the latter, but it was a bust: Polydor, their label, dropped them before releasing a record. But it eventually led to television, after she moved to London in the early 2000s and became a presenter on Channel 4’s chaotic breakfast programme RI:SE, interviewing Tom Hanks and Leonardo DiCaprio, and then hosting Top of the Pops."}, {"type": "quote", "text": "'I was having a ball!' she says.

I just really missed academia, it sounds really up my own… But I wanted to get back to reading research papers.'"}, {"type": "text", "text": "So Bonnin was opposite DiCaprio thinking: what I really want is to trawl through some scientific journals? 'He was amazing, though,' she concedes. 'Before I met him, I was like, ‘No, he’s not my type.’ But when I sat opposite him I was like, ‘Oh my God, this man’s charisma!’ And in a really understated way. It kind of threw me. It was quite amazing, actually, as an experience. I’m like, ‘Oh, my God, what is this aura thing going on with you?’'"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Next for Bonnin was a masters in wild animal biology at the Zoological Society of London and the Royal Veterinary College. 'I wanted to be a scientist in India and just work with tigers,' she says.

We have all the data we need.'"}, {"type": "text", "text": "The best way to make an impact, Bonnin decided, was to return to presenting. Her timing was perfect: in 2009, BBC One was looking for hosts for a new science magazine series, Bang Goes the Theory. Bonnin was given the gig and made eight series of the show until 2014. She worked prolifically during this period, popping up on Stargazing Live, Horizon and Tomorrow’s World, and co-presenting ITV’s Countrywise with Ben Fogle from 2013 onwards."}, {"type": "text", "text": "But Bonnin’s schedule was taking its toll and in 2015 she was overwhelmed by what she now realises was burnout. The first sign came when she was on live TV, working on Big Blue Live at the Monterey Bay Aquarium in California. The show, which won a Bafta for best Live Event, had just shown extraordinary footage of a blue whale when the cameras cut back to Bonnin. 'And I was just away with the fairies,' she recalls. 'I was standing on this pier and reading the Autocue on live TV and I was going, ‘I just want to jump in the water and go for a swim, I’m so exhausted…’ I was smiling, but inside I was a wreck.'"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Bonnin ignored the signs, kept on working, but then had another panic attack when she was diving in the Bristol Channel.

So I think that’s burnout.'"}, {"type": "headline", "text": "These days, Bonnin is happier and healthier than she can remember being.

In November 2020, Bonnin was elected as president of the Wildlife Trusts, the conservation charities managing the UK’s nature reserves.

And I’m also the first brown person to be the president. So that’s beautifully challenging.'"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Despite this groundbreaking role, though, Bonnin will sometimes feel the twitch of impostor syndrome. She’s increasingly in demand with big companies – the likes of Unilever – to advise on their green strategy, but she questions if she’s the right person to be giving those presentations.

A battle to empower women and people of colour in the wildlife sector. A battle to keep making programmes that change those hearts and minds. I ask if she can see herself, like Attenborough, still working and campaigning well into her nineties. 'Yes – not a hesitation,' says Bonnin. 'Because I look to Jane Goodall. I look to David Attenborough. I look to Sylvia Earle. I look to Chris Packham, not that he’s much older than me. Also, nobody should retire: your whole body and mind just crumbles. Continue doing what you love, giving back to the planet, growing, understanding what it means to be human till the day you die.'"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Then Bonnin stops, remembering something vital she’s forgotten.
