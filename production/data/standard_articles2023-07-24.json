are calling Speaking during a debate on the level of Government preparation for the impacts that climate change will have on health, the economy, food security and the environment, the Tory peer said: \u201cWe have all too little debate on climate change.\u201cIt\u2019s all the more important that we have it now since critics of any aspects of this policy find it increasingly difficult to get a hearing in the media.\u201cHere in this House, at least, we cannot be censored, though it seems we do run some risk of losing our bank accounts if we dare to speak up.\u201dHe noted \u201cmore will need to be spent on things like flood protection and reservoirs\u201d, but speaking about calls for the UK to adapt to the health consequences of rising temperatures, Lord Frost said: \u201cDigging deeper, what are those consequences of the hotter, warmer summers and warmer, wetter winters?\u201cAt the moment, seven times as many people die from cold as from heat in Britain. Rising temperatures are likely to be beneficial.I don't think the families of people who died because of heat are very much cheered by the fact that there are fewer people dying because of cold\u201cThe Government Actuary\u2019s Department, no less, wrote in April this year, and I quote, \u2018it is the low winter temperatures that have a greater effect on the number of deaths\u2019. Since the start of the millennium, a decline in deaths from cold temperature periods has more than offset any increase in the number of deaths associated with warmer temperature over the same period.\u201cNow, I\u2019m not sceptical about adaptation. I\u2019m sceptical about mitigation.\u201cI suggest that the rational thing to do is to move away from the current high-cost mitigation efforts, efforts which also involve massive investments in unproductive renewables, huge changes in lifestyles as well as crushing economic growth, and pursue mitigation in a different way.\u201cInvesting in effective energy production, nuclear, gas, other technologies as they emerge, and meanwhile, spend the manageable sums that we need to on adaptation so we can adjust to the perfectly manageable consequences of slowly rising temperatures as they emerge.\u201dSpeaking after Lord Frost, Labour former minister Lord Whitty said: \u201cThe idea that we can have a choice between mitigation and adaptation is absurd. We need both.\u201dReferring to the recent by-election in Uxbridge and South Ruislip, he added: \u201cAs to the current furore in the newspapers over the weekend after a by-election in which 250 people voted the wrong way, we have the pressure on the leaders of our two main parties to back off from their commitment to green policies and to climate change.\u201cI find that absolutely absurd.\u201dWe will see... more vector-related diseases, mosquito-related diseases such as Zika virus, West Nile fever and indeed, potentially, malaria in the future if the predictions are correctSome Tories have been calling for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to delay climate pledges after the party narrowly held on to Uxbridge and South Ruislip in last week\u2019s by-election, with Labour\u2019s failure to win being attributed to the expansion of London\u2019s Ultra Low Emission Zone (Ulez) scheme.Tory former environment minister Lord Deben, who recently left his role as chairman of the Climate Change Committee, said: \u201cWe do have a certainty here. The weather is changing. It\u2019s changing dramatically and we have actually to sort out our acceptance to it.\u201cAnd that means that we can\u2019t talk about deaths as Lord Frost did. I don\u2019t think the families of people who died because of heat are very much cheered by the fact that there are fewer people dying because of cold.\u201cThe fact of the matter is we have to deal with these problems. We have to do something about our care homes, most of which \u2013 not just many, but most of which \u2013 are entirely unsuited for the weather that we are going to have.\u201dIndependent crossbench peer Lord Hastings of Scarisbrick doubted those who suggest people cannot afford mitigation and adaptation measures, noting that he expects more than 53 million British adults and children to take overseas holidays this year.He said: \u201cPeople can afford in mass numbers to undertake easy pleasures, but when it comes to affording the cost of responding to the cataclysmic crisis of climate change, we\u2019re told we can\u2019t afford it \u2013 we can.\u201dGreen Party peer Baroness Jones of Moulsecoomb said Lord Frost had promoted \u201cdenialist tropes\u201d and \u201cright-wing conspiracy theories\u201d in his speech.Energy minister Lord Callanan said: \u201cAdaptation and net zero in fact go hand-in-hand, achieving net zero actually requires adaptation. We have a huge opportunity to make the substantial net zero investments that are resilient to current and future climate change risks and doing so can, of course, prevent future higher costs.\u201cLet me, for the avoidance of any doubt, confirm that delivering net zero is of course vitally important to this Government.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64bef89a51ac333ca792fa59", "url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news-live-arsenal-chelsea-fc-man-utd-mbappe-kane-caicedo-b1096260.html", "primaryCategory": "Football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Transfer news LIVE!

More homes in the places where people want and need them.\u201dThere were signs of local Tory opposition to his housing strategy as Conservative MP for South Cambridgeshire Anthony Browne vowed to \u201cdo everything\u201d to stop the \u201cnonsense plans to impose mass housebuilding on Cambridge\u201d.Mr Browne lashed out at the plan, tweeting: \u201cI will do everything I can to stop the Government\u2019s nonsense plans to impose mass housebuilding on Cambridge, where all major developments are now blocked by the Environment Agency because we have quite literally run out of water.

benefits and concerns linked to AI.He said: \u201cThe new AI technology is further exacerbating this financial threat to the whole industry; AI-generating companies able to scrape for free the information from news websites, which are already facing increasing costs of creating original journalistic content.\u201cMeanwhile, many AI sites, such as Microsoft\u2019s new AI service, are

Cameron drew attention to the first global summit on AI, hosted by the UK, highlighting its critical role in addressing the challenges posed by the technology.He said: \u201cAt the extreme, artificial

improving diagnostics and health care to tackling climate change, but they also bring serious challenges such as the threat of fraud and disinformation created by deepfakes.\u201cWe note the stark

harrowing stories of how their lives have been blighted after they handed over the letter on Monday calling for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to expand the interim compensation scheme to cover more victims and their families.The Infected Blood Inquiry was established in 2017 to examine how thousands of patients in the UK developed HIV and hepatitis C through contaminated blood products given in the 1970s and 1980s.About 2,900 people died in what has been labelled the worst treatment disaster in the history of the NHS.Inquiry chairman Sir Brian Langstaff has said an interim compensation scheme should be widened so more people \u2013 including orphaned children and parents who lost children \u2013 could be compensated.Read MoreMordaunt: Government not dragging feet on infected blood

reveals she pulled out of X Factor after she was raped by hotel workerSir Brian said in April he was taking the unusual step of making the recommendation ahead of the publication of the full report into the scandal so that victims would not face any more delays.Under the initial scheme, only victims themselves or bereaved partners can receive an interim payment of around \u00a3100,000.The inquiry has recommended the Government establish an arm\u2019s-length compensation body now, and definitely before the final report is made in autumn.These payments are not just about compensation, they symbolise acknowledgement and they represent initial recognition of each life lostThe letter from relatives called for Sir Brian\u2019s request to be acted on, saying: \u201cThis delay denies victims and their families any sense of tangible progress.\u201cMany continue to die without full redress, this cannot be right. The interim payment for deaths not yet recognised is critical.\u201cThese payments are not just about compensation, they symbolise acknowledgement and they represent initial recognition of each life lost.\u201dJanine Jones, whose haemophiliac brother Marc Payton died in 2003 at the age of 41 after being infected with HIV and hepatitis C, was among the group handing in the letter.Ms Jones, 58, of Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, said her brother was diagnosed with HIV in 1985 when he was 23 and told he had hepatitis C in 1990.Their elderly parents, Ron and Val, had both died while waiting for justice.She told the PA news agency: \u201cIn the last two years while the inquiry has been going on both our parents have died.\u201cThey were both in their 80s and they died with no recognition at all for their son\u2019s death.\u201cBecause he wasn\u2019t married or he didn\u2019t have a partner when he died, there has been no compensation paid to him at all.\u201dShe said of her parents: \u201cThey were devastated from his diagnosis anyway. Mum always blamed herself for giving him haemophilia because she was the carrier.\u201cIt absolutely crucified them, they never got over it.\u201cMy mum, the last three years of her life she had dementia and every time she saw me it was the first words out of her mouth: \u2018Where\u2019s Mark? I haven\u2019t seen Mark\u2019.Ms Jones added: \u201cI\u2019ve been orphaned. I\u2019ve lost my brother. I\u2019ve lost my parents. On my brother\u2019s deathbed I promised him I\u2019d carry on fighting for him.\u201dWhen my dad died we just got no support. We left the hospital, we got nothing from anybody, nobody contacted us. Just left his five children without any support. Nobody came to us to give us any advice, no counsellingShe said an arm\u2019s-length compensation body would be more independent from Government.\u201cThey haven\u2019t done anything good for us over the last 40 years of campaigning to get something done, so we really don\u2019t trust anything they\u2019re saying,\u201d Ms Jones added.\u201cObviously an arm\u2019s-length body will have to still answer to Government but we\u2019d like it to be more independent.\u201dEileen Burkert, 54, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said her haemophiliac father Edward died in April 1992 after developing HIV and hepatitis C from contaminated blood products.Ms Burkert said two uncles and three cousins, who also had the inherited bleeding disorder in which the blood does not clot properly, were infected from transfusions and died.\u201cWe didn\u2019t know that my dad had had HIV until the day he died,\u201d she said.\u201cHe was a single father of five \u2013 he was 54, the age I am now.\u201cWhen my dad died we just got no support. We left the hospital, we got nothing from anybody, nobody contacted us.\u201cJust left his five children without any support. Nobody came to us to give us any advice, no counselling.\u201dMs Burkert added: \u201cOne of my younger brothers (Keith) took his own life eight years after my dad died and through talking to one of his key workers back in the day, I found out that he always feared that he may have got HIV.\u201cAnd we think that he took his life because he missed dad. I didn\u2019t know how to console my brother because I was going through the same thing,\u201d she said.\u201cIt\u2019s not just the impact on myself and my brothers and sisters, it literally contributed to my brother\u2019s death because if you don\u2019t have the support and the network around you, how can you deal with it\u2026 when your only parent has been taken by a disease like Aids, which was really, really stigmatised back in the day?\u201d\u201cRight now I\u2019m pretty angry because the first interim payment paid the infected, rightly so, and the windows and partners, rightly so, but why haven\u2019t they recognised, so far, the deaths of people that have so far gone unrecognised?\u201cLike my dad was a single parent of five children \u2013 so why is my dad\u2019s life worth less than anybody else\u2019s?\u201cIt is not the money; my dad\u2019s life needs to be recognised,\u201d Ms Burkert added."}, {"_id": "64bef89c51ac333ca792fa61", "url":

the BBC News At Six for the last 20 years, died on Monday.At the end of Monday\u2019s programme, his colleague Sophie Raworth revealed Alagiah had hoped to come into the BBC studio one last time to thank the viewers but did not get the chance.In a video montage in his honour which featured clips and pictures, Alagiah admitted it had taken him time to process the diagnosis after he was first told he had bowel cancer.\u201cMy life, for what it is worth, is divided into pre-cancer and post-cancer. The weird thing about a bowel cancer journey is you don\u2019t really know the beginning and you don\u2019t really know the end,\u201d he said in the video.Read MoreClive Myrie emotional as he announces George Alagiah\u2019s death on BBC NewsTributes pour in for BBC newsreader George Alagiah following his death aged 67George Alagiah remembered as \u2018one of the best journalists of his generation\u2019SPONSORED10 amazing European hikes\u201cSo I know the day I was diagnosed with bowel cancer, but I don\u2019t know when it started. Because I was at the top of my game, I was having a fantastic time at work and home, and then suddenly you hear those words \u2018I\u2019m sorry to tell you Mr Alagiah, you\u2019ve got bowel cancer\u2019.\u201cAt first when you\u2019re told, you don\u2019t know how to respond and it took me a while to understand what I needed to do.\u201dHe continued: \u201cFor me, I had to get a place of contentment and the only way I knew how to do that was literally to look back at my life.\u201cActually, when I look back to my journey, where it all started, looked at the family I had, the opportunities my family had, the great good fortune to bump into Fran who\u2019s been my wife and lover for all these years. The kids that we brought up, it didn\u2019t feel like a failure.\u201cI wish I hadn\u2019t had cancer, obviously. But I have cancer and I\u2019m glad of the things I\u2019ve learned about myself and about my community, my friends and my family as a result\u201cI have gotten to a place to see life as a gift. Rather than kind of worrying about when it\u2019s going to end and how it\u2019s going to end, I\u2019ve got to a place where I can see it for the gift it is. I feel that gift keenly every morning.\u201dBefore airing the video on the BBC\u2019s News At Six, Raworth remembered Alagiah as a \u201cman of great values and indomitable spirit\u201d.She recalled launching the evening news show with him 20 years in January 2003, saying that he felt \u201cenormously proud and privileged\u201d to be presenting the programme.\u201cHe loved being in the newsroom, being part of the team, and he made a good cup of tea as well. We all adored him,\u201d she added.\u201cHe felt a real connection with the audience too. After he was diagnosed with cancer, just over nine years ago, he received thousands of letters and messages from people who wrote to him as if they knew each other, strangers who spoke to him as a friend.\u201cHe was really touched by your support. George was a man of great values and indomitable spirit. A big smile of velvety love, a great friend.\u201dGeorge Alagiah passed away on Monday  / BBCBBC newsreaders Clive Myrie and Naga Munchetty fought back tears earlier in the day as they delivered the news of his death on air.Broadcaster Myrie became emotional as he paid tribute to Alagiah during the lunchtime BBC News broadcast, saying: \u201cOn a personal note, George touched all of us here in the newsroom with his kindness and generosity, his warmth and good humour.\u201cWe loved him here at BBC News and I loved him as a mentor, colleague and friend.\u201cHis spirit, strength and courage in the later years of his life is something his family can be so proud of. Journalism has lost a giant.\u201dMunchetty also became choked up as she interrupted her live show on BBC Radio 5 Live around midday to deliver the news.As her voice broke, she said: \u201cApologies for the emotion in my voice \u2013 he was so loved in our newsroom.\u201dAlagiah, who was born in Sri Lanka, continued to present for the BBC when he was not receiving treatment.He joined the corporation in 1989 and spent many years as one of its leading foreign correspondents before moving to presenting.He was a specialist in Africa and covered the civil wars in Somalia and Liberia as well as the genocide in Rwanda 20 years ago.Throughout his career he interviewed central political figures, among them former South African president Nelson Mandela, Archbishop Desmond Tutu and ex-Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe.He was nominated for a Bafta in 1994 for his coverage of Saddam Hussein\u2019s genocidal campaign against the Kurds of northern Iraq and was named Amnesty International\u2019s journalist of the year in 1994 for reporting on the civil war in Burundi.He first began hosting the 6pm news bulletin in early 2003, but stepped up to front it solo four years later following the departure of his co-host, Natasha Kaplinsky.Kaplinsky wrote on Instagram: \u201cGoodbye dearest George. I will miss you so very much. It was such a privilege to be your friend.\u201dBBC director-general Tim Davie said: \u201cAcross the BBC, we are all incredibly sad to hear the news about George. We are thinking of his family at this time.\u201cGeorge was one of the best and bravest journalists of his generation who reported fearlessly from across the world as well as presenting the news flawlessly.\u201cHe was more than just an outstanding journalist, audiences could sense his kindness, empathy and wonderful humanity. He was loved by all and we will miss him enormously.\u201dQuestion Time presenter Fiona Bruce said Alagiah was \u201cthat rare thing \u2013 a first-rate journalist and an all round lovely human being.\u201dShe added: \u201cIntegrity and decency shone through him. That and a mischievous sense of humour with an endearing giggle.\u201dNick Robinson, presenter of BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, paid tribute saying: \u201cGeorge was a brilliant journalist, a lovely man and an inspiring example to all fighting serious illness. His friends will miss him deeply.\u201dBroadcaster John Simpson said: \u201cA gentler, kinder, more insightful and braver friend and colleague it would be hard to find.\u201cI loved having his company in the BBC World Affairs Unit, and his progress after that was a pleasure to watch.\u201dFormer BBC correspondent Jon Sopel added: \u201cTributes will rightly be paid to a fantastic journalist and brilliant broadcaster \u2013 but George was the most decent, principled, kindest, most honourable man I have ever worked with. What a loss.\u201dLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he was \u201cdeeply saddened\u201d by news of Alagiah\u2019s death.He said: \u201cA much-loved face of BBC News for decades, George will also be remembered for his brilliant, fearless journalism as foreign correspondent. He rightly won awards for his evocative, boundary pushing reporting. British journalism has lost a talent. My thoughts are with his family and loved ones.\u201dAfter his diagnosis Alagiah endured two rounds of chemotherapy and several operations, including the removal of most of his liver.He returned to work after his treatment was over but the cancer came back and spread, leading to breaks from the studio while he received treatment.Following his diagnosis, Alagiah also campaigned for cancer charities, including Macmillan Cancer Support and Bowel Cancer UK, to help raise awareness.Before joining the BBC, Alagiah worked as a print journalist and went on to write a number of books including A Home From Home, which looked at what it means to be British.Throughout his illustrious career, he also presented other shows such as Mixed Britannia, looking at the UK\u2019s mixed-race population.He was made an OBE in the 2008 New Year Honours.He is survived by his wife of 40 years, Frances Robathan, their two sons and three grandchildren."}, {"_id": "64bef89d51ac333ca792fa64", "url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/arsenal-fc-vs-barcelona-prediction-kick-off-time-tv-live-stream-team-news-latest-h2h-results-friendly-2023-preview-b1096475.html", "primaryCategory": "Football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Arsenal vs Barcelona: Friendly prediction, kick-off time, TV, live stream, team news, h2h results", "lead": "Arsenal head to the west coast this week for a pre-season friendly against Barcelona.", "author": "Marc Mayo", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 18:41:57", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:18:05.163422", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-24T18:41:57+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "EveningStandard", "image": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2023/07/24/19/Collage%20Maker-24-Jul-2023-07-22-PM-7963.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Arsenal head to the west coast this week for a pre-season friendly against Barcelona.The Spanish giants were forced to cancel their meeting with Juventus last week due to a sickness bug that swept through their camp, making this their first outing of the summer.The Gunners are more advanced in their preparations for the new campaign but suffered defeat to Manchester United last time out.Nonetheless, new signings Declan Rice, Kai Havertz and Jurrien Timber have had plenty of time to get settled on their tour of the United States, which began with a 5-0 win over MLS All-Stars.Barcelona will still provide a sturdy test with only one friendly left to go after this meeting before Arsenal kick their season off in the Community Shield.Read MoreTierney offers update on Arsenal future amid transfer talksTransfer news LIVE!

They can form part of a healthy, balanced diet.It also states that unsweetened calcium-fortified dairy alternatives like soya milks, soya yoghurts and soya cheeses also count as part of this food group and can make good alternatives to dairy products.Abigail Johnson, assistant professor and associate director of the University of Minnesota School of Public Health Nutrition Coordinating Centre, said: \u201cOur results provide evidence that many plant-based milk alternatives are not nutritionally equivalent to cow\u2019s milk.\u201cBased on these findings, consumers should look for plant-based milk alternative products that list calcium and vitamin D as ingredients.\u201cThey may also want to consider adding other sources of calcium and vitamin D to their diets.\u201dThe findings, which are preliminary and have not been peer-reviewed, were presented at Nutrition 2023, the annual meeting of the American Society for Nutrition being held in Boston.Dr Johnson said: \u201cWe know from our dietary assessments for nutrition studies that consumers are choosing more plant-based milk alternatives\u201cThis project aimed to increase the number of these milk alternatives available in the Nutrition Coordinating Center\u2019s database of foods.\u201dProduct labelling requirements and dietary guidance to the public are among the approaches that may be helpful in alerting and educating consumersThe study included nutrition information from nutrition facts labels and ingredient information for 233 plant-based milk alternative products from 23 different manufacturers.For each product, the researchers applied a nutrient calculation program to estimate full nutrient information.They then compared the nutritional content of different products within a category \u2014 for example, almond milk, oat milk, and soy milk \u2014 with each other and with cow\u2019s milk.According to the findings, compared with dairy milk, just 28 of the plant-based alternatives had similar amounts or more calcium, vitamin D and protein.Almost two-thirds of the products included in the study were made from almonds, oats, or soy.Some 170 of the plant-based milk alternatives were fortified with both calcium and vitamin D and that the level of fortification tended to be similar to dairy milk.Specifically, 76% of the oat-based products, 69% of soy-based, and 66% of almond-based alternatives were fortified with both calcium and vitamin D, the study found.Dr Johnson said: \u201cOur findings point to a need to ensure that consumers are aware that many plant-based milk alternative products in the marketplace today are not nutritionally equivalent to cow\u2019s milk.\u201cProduct labelling requirements and dietary guidance to the public are among the approaches that may be helpful in alerting and educating consumers.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64bef89e51ac333ca792fa6a", "url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/insider/greta-gerwig-barbie-movies-directed-narnia-husband-interview-instagram-b1096428.html", "primaryCategory": "Insider", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Greta Gerwig: from mumblecore indie darling to record-breaking Barbie director", "lead": "The awkward It Girl of 2000s indie films has become a writing-directing powerhouse, with this weekend\u2019s Barbie release charting as the biggest opening weekend of any female director in history.

She was obsessed with Leonardo DiCaprio and carried a binder of pictures of him around with her wherever she went. The binder, labelled \u201cpics of Leo\u201d for organisational purposes, annoyed the rest of her family greatly, because it meant she kept draining the printer of all its ink and toner. Nevertheless, she continued her collection and made sure to kiss a picture of Leo every night before she went to sleep. Her obsession came to an abrupt halt, though, when she read in an interview that DiCaprio liked going out to clubs in LA with Tobey Maguire. \u201cI remember thinking, \u2018What will we have to talk about?\u2019\u201d she said in a 2016 Late Night interview.Greta Gerwig in 2016  / Getty ImagesGerwig may have been typical in her desire to smooch the most adored actor on the planet during the 2000s, but she was also an erudite child: she grew up reading Joan Didion, Virginia Woolf and Jane Austen, the latter of who she blames now for \u201c[making] me think that every guy who was a jerk was actually a super nice guy who wanted to marry me,\u201d \u00e0 la Mr Darcy. She went to a Catholic school - we\u2019ll get on to the Lady Bird parallels, don\u2019t you worry - and grew up wanting to be in musical theatre. That part didn\u2019t work out, but this weekend she did manage to break the box office record for the highest earning opening weekend for a female director ever, which isn\u2019t bad for a backup career. In fact, it wasn\u2019t even her first backup... it was her third. There\u2019s a lot to get through between Sacramento and Barbieland, so here\u2019s how Greta Gerwig went from intense child, to indie darling starring in small-time \u201cmumblecore\u201d short films, to one of the most important female directors in the history of film.Her Ladybird-like upbringingGreta Gerwig in 2007 / Getty ImagesIf you\u2019ve ever seen Greta Gerwig\u2019s 2017 hit coming-of-age film Lady Bird, the following is likely to sound familiar to you: Greta Gerwig was raised in Sacramento, California, by her loving father and mother, who worked for a credit union and as an OBGYN nurse respectively. She went to an all-girls Catholic school, St Francis High School, didn\u2019t have a lot of money, but did have what she described as \u201cepic\u201d fights with her mother on the regular. Despite all that, Gerwig insists that Lady Bird is not at all autobiographical. Greta Gerwig and Saorise Ronan, star of Lady Bird, in 2017 / Getty Images\u201cLady Bird is the opposite of how I was in Catholic school. I was a real rule-follower and a people-pleaser and a gold star-getter,\u201d Gerwig told The Hollywood Reporter at the time of the film\u2019s release. \u201cLady Bird is a flawed heroine that I invented [...] Even though I start with things that are close to me, they so quickly spin out and become their own characters,\u201d adding that Lady Bird is \u201cthe girl I wished I could've been, in a way\u201d. Unlike Lady Bird\u2019s dislike for the nuns at her school, Gerwig refers to the nuns who taught her as \u201creally groovy\u201d and says the fights with her mother were never out of a \u201clack of love\u201d. \u201cI always felt like [my parents] were both artists without being artists,\u201d Gerwig told The New York Times in 2017, explaining in another interview that being artistic \u201ccan be a deep part of your existence, whether or not somebody gives you money for it.\u201dHow she got into filmmakingGerwig with Rhys Ifans, Ben Stiller and Noah Baumbach in 2010 / DDP/AFP via Getty ImagesLike Lady Bird, Gerwig was aiming for a degree on the East Coast in summer 2002 - but she wanted to major in musical theatre, something her mum did not approve of. \u201cThis was another of my mum's great moments, where she said, 'I'm not spending $40,000 a year for you to learn how to tap dance,\u2019\u201d Gerwig told The Guardian. Instead, she went to Barnard College, a women's liberal arts college in association with Columbia University, in New York, and studied English with Philosophy, with vague ambitions of becoming a lawyer. In the meantime, Gerwig kept her musical theatre muscles flexed by performing in extra curricular plays with her dormmate, Kate McKinnon (of Saturday Night Live, and now Barbie, fame) and worked as a stage manager. After university, Gerwig went on to star in a series of small \u201cmumblecore\u201d productions headed by director Joe Swanberg: LOL (not the one with Miley Cyrus), Hannah Takes The Stairs and Nights and Weekends. In working with Swanberg, Gerwig grew confident in her co-writing and co-directing abilities, but also became known as an It Girl of the indie movie scene. Ben Stiller and Greta Gerwig in 2010 / Getty ImagesThen, in 2010, she met another up-and-coming director: Noah Baumbach. Baumbach, who was then married to his ex-wife Jennifer Jason Leigh, cast Gerwig in his new project Greenberg, alongside Ben Stiller and Rhys Ifans, which Gerwig expected to be a big hit. It wasn\u2019t - and though Gerwig\u2019s performance did garner praise, it wasn\u2019t enough. \u201cI was really depressed,\u201d she said of this period. \u201cI cried a lot. It was a hard year. I was 25 and thinking, \u2018This is supposed to be the best time and I'm miserable.\u2019 Looking back, I wish I had taken that time and written more, but it felt like acting was happening for me, and I went back to acting classes. The blessing and curse of my life is that I think I thrive when I have a singular purpose and a calling. But actually I'm happiest when I'm doing lots of things. And I have to reconcile that.\u201dFrances Ha onwardsGreta Gerwig at New York Fashion week in 2011 / Getty Images for IMGWhile 2010 may have been a dark time, 2011 was when Gerwig achieved her teenage dream of starring in a Woody Allen movie (she wrote it in her yearbook and everything). Her small role in To Rome With Love was enough to get the right recognition, and by 2012 she was the lead in Baumbach\u2019s next film, Frances Ha, which she also co-wrote. Frances Ha was markedly more successful than Greenberg, helping to boost the careers of both parties, and give Gerwig confidence to start writing projects on her own.There was a brief fork-in-the-road career moment in 2014 when Gerwig was cast as the lead role in \u201cHow I Met Your Dad\u201d, a How I Met Your Mother sequel, but the pilot ultimately wasn\u2019t picked up and never became a series.Greta Gerwig in 2011Instead, she had the time to write alone, and it was then that she wrote Lady Bird. \u201cWriting with a partner is better than writing alone because you can make eachother laugh,\u201d Gerwig told Vogue, \u201cbut writing alone can give you a very deep sense of satisfaction and lonely victory.\u201d Victory indeed, Lady Bird was a commercial and critical success: It grossed $78 million worldwide, with just a $10 million budget, and was nominated for sixteen awards in the 2017 award circuit, including an Oscar for Best Director, which made Gerwig the first woman in eight years (and one of only five women in Oscar history) to be nominated in this category.Greta Gerwig and Saorise Ronan on set of Lady Bird  / A24Then, two years later, while still riding the high of the Lady Bird hype, Gerwig released her adaptation of Little Women, starring Saorise Ronan, Florence Pugh, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Emma Watson and Meryl Streep alongside a crop of fellow rising stars and esteemed actors. She has a special relationship with Ronan and Chalamet, who starred in both Little Women and Lady Bird, and even tried to get them to cameo in Barbie this year, but \u201cboth of them couldn\u2019t do it and I was so annoyed,\u201d Gerwig told CinemaBlend last month. Little Women has a bombshell hit too, and Gerwig\u2019s fame only grew.The Barbie-ification of Greta GerwigGreta Gerwig at the Barbie premiere  / Getty Images for Warner Bros.Gerwig was brought onto the Barbie movie in early 2020, around the exact same time she got really into watching Love Island, which just so happens to be Margot Robbie\u2019s favourite reality TV show. Gerwig co-wrote Barbie from scratch with Baumbach, and Margot Robbie remembered enjoying the pair\u2019s wacky, irreverent script so much she thought it would never get made. \u201cThe first time I read the \u2018Barbie\u2019 script, my reaction was, \u2018Ah! This is so good. What a shame it will never see the light of day,'\u201d Robbie told BAFTA, \u201c\u2018because they are never going to let us make this movie.\u2019 But they did.\u201dGerwig herself felt the same. \u201c[Barbie] felt complicated enough, sticky enough, strange enough, that maybe there could be something interesting there to be discovered,\u201d she told The Guardian, \u201cI kind of had two thoughts: I love this and I can\u2019t bear it if anyone else makes it. And: they\u2019ll never let us make this movie.\u201dGreta Gerwig with her partner Noah Baumbach (Ian West/PA) / PA ArchiveBut they did, indeed. This weekend, Barbie opened at the box office to the tune of $293m worldwide, the biggest opening weekend for a female director in history. Gerwig\u2019s impact upon Barbie is already being felt, and is paying itself back in dividends: she\u2019s just been selected to direct the Chronicles of Narnia reboot for Netflix and has apparently leant a hand on the screenplay for Disney\u2019s upcoming live action adaptation of Snow White. Her agent, Jeremy Barber, recently shared how Gerwig\u2019s ambitions have changed from the small scale projects of her past to the big blockbusters she is coming to be known for today. \u201cHer ambition is not to be the biggest woman director, but [rather] a big studio director,\u201d he told The New Yorker. If 2023 is anything to go by, it looks like Gerwig is well on track to smash that target too. Her happy, messy personal lifeGreta Gerwig in 2022  / Getty ImagesGerwig lives with Baumbach and their two sons in Manhattan, New York. Gerwig gave birth to their first child, Harold, in March 2019, just 24 hours after delivering the first rough cut of Little Women to the studio - her cast and crew didn\u2019t even know she was pregnant. \u201cI didn\u2019t really intend for it to be that way,\u201d Gerwig told W magazine. \u201cIt\u2019s just that at the beginning, you don\u2019t tell anyone. And then at some point, I realized, \u2018Well, maybe I\u2019ll just make it to the end, and no one will know.\u2019 And then I did.\u201d She and Baumbach aren\u2019t married, though she does wear a ring on her finger and they call each other partner because \"'boyfriend' makes it sound like I just met him last week,\" Gerwig explained on The Late Late Show. Then, four months ago, the pair welcomed their second baby, who we don\u2019t know the name of yet. \u201cHe's a little schmoo [...] that's very much his energy,\u201d Gerwig said of her youngest son in an interview with Elle recently, \u201cthe little guy is sleeping through the night. But I\u2019m still doing that thing where I wake up, every hour to 90 minutes, and just hover. You just keep wanting to look at that baby. So I\u2019m slightly in a twilight state.\u201dGreta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach in 2013 / Getty ImagesGerwig is a self-described \u201cmessy person\u201d, a trait she says Baumbach often calls her up on. \u201cNoah always comes home and he\u2019s like, \u2018I can tell exactly what you did [today] because there\u2019s a trail of crap.

Energy efficiency and renewables are the answer to fixing Britain\u2019s broken energy system, not new oil and gas fields like Rosebank which receive billions in tax breaks despite record profiteering from industry.\u201cWe must avoid another winter where pensioners and other vulnerable households are faced with impossible choices again because of government dithering.\u201dAsked whether the Government was delaying the deadline, Downing Street said it was \u201cconsidering the correct approach\u201d as ministers scrutinised net zero plans.The Prime Minister\u2019s official spokesman said: \u201cIt\u2019s right that we ensure proposals take into account the wider developments in energy efficiency and private rented sectors including the upcoming review of the EPC system, the Renters\u2019 Reform Bill, the introduction of the decent home standard in the private sector.\u201cThat\u2019s to ensure that the costs and circumstances relating to energy efficiency improvement are fair and proportionate for landlords and tenants.\u201dThe current proposals would see all new tenancies required to have an energy performance certificate (EPC) rating of C or above by 2025, with this expanded to all existing tenancies by 2028.More than half of tenants live in homes with an EPC rating of D or below, with poorer tenants more likely to live in less energy efficient homes.Climate change think tank E3G estimated that improving energy efficiency would save renters an average of \u00a3570, but landlords would be expected to pay the first \u00a310,000 of any energy efficiency work themselves.A consultation on the energy efficiency target ended in January 2021, but the Government is still to respond.Landlords welcomed the suggestion the deadline could be delayed, saying a lack of clarity meant there was no hope of meeting the deadline.Ben Beadle, chief executive of the National Residential Landlords Association, said: \u201cThe NRLA wants to see properties as energy efficient as possible, but the sector needs certainty about how and when this will happen.\u201cMinisters need to develop a proper plan that includes a fair financial package to support improvements in the private rented sector.\u201cWe will continue to work with all parties to develop pragmatic and workable proposals.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64bef89f51ac333ca792fa6c", "url":

This is home to Dryad Global, one of the surprising number of private security firms and advisors operating out of London right now. There\u2019s also G4S and Aegis Defence Services \u2014 two of the biggest in the world \u2014 which share a home, according to Google Maps, in the very same block tucked behind Victoria Station. AKE, meanwhile, is just near London Bridge, and Team Fusion is nestled between the members\u2019 clubs, tailors and car dealerships of Mayfair. It\u2019s probably not what you think of when you think of private security firms. Yevgeny Prigozhin\u2019s Wagner Group \u2014which, unlike these legally compliant London companies, can be described as mercenaries \u2014 is the best-known in the world right now. For a hot minute this summer it was Wagner forces that, allegedly, attempted to stage a coup to overthrow Putin. Because these guys don\u2019t work for him. They work for whoever\u2019s paying them the most.It\u2019s a big business. Security service revenues worldwide are expected to increase 4.4 per cent per year to \u00a3231 billion in 2026, according to Freedonia Group. And G4S, one of the top five groups in the world along with Aegis, is the second largest private employer in the world behind Walmart, with a presence in 125 countries. But where did they come from, who do they employ and what are they doing?As late as the 19th century, private personnel were deployed with regularity around Europe, with Britain hiring 15,600 foreign mercenaries to join it in the Crimean War in 1854. However, with the development of Europe\u2019s nation states, the notion of fighting for one\u2019s own country solidified. Fighters such as those in the French Foreign Legion and Hitler\u2019s 2,000 Danes were notable exceptions.By the 1960s and 1970s, smaller wars in the global south were piggybacked by a boom of British private military companies. A Foreign and Commonwealth Office document published by a select committee in 2002 explained that these actions \u2018were either seen as an attempt by Western capitalists to retain control of a mineral rich region or as colonialists attempting to retain power\u2019 and called for better regulation. Within months the largest mercenary operation of modern times began in Iraq with the deployment of 48,000 security contractors \u2014 including at least 1,000 Blackwater operatives. Today, mercenaries are deployed in Yemen, Nigeria, Ukraine, Syria and Iraq. Putin is allegedly trying to regularise up to 30 mercenary groups in Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.The UK outlaws fighting for another country if that country is fighting against a country we\u2019re at peace with. So private security companies technically should not send Britons to hostile environments in order to seek out combat. But it\u2019s not always that simple. One former military personnel member who has worked in the private security sector explains: \u2018[it\u2019s] about how far you stretch the definition of \u201csecurity\u201d.\u2018At what point does protecting a convoy or extracting civilians from somewhere turn into an armed confrontation with whoever is the threat? There\u2019s also training and mentoring work \u2014 if a company ends up doing \u201cforward mentoring\u201d, that means they\u2019re not only training the guys; they\u2019re also going out on the ground with them. Again, at which point does the mentor become an active participant once their team gets contacted?\u2019And Simon Cassey, senior vice-president at security industry insurance broker Chesterfield Group, explains: \u2018A lot of people think they\u2019re mercenaries, and they\u2019re definitely not. Mercenaries make war, are paid to cause trouble, to assist in political aims of governments. These men, however, are specifically supporting armies and governments in beneficial and certainly mostly good causes.\u2019 That said, his work does deal in ransom insurance and insurance for loss of life and limb. Indeed, he explains that \u2018although these men should know what they\u2019re getting into, some of them attempt to bring cases against their employer but few succeed.\u2019So what\u2019s the draw of this risky business? Military veterans don\u2019t always have many career options. Iain Overton, an investigative journalist and executive director of charity Action on Armed Violence (AOAV), explains: \u2018The problem is, if you\u2019re a 35-year-old bloke who spent 18 years of your life working in the Paras, and then you might well leave and think that either your next work choice is join the police, or join a security company.\u2019 There are also, he adds, the \u2018Walter Mitty types\u2019 up for an adventure but lacking relevant credentials.With so many British private security groups having boots on the ground in the Middle East and English-speaking African countries, there is also a sense of familiarity. Andrew Jackson, managing director of ex-military recruitment website SaluteMyJob, says: \u2018Many ex-military people go into maritime security, for example, or into or back to places like Iraq and Afghanistan, where they\u2019re often supporting either Nato UK forces that are out there, or businesses that need security or risk management, particularly the energy industry.\u2019 The alternatives, security guard work or police work, are \u2018generally not very well paid\u2019. For those who wear their experience and seniority slapped on their lapels, Overton explains that private security roles allow them to maintain prestige.Once employed by these private security companies, personnel can be working on anything from armed security guards to maintenance and operation of weapon systems, combat support, running prisons and interrogations, intelligence and research. Cassey explains that private security companies can work on stabilising countries that have recently seen conflict, for example, protecting the building of girls\u2019 schools in Afghanistan, where \u2018the Taliban would wait until they\u2019re 85 per cent constructed then come down from the hills and try to destroy them. Well, the security companies prevent them from doing that.\u2019 He hastens to add: \u2018This work is defensive, not offensive.\u2019How far do you stretch the definition of \u2018security\u2019? At what point does extracting civilians turn into an armed confrontation with whoever is the threat?Transparency around pay is unclear, though, as with any private service, these organisations operate outside of public scrutiny. Rates can vary, Overton tells me, from \u00a3125 a day on guard jobs to \u2018eye-watering sums\u2019 if they\u2019re protecting high net worth individuals. AOAV has found Britain has spent \u00a350m on private security companies annually since 2004. Despite such big business, Overton explains: \u2018There\u2019s no real industry standard or quality control on this.\u2019The UK military\u2019s deployment is increasingly democratically driven as MPs vote on military action abroad, individuals are subject to court-martial rules and military data \u2014 where it wouldn\u2019t pose a security risk \u2014 can be made available to the public via Freedom of Information rights. I contacted each of the London-based private security companies mentioned in this article with simple questions, such as, \u2018Does your work ever take in hostile environments?\u2019 and, \u2018What work can employees be expected to do once there?\u2019 \u2014 however, companies like G4S are under no legal obligation to give me any information. This lack of transparency means, the AOAV\u2019s 2018 report states: \u2018It is impossible to determine what the companies are actually capable of.\u2019In some prominent cases the truth has outed; Keenie Meenie Services is currently under investigation by the Metropolitan Police for alleged war crimes committed in Sri Lanka. In 2005, Aegis was alleged to have shot at Iraqi civilians. Later, a former Aegis director admitted that the organisation hired Sierra Leonian fighters \u2014 because \u2018at some point you say I\u2019m afraid all we can afford now is Africans\u2019 \u2014 without assessing if they were former child soldiers.The International Code of Conduct for Private Security Service Providers has been introduced but critics point out that it is self-regulating and few have signed up. A joint statement provided to ES Magazine by the Ministry of Defence and the Home Office says: \u2018The Security Industry Authority (SIA) is responsible for the regulation of the private security industry in the UK...[it] has no role in relation to the provision of security services overseas.\u2019In a crowded market, the cachet of British military men\u2019s experience on the ground in countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan is dwindling as the years pass. And besides, the future is digital. Cassey explains: \u2018The cyber climate is heating up... a lot of the boots on the ground type security companies are looking for that more intellectual work that involves the protection of data from cyber attack.\u2019 It could prove more lucrative, too. But, Overton warns, transparency could wane further still: \u2018We\u2019ll see more of the Cambridge Analytica-style approach, digital intelligence services, and more surveillance-type work.

the first Asian boxer ever to become a four-belt world champion - faces the battle of his career against the planet\u2019s best super-bantamweight.The odds are certainly against Fulton in Inoue\u2019s back yard, but he is a clever, slick, versatile and experienced fighter who has the skills necessary to frustrate and bypass his opponent\u2019s awesome power.Both fighters are undefeated as professionals, with Inoue having been undisputed at 118lbs  / AFP via Getty ImagesAfter demolishing the great Nonito Donaire in a hopelessly one-sided rematch of their bloody 2019 classic, \u2018The Monster\u2019 battered Butler before Christmas, but for a change struggled to find a trademark venomous finish before finally breaking his stubborn resistance with a typically violent barrage in the penultimate round.He won\u2019t have things completely his own way here and we anticipate a few cagey but fascinating rounds where Fulton is able to steer clear of those trademark power punches that reverberate around the area and perhaps even take a lead on the cards.However, you can only avoid the Inoue onslaught for so long, as a record of 21 knockouts from 24 outings can attest, so expect the home favourite to eventually wear down his rival\u2019s defences and inflict his maiden professional defeat via a brutal late stoppage.Inoue to win via late knockout.Fulton vs Inoue weigh-in resultsFulton hit the scales at 121.9lbs, while Inoue came in ever-so-slightly lighter at 121.7lbs.

Wildfires are highly dangerous and unpredictable. \u201cIf you are planning to travel to any areas affected by wildfires, please check with your travel operator or hotel prior to travel that the area you plan to visit [is safe].\u201cThe situation can change quickly, so you should stay up to date with official advice, follow 112 Greece on Twitter for official updates (you may need to translate the tweets to English).

Several travel agencies and airlines are now cancelling flights to Rhodes.There is no assurance that you will receive your money refunded if you decide not to travel unless the Foreign Office advises you to do so or the airline or tour operator cancels your trip.Most insurance policy claims only cover trip cancellations in specific situations, such illness, a death in the family or an unusually long delay to a flight taking off.Additionally, airlines are not obligated to reimburse you if you cancel a trip because of unavoidable circumstances.That said, you might be eligible to request a refund under the provisions of your insurance coverage if you have a pre-existing medical condition and visiting Greece could pose a health risk.As a result of the temperatures, some travel industry professionals have speculated that airlines would provide some compensation.Loading....Which islands are affected?Rhodes is the largest island affected by the fires and 19,000 residents have been evacuated.As well as Rhodes, Corfu is suffering from wildfires. Follow local officials' instructions about when to evacuate if you are on vacation in Corfu.

The costs are likely to be high.\u201d\u201cI believe we should begin preparing for this now, before the inquiry reports,\u201d she said in the letter.Ms Mordaunt told the inquiry she did not receive a written response, or even a formal acknowledgement to say it had been received, but she added there were \u201cdiscussions between officials\u201d.The lack of a response would have been unusual at other times, she said, but noted the situation was \u201cnot normal\u201d during the pandemic.She then wrote again in September 2020, saying: \u201cI cannot stress enough the urgency of taking long overdue action on financial support and compensation.\u201dIn a handwritten addition to the letter, she wrote: \u201cWe have ideas about a solution to this and have been trying for some time to secure a meeting with you.\u201dI think that there is a moral obligation to address the many issues that those affected by this have, and I am very conscious that that can't happen soon enoughIn his written evidence to the inquiry, Mr Sunak said it was \u201cunclear\u201d whether he saw either of Ms Mordaunt\u2019s letters, but that it was not uncommon for his correspondence to be filtered by ministers\u2019 staff.He said a holding response was sent to the second letter in September, but added \u201cI do not know if anything else happened thereafter\u201d.On the time taken to commission a study looking at options for a framework for compensation, first announced in March 2021, Ms Mordaunt said: \u201cThis was against a backdrop of immense activity on that all-consuming issue of the pandemic.\u201cSo I think that was a factor in terms of speed of response to things. But I think not an unreasonable one given how much bandwidth that that issue was absorbing in Government.\u201dAsked if in hindsight it took too long to commission the study, she said: \u201cI think that everything about the situation has taken too long.\u201cIn my shift as paymaster general I do not think we could have worked faster in thrashing out and dealing with some of these issues.\u201dShe also told the inquiry: \u201cI think that there is a moral obligation to address the many issues that those affected by this have, and I am very conscious that that can\u2019t happen soon enough.\u201dApplause could be heard coming from the room when Ms Mordaunt\u2019s evidence session came to an end."}, {"_id": "64bef8a351ac333ca792fa7d", "url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/liam-smith-greater-manchester-father-york-gbh-b1096455.html", "primaryCategory": "Crime", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Acid murder trial hears of secret prison recording", "lead": "Father-of-two Liam Smith was shot and had acid poured on him after a one-night stand, Minshull Street Crown Court in Manchester heard.", "author": "Pat Hurst", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 16:28:52", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:18:11.297419", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-24T16:28:52+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "EveningStandard", "image": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2023/07/24/17/3044ba852d0c81dd641d88986883ddb3Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjkwMzAyMzA4-2.70706704.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "A man accused of a shooting and acid attack murder was caught on tape in a secret prison recording saying \u201cwe both wanted him to suffer\u201d.Michael Hillier, 39, was heard speaking of his involvement in the plot to harm Liam Smith, 38, along with his alleged accomplice, his girlfriend Rachel Fulstow, 37.Both are accused of the joint enterprise murder of Mr Smith after Fulstow had a one-night stand with him then led her new boyfriend, Hillier, to believe she had been raped, Minshull Street Crown Court in Manchester has heard.Hillier has admitted manslaughter and is caught on tape saying his intention was to maim his victim not to kill him.We both wanted him to suffer, you know what I mean, it wasn\u2019t the intention for him to end up deadRead MoreChris Eubank Jr confirms September date for next fightMan admits manslaughter in case of father-of-two killed in gun and acid attack\u2018Astonishing failure\u2019 at prison holding hundreds of sex offendersFive arrested after man stabbed to death in park in WembleyJurors were told Mr Smith was lured out of his home and blasted at close range with a gun by Hillier, 39, who then poured corrosive liquid, probably sulphuric acid, on the face and body of his stricken victim, burning away his flesh.He was left for dead in the street outside his house, with the chemicals still \u201cfizzing\u201d on his body when he was found shortly after the attack in the early evening of November 24 last year.Mr Smith, an electrician from Wigan, Greater Manchester, had had a \u201cbrief liaison\u201d with former nail technician Fulstow, with a one-night stand in a York hotel in 2019.The next year she became the partner of Hillier, who was not happy about the fling and was \u201cled to believe she had been raped\u201d, the court heard.Both Fulstow, from Andrew Drive, York and Hillier, from Ecclesall Road, Sheffield, deny murder.Fulstow has told police she did not know what Hillier was planning to do.On Monday the jury heard of the covert recording of Hillier made in prison following his arrest two months after Mr Smith died.Hillier is heard to say: \u201cShe is trying to like distance herself from it.

For example, Zakynthos, home to the party strip of Zante, is more than 400 miles away from Rhodes, where the fiercest fires are burning.CorfuThe fire on Corfu was burning on a large coastal front, with boats from the area now dispatched to evacuate residents by sea.Once again, the fires appear to have started in the forests, with dry and hot weather conditions causing them to spread to coastal areas.Safety information for CorfuWhilethe fires are less intense on this island, some areas of Corfu are being evacuated, particularly in the south.If you are on holiday in Corfu, you are advised to follow advice from local authorities regarding when to evacuate. If you are unsure if you are affected, you should call your hotel or travel operator.How far is Kos from Corfu?Similarly, Kos is roughly 450 miles away from Corfu and takes just under four hours to fly between the two islands.That means that many other islands are largely unaffected by the wildfires, although are experiencing scorching temperatures at the same time.EviaThe fires in Evia are also on the south of the island, threatening five villages in particular: Livadi, Potami, Pernaraki, Platanistos and Kastro.The fires are smaller than on Corfu and Rhodes, but the smoke is reportedly still thick enough in some areas to be hazardous to health.Safety information for EviaThe inhabitants of these villages are being evacuated to the town of Karystos. The same advice for Corfu and Rhodes applies, with the numbers for the Crisis Management Unit applying to all three islands.How many Greek islands are there?There are 6,000 Greek islands but only 227 islands are inhabited.The five largest are Crete, Evia, Lesbos, Rhodes, and Chios, but the most popular for UK tourists tend to be Rhodes, Crete, Kos, Corfu, and Santorini.READ MORESea evacuations begin in Corfu as wildfires tear through second Greek islandWildfires on Rhodes force hundreds of tourists to flee hotels as temperatures soarGreek wildfires spread as extreme heat alerts issued for Italy and SpainWhich holiday resorts have been evacuated?Thousands of holidaymakers have been evacuated, with all of Rhodes\u2019s hotels and resorts organising ways for both tourists and locals to flee to safety.On Corfu, those living and staying in the areas of Santa, Megoula, Porta, Palia Perithia, and Sinies are being evacuated to Kassiopi, a village on the northeast coast of the island.What to do if your holiday has been cancelled due to the Greek island wildfiresWith both Jet2 and TUI cancelling all flights to Rhodes until next Monday (July 31), if you have an upcoming holiday to Rhodes, Corfu, or Evia, then you should have received a notification from your airline or holiday agent that your trip has been cancelled.Thomas Cook has cancelled all holidays to Kiotari and Lardos \u2014 the areas of Rhodes most at risk \u2014 until July 31 and would be in touch with customers to arrange \u201cswift refunds\u201d.It has also offered full refunds to customers due to depart for other parts of the island on Sunday and Monday who wish to cancel their trip.Easyjet has also cancelled all package holidays to Rhodes, Corfu, and Evia until Tuesday (August 1), but there seems to be a tentative hope that holidays booked for after the middle of next week could still go ahead.Flights by Ryanair and British Airways are currently running as normal.If your flight has been cancelled, then you should be entitled to a full refund, or potentially an option to rebook for another date. Contact the airline if you have not received an email regarding your flight."}, {"_id": "64bef8a451ac333ca792fa80", "url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/shopping/esbest/home-garden/home-accessories/best-summer-duvets-a3881196.html", "primaryCategory": "Home Accessories", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Best summer duvets with a low tog to keep you cool all night long", "lead": "No need to wake up a hot mess this summer - low tog duvets make a dreamy bed companion", "author": "Abha Shah", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 16:23:48", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:18:12.023375", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-24T16:23:48+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "EveningStandard", "image": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2021/04/13/15/best-summer-duvets-2021jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Danny Zuko and Sandy Olsson may have warbled about those summer nights, but we all know that trying to sleep in stifligly warm weather can be more of a nightmare than a rom-com. Not only does sleeping in hot weather demand a change in bedclothes (linens and cottons are breathable, sweat-wicking and as a result, feel cooler against skin) but a change of bedding is a wise investment for summer months too. Enter the summer duvet, a lighter covering with less filling to help you nod off into blissful slumber while still feeling cocooned. Before we show you the best summer duvets to invest in right now, here\u2019s a quick guide to everything you need to know about them.READ MOREBest firm mattresses 2023: Pocket sprung, hybrid and memory foam mattresses for extra supportBest cooling pillows that help with night sweatsBest memory foam pillows for neck support and comfortWhat is a tog exactly? First off, togs. They\u2019re a measurement of warmth, but more specifically, the effectiveness of the material\u2019s ability to trap warm air within its fibres. High togs trap more air, making them warmer to burrow into when it's chilly out. In the summer, you should look out for a low tog duvet which encourages airflow and keeps you cool. What tog rating should I look for in a summer duvet? When shopping for a summer duvet for your bedroom, an ideal tog rating is 4.5 or less. Does a higher tog mean the duvet is thicker? No necessarily. You can have a plump duvet with a low tog rating, making it like a squishy, airy cloud. Thickness is down to the material. READ MOREBest smart fans to keep you cool over the summer monthsBest tower fans: Oscillating, quiet fans to keep your home coolBest cooling mattresses for hot sleepers UKWhat is the difference between natural and synthetic fillings? Natural duvets have duck and goose feather-filling as well as down, all of which are more insulating so tend to be a lot warmer with less filling. Meanwhile, synthetic duvets are made with polyester, which require more material for the same tog rating as a natural duvet. Synthetic options can be made from hollow fibres or microfibres, the former being a more effective way to trap warmth, the latter as a higher quality option that mimics down filling in a more lightweight fashion. Choosing between these types of duvets comes down to personal choice, budget, and allergies - many allergy sufferers prefer synthetic duvets because they won\u2019t trigger reactions.Now you\u2019re armed with all the summer duvet-buying info you\u2019ll ever need, the only thing left for us to do is show the best super low tog rating options to buy right now.From all-vegan, to synthetic and duck and goose feather, see our favourite summer duvets to bring the \u2018whooo-aaaa\u2019 back to your summer nights.Shop belowREAD MOREBest mattresses of 2023 reviewed: Memory foam, pocket spring and hybrid optionsBest babies and children\u2019s mattresses UK for a great night\u2019s sleepBest mattresses for front sleepers for support and comfortSimba Summer Hybrid DuvetSimbaTog: 4.5 No one does cooling sleep technology quite like Simba, and the brand\u2019s Summer Hybrid duvet is no exception.

The 36-year-old had written an apology in 2020 in response to the harassment allegations on Twitch (as seen in the above Tweet).

National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \u2013 its highest category.Human-induced climate change has been steadily warming the oceans which have absorbed 90 per cent of the excess heat produced by greenhouse gas emissions.Meanwhile, natural occurrences such as changes in wind patterns have driven the North Atlantic ocean\u2019s temperature to record highs, scientists said.El Nino, a naturally occurring warming event in the eastern tropical Pacific, has also had an impact, driving up average ocean and air temperatures around the world, but its effects are not thought to be linked to the heatwave in the North Atlantic.Read MoreRhodes inferno must be wake-up call on global warming, says ministerAmsterdam bans cruise ships to limit tourism and curb pollution Sardinia sizzles in 46C as Italian cities placed on heatwave red alertSPONSOREDSeven underrated gin cocktails and where to get themExperts say climate change is shifting the temperature baseline, making heatwaves more frequent and more extreme and they can be just as devastating for some marine life as that on land.Dr Christopher Free, of the Marine Institute at University of California, Santa Barbara, said: \u201cIn the last decade, marine heatwaves have disrupted fisheries all around the world.\u201cIf conditions in the North Atlantic stay hot, similar catastrophes may be on the horizon.\u201dFish in the ocean, which lies between the east coast of North America and the UK and western Europe, depend on cooler waters for spawning, with one species \u2013 the Norwegian spring spawning herring \u2013 declining by 40% since 2009, which is thought to be due to the warming oceans.The MSC is concerned that a combination of warming oceans and poor international management will lead to a crash in fish stocks that would put thousands of people out of work.Dr Olav Sigurd Kjesbu, of the Institute of Marine Research in Norway, said: \u201cWe know these pelagic fish stocks are sensitive to temperature changes.\u201cWe have already seen that climate affects their distribution, their ability to spawn and mortality rates.\u201cRapid warming of the seas could accelerate these changes. They could also have a significant impact on the ability of herring and blue whiting to reproduce based on recent analyses.\u201dProfessor Geraint Tarling, an ocean biologist at the British Antarctic Survey, said many species are moving north towards the Arctic and replacing native species there in a process known as Atlantification.Dr Craig Donlon, head of Earth surfaces and interior section at the European Space Agency, described this year\u2019s North Atlantic temperature rise as a \u201cscary situation\u201d but added the ecosystem will adapt, with species migrating north replaced by others coming from the south.He said: \u201cWe can expect to see changes of biology structure, the ecosystem will adapt.\u201cSome species will migrate further north into the water that they feel more comfortable in, in terms of temperature, and of course, other species will migrate north into our waters from the south, bringing a bit more diversity.\u201dThe UK Government announced last week its plans to begin a large-scale monitoring programme of pelagic trawlers above 24 metres, fitting them with cameras and GPS to record the size and species of their catches in English waters in an effort to manage stocks more sustainably.Erin Priddle, the MSC\u2019s regional director for Europe, said: \u201cPolicy-makers must find a way to incorporate stock shift changes, such as changing distributions of the North East Atlantic pelagics, into long-term and robust fisheries management plans.\u201cWithout joined-up and effective planning, our fisheries resources could be put at risk of overexploitation, overfishing, and even stock collapse.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64bef8a651ac333ca792fa88", "url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/who-is-charlotte-owen-youngest-life-peer-boris-johnson-honours-list-b1087197.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Who is Charlotte Owen?

The former special adviser was a surprise inclusion on Mr Johnson\u2019s resignation honours\u2019 list given that she is believed to have only had a series of backroom political jobs in the administrations of the ex-PM and his successor, Liz Truss.The list contained 38 honours and seven peerages, including former Downing Street chief of staff Dan Rosenfield and Kulveer Singh Ranger who worked with Mr Johnson when he was London mayor.However, Owen was one of the most discussed names on the list due to her age.

In 2015, she received a 2:1 in politics and international relations from the University of York. Before taking a position as a special adviser to\u00a0prime ministers Johnson and Liz Truss, she worked as an intern and parliamentary assistant. Owen split her\u00a0time equally between Chris Heaton-Harris, the chief whip and parliamentary secretary to the Treasury, and Mr Johnson. Sky News\u2019s Liz Bates said: \u201cShe\u2019s had a few jobs in Parliament. One of those was working for Boris Johnson. She did in the end work for the Number 10 policy unit. And I think at the end of her political career she was working for Liz Truss and the chief whip at the time, not an illustrious political career by any stretch, but she will go to the House of Lords as well.\u201dShe has worked in politics for approximately five years and eight months, meaning she has gone from parliamentary intern to baroness in just under six years.Who else was rewarded on the honours list?Along with Owen, other young peers include Ben Gascoigne and Ross Kempsell.Jacob Rees-Mogg and Priti Patel, both former Cabinet ministers\u00a0under Johnson also received recognition, he a knighthood and she a damehood. Former ministers Andrea Jenkyns and Amanda Milling also received damehoods.Ben Houchen, the mayor of Tees Valley, and Shaun Bailey, a former London mayoral candidate and member of the London Assembly, are two of the new peers.In order to prevent by-elections for the Conservatives, no serving MPs were given peerages. Former culture secretary Nadine Dorries and former Cop26 president Sir Alok Sharma were not put forward for the House of Lords. The government reportedly rejected the nominations at the last minute to avert the possibility of two potentially disastrous by-elections.However, Grant Shapps, the secretary for energy security, claimed that Downing Street had no influence over recommendations for peerages."}, {"_id": "64bef8a651ac333ca792fa89", "url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/cricket/ashes-2023-england-australia-b1096448.html", "primaryCategory": "Cricket", "subCategories": "test", "title": "The Ashes: Blame game begins over how England missed out on epic Oval series decider", "lead": "Test cricket misses a golden opportunity as the Old Trafford rain spoils hopes of a Fifth-Test shootout with Australia in London", "author": "Malik Ouzia", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 15:58:52", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:18:14.314850", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-24T15:58:52+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "EveningStandard", "image": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2023/07/24/16/newFile-5.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Welcome to this evening\u2019s therapy session. Come in, have a seat. Or better still, lie down, relax, and let\u2019s get it all out. Now then, with which grievance shall we begin?There are plenty to choose from, plenty of places we have all turned to over the past 24 hours to channel our frustrations that after all the hype, and all the delivery on the hype, it is rain, mere pesky precipitation, that has denied England a shot at regaining the Ashes and us all what might have been the occasion of a cricketing lifetime, a first genuine, winner-take-all decider from a 2-2 scoreline since 1937.The most sober introspection would start at the start, with the opportunities squandered with both bat and in the field at Edgbaston, a Test in which England made all the running but were never quite ruthless enough to pull clear, eventually reeled in in the final furlong by a team in more clinical mood. This, however, does not feel the time for sobriety, so pour a glass and let us plough on.To Lord\u2019s, where, despite Ben Stokes\u2019s latest epic, Australia, led by Pat Cummins, were value winners. It was a result that left England no margin for error and raised the possibility that, even after winning at Headingley, one washout and the first Bazball draw would be enough to deliver a killer blow. Its realisation is the source of all English frustration now, the knowledge that nothing could have been done to prevent it only amplified by the wondering whether, just maybe, something could.Washed away: England\u2019s hopes of forcing an Oval Ashes decider were ruined by the weather  / Getty ImagesRead MoreEngland name same squad for Ashes finale but could freshen up attackStokes frustrated as \u2018pretty much perfect\u2019 England display not enoughThe Ashes: England\u2019s charge comes too late as rain prevents epic finaleSPONSOREDHow to keep your energy costs down all year roundMight Stokes have declared sooner on day three, rather than indulge Jonny Bairstow\u2019s century pursuit? Perhaps, but the runs added with James Anderson swelled the lead to make batting once \u2014 the most likely route to victory in a shortened game \u2014 a genuine shot.What about over-rates, with 26, an entire session\u2019s worth, lost across the first three days? That time may well have come in handy, but consider the causes \u2014 the volume of seam bowling, Stokes\u2019s field changes to enact batter-specific ploys, England\u2019s spraying of the ball to the fence \u2014 and it is clear that slowing the game while accelerating it is to some extent inevitable, and speeding up would not come without cost.So, then the gripes (of varying merit) stray into the realms of logistics: start and finish times that fail to make full use of the British summer\u2019s protracted daylight; the lack of reserve days for rain; that a drawn series is enough to retain the Urn in the first place; northern Tests (no worries there in 2027); the surrendering of August (when, of course, it has never rained) to the Hundred; cricketers being allowed to eat lunch.It is hard to understate what a boon these seven days might have been for cricket in this country, to underestimate the fever pitch that might have been reachedThe more genuine of these are long-standing grumbles about things woven into the very fabric of the Test game and while that might not necessarily make them unalterable, on the back of a stinging result is probably not the time to make the credible, clear-eyed case.Maybe the profile of this particularly underwhelming denouement should make it the straw that breaks the camel\u2019s back, but asked about both reserve days and the draw-retention rule, Stokes was not in the mood for change.Ultimately, the search for blame, understandable as it is, is being conducted in a soggy void, borne of the longing for that little Urn, yes, but more for what this week might have been.It is hard to understate what a boon these seven days might have been for cricket in this country, to underestimate the fever pitch that might have been reached. It is hard, given the state of flux the Test game finds itself in, to escape the nagging feeling that it might never be this good again.\nThe Ashes 2023 | England v Australia1/18The Ashes 2023 | England v Australia\n\nAustralia\u2019s Pat Cummins (left) and England\u2019s Ben Stokes pose for a photo with The Ashes urn prior to day one of the first Ashes test match at Edgbaston, BirminghamPAEngland\u2019s players stand for a minutes silence in memory of the victims of a knife and van attack that killed three people in the city of Nottingham, ahead of the start of play on day one of the first Ashes Test cricket match between England and Australia at Edgbaston, BirminghamAPAustralia\u2019s players stand for a minutes silence in memory of the victims of a knife and van attack that killed three people in the city of Nottingham, ahead of the start of play on day one of the first Ashes Test cricket match between England and Australia at Edgbaston, Birmingham,APA detailed view of the Ashes Trophy and urn prior to Day One of the LV= Insurance Ashes 1st Test match between England and Australia at EdgbastoGetty ImagesAustralia\u2019s Pat Cummins in action as he bowls the first ball of the test Action Images via ReutersZak Crawley of England hits a four from the first ball during Day One of the LV= Insurance Ashes 1st Test match between England and Australia at Edgbaston Getty ImagesFans arriving on day one of the first Ashes test match at Edgbaston, Birmingham.PAA fan is fancy dress poses for a selfie with another fan in the stands ahead of the first testAction Images via ReutersA general view of Edgbaston cricket ground, ahead of the opening day of the first Ashes test matchPAAustralia\u2019s Pat Cummins is seen on the big screen during a minutes silence to honour the victims of the Nottingham attackAction Images via ReutersCricket fans in fancy dress on day one of the first Ashes test match at Edgbaston, BirminghamPAFans arriving on day one of the first Ashes test match at Edgbaston, Birmingham.PAAustralia fans in the stands on day one of the first Ashes test match at Edgbaston, BirminghamPAAustralia\u2019s Pat Cummins (left) and England\u2019s Ben Stokes pose for a photo with The Ashes urn prior to day one of the first Ashes test match at Edgbaston, BirminghamPA\n\n \n\n\nThe mood at Old Trafford as the inevitable realisation crept in yesterday was somewhere only just north of funereal, corridors and concourses littered with people here in all manner of capacities exchanging the same empathetic nod.

As for the spectators, they were pining for local lads Matt Jordan and Tommy Fleetwood, or else for Rory McIlroy to end his nine-year barren run in the majors.All three threatened to make a push for the Claret Jug at different stages but all lacked the consistency of Harman over the course of the four days.This will not go down in history as a vintage Open but predominantly because of Harman\u2019s dominance and his steadfastness in horrible conditions on a final day which he likened to golfing Armageddon. For his rivals, it must have felt that way.A capitulation from the American briefly loomed on the horizon with bogeys on the second and fifth holes of his final round taking him back to 10-under, but that and the threat of a contest were immediately extinguished by back-to-back birdies on the very next two holes.Read MoreThe Open: Harman cruises to stunning six-shot victory for first major winYellow rain warning issued across northern England and Wales for SundayThe Open: Harman rallies to maintain five-shot lead as Rahm chargesSPONSOREDRaise your glass to a premium gin with a differenceBy the time he sunk his final putt on the 18th, his winning margin was six strokes, the biggest at the Open since Louis Oosthuizen in 2010.It was Harman\u2019s 60th putt inside 10 feet over the course of his four rounds. Of those 60, he missed just one and, while his chasers almost seemed to be magnets for the myriad bunkers, he found the sandy stuff just twice all week, the second on his final hole.Accuracy: Harman was automatic with the putter as he led wire-to-wire at Royal Liverpool  / Getty ImagesSuch statistics go a long way to explaining how the unheralded Harman managed to triumph and pocket a winner\u2019s cheque for \u00a31.8million.While he was unheard of to most on these shores before this week, this wasn\u2019t quite the shock the bookies would have you believe. Harman began the week at 26th in the world and showed he had a penchant for links golf when finishing sixth at last year\u2019s Open. And yet, he had not won on tour since 2017. What a time and place to correct that.In the aftermath, he admitted the numbers had bothered him. \u201cIt\u2019s been hard to deal with,\u201d he said. \u201cSomeone mentioned that I\u2019ve had more top 10s than anyone since 201, so that\u2019s a lot of times where you are like, \u2018damn it, man\u2019. It just didn\u2019t happen for whatever reason. I don\u2019t know why this week but I\u2019m very thankful that it was.\u201dNow he is inside the world\u2019s top 10 and has almost certainly done enough to be an automatic pick for the American Ryder Cup team, which will be skippered by his good friend Zach Johnson.If the Americans had a single 10-foot putt to win the Ryder Cup, Harman would undoubtedly be their pickHarman had this week revealed a penchant for hunting with a bow and arrow, and then eating his prey. Such an admission had earned him the nickname the Butcher of Hoylake, one which he seemed to embrace.Harshly, there were boos for him on the first tee, the negative reception playing a role in him staying well out in front.He recalled: \u201cA guy when I was passing him said, \u2018Harman, you don\u2019t have the stones for this\u2019. That helped. It helped snap me back into thinking, \u2018I\u2019m good enough to do this. I\u2019m going to do this. I\u2019m going to go through my process and the next shot is going to be good\u2019. If they wanted me to not play well they should have been really nice to me.\u201dHis plan of celebration to return home and mow the lawn on a brand new giant orange tractor hardly gave the impression that Harman is going to be any sort of rabble-rouser when it comes to trying to down Europe on home soil in Rome later this year.He\u2019s no Patrick Reed nor Ian Poulter but, if the Americans had a single 10-foot putt to win the event, Harman would undoubtedly be their pick.

Supposedly, a Zen monk known as Eisai introduced the first matcha seeds to the garden of a Buddhist temple in 12th century Kyoto, Japan.In the decades and centuries that followed, traditional tea ceremonies involving matcha became ingrained in Japanese culture. These ceremonie are called \u201cchanoyu\u201d and are believed to create a bond between a host and a guest, as well as promote healing and inner-peace. Today, matcha is a much-loved, jitter-free alternative to traditional caffeinated drinks such as coffee.

The other owners are German utility giant RWE (30%), Canadian investment group CDPQ (25%) and Abu Dhabi green energy company Masdar (20%). It is operated by RWE from the Port of Ramsgate.The lead investor Greencoat UK Wind is a listed renewable infrastructure fund, which already has holdings in 46 operating UK wind farms with net generating capacity of 1652MW. \u00d8rsted CFO Daniel Lerup said: \u201cWe\u2019re very pleased to have found a strong new owner for our remaining minority interest in London Array.\u201d The deal is scheduled to complete at the end of July 1690190609Prudential and Burberry struggle in subdued session, Ocado ralliesOcado shares were given another lift today as investors cheered a long-awaited deal to end the company\u2019s \u201crobot wars\u201d patent case.The grocery warehouse technology stock has now more than doubled in value since sliding to the brink of FTSE 100 relegation in early June.Today\u2019s rise of 9% or 62.2p to 749.2p followed the weekend disclosure that Ocado and Norway\u2019s AutoStore had settled their three-year intellectual property dispute. Ocado will receive \u00a3200 million and the two companies will be free to commercialise their patent portfolios.The fast-tracking of Ocado shares came in a session when investors were otherwise content to be on the sidelines at the start of a busy week for earnings on both sides of the Atlantic.The US Federal Reserve and European Central Bank are also due to increase interest rates by another 0.25%, but traders will be more focused on this week\u2019s guidance from policymakers over whether the moves represent the peak of the cycle.Ahead of these developments, the FTSE 100 index edged 3.57 points higher to 7667.30 and the FTSE 250 index by 47.06 points to 19,247.51.Asia-focused stocks were among those under pressure after Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index slumped by more than 2% due to ongoing fears over the China economy.Big fallers included Prudential, which declined 22.5p to 1021.5p, and the luxury goods group Burberry after a drop of 44p to 2200p. In the mining sector, Anglo American fell 21p to 2368p and Rio Tinto by 16p to 5124p after analysts at Credit Suisse cut their price target on both companies.Top performing stocks in the FTSE 250 included pork, poultry and convenience foods supplier Cranswick, which jumped 72p to 3416p after announcing a stronger-than-expected start to its financial year.The East Yorkshire-based company, which employs 13,700 people at 22 sites in the UK, said revenues rose 14.7% amid resilient demand in the 13 weeks to 24 June.There was also further support for Royal Mail owner International Distributions Services after Peel Hunt removed its \u201csell\u201d recommendation.

The slogan was designed by a business then called Saatchi & Saatchi.That led to complaints from Labour\u2019s Denis Healey that the Tories were \u201cselling politics like soap-powder\u201d.M&C was set up in 1995 by partners including MacLennan.In 2019 M&C had to admit its own accounts weren\u2019t working either. A review by PwC found accounting errors of towards \u00a312 million due to errors that went back to 2014. Then chief executive David Kershaw and other executives quit.A probe by the Financial Conduct Authority followed, as did a contentious takeover by by tech entrepreneur Vin Murria, who had become the biggest shareholders with a 12.5%.Then chairman Gareth Davis always said the all-share offer did not reflect the firm\u2019s future potential. Internally, there was significant opposition to Murria\u2019s bid, with questions about the \u201ccultural\u201d fit of the deal.MacLennan was paid \u00a31.4 million last year including a bonus of \u00a3650,000. After 28 years with the business he also holds shares worth many millions.He will also get paid for another 12 months while on gardening leave.MacLennan said: \"It has been a rare privilege to work for three decades with people I respect and like, creating work that has had an extraordinary impact on the world. M&C Saatchi is well set for the future and now is the right time to make way for fresh energy and ideas. Thanks to all past and present, and to those in the future who I know will keep the M&C Saatchi flame burning bright.\" M&C shares rose 2p to 150p 1690193303Slow July private sector growth \u2018reignites recession worries\u2019Private-sector growth in the UK in July fell to its lowest rate in six months, in the latest sign that the Bank of England\u2019s rate rises are beginning to slow the economy down and could potentially tip the country into recession.The S&P Global /CIPS Flash PMI came to 50.7 for the month, well below the expected 52.3 and June\u2019s 52.8. However, that still remains above 50, the threshold that separates growth from decline.Manufacturing declined again, with a reading of 46.5, down from 48.1 in June. The dominant service sector, meanwhile continued to grow but more slowly with a reading of 51.5.But there was good news on inflation, as growth in prices charged hit its lowest total in two-and-a-half years.Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence said: \u201cThe UK economy has come close to stalling in July which, combined with gloomy forward-looking indicators, reignites recession worries.\u201cJuly\u2019s flash PMI survey data revealed a deepening manufacturing downturn accompanied by a further cooling of the recent resurgence of growth in the service sector.\u201cAn upside to the deteriorating growth and demand picture is a further cooling of inflationary pressures. Manufacturing prices are falling at an increased rate and service sector inflation is continuing to moderate. Although ongoing upward wage pressures mean service sector price growth remains elevated, the survey data signal further, potentially marked, falls in consumer price inflation in the months ahead.\u201dRead more hereLatest updatesOlder updates"}, {"_id": "64bef8a851ac333ca792fa90", "url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/west-government-royal-navy-marks-spencer-industry-b1096443.html", "primaryCategory": "Politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "UK\u2019s defence industry is not a Marks & Spencer\u2019s operation, says ex-top brass", "lead": "Former head of the Royal Navy Lord West urged the Government to move away from a \u2018just-enough, just-in-time\u2019 approach.", "author": "Martina Bet", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 15:38:37", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:18:16.126380", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-24T15:38:37+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "EveningStandard", "image": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2023/07/24/16/b4e7e8cf6da5987b01966f650783b840Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjkwMjk3NzYw-2.47973531.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "The UK\u2019s defence industry cannot be compared to a Marks & Spencer \u201cknocking out women\u2019s underwear\u201d as it is much harder to provide missiles and weapons systems, a former top brass has said.The former head of the Royal Navy Lord West of Spithead raised concerns about the pace and efficiency of the UK\u2019s defence industry in meeting demands, as he called for a much more comprehensive strategy.The independent crossbench peer urged the Government to move away from a \u201cjust-enough, just-in-time\u201d approach when it comes to replacing ammunition and missile stocks given to Ukraine.His comments came after defence minister Baroness Goldie told the House of Lords substantial contracts had been placed to directly replace munitions granted to Ukraine.These orders included next-generation light anti-tank weapons, Starstreak high-velocity missiles, lightweight multirole missiles, Javelin missiles, Brimstone missiles, 155 mm artillery rounds, and 5.56 millimetre rifle rounds.Read MoreTobias Ellwood facing Defence Committee no confidence vote after Taliban remarksVaradkar to stress morale boost EU accession could offer to Ukraine\u2019s soldiersTata did not choose UK for \u00a34bn battery plant just for taxpayer cash \u2013 SunakSPONSOREDSips for the summer monthsDespite the progress, Lord West expressed his dissatisfaction with the time it took to initiate the orders, saying: \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt it\u2019s been a long time before we got various orders in.\u201cThe Ukrainian war started 17 months ago, and a number of members in this House\u2026 referred to the need to put in various orders.\u201cAnd it\u2019s not surprising because actually for too long we have run a \u2018just-enough, just-in-time\u2019 type philosophy, as regards war stocks and replacing ammunition and missiles.\u201dHe went on: \u201cWe are not a Marks & Spencer knocking out women\u2019s underwear.\u201cThat is not the basis on which we are providing stuff.

That is not the basis on which we are providing stuff.

We know that. The MoD (Ministry of Defence) has engaged closely.

hit out at \u201ctop-down targets\u201d on housebuilding as Downing Street insisted he stands by the Conservative manifesto commitment to build 300,000 homes a year by the mid-2020s.Housing Secretary Michael Gove, delivering a speech on planning reforms in London on Monday, expressed his commitment to the target, but did not say when it would be reached.Ministers are well short of the figure after the Prime Minister last year made it advisory rather than mandatory as he looked to see off a potential backbench rebellion.There were signs of more local Tory opposition to his housing strategy as Conservative MP for South Cambridgeshire Anthony Browne vowed to \u201cdo everything\u201d to stop the \u201cnonsense plans to impose mass housebuilding on Cambridge\u201d.Responding to the criticism, Mr Sunak stressed the importance of taking \u201clocal communities along with you\u201d as he said Westminster politicians should not \u201cride roughshod over those views, impose top-down targets, carpet over the countryside\u201d.Read MoreMordaunt: Government not dragging feet on infected blood victims\u2019 compensationRepatriation flights return British holidaymakers from Rhodes after

year still stands, the Prime Minister told reporters at a housing development site in the West Midlands: \u201cWe are making progress, I\u2019m proud of that progress and we\u2019re not stopping there.\u201cBut we\u2019ve got to do it in the right way, I don\u2019t want to concrete over the countryside, that\u2019s something that is very special about Britain.\u201cWe\u2019re making it easier for people to expand homes upwards and outwards, we\u2019re making it easier to build on brownfield sites with more investment, and we\u2019re investing in the planning system.\u201dAlthough Mr Sunak did not explicitly say he remains committed to the 2019 pledge, his official spokesman later insisted he does while emphasising the Government is on course to meet its target of building one million homes between 2019 and 2024.\u201cObviously we want to continue the progress towards that 300,000 per year commitment, and obviously we are on track for delivering a million more by the end of the Parliament,\u201d the official told reporters.It comes two weeks after the cross-party Levelling Up, Housing and Communities Committee warned that Tory ministers are unlikely to deliver it and said Mr Sunak\u2019s decision to drop the compulsory target is \u201calready having a damaging impact on efforts to increase the building of new homes\u201d.Mr Gove said after a speech in King\u2019s Cross: \u201cThe 300,000 target by the middle of this decade is one I completely stand by.\u201dAsked when the Government is expected to hit it, he said: \u201cAs soon as we possibly can.\u201dHe said rampant inflation makes \u201cdelivering against that target more difficult\u201d but that he is \u201cconfident we are on a trajectory to reach that 300,000 target\u201d.Labour demanded the Government publish any impact assessment it carried out into the move to ditch the compulsory housebuilding target.Shadow housing secretary Lisa Nandy said: \u201cThe Government has never met its target to build 300,000 homes a year and today\u2019s announcement doesn\u2019t come close to matching the scale of ambition needed to fix the housing crisis.\u201cFamilies and young people desperate to get on the housing ladder deserve to know what assessment the Government made of Rishi Sunak\u2019s reckless decision to scrap housing targets, which has pushed housebuilding off a cliff.\u201dIn his speech, the Housing Secretary set out measures including on leasehold reform, simplifying planning procedures, expanding planning capacity, and regenerating and reviving inner cities.A new \u201cinner city renaissance\u201d is the most important component of the strategy, Mr Gove said, as he argued for \u201cusing all of the levers that we have to promote urban regeneration rather than swallowing up virgin land\u201d.He said there is a \u201cdirect contrast\u201d with Labour on the issue, with the Opposition pledging to make it easier to build on unsightly parts of the green belt.The proposals include developing a new urban quarter in Cambridge with space for homes, art facilities, laboratories and green areas.But Mr Browne lashed out at the plan, tweeting: \u201cI will do everything I can to stop the Government\u2019s nonsense plans to impose mass housebuilding on Cambridge, where all major developments are now blocked by the Environment Agency because we have quite literally run out of water. Our streams, rivers and ponds already run dry.\u201dIn response, Mr Gove said he believes his colleagues will be won over by the detail of the plans.The senior Tory said: \u201cIt will be the case that, I\u2019m sure, Conservative backbenchers and others, once they have a chance to look at our plans, will realise that this is in the national interest and that\u2019s why we\u2019re acting.\u201dConcerns have been raised that Mr Gove\u2019s proposals to slash red tape to pave the way for more conversions of shops and takeaways into houses could lead to substandard housing.Polly Neate, chief executive of the charity Shelter, described his speech as \u201ca real mixed bag\u201d.\u201cWe need proper investment to build much-needed genuinely affordable homes, not more piecemeal reform,\u201d she said.\u201cConverting takeaways and shops into homes and restricting building to city centres won\u2019t help. It could risk creating poor quality, unsafe homes that cause more harm than good.\u201cWhen we are losing more social housing than we build, the Government must work with councils to deliver the quality homes local communities across the country need.\u201cThe Secretary of State clearly agrees these homes are essential, so the Government should put its money where its mouth is and get on with building a new generation of social homes.\u201dMr Gove argued for \u201cgentle densification\u201d of inner cities, saying the urban sprawl of the past has hurt productivity.But Ant Breach, senior analyst at Centre for Cities, said densification will not solve every problem.\u201cCities will need to expand outwards too, and this means green belt reform is essential. Only by building both up and out of cities will we start to close the gap on England\u2019s 4.3 million missing homes.\u201dMick Platt, director of the Residential Freehold Association, said the Government must \u201cthink carefully\u201d about the challenges associated with high-density housing.\u201cManaging large, complex apartment buildings is not straightforward and the Government\u2019s leasehold reform agenda risks pushing this responsibility on to residents, many of whom do not want it.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64bef8a851ac333ca792fa93", "url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/culture/film/women-top-grossing-films-female-directors-barbie-greta-gerwig-b1096422.html", "primaryCategory": "Film", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Top-grossing films directed by women as Greta Gerwig breaks records with Barbie", "lead": "Barbie\u2019s early success has given Greta Gerwig the biggest first weekend return at the box office for a female director in film history.", "author": "William Mata", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 15:36:24", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:18:16.858710", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-24T15:36:24+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "EveningStandard", "image": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2023/07/18/09/GettyImages-1537555784.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Barbie\u2019s early success has given Greta Gerwig the biggest first weekend return at the box office for a female director in film history.It could now become one of the highest grossing films ever with a woman behind the camera, with the current record being Jennifer Lee\u2019s Frozen II.A huge marketing campaign and healthy competition with Oppenheimer, which also opened on Friday, propelled Barbie into the stratosphere of ratings. \nMargot Robbie and Ryan Gosling attend Barbie Photo Call at Four Seasons Hotel Los Angeles1/10Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling attend Barbie Photo Call at Four Seasons Hotel Los Angeles\n\nREUTERSREUTERSGetty ImagesGetty ImagesJordan Strauss/Invision/APGetty ImagesREUTERSREUTERS\n\n \n\n\nAnd after rave reviews \u2013 including this five star one from the Standard\u2019s Charlotte O\u2019Sullivan \u2013 it could stick around for weeks to come and be one of the smash hits of 2023.Read MoreMargot Robbie\u2019s friends made fun of her for not kissing Ryan Gosling in BarbieAmy Winehouse biopic will \u2018nail\u2019 singer\u2019s sense of humour, says Mark RonsonBarbenheimer weekend generates almost \u00a330m at UK box officeSPONSOREDRaise your glass to a premium gin with a differenceHere is how Barbie\u2019s box office success compares with other films directed by women.What has Barbie made at the box office so far?Barbie made $377 million (\u00a3295 million) at the US box office over the weekend and \u00a318.5 million in the UK.On the home front, this puts Barbie behind only James Bond film No Time To Die (\u00a321 million) and Spider-Man: No Way Home (\u00a319.5 million) for films released after the pandemic.

He simply was a wonderful human being.\u201dAlagiah, who was born in Sri Lanka, continued to present for the BBC when he was not receiving treatment.He joined the corporation in 1989 and spent many years as one of its leading foreign correspondents before moving to presenting.He was often a specialist in Africa and covered the civil wars in Somalia and Liberia as well as the genocide in Rwanda 20 years ago.Throughout his career he interviewed central political figures, among them former South African president Nelson Mandela, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, and ex-Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe.He was nominated for a Bafta in 1994 for his coverage of Saddam Hussein\u2019s genocidal campaign against the Kurds of northern Iraq and was named Amnesty International\u2019s journalist of the year in 1994 for reporting on the civil war in Burundi.He first began hosting the 6pm news bulletin in early 2003, but stepped up to front it solo four years later following the departure of his co-host, Natasha Kaplinsky.Kaplinsky said it was a \u201cprivilege\u201d to be friends with Alagiah as she paid tribute.\u201cGoodbye dearest George.

My thoughts are with his family and loved ones.\u201dAfter his diagnosis Alagiah endured two rounds of chemotherapy and several operations, including the removal of most of his liver.He returned to work after his treatment was over but the cancer came back and spread leading to breaks from the studio while he received treatment.Appearing in a campaign in aid of Macmillan Cancer Support in 2022, speaking about the impact of his own experience of living with stage four bowel cancer, Alagiah said: \u201cPeople always ask me how I cope and it\u2019s the hardest question\u2026\u201cThe challenge at first was getting my cancer diagnosis straight in my head \u2013 despite having so much going for me, a successful career and a loving family, here I was just being told I was dying.\u201dIn\u00a0a videocast for the charity Bowel Cancer UK in 2020 in which he said he sometimes felt he had the \u201ceasy part\u201d, living with bowel cancer while his loved ones had to watch.He said: \u201cThose of us living with cancer know that it affects our families almost as much as ourselves.\u201cIn some ways I\u2019ve felt through my six-plus years living with cancer that sometimes I have the easy part\u2026 My job is just to stay fit and my family has got to watch all of the other things.\u201dThe chief executive of Bowel Cancer UK paid tribute to Alagiah, describing him as a \u201chuge advocate\u201d of the charity since he shared his diagnosis.Genevieve Edwards said in a statement to the PA news agency: \u201cHe supported our campaign calling on the NHS to lower the bowel cancer screening age to 50, shared his experience of the disease to raise lifesaving awareness of the symptoms, as well as speaking to our wonderful supporters about living with advanced bowel cancer at events that have raised thousands of pounds for the charity.\u201cMost recently, he hosted our podcast \u2013 he gave not only his time but his phenomenal broadcasting skills, his incredible warmth and his personal insight into living with the disease. We will never forget how much of his precious time he gave to the charity and the kindness he showed to our supporters during a very difficult time in his life.\u201dBefore joining the BBC, Alagiah worked as a print journalist and went on to write a number of books including A Home From Home, which looked at what it means to be British.Throughout his illustrious career, he also presented other shows such as Mixed Britannia, looking at the UK\u2019s mixed-race population.He was made an OBE in the 2008 New Year Honours.He is survived by his wife of 40 years, Frances Robathan, their two sons and three grandchildren.Professor Peter Johnson, NHS England\u2019s national clinical director for cancer, said: \u201cI am very sorry to hear that George Alagiah has died with bowel cancer and my thoughts are with his friends and family.\u201cTalking about cancer can save lives and that George was able to speak so openly and honestly about living with cancer will undoubtably make a difference to many others: I am very grateful that he felt able to do this.\u201cWith all cancers, acting at the first sign of symptoms can make a big difference to how cancer can be treated, and as George often reminded people, it\u2019s important to be aware of the symptoms of bowel cancer \u2013 so if you have noticed any changes such as blood in your poo, a change in bowel habits or pain and bloating \u2013 please do come forward for checks as soon as possible.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64bef8a951ac333ca792fa97", "url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/culture/art-prize/unmissable-selfportraits-to-see-this-summer-in-london-b1070759.html", "primaryCategory": "Art Prize", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Unmissable self-portraits to see this summer in London", "lead": "From Ulay at Tate Modern to Paul McCartney\u2019s 1960s photography at the National Portrait Gallery, here\u2019s where to see some of the capital\u2019s most inspiring self-portraits this summer ", "author": "Rebecca Gonsalves", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 15:15:32", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:18:17.920424", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-24T15:15:32+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "EveningStandard", "image": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2023/04/03/10/P1964H_13a-15a.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Spending time examining your own image can be a confrontational, explorative, and even revelatory experience.

Various barkeeps swear that they were the first to mix this tart, salty drink for picky customers. One thing\u2019s for sure - it\u2019s been around since the 1930s and always made with the same three base ingredients. Cointreau, lime or lemon juice, and the star keeping the whole show on the road: tequila.What tequila is best for Margaritas?Made from blue weber agave leaves, there are three main categories of tequila that relate to the ageing of the distilled spirit, from youngest to oldest: blanco, reposado and a\u00f1ejo.A\u00f1ejo spends the longest time maturing - usually a year, at the least - giving it a smooth, rich flavour that some liken to whisky.Blanco and reposado, on the other hand, are younger, and both dazzle in a Marg. Blanco is the one that bars usually keep on shelves for cocktails, but if you\u2019re making a round at home and want a bit of extra depth or you\u2019re feeling boujee, try adding a reposado tequila to the mix.READ MOREBest tequila for sipping or mixing in delicious cocktailsBest celebrity alcohol brands to try in 2023: tipples from Kylie, Jay Z, Kendall Jenner and moreBest glasses for cocktails, wine and other drinks according to the expertsHow to make the perfect Margarita at homeThere are many variations of Margs to choose from, from picante (a Soho House staple) and frozen, to flavoured ones like watermelon and strawberry.But the classic goes a little something like this: three parts tequila, two of a triple sec like Cointreau, and one part lime juice (the ratio is blissfully easy to remember: 3, 2, 1). Sling into a shaker and go hell for leather until it feels chilled to the touch.

It was a learning opportunity \u2013 gifted by a former world leader to a backbench MP \u2013 that a cost-benefit analysis must be undertaken before a politician does or says anything. I think about it, and the wider implications, a lot.This is not to say that politicians should never take risks, or do things that may cost them votes. Indeed, some even suggest we\u2019re at our best when we\u2019re at our boldest. But the risk has to come with the hope of a reward.Take Sadiq Khan and his decision to extend the Ultra low emission zone (Ulez) to all London boroughs. This is not because the Mayor hasn\u2019t given it much thought, or that he\u2019s not very good at politics. Khan knows this policy will cost him votes at the next election.Indeed, Ulez expansion has already deprived his party of an additional parliamentary seat following Thursday\u2019s Uxbridge and South Ruislip by-election. But as a directly elected mayor, Khan\u2019s incentives are different to that of his party.First, the politics. Khan\u2019s electorate is limited to Labour-dominated London. And he garners much of his support from the inner boroughs already subject to the Ulez.Second, the legacy. Mayor of London is not an especially powerful position. Khan has precious few levers to pull, not least on tax, and\u00a0has clearly decided that he wants to be remembered as the person who tried to clean up the capital\u2019s toxic air.And finally, the science. Air pollution is, I\u2019m afraid, killing us. In 2019, it contributed to the premature death of roughly 4,000 Londoners, according to a study by Imperial College London.Starmer faces his own set of incentives, costs and benefits. Vast amounts of pixels have been spilled in the last few days over what he should do next, and I\u2019m sure he\u2019s grateful for the advice. But it\u2019s a much more straightforward proposition for Khan. And that is why, legal action-permitting, the Ulez extension is highly likely to go ahead on August 29.In the comment pages, Philip Collins says Labour is learning that to win, it is better not to speak. Ethan Croft recalls how Keir Mather, parliament\u2019s youngest MP, arrived at Oxford fully formed.

acceptable for female anorexia nervosa, which is a promising finding given physiological dangers and problems with treatment engagement.\u201dAnorexia is an eating disorder and serious mental health condition.People who have anorexia try to keep their weight as low as possible by not eating enough food or exercising too much, or both.This can make them very ill because they start to starve.Additionally, people with the condition often have a distorted image of their bodies, thinking they are fat even when they are underweight.Men and women of any age can get anorexia, but it\u2019s most common in young women and typically starts in the mid-teens, according to the NHS.The condition is difficult to treat and there are currently no proven treatments for adult anorexia to reverse the core symptoms, and there are also no approved drugs.\u201cPeople living with anorexia nervosa urgently need new optionsPsilocybin therapy has been shown to be a promising treatment for other mental illnesses and is associated with improvements in anxiety, cognitive flexibility and self-acceptance.Stephanie Knatz Peck, from the University of California in the USA,\u00a0and her colleagues investigated the safety, tolerability and exploratory efficacy of a single 25-mg dose of investigational COMP360 psilocybin.This is a synthetic form of psilocybin developed by biotechnology company COMPASS Pathways.In the study, the substance was delivered alongside psychological support in 10 female adults aged 18\u201340 years of age with anorexia.They were assessed for three months following the single dose, and researchers report that no serious adverse events were reported.Self-reported responses from the patients revealed that 90% regarded the psilocybin treatment as meaningful and positive, endorsing additional treatments if available.This study is a first step in showing that psilocybin may be a safe treatment for those with anorexia nervosa, but we cannot conclude from this work that it will be effective in this chronic, complex illnessAdditionally, the researchers indicate that four people demonstrated substantial decreases in eating-disorder scores at a three-month follow-up, qualifying for remission from eating-disorder psychopathology.They highlight that further research is needed as the results are preliminary, it was a small study with no placebo group, and therefore the results should be treated with caution.Dr Guy Goodwin, chief medical officer at COMPASS Pathways, said: \u201cPeople living with anorexia nervosa urgently need new options.\u201cThis study shows promising preliminary evidence that COMP360 psilocybin treatment could help people living with this difficult to treat condition. We are now looking to investigate these findings further in our larger phase 2 study.\u201dDr Alexandra Pike, lecturer in mental health at the University of York, said: \u201cThe changes found in eating disorder symptoms were very subtle, and only appeared in a few of the many questionnaires participants completed \u2013 in contrast to more unambiguous results in disorders such as major depressive disorder.\u201dShe added: \u201cThis study is a first step in showing that psilocybin may be a safe treatment for those with anorexia nervosa, but we cannot conclude from this work that it will be effective in this chronic, complex illness.\u201dNo one with anorexia or other eating disorders should attempt to self-medicate with psilocybinMichael Bloomfield, professor of psychiatric neuroscience at University College London, said: \u201cThe study was not designed to measure whether the experimental treatment was effective and there were no placebo conditions.\u201cThis small study found that the experimental treatment was safe enough to warrant further research studies which should now take place.\u201cWhilst this is exciting news, we cannot yet say the psilocybin-assisted therapy will be helpful for patients suffering from anorexia. Treatment with psilocybin-assisted therapy for anorexia should not be taking place outside of research trials. Anorexia can be potentially life-threatening.\u201cPeople with anorexia and other eating disorders need access to highly specialised psychiatrist-led multidisciplinary teams. No one with anorexia or other eating disorders should attempt to self-medicate with psilocybin.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64bef8ab51ac333ca792fa9e", "url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/slash-your-printing-costs-by-up-to-90-with-the-epson-ecotank-et2820-b1082896.html", "primaryCategory": "Lifestyle", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Slash Your Printing Costs by Up to 90% with the Epson EcoTank ET-2820", "lead": "Say goodbye to messy ink cartridge replacements", "author": "", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 14:52:03", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:18:19.675678", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-24T14:52:03+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "EveningStandard", "image": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2023/05/22/16/epson-ub-22-day-2-1743%20%281%29.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Inkjet printers have been a reliable and affordable solution for households looking to print high quality images as well as documents, but with so many pricing options, connectivity options and designs, it can quickly become a decision overload.There\u2019s no shortage of cartridge-based solutions that at first glance, might seem like the most affordable option but it doesn\u2019t take long to transpire that the refills can cost almost as much as the printer itself.

growing the population and introducing sihek back into the wild.\u201dThe kingfishers are endemic to Guam, a small US territory located in the Pacific ocean, and are known for their dusty, orange feathers and striking blue wings.The birds were classified as extinct in the wild in 1988 following the accidental introduction of brown tree snakes 40 years prior, significantly reducing the number of sihek on the island.Efforts are underway to reduce the spread of the brown tree snakes, but their population on Guam have have grown to more than two million, and now the threatened birds remain in the care of humans.The sihek recovery project hopes to release nine chicks onto Palmyra Atoll, an island just south of Hawaii, next year.It will repeat this annually until 20 siheks establish as

Emma Hayes likes playing her there, but she gives James the freedom to roam inside. Long term, there is a belief among staff at Chelsea that James will become a No10.James was used out wide by Wiegman on Saturday, when she came off the bench for the final 30 minutes against Haiti. The forward was bright, arguably one of England\u2019s better attackers, and she will want to start against a Denmark defence that had an average age of 30 for their opening victory over China.Ella Toone would appear the most likely to make way. After a bright start against Haiti as England\u2019s No10, she struggled to make an impact. Playing all three of Chloe Kelly, Lauren Hemp and James as a trio off a striker would be a bold play from Wiegman, and against her usual way of working.Wiegman is not a fan of changes. She did not make a single one to her starting XI at the Euros last summer, but it was the same when she was in charge of the Netherlands.It is a method that understandably brings plenty of external noise. During the Euros, there were calls for Ellen White to be dropped so Alessia Russo could start. Wiegman ignored them, with results vindicating her, but there are already similar shouts starting now when it comes to James.Wiegman is not one to panic or bow to public opinion... she didn\u2019t make a single change to her starting XI at the Euros last summer \u201cAbsolutely no way Lauren James should be starting on the bench,\u201d former Arsenal striker Ian Wright tweeted during Saturday\u2019s win.Wiegman is not one to panic or bow to public opinion, and she will take comfort from the fact in all three of her past major tournaments she started with 1-0 wins.A victory against Denmark here in Sydney on Friday would all but guarantee England finishing top of Group D, and most likely mean that they will avoid drawing co-hosts Australia in the last-16.\u201cDenmark will drop deep and have an organised defence,\u201d said Wiegman.\u201cWe need to keep the ball moving quicker and have less touches.

My muscles tense up and my heart rate goes sky-high. Everything burns. Yes, I\u2019d seen it on Instagram and watched celebrities like David Beckham and Kim Kardashian shiver, clench and scream through freezing sessions, but the reality was more shocking than I\u2019d expected. \u201cRemember your breathing,\u201d says Lisa Kricfalusi, a cold exposure therapist who is guiding me through my icy dip \u2014 so I take a deep breath through my nose, try to forget about my mind screaming for me to jump out of the bath, and instead delve a little deeper, submerging my shoulders and shocking my body even more.Getty ImagesI\u2019m sitting in one of the world\u2019s first smart ice baths, called Monk \u2014 pegged as the \u201cPeloton of the recovery world\u201d, it\u2019s said to have a waiting list of 3,000 people. The smart elements include guided dips, the ability to track your data, and temperature control at the press of a button, it\u2019s a huge step forward for cold-water therapy \u2014 but at \u00a35,000 it\u2019s not cheap, so is it worth the price tag?If my ice-cold body had to decide at this very moment, it would be a hard no \u2014 it feels like I\u2019ve been trapped outside during a particularly cold winter, in nothing but a bikini. Basically, my worst nightmare. Of course, cold water therapy or ice baths are nothing new. Wim Hof branded his method a few years ago, and everyone from wellness gurus to your next-door neighbour has been braving cold water and raving about the benefits ever since.The research speaks for itself though; as well as an ability to bio-hack your metabolism, mental clarity and faster muscle recovery, cold water exposure can \u201chelp to improve sleep quality by reducing body temperature, reduce stress by triggering the release of endorphins, and even improve circulation by constricting blood vessels and then dilating them again,\u201d explains Calum Sharma, head of exercise science at The Body Lab, where they offer cryotherapy at their gym in Kensington.Evening Standard When the smart bath launches later this year, we\u2019re likely to see social media awash with celebrities, athletes and influencers taking daily dips, but Laura Fullerton, CEO and founder of Monk, believes there is a bigger market for it: \u201cLockdown made people realise that they were in control of their own health.\u201d Fullerton came across some pitfalls as she started practising the wellness trend. \u201cI used to buy so many bags of ice for my bath, I even broke into Hampstead Heath ponds at night during lockdown, but it turns out it was a bad idea, as the water was contaminated, and I got sick.\u201d It was a private Facebook group she joined, however, which made her realise how big the ice bath movement was. \u201cPeople were learning how to transform chest freezers into ice baths, and I thought if there are this many people who are willing to get electrocuted, then surely there is something bigger here? This was one of the catalysts behind Monk.\u201d The sleek oval bath wouldn\u2019t look out of place in a hotel suite or a top-notch members gym \u2014 and let\u2019s face it, it\u2019s way more Instagram-worthy than a paddling pool full of ice. Unfortunately, though, unlike my Peloton, whichever way I switch my furniture around it\u2019s just not going to fit in my one-bed flat in Crystal Palace. Standing at nearly 3ft and 160 cm wide it\u2019s not massive but unless you have a garden or a home gym it\u2019s not going to be easy to find a home for it. As Kricfalusi helps me through the last minute of my glacial experience with soothing positive affirmations \u2014 \u201cI believe in you\u201d and \u201cYou have the power within you to do this\u201d \u2014 I\u2019m ready to put her in my pocket and take her home. She\u2019s just the encouragement you need when your pain threshold is met. Evening StandardHappily, she\u2019ll be the voice of the app, and that\u2019s one of the draws \u2014 with most of us novices to cold water therapy, Monk offer a guided experience, from breathwork to an acclimatisation programme.In theory it has many benefits \u2014 but could it be one of those healthy habits we start, with good intentions, only for it to end up gathering dust (and our guilt) in the garage, just a few months later? There is every possibility, but like exercise, Fullerton says consistency is key, with \u201c11 minutes a week\u201d the sweet spot. I last four minutes and leave feeling alert (like I would after a couple of shots of espresso) and with the hope that its done damage control after last night\u2019s wine \u2014 but unfortunately, not with the bank balance to purchase a smart ice bath, maybe I\u2019ll have to settle with an old chest freezer, after all.The Monk smart ice bath will be available to buy later this year for \u00a34,995"}, {"_id": "64bef8ad51ac333ca792faa4", "url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/england-womens-world-cup-mary-earps-denmark-b1096423.html", "primaryCategory": "Football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Lionesses must raise World Cup game admits Mary Earps before Denmark showdown", "lead": "England underwhelmed against Haiti but can all but seal top spot in Group D with a win in Sydney on Friday ", "author": "Simon Collings", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 14:41:22", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:18:21.034033", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-24T14:41:22+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "EveningStandard", "image": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2023/07/24/15/newFile-11.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Mary Earps admits England must raise their game against Denmark in Sydney on Friday.The Lionesses were only 1-0 winners against World Cup debutants Haiti in their tournament opener on Saturday.England struggled to get into their groove, both in attack and defence, and goalkeeper Earps believes they have \u201ca few kinks\u201d to work out.Denmark beat China 1-0 so whoever wins on Friday will all but guarantee finishing top of Group D.Clean sheet intact: England were indebted to Mary Earps for preserving a narrow lead over Haiti in their World Cup opener / Getty ImagesRead MoreHow \u2018cheat code\u2019 Lauren James can provide spark for misfiring EnglandBrazil and Germany make early World Cup statement with huge first winsLionesses ready to roar in Haiti test despite rocky road to World CupSPONSOREDHow to keep your energy costs down all year round\u201cA bit of a mixed bag,\u201d said Earps, when asked to assess the performance against Haiti. \u201cWe had moments where we connected really well, but I think there are a few kinks still to work out.\u201cWe could have dominated better than what we did, and they had a lot of moments in transition which caused us issues because they are very quick.\u201cWe were not surprised, we were prepared for that, but I just don\u2019t think we executed as well as we could have.\u201cThe win is the most important thing.

\u201cunpopular, expensive\u201d policies would be a \u201creal opportunity\u201d and proposed getting rid of the 2030 ban announced during Boris Johnson\u2019s premiership.But Mr Sunak has also faced

The Day of the Jackal writer, 84, was caught by a speed camera in October and says he paid a fine for driving 7mph over the 30mph limit. However the best-selling writer and journalist has been hauled before a court after an administrative error \u2014 which he insists the Met is to blame for. Forsyth took to his typewriter to bash out an indignant letter to the magistrate, including the suggestion that the police force has not got its priorities in order. \u201cFifty years ago, being bilingual in German, I used to slip through the Berlin Wall on errands for the Firm,\u201d wrote Forsyth, in a reference to his work for MI6. The East German Stasis would salivate with envy if they had had the surveillance powers of the Met today. \u201cSo in a capital with 500 unsolved burglaries, there are ample time wherewithal and staff to hound an old codger driving at seven mph over the limit.

He said in 1973 he was called on to collect a package from a Russian colonel \u201cworking for us deep inside East Germany\u201d.Forsyth was behind the wheel of his black Suzuki when he was caught out on the A40 near Paddington Green on October 31 last year. The speed limit on that stretch of road has been recently cut from 40mph to 30mph, with scores of drivers each week being fined for driving too fast. Forsyth had a solitary reader in mind when he wrote to the court, addressing his note: \u201cDear Mr Stipendiary\u201d \u2014 a historic term for a paid magistrate. ES Picture Desk\u201cI regret having to take up your valuable time but have no choice,\u201d he wrote. \u201cOverhead gantry cameras spotted my little runabout pootling along an urban motorway at 37mph unaware speed reduction cameras had changed the rating from 40mph to 30mph. I had simply missed the sign.\u201d Forsyth said he admitted the offence and paid a fine \u2014 \u201cend of story \u2014 I thought\u201d, but was then alerted to an \u201cerror\u201d which the Met blamed on him. \u201cThey claim my driving licence number was not on one of the forms. Not true,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI enclose a photocopy of the form, submitted well in time, with driving licence number identified with an asterisk. \u201cNow the claim is that without this number the settlement was invalid and I am therefore over-time-limit. The fine is cancelled and being returned to me and my case referred to your court.\u201dForsyth added in a plea to the court: \u201cI must ask you to reimpose the fine, which I will pay immmediately \u2014 but please with no court costs because I have not imposed any; the error was the Met\u2019s, not mine.\u201dForsyth was prosecuted behind closed doors through the single justice procedure and sentenced without a court hearing last month. Magistrate Robin Fawcett imposed a \u00a360 fine, a \u00a324 victim surcharge, and just \u00a316 in costs \u2014 bringing the total to \u00a3100.

Cinemas even scrambled to add more to accommodate the demand including 1am and 6am screenings, which also sold out.\u201cNolan\u2019s films are truly cinematic events,\u201d said Jim Orr, Universal\u2019s president of domestic distribution.IMAX showings alone made up 26 per cent of the domestic gross from only 411 screens and 20 per cent of the global gross, and Oppenheimer will have at least a three-week run on those high-demand screens.\nBarbie LA premiere: Best dressed1/58Barbie LA premiere: Best dressed\n\nAmerica Ferrera, Ariana Greenblatt, Issa Rae, Margot Robbie and director Greta GerwigAFP via Getty ImagesRyan Gosling, Margot Robbie and America FerreraGetty ImagesMargot RobbieChris Pizzello/Invision/APAlana Haim, Danielle Haim, and Este HaimChris Pizzello/Invision/APMargot Robbie and Ryan GoslingChris Pizzello/Invision/APBillie EilishAFP via Getty ImagesHari NefAFP via Getty ImagesRyan GoslingAFP via Getty ImagesRyan GoslingREUTERSSkai JacksonREUTERSXochitl GomezChris Pizzello/Invision/APMargot Robbie and Scott EvansREUTERSDua LipaChris Pizzello/Invision/APMargot RobbieGetty ImagesMargot RobbieAFP via Getty ImagesMargot RobbieGetty ImagesHari NefAFP via Getty ImagesAlana Haim, Danielle Haim and Este HaimAFP via Getty ImagesNicki MinajAFP via Getty ImagesNicki MinajGetty ImagesShay MitchellAFP via Getty ImagesMichael CeraChris Pizzello/Invision/APAmerica FerreraAFP via Getty ImagesAlexandra ShippAFP via Getty ImagesAva MaxChris Pizzello/Invision/APGal GadotREUTERSSimu Liu, Allison HsuChris Pizzello/Invision/APHari NefChris Pizzello/Invision/APKate McKinnonChris Pizzello/Invision/APClaudia Sulewski, Finneas O'ConnellChris Pizzello/Invision/APDove CameronChris Pizzello/Invision/APDua LipaChris Pizzello/Invision/APAriana GreenblattChris Pizzello/Invision/APJim Cashman, Stephanie CourtneyChris Pizzello/Invision/APAshley GrahamChris Pizzello/Invision/APKingsley Ben-AdirChris Pizzello/Invision/APKiersey ClemonsChris Pizzello/Invision/APMark Ronson, Grace GummerChris Pizzello/Invision/APAmerica FerreraREUTERSFinneas O\u2019Connell and Billie EilishAFP via Getty ImagesIssa RaeAFP via Getty ImagesDua LipaAFP via Getty ImagesIssa RaeAFP via Getty ImagesSimu LiuGetty Images\n\n \n\n\n\u201cThis is a phenomenon beyond compare,\u201d said Rich Gelfond, the chief executive of IMAX, in a statement. \u201cAround the world, we\u2019ve seen sellouts at 4am shows and people travelling hours across borders to see Oppenheimer in IMAX 70mm.\u201d\u201cIt was a truly historic weekend and continues the positive box office momentum of 2023,\u201d said Michael O\u2019Leary, president and chief executive of the National Association of Theatre Owners.\u201cPeople recognised that something special was happening and they wanted to be a part of it.\u201dAnd yet in the background looms disaster as Hollywood studios continue to squabble with striking actors and writers over a fair contract.Barbie and Oppenheimer were the last films on the 2023 calendar to get a massive, global press tour.

All negotiations between AMPTP and the WGA shut down back in May when the strike started. It is hard to reach any agreement when the other side won\u2019t even come to the table.\u201cI joined the WGA in 1986 and have been through several strikes with them. We made gains in all of them, but some issues are more important than others\u2026 and this year\u2019s strike is the most important of my lifetime.\u201c\u2026No one can be certain where we go from here, but I have a bad feeling that this strike will be long and bitter. It may get as bad as the infamous 1985 strike, though I hope not.\u201dThe writer, who said he had been on several pickets in New Mexico supporting the strikes, revealed his \u201coverall deal\u201d with HBO was suspended on June 1.He also gave an update on the second series of House Of The Dragon (HOTD) series, which will see the return of Matt Smith, Emma D\u2019Arcy and Paddy Considine in their starring roles.Martin wrote: \u201cOne of the few shows still shooting is House Of The Dragon\u2026I am told the second season is half done. All of the scripts had been finished months before the WGA strike began.\u201cNo writing has been done since, to the best of my knowledge. HOTD is shot mostly in London (and a little bit in Wales, Spain, and various other locations), which is why filming has continued.\u201cThe actors are members of the British union, Equity, not Sag-Aftra and though Equity strongly supports their American cousins\u2026 British law forbids them from staging a sympathy strike. If they walk, they have no protection against being fired for breach of contract, or even sued.\u201dMartin said he considers himself \u201cone of the lucky ones\u201d as he continues to work on projects such as the stage adaption of The Iron Throne which he has been working on for the \u201cpast few years\u201d.\u201cThe scripts for that one are coming along well, and it\u2019s got me very excited. Sag-Aftra covers television and film, but not the stage, so the strike has no impact there. Maybe we will even be able to bring the show to the West End by\u2026 well, no, better not say, do not want to jinx the project,\u201d he said.He ended the blog post with the hope the strikes get settled quickly \u201cbefore we all lose our houses\u201d."}, {"_id": "64bef8b251ac333ca792fab9", "url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/celebrity-news/zara-mcdermott-gaia-bbc-three-dorset-b1096406.html", "primaryCategory": "Celebrity News", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Zara McDermott hopes Gaia Pope-Sutherland film will prompt \u2018big conversations\u2019", "lead": "Ms Pope-Sutherland died in 2017 after reporting she had been drugged and sexually attacked by a man when she was 16.", "author": "Ellie Iorizzo", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 13:52:54", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:18:26.290099", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-24T13:52:54+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "EveningStandard", "image": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2023/07/24/14/24131419-0d74c721-e9e8-4b2a-9304-0a2b19345d38.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Zara McDermott wants her latest documentary about the death of Gaia Pope-Sutherland to be added to her portfolio of films that bring about \u201cbigger conversations\u201d for young people within families and schools.The TV presenter, 26, said she was \u201cincredibly proud\u201d of her upcoming three-part BBC Three series Gaia: A Death On Dancing Ledge.It aims to shed a light on the circumstances surrounding the death of the 19-year-old who ran away from home while experiencing a mental health crisis in 2017, after reporting she had been drugged and sexually attacked by a man when she was 16.Ms Pope-Sutherland died after suffering hypothermia and was found in undergrowth between Dancing Ledge and Anvil Point along the Dorset coastline 11 days after she went missing.At the time of her disappearance, she was anxious about the accused rapist\u2019s imminent release from prison where he was serving time for other sexual offences.Read MoreCher announces she is launching gelato brand called CherlatoRobin Williams\u2019 kids pay tribute on what would have been his 72nd birthdayBBC newsreader George Alagiah dies at 67 after bowel cancer diagnosisSPONSOREDHow to keep your energy costs down all year roundMcDermott\u2019s \u201craw and candid\u201d film explores the series of events that led to Ms Pope-Sutherland\u2019s death, including \u201coversight\u201d from officials involved in her care, as well as highlighting the families\u2019 search for truth and justice.The presenter said she really hopes the main outcome of the film is that people start having \u201cdifficult conversations\u201d.She told the PA news agency: \u201cI think as much as it\u2019s important to tell a story of tragedy, because it definitely will hopefully capture the emotion, the important part as always in any documentary that I make is to see a little light at the end, regardless of how small or big that light is, just to see a little bit of light.\u201cEvery documentary that I make, I want there to be that kind of ending where people feel hopefully something can change.\u201cIn order for that change to be made, people watching the documentary can start to hopefully have those conversations, even just a conversation within your family, it might make someone open up about something that happened to them.\u201dShe continued: \u201cFor me, it\u2019s about making a difference and making a change\u2026 A lot of my documentaries are shown in schools, and for me a massive aim is to create a portfolio of films that can be used as part of PSHE lessons in schools and just bringing bigger conversations.\u201cI think that it\u2019s really hard sometimes for parents to speak about some of the topics that are in some of my documentaries, with Gaia the sexual assault element, disordered eating, rape culture in schools, revenge porn \u2013 these are tough conversations with your kids.\u201cSo sometimes having that icebreaker of being able to sit down watch a programme and then say, \u2018What did you learn from that\u2019, that for me is the main thing and I think that\u2019s the same with teachers as well.\u201dMcDermott said she felt it was important to tell Ms Pope-Sutherland\u2019s story having followed it in the news when it was first reported, noting they were around the same age.Having filmed the documentary since last Spring, the presenter described Ms Pope-Sutherland as a \u201creal inspiration\u201d and considers her a friend, despite having never met her.She said: \u201cI\u2019m really glad that I got to tell Gaia\u2019s story because I learned so much about her through this journey.
