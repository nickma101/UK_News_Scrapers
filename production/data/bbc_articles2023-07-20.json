But the CMA found examples of retailers using grams and millilitres.<br/>The watchdog discovered a lack of transparency with missing or incorrectly calculated unit pricing information both in store and online. Examples include a 250ml bottle of handwash that was sold for \u00a31.19 but was mistakenly priced at \u00a3476.00 per 100ml.<br/>It also raised concerns about unit pricing information being too small to read and some retailers not displaying unit prices for any products on promotion.It added that some of the problems \"stem from the unit pricing rules themselves\", which fall under the Price Marking Order, saying the rules allowed \"unhelpful inconsistencies in retailers' practices and leave too much scope for interpretation\".<br/>Sue Davies, head of food policy at the consumer group Which?, said supermarkets must \"urgently act\" on the areas highlighted by the CMA.<br/>\"This includes the need to put unit pricing on promotions, such as on loyalty card offers and multi-buys, and make unit pricing clearer and more consistent,\" she said.<br/>She added that the the government must \"act swiftly on its promise to update pricing rules and close the loopholes that are allowing supermarkets to unnecessarily confuse shoppers\".<br/>While food price inflation remains at historically high levels - 17.3% in June - the watchdog said evidence it had collected indicated that competition issues had not been driving this.<br/>Ms Cardell told the BBC the CMA had found no evidence of profiteering on groceries, but said it was important to keep the market \"under review\" as the sector seeks to rebuild profits.<br/>It found that operating profits in the grocery sector fell by 41.5% in 2022-23, compared with the previous year, while average operating margins fell from 3.2% to 1.8%. <br/>This was due to retailers' costs increasing faster than their revenues, indicating that rising costs have not been passed on in full to consumers, the CMA said.<br/>It pointed to evidence that budget supermarkets Aldi and Lidl had gained market share, suggesting that supermarkets were \"restricted in their ability to raise prices without losing business\".<br/>However, it said that not everyone was able to benefit fully from strong competition, \"particularly those who cannot travel to large stores or shop online, and therefore may rely on higher-priced convenience stores\".<br/>The CMA said so far it had looked at competition overall between retailers but had not yet looked at individual product categories or across the wider grocery supply chain.<br/>It said it would now further analyse 10 product categories: baby formula, milk, bread, pet food, poultry, mayonnaise, baked beans, chilled desserts, ready meals, and lemonade. <br/>It added it did not have any provisional concerns that competition for these products was ineffective.<br/>Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, which represents supermarkets and other retailers, said: \"Supermarkets have been working hard to support their customers through the cost of living crisis and will be reflecting on the CMA's recommendations on unit pricing. <br/>\"The CMA itself notes that 'many of these problems stem from the rules themselves', and retailers stand ready to support proposed changes to the unit pricing rules.\"<br/>The government said it welcomed the findings into competition and unit pricing, and said it would launch a consultation in the autumn on the Price Marking Order \"to make it work for consumers\".<br/>Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said: \"It's reassuring that competition between supermarkets is working, but the CMA has my backing to look further into price rises for 10 everyday essentials.\"<br/>Read more tips here<br/>Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>Sainsbury\u2019s boss denies profiting from high prices<br/>How a big yellow label influences what we buy<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

What happened with the daughters of Manipur can never be forgiven,\" he said, finally breaking his silence on Manipur more than two months after violence erupted. <br/>India video shows how rape is weaponised in conflict<br/>Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud also expressed concern over the assault, saying the Supreme Court was \"deeply disturbed over the video\". Telling the government to inform the court about the steps being taken against the accused, the chief justice said \"we will take action if you don't\". <br/>Deadly violence has plunged Manipur, a scenic Indian state bordering Myanmar, into turmoil for more than two months. <br/>Clashes between members of the majority Meitei and the Kuki tribal communities have resulted in their complete segregation. At least 130 people have died and 60,000 have been displaced.<br/>The two women, who are Kukis, were assaulted by men of the Meitei group.<br/>Warning: This article contains details some readers may find distressing.<br/>Police say the assault on the women took place on 4 May but it made national headlines on Thursday after the video started going viral on social media. The federal government has asked all social media companies to delete the video from their platforms. <br/>The horrific video of the two women was widely shared on social media on Wednesday. It shows them being dragged and groped by a mob of men who then push them into a field.<br/>The Indigenous Tribal Leaders' Forum (ITLF) said in a statement that the atrocities had been committed in a village in Kangpokpi district against women from the Kuki-Zo tribal community. It also alleged that the women had been gang raped. <br/>By Geeta Pandey, BBC News, Delhi<br/>It's well known that women's bodies often become a battleground during riots and conflicts, and rape and sexual assault are used as instruments of violence to punish them. <br/>The sexual assault of the Kuki women in Manipur is the latest example. The footage showing the women weeping, wincing in pain and begging their attackers to show some mercy is disturbing to watch. <br/>The fact that the first arrest has been made only now, more than two months after the attack was reported to police, does not inspire confidence in the authorities - all the more so since many of the men are clearly identifiable in the footage.<br/>But the outrage that followed the video's emergence in India has put the spotlight on the horrific crime. It has also raised questions about the failure of the state in comforting the survivors - and finally forced Mr Modi to make a statement on the ethnic violence that is tearing Manipur apart.<br/>To restore some sort of confidence in Manipur, especially among the minority Kuki community, the authorities are now under pressure to act swiftly against the perpetrators and bring justice to the women. People across the country feel this should not be happening in modern India.<br/>\"The gang rape of the women happened after the village was burnt down and two men - one middle-aged and another a teenager - were beaten to death by the mob,\" the ITLF said.<br/>But the police complaint filed by a relative of one of the women said only one of them was gang raped. It added that a third woman had been forced to strip but she is not seen in the video. <br/>Police said that the incident took place on 4 May and that a case of abduction and gang rape and murder had been registered in Thoubal district.  <br/>The assault has been condemned by politicians across the spectrum.<br/>Federal minister Smriti Irani, called it \"downright inhuman\".<br/>Several opposition leaders also criticised the Bharatiya Janata Party government for not doing enough to quell the violence in the state.<br/>Congress party leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadhra said that the \"images of sexual violence against women from Manipur are heart wrenching\".<br/>Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal weighed in too. \"This kind of heinous act cannot be tolerated in the Indian society,\" he said.<br/>BBC News India is now on YouTube.

This government is failing us and failing patients.\"<br/>Its deputy chair, Dr Simon Walsh who is an emergency medicine consultant, told BBC News that going on strike was a difficult decision to reach, knowing that it would affect patients. <br/>\"There's a full emergency service so patients who have emergencies will receive care as they normally would...Of course it's a really difficult step to take industrial action and therefore impact on people who were planning to have elective operations and appointments today.<br/>\"We really see this as a step we need to take to protect the NHS, to stop the erosion of the workforce.\"<br/>Sally Knight, 68 and from Lightwater, is waiting for a hip operation which has been pushed back until September.<br/>She told the BBC she has been treated really well by the NHS in her area, but that delays and disruptions to services were a frustration: \"We locked ourselves away. We did everything we should have done in Covid to protect the NHS and now when I want them, they are letting me down really.<br/>\"Currently, I feel I was going forwards and now I've been knocked back.\"<br/>But Health Secretary Steve Barclay urged the profession to end the dispute.<br/>He said the government had listened to their concerns, by increasing the amount that can be paid directly into pension pots tax-free, as well as accepting the recommendations of the independent pay review body and giving consultants a 6% pay rise this year.<br/>He stressed it was the government's \"final offer\", adding: \"It is now time to put patients first.\"<br/>On the strike days, people should use 999 in life-threatening emergencies, and NHS 111 online for other health concerns. <br/>GP services and pharmacies can also be accessed in the normal way. <br/>Those not told their appointments have been postponed should attend as normal.<br/>The 6% pay increase means basic pay starts at \u00a393,666 - with the most experienced consultants receiving more than \u00a3126,000 a year - but to reach that salary takes, on average, 19 years in the role.<br/>However, the average NHS consultant earns approximately 30% more than their stated salary - about half of this is for working additional hours, with the rest made up of other allowances - including a bonus system known as clinical excellence awards.<br/>They can also be paid additionally for private work - but not all do it. <br/>Yes, but depending on what measure is used the scale of the cut in pay varies.<br/>The BMA uses the RPI measure of inflation, which shows, since 2008, pay has fallen by 27%.<br/>Once changes to tax and pensions over this period are factored in, the shortfall in take-home pay is 35%, the BMA says. <br/>But work by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, using other measures of inflation, shows the fall since 2010 is around 17%. <br/>This drop in pay is greater than most other NHS workers, such as nurses, ambulance staff and estates staff, with lower-paid staff prioritised for the biggest pay rises.<br/>The BMA said it means consultants have seen their pay eroded when compared to professions such as law, accountancy, financial services and engineering.<br/>Unlike the junior doctors' at the start of their dispute, consultants are not asking for full pay restoration in one uplift. <br/>Instead, they want the government to start giving pay rises that at least match inflation.<br/>Consultants plan more industrial action, on 24 and 25 August, unless a pay deal is agreed.<br/>Are you a senior doctor?

Relations with the US have plummeted in recent years, as it has tested dozens of increasingly powerful missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads. <br/>On its travel advisory, the US tells its citizens not to travel to North Korea - one of the world's most isolated states - due to \"the continuing serious risk of arrest\" and the \"critical threat of wrongful detention\". <br/>It is unclear if PV2 King has defected or hopes to return. <br/>Experts say such a low-ranking soldier would have little propaganda and intelligence value, which may prompt North Korea into releasing him - but what will happen to him remains highly uncertain. <br/>The lack of precedent makes it hard to foresee next steps - it's been decades since a US soldier last defected to the North.<br/>The fact that Pyongyang is not responding to US attempts to communicate is adding to the uncertainty. <br/>PV2 King was due to fly back to the US from South Korea, where he was based, to face disciplinary action.<br/>But the 23-year-old did not board the plane when he parted ways with his military escorts at Incheon Airport near Seoul on Tuesday and instead embarked on an apparently pre-booked tour to the border - the details of how he managed to do that are still unclear. <br/>US defence officials said the soldier \"wilfully\" crossed into the North over one of the most heavily-fortified areas in the world. <br/>The DMZ has separated the two countries since the Korean War in the 1950s, in which the US backed the South. The war ended with an armistice, meaning that the two sides are still technically at war. Tens of thousands of US troops remain in the South.<br/>Pyongyang could use PV2 King as a propaganda tool to criticise the US military,  said James Fretwell, an analyst at Seoul-based specialist site NK News.<br/>\"King may well show up in North Korean state media at some point in the near future. But a lot depends on how long his interrogation, and maybe his Covid-19 quarantine, lasts,\" he added. North Korea still maintains a strict border lockdown in response to the pandemic. <br/>But Jenny Town, director of the Stimson Center's 38 North Program, believes Mr King \"does not make for a very ideal or compelling soldier story\".<br/>\"There have also been cases long ago of US soldiers who defected and were allowed to stay\u2026 But in those cases, there was political value to [their stories] and it was a very different time, and a different leader,\" she said.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Travis King's brother speaks after arrest<br/>Meanwhile, behind the scenes, diplomats and military officials are desperately trying to talk to the North Koreans to find out what is going on, but engaging them is not easy. <br/>State department spokesman Matthew Miller said the US, which has no diplomatic relations with North Korea, has other channels to communicate.<br/>He said department officials were engaging with counterparts in South Korea and Sweden to access information on PV2 King - but US officials knew nothing of his current condition or whereabouts.<br/>Given that the two countries do not have diplomatic relations, the Swedish embassy in Pyongyang tends to negotiate on behalf of the US. Currently its diplomatic staff are not in the country, because of the ongoing border closure since the pandemic.<br/>Both the UN Command, that runs the border area, and the South Korean military have direct phone lines to the North Korean military, that they call daily to check in, though the North Koreans do not always pick up. <br/>In recent years, a number of American citizens who illegally entered North Korea -  excluding those convicted of criminal activity there - have been released within six months. <br/>Some experts feel that the tensions between North Korea and the US and the impasse in bilateral talks means the North has little to gain in holding on to PV2 King. <br/>\"For Pyongyang, it makes sense to find a way of extracting some compensation and then expel an American for unauthorised entry,\" said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul.<br/>\"In the best-case scenario, the American soldier will return home safely at the cost of some propaganda victory for Pyongyang, and US and North Korean officials may have an opportunity to resume dialogue and contacts that went stagnant during the pandemic.\"<br/>What we know so far about North Korea's detention of a US soldier<br/>US soldier in N Korea was held after fights in Seoul<br/>Warmbier parents describe N Korea 'torture'<br/>How harsh is prison in North Korea?<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

But if the interruption in supplies leads to a prolonged period of higher prices, the impact will make itself felt around the world in the coming months.<br/>The sharp increase in grain cost after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year lead to rising prices - not just for food items based on grains, but also for meat and poultry, as animals are often fed with grain. <br/>Countries which depend most heavily on Ukraine's supplies are likely to be most affected. Before the war Lebanon received nearly three-quarters of its grain from Ukraine, while Pakistan, Libya and Ethiopia are also very heavily dependent. <br/>Earlier, President Vladimir Putin said he would return to the international grain agreement immediately if his demands were met. They include lifting sanctions on sales of Russian grain and fertiliser and reconnecting Russia's agricultural bank to a global payment system.<br/>Russian air strikes on the Black Sea coastal cities meanwhile continued for a third night, leaving more than 20 people wounded in Odesa and Mykolaiv. <br/>Mykolaiv regional governor Vitaliy Kim said 19 people had been hurt in the regional capital, including children. Apartment blocks were targeted and in one building the second and top floor were partially destroyed.<br/>Several people were also wounded in Odesa, when a four-storey building was badly damaged.<br/>Russian-occupied Crimea was also hit overnight, according to its Russian-appointee leader Sergei Aksyonov.<br/>A teenage girl was killed when a drone hit four administrative buildings in the north-west of the peninsula.<br/>Crimea has been hit on three consecutive days. A suspected Ukrainian drone attack from the sea damaged a bridge from the occupied peninsula to southern Russia on Monday. Part of a key motorway was also shut on Tuesday because of explosions at a nearby munitions depot.<br/>Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Russia of deliberately targeting grain export infrastructure and putting vulnerable countries at risk.<br/>Agriculture Minister Mykola Solskyi said strikes had destroyed 60,000 tonnes of grain and damaged considerable parts of the grain export infrastructure.<br/>The Black Sea grain deal enabled the UN's World Food Programme (WFP) to ship more than 725,000 tonnes of wheat from Ukraine to countries facing acute hunger, including Ethiopia, Yemen and Afghanistan. So Ukraine provided more than half the WFP's wheat grain last year.<br/>More than half the total grain shipped under the deal was corn, however. Of the nearly 33m tonnes exported, the biggest amount went to China (8m tonnes), then Spain (6m tonnes) and Turkey (3.2m tonnes), UN data shows.<br/>Turkey has been milling grain into flour for the WFP. Corn is used as biofuel and animal feed, besides human consumption.<br/>The defence ministry in Moscow said that from Thursday all vessels sailing on the Black Sea to Ukrainian ports would be regarded as \"potential carriers of military cargo\" and that the ships' \"flag states... will be considered to be involved in the Ukrainian conflict on the side of the Kyiv regime\".<br/>On Wednesday Mr Putin accused the West of using the grain deal as \"political blackmail\". Moscow has accused Ukraine of using the Black Sea grain corridor for \"combat purposes\". <br/>Ukraine's options for exporting grain by rail are also very limited: rail capacity is smaller than shipping volumes and several EU countries in Eastern Europe are blocking Ukrainian grain, in order to protect their own farmers.<br/>Some Ukrainian grain may now be shipped via the Danube, using Romanian territorial waters, though again the volumes are likely to be relatively small.<br/>Marex Capital analyst Charlie Sernatinger said Russia's threatened escalation could \"cut all of the waterborne grain shipments off from the Black Sea, both Russian, and Ukrainian\", which would cause a similar situation to that at the start of the war.<br/>Ukrainian MP Oleksiy Goncharenko called on the UK, US, France and Turkey to protect the grain ships with military convoys and provide Odesa with air defences.<br/>\"Clearly Putin has an aim to disrupt food security and cause a peak in world food prices, which in the developed countries will lead to inflation, but in developing countries that will lead to social destabilisation, starvation and new waves of migrants.\"<br/>Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>What was the Ukraine grain deal?<br/>Russia's grain deal exit stab in the back - Kenya<br/>Russia says Crimea bridge partially open to cars again<br/>No fast results in offensive, warns Ukrainian commander<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

That target has become the centrepiece of global efforts to tackle climate change.<br/>Climate scientists have been warning governments for years that they are not cutting their countries' emissions quickly enough to keep within this target. <br/>But it is surprising for someone as senior and well respected as the former head of the UN climate science body the IPCC to be so frank that he believes it will be missed.<br/>Professor Sir Bob Watson is currently Emeritus Professor of the UK's Tyndall Centre for Climate Research - having previously worked at the UN, Nasa, UK's Department of Environment and the US White House - and is perhaps one of the foremost climate scientists in the world.<br/>In the interview aired on Thursday he said: \"I think most people fear that if we give up on the 1.5 [celsius limit] which I do not believe we will achieve, in fact I'm very pessimistic about achieving even 2C, that if we allow the target to become looser and looser, higher and higher, governments will do even less in the future.\"<br/>Although his comments are candid on the state of action on climate change, many of his colleagues will agree with his conclusion that we are on course for a temperature rise of 2.5C or more. Based on current government commitments to cutting greenhouse gas emissions Climate Action Tracker predicts that global temperatures will rise to 2.7C .<br/>The figure is not a direct measure of the world's temperature but an indicator of how much or how little the Earth has warmed or cooled compared to the long-term global average - and even slight changes can have significant impacts. <br/>The UN climate body, the IPCC, has said keeping temperature rises below 1.5C, rather than 2C, would mean:<br/>Prof Sir Bob Watson said that the world is struggling to prevent temperature rises as we are not reducing emissions fast enough. <br/>\"The big issue is we need to reduce greenhouse gases now to even be on the pathway to be close to 1.5C or 2C. We need to reduce current emissions by at least 50% by 2030. The trouble is the emissions are still going up, they are not going down,\" he said.<br/>He told the Today programme that setting targets was not enough and countries needed to back these up with action: \"We need to try and hold governments to start to act sensibly now and reduce emissions, but even governments with a really good target like the United Kingdom don't have the policies in place, don't have the financing in place to reach those goals.\"<br/>In March the UK's watchdog on climate change said the UK had lost its leadership on climate issues. It said Government backing for new oil and coal, airport expansion plans and slow progress on heat pumps showed a lack of urgency across government on the issue.<br/>World likely to warm beyond key 1.5C limit by 2027<br/>What is El Ni\u00f1o and how does it change the weather?<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

He has also made lots of controversial comments, and when you have a bit of loose cannon like that, they could bring you into disrepute, even though it's not intentional.<br/>\"That risk has to be very closely managed because it might come with a financial cost. If the returns on the account do not justify the costs, then the bank will see no point in carrying on the relationship.\" <br/>The report stated that Coutts had been happy to carry on banking Mr Farage while he had a mortgage with them, but once he had paid it off they planned to terminate the relationship.<br/>However, Angela Knight, former chief executive of the British Bankers' Association, told the BBC's Today programme she found what had happened to the firmer United Kingdom Independence Party leader \"somewhat uncomfortable\".<br/>\"It is somewhat uncomfortable to see a situation arise where because of somebody's legitimate views, even though you don't agree with them, it somehow has resulted in a service being withdrawn and they are not being told about it.\"<br/>She added: \"In this instance what seems to have happened is nothing was really said to the individual concerned and then when they put in an application [to the bank to see the evidence] they suddenly find that there's a whole series of reasons which seems to centre around what they have said.\" <br/>On Thursday Mr Farage welcomed reports of a government crackdown, saying closing bank accounts for political reasons could stop people from going into public life.<br/>\"Refusal to open [accounts] and closures have happened to several members of my family... Which is perhaps, above all, what has made me angry, really angry and motivated me to [speak out].\"<br/>On Wednesdday Prime Minister Rishi Sunak tweeted that shutting someone's account over their views was \"wrong\", calling free speech the \"cornerstone of our democracy\". <br/>Meanwhile, Home Secretary Suella Braverman said elsewhere that the Coutts row \"exposes the sinister nature of much of the diversity, equity and inclusion industry\".<br/>The BBC had previously reported Mr Farage had fallen below the financial threshold needed for an account at Coutts, citing a source familiar with the move.<br/>The former politician accused the broadcaster of falling for \"spin\" and restated that he had been targeted for his political views.<br/>He cited the report by the bank's reputational risk committee which states that the Brexiteer's views did not \"align with our values\".<br/>\"Apparently, I'm a risk to them. I have virtually no links of any kind to Russia whatsoever. This is political. There is no other way of looking at it,\" he said.<br/>He later told BBC Newsnight he was \"literally shocked\" when he saw the report, which he described as a \"personal hit job\". \"This bank is behaving now like a political campaigning organisation,\" he said.<br/>Coutts has said it has offered Mr Farage an alternative account at its sister bank, NatWest and the offer still stands. <br/>Anyone concerned that they have not been treated fairly by their bank can appeal to the Financial Ombudsman Service.<br/>City regulator the Financial Conduct Authority is also talking to NatWest about the handling of Mr Farage's accounts, its boss told MPs on Wednesday.<br/>Nikhil Rathi said that current rules made clear banks should not discriminate on the basis of political views.<br/>Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>Farage launches fresh attack over Coutts bank closure<br/>Farage: Coutts file 'shows account shut over my views'<br/>Bank account closures probe 'must be fast tracked'<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

According to a police complaint, one of the women was gang raped. The complaint added that a third woman was also forced to strip but she is not seen in the video. <br/>The video shows the distraught women being pushed around and groped by their attackers. While the men's faces are visible, only one person has been arrested so far on charges of gang rape.<br/>Manipur, in north-eastern India, has been gripped by ethnic violence between the majority Meitei group and the tribal Kuki minority since May. Reports from the ground detail chilling accounts of shootings, looting and sexual assault.<br/>According to a report in The Print, the sexual violence shown in the video took place after fake news about a Meitei woman's rape and murder was circulated just after the violence began. It \"unleashed a new, deadly cycle of reprisal violence on Kuki tribal women allegedly by Meitei mobs\", says the report.<br/>Rape has long been used as a weapon during conflict. <br/>In most large-scale incidents of violence - the 1947 partition of India, the 1971 Bangladesh independence war, the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, the civil war in Sri Lanka, the 2002 Gujarat riots, to give just a few examples from South Asia - appalling instances of sexual assault and gang rape have been reported, with the scale of the brutality sometimes uncovered only decades later. <br/>Survivor accounts show that the crime is often attributed to revenge against the \"other\" through violating the bodies of women - seen as a site of honour for their communities.<br/>The state's mechanisms to end the conflict - such as the army and other security forces - have also been accused of brutal sexual violence in places such as Indian-administered Kashmir and the north-eastern states.<br/>\"The price that women pay for this violence done on their bodies is often hidden and very private. The women's movement has been bringing attention to this for decades, yet it continues,\" says Anuradha Chenoy, former professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi.<br/>What makes matters worse is state apathy. <br/>The assault in Manipur occurred on 4 May. According to the police complaint filed by a relative of one of the women, it took place when two men and three women from the tribal Kuki community were fleeing towards a forest to escape violence in Kangpokpi district.  <br/>The complaint alleges that they were rescued by a police team who were then ambushed by a mob who \"snatched\" the villagers. <br/>According to the complaint, the mob killed the two men and forced the women to remove their clothes.<br/>One of the women, a 21-year-old, was \"brutally gang-raped in broad daylight\", the complaint says, adding that the other two managed to escape. <br/>Vikram Singh, a former police chief in Uttar Pradesh state, says that the \"shameful\" incident raises grave questions about the police and administration.<br/>\"No administration in a country like India is so helpless that it cannot do anything when women are treated like this,\" he says, adding that apart from the perpetrators, the police officials in question should also be punished.<br/>Yet, the first arrest in the case was only made on Thursday morning, hours after the video was shared widely on Twitter and the Supreme Court said it was \"deeply disturbed\". <br/>Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has often spoken about empowering women and educating girls, had not publicly commented on the crisis in Manipur despite repeated calls from citizens and opposition leaders. He finally broke his silence a few hours ago, saying his heart was \"full of pain and anger\" and that the guilty would be punished.<br/>But the question remains - why did it take so long, especially when the faces of the perpetrators were clearly visible in the viral video?<br/>\"Ensuring access to justice is the state's responsibility. But in most cases, the state and administration are totally missing in the fight for justice,\" says Vrinda Grover, an advocate who has represented several victims of sexual violence.<br/>She adds that if it takes the Supreme Court's intervention for even one arrest to be \"miraculously\" made, it does not give any hope to victims of violence.<br/>Khushbu Sundar, a member of Mr Modi's party - the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which also governs Manipur - said the video was \"horrific\" and \"unacceptable\".<br/>\"This is a complete failure of law and order,\" she said, adding, however, that this was \"not the time for accusations\" and that all political parties needed to keep aside their differences and \"stand together against the violence in Manipur\".<br/>Lawyer Warisha Farasat, who researched the 1989 Bhagalpur riots in Bihar state in which more than 1,000 people were killed, said that two commissions set up by the government to investigate the violence did not mention sexual assault or rape at all in their reports.<br/>\"I did my research 21 years after the incident and people were still reluctant to talk about it. The only cases where families spoke about sexual violence were those where the victim had died in the assault, perhaps because there was no rape-related social stigma involved,\" she says.<br/>In India, sexual violence often goes unreported as traumatised victims fear being cast out by their families and ostracised by society.<br/>Ms Farasat says that victims of sexual violence in conflict zones are also facing overlapping traumas - from loss of livelihood to deaths of family members - which can make them minimise their experiences. <br/>She adds, however, that the reluctance does not always stem from shame. <br/>\"The problem is, when women come out to speak, they don't get justice. That's what needs to change,\" Ms Farasat adds.<br/>While there are sporadic instances of legal justice, it often takes years and a lot of strength from the victims, who are already economically marginalised and may have been forced to move away from their homes due to fear and shame.<br/>Earlier this year, two Hindu men were sentenced to 20 years in jail for gang-raping a Muslim woman in 2013 during communal riots in Uttar Pradesh. The verdict was a landmark one but Ms Grover, who represented the complainant, points out that seven women had initially approached the court alleging sexual violence.<br/>\"Finally, only one woman stood and testified against her attackers,\" she says.<br/>Another example, Ms Farasat says, is Bilkis Bano, who was gang-raped and saw 14 members of her family being murdered by a Hindu mob during the 2002 anti-Muslim riots in Gujarat state. But the 11 convicts in the case were granted an early release from jail last year by the state's BJP government - when the men walked free on India's independence day, relatives celebrated by giving them sweets and touching their feet. Reports said the men were also garlanded by activists of a hardline Hindu organisation. <br/>\"In Bilkis's case, the wheels of justice did turn in her favour but we've come full circle and now the convicts are out again. Yet, even for that limited justice, Bilkis is an exception because she was one of the very few victims who was able to fight her case. Hers is a landmark case because she was the exception to the rule,\" she says.<br/>The state often offers compensation to victims but what they need is reparations, Ms Grover says.<br/>\"That includes rehabilitation, the guarantee of non-recurrence of the attack and social and economic restitution,\" she says.<br/>What needs to end, adds Ms Farasat, is the culture of impunity that gets strengthened with each successive incident.<br/>\"It's not just mobs, but also authorities such as police officers and politicians - everyone needs to be held accountable.\"<br/>BBC News India is now on YouTube.

In one place she was deployed, she said the facilities were so poor there was no space for staff to store their food, so people kept their lunches in a fridge-freezer that also contained evidence for rape cases.<br/>Another officer who is no longer with the force is Matt Lloyd-Rose, who from 2012 to 2015 worked as a teacher alongside serving with the Met as a special constable - a volunteer role with full police powers including those of arrest. <br/>Mr Lloyd-Rose, from Lambeth in south London, said some things he witnessed during his time with the force \"stunned\" him, including an occasion when his team had been out patrolling in a police van in Clapham.<br/>\"We'd been dealing with all sorts - stopping people for drugs, helping people who were drunk and confused, and chasing after illegal hotdog vendors,\" he said.<br/>\"One of the regular officers then said that we would we be going 'talent spotting'\", he added, and the team then drove \"back and forth along the high street\" while the regular officers were \"making comments about the women outside of the window, having some sort of group discussions about who is most attractive, about who they would be most interested in having sex with\".<br/>On another occasion, he said a young woman approached the team after her bag had been snatched on the bus.<br/>\"She was really upset; she was sobbing and was visibly extremely distressed,\" Mr Lloyd-Rose explained. \"And then the regular who's been dealing with her rolled his window back up again, and immediately said 'she'd get [sexual expletive]'.\"<br/>Mr Lloyd-Rose said that while he didn't witness \"overt aggressive discrimination\" there was a consistent \"reinforcing of norms and boundaries, something insidious\" that frequently involved targeting female staff.<br/>\"There was a real expectation the people who objected would be cut out of things, or would be provoked to try and overcome that objection,\" he said.<br/>Mr Lloyd-Rose added that this attitude wasn't only displayed by frontline officers but also by those leading training.<br/>\"One of the trainers was telling us about a female officer he had been on patrol with and he said: 'Before you ask, I have seen her naked when we were playing strip poker.'<br/>\"The culture was openly expressed in front of diverse groups of officers who that trainer didn't know at all, and he was kind of quite happy and confident that he could express that culture without anyone objecting.<br/>\"The institutional misogyny and sexism seemed ludicrously blatant, basically.<br/>\"That kind of culture both provides cover and and space for individuals with the most noxious views and others who have real intent to do harm, but it also provides a culture in which terrible things can become normalised.\"<br/>As a detective, Jess McDonald's experience was different from Mr Lloyd-Rose's - although perhaps no less worrying in terms of what it says about the Met Police and the criminal justice system more widely.<br/>During her time with the force, she was posted to the Community Safeguarding Unit, which deals with among other crimes cases of domestic and sexual violence.<br/>She said the department was \"internally known as the most difficult area of policing\" due to the \"trauma and the intensity of the role\".<br/>\"I would liken it before to kind of trying to fight a raging fire with a chocolate teapot.\"<br/>She said that a sense of \"hopelessness\" was evident, \"because you're investigating rapes day in day out and so few of them are actually being taken further\".<br/>\"It's the demoralisation of having to be the face or the person who turns round to someone who's going to have gone through the whole investigative process... and saying, 'you know I'm really sorry but it's not even being charged'.\"<br/>Ms McDonald said the feeling of \"futility\" among Met staff doing this work was so widespread that on several occasions female colleagues said they wouldn't bother reporting a sexual offence committed against them.<br/>On one occasion, a training leader even admitted she felt this way to an entire room of trainees learning how to investigate rape, Ms McDonald said.<br/>\"Whilst we were learning about it all theoretically she says something along the lines of, 'look, I probably wouldn't report it if it happened to me'.\"<br/>Asked if she saw or heard of any women being treated poorly within the force, Ms McDonald recalled a time when a female colleague said she knew was filmed by a man \"about to join a ranking of sergeant\" on a rape team, while woman used the shower in police accommodation.<br/>\"Luckily, there was a third officer [a witness to what happened] and he was a superintendent of the Met's Directorate of Professional Standards,\" she said.<br/>Ms McDonald said the offender had met her colleague the night before and \"knew exactly when she was going to be in the shower\".<br/>\"He films her using the shower through the glass window above the door. She was able to sort of see the phone in his hand when she passed out the shower and confronted him.\" <br/>Ms McDonald said the senior officer witnessed the confrontation and arrested his colleague for voyeurism.<br/>The offender went on to be convicted of voyeurism, but Ms McDonald said: \"I can't help thinking if the other guy hadn't seen that and jumped into action and knew what to do, I don't think my friend would have taken it further.\"<br/>Within the Met, she believes there should be a focus on \"empowering people to speak up internally on the front line\" in cases where vetting fails to exclude those officers who joined the police to abuse their power.<br/>\"Internally, people know who the bad ones are... people who are doing frontline work get a feel for people; who's creepy, who makes a comment,\" she said.<br/>\"We're currently doing nothing proactive... there is just this culture of silence and no-one really rocks the boat, nothing is really done. If you do speak up it's huge.\"<br/>A spokesperson for the Met Police said: \"The commissioner has been unequivocal about his commitment to reform the standards of the Met - he set out his plans following the publication of the Casey Report. <br/>\"We recognise that we have let down Londoners and our own staff.\"<br/>The spokesperson also highlighted the work the force has been doing \"to improve standards and root out officers who do not meet these\", including a review of sexual and domestic abuse allegations against more than 800 officers and a project to utilise counter-terror tactics to catch predators who target women.<br/>Matt Lloyd-Rose is the author of Into the Night: A Year with the Police, and Jess McDonald is the author of No Comment: What I Wish I'd Known about Becoming a Detective.<br/>Follow BBC London on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Total panic.<br/>\"It's hard not to believe that you're a criminal, that you're deserving of this,\" the Australian climate activist says.<br/>Last month, the 25-year-old had her home in Western Australia raided by counter-terrorism police. <br/>Her alleged crime - helping to flood a global fossil fuel giant's office with non-toxic gas.<br/>Stench gas, which smells like rotten eggs, is let off in mines to alert workers of danger. In this case, it was used by protesters to empty the Perth headquarters of Woodside Energy, to highlight the climate crisis.  <br/>Australia's largest oil and gas firm says the protests targeting its brand are \"unlawful\" activities by \"extreme groups\".<br/>But environmental campaigners say disruptive protest is key to their mission. <br/>Meanwhile, lawyers warn that the response to climate activism in Australia has become \"increasingly militarised\".<br/>Ms Sangalli says officers from Western Australia's State Security Investigation Group (SSIG) - whose duties include counter-terrorism - searched her home for hours, looking for evidence of her involvement in the Woodside protest. <br/>Despite facing no formal charges and not being present at the gas evacuation, she was forced to watch as her personal items were seized - including phones and laptops - and a male officer flicked through her diary. <br/>\"That was the most painful part,\" she told the BBC. <br/>\"Violated is a good word for it. You're rendered powerless.\" <br/>The activist has been involved with two climate protest groups - the global Extinction Rebellion, and the more local Disrupt Burrup Hub, which campaigns against fossil fuel projects on the state's Burrup Peninsula. <br/>Both groups follow a \"direct action\" strategy intended to end climate complacency, which means engaging in activities such as infiltrating fossil fuel conferences, blocking rush hour traffic, and superficially defacing artworks. <br/>Several members of the group are now facing criminal charges over the Woodside protest, with the company alleging four of its employees suffered dizziness, breathing difficulties, rashes, and nausea. <br/>\"Woodside condemns unlawful acts that are intended to threaten, harm, intimidate or disrupt our employees,\" the company said. <br/>But Disrupt Burrup maintains their protest stunt was carried out safely and was a necessary action against one of Australia's most powerful polluters.<br/>Its members are challenging the charges in court.<br/>Western Australia is a resource-rich state built on mining revenue, particularly iron ore, oil and gas.<br/>Its industry is concentrated in the Pilbara, a desert area in the state's far north. With an annual output of more than A$100bn (\u00a352bn; $67bn), it powers the national economy and is home to global mining giants, including Rio Tinto and BHP.  <br/>Some of Australia's most polluting projects are based there, including Woodside's North West Shelf gas facility and its Scarborough development - a controversial offshore drilling venture which scientists say will jeopardise the nation's climate targets. <br/>Both projects have sparked fierce debate and renewed accusations that the gas lobby has an outsized influence over state authorities. <br/>Access to ministers, timing of political donations and movement of mining executives into watchdogs, have all been cited as examples - including three former Woodside employees who chaired the advisory board of Australia's offshore oil and gas regulator. <br/>Gerard Mazza has led protests against Woodside's Pilbara projects, due to their emissions and damage to local ancient Aboriginal rock art. <br/>The 31-year-old's home was recently raided by SSIG police for his alleged role in attempting to evacuate Woodside's annual investors meeting in April, also using stench-gas.  <br/>He now faces charges of aggravated burglary, which carry a maximum 20-year sentence. <br/>Mr Mazza argues Western Australia is a \"petrostate\" designed to \"protect fossil fuel companies\" due to the money they bring in. <br/>\"If it was really all about public safety, the state would be cracking down on Woodside executives making obscene wealth by endangering lives and ecosystems. Instead, they're coming after us.\"<br/>The state government has routinely dismissed such claims, denying any influence. In response to the BBC's questions, it said it is \"committed to achieving net zero emissions by 2050\".<br/>But Western Australia's emissions continue to rise, while other states have recorded significant reductions over the past decade.<br/>A dozen raids - including those on Mr Mazza and Ms Sangalli's homes - have been carried out by the state's counter-terrorism police against climate protesters this year. <br/>The SSIG collaborates with federal intelligence agencies on matters of national security and is exempt from Freedom of Information laws, meaning its investigations remain secret. <br/>Lawyers such as Julia Grix says politicians and prosecutors are framing climate protesters as a threat to public safety to justify heavy-handed policing. <br/>The solicitor - who defends environmental activists - says her clients are increasingly being referred to as \"extremists\" in court documents. <br/>\"That sort of language is most commonly applied to organised crime of a very sophisticated kind, which I would associate with bikie (motorcycle) gangs, or terrorism,\" Ms Grix said. <br/>It's a \"demonisation strategy\" used to justify \"extreme measures never intended for regulating protests\", Australian legal scholar Luke McNamara says. <br/>The right to protest has long been defended by Australia's courts. <br/>In 2017, a landmark High Court case ruled that Tasmania's anti-protest laws were unconstitutional. And in 2020, a Queensland state court overturned suspended prison sentences against two activists who had blocked access to the major Adani coal mine. <br/>David Mejia-Canales, a lawyer at the Human Rights Law Centre, an Australian rights group, says those protections are key to a functioning democracy. <br/>\"Protest takes many forms, sometimes disruptive. But that's why it's effective, because it disrupts the everyday to demand attention for a cause,\" he said.<br/>\"As citizens of a democratic society, we should exercise a level of tolerance for disruption if the right to protest is going to have its full value.\"<br/>But Western Australia's emergency services minister, Stephen Dawson, recently argued in parliament that the evacuation of Woodside's offices could be viewed as \"an act of terrorism\" because \"people's health was put at risk by the material released\".<br/>And some of Australia's most prominent leaders - including former Prime Minister Scott Morrison - have called for demonstrations which obstruct critical infrastructure to be \"outlawed\". <br/>\"The right to protest does not mean there is an unlimited licence to disrupt people's lives,\" he said in 2019, labelling environmental campaigners \"anarchists\". <br/>The court cases under way in Western Australia are not taking place in isolation. <br/>They are part of a broader national crackdown which has seen Australian states criminalise disruptive protests through new laws, increased jail terms and penalties. This has sparked public outcry. <br/>In May, after several Extinction Rebellion protests, the South Australia government introduced a A$50,000 maximum fine and three months jail for anyone \"recklessly\" obstructing public spaces, while laws passed in New South Wales last year created a two-year maximum prison sentence for acts disrupting major roads or facilities. <br/>England, Wales and parts of Canada and the US have also adopted similar laws aimed at blocking disruptive climate activism. <br/>In Western Australia, climate protesters say they have been \"disabled\" by intimidating raids, strict bail conditions and orders which give authorities access to their devices and ban them from communicating with peers.<br/>According to Ms Grix, these tools were originally intended to deal with gangs and drug dealers.<br/>\"To apply [that]... to climate defenders, who are protesting about environmental concerns, seems to be a massive overreach,\" she says.<br/>Prof McNamara agrees. <br/>\"What we see in these situations is the police reaching for whatever is at their disposal,\" he told the BBC. <br/>\"Counterterrorism policing units and associated powers were never intended to be used against protesters.\"<br/>In the coming days, several court hearings will determine whether Mr Mazza and some of his peers could face prison. <br/>But the 31-year-old says that while \"climate and culture\" remain under threat, he will \"not be deterred\" from protesting.<br/>Climate activist's jailing ignites row in Australia<br/>How Australia is becoming more unliveable<br/>Is climate change killing Australian wine?<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

It has hundreds of signatories.<br/>AI lets a computer act and respond almost as if it were human.<br/>Computers can be fed huge amounts of information and trained to identify the patterns in it, in order to make predictions, solve problems, and even learn from their own mistakes.<br/>As well as data, AI relies on algorithms - lists of rules which must be followed in the correct order to complete a task.<br/>The Foundation was launched in 2018 and is a non-profit global group bringing together people working in tech and academia to look at the development of new technologies. <br/>Its questions for developers include how they will prevent an AI product from incorporating bias, and how they would deal with a situation in which the result generated by a tool results in law-breaking.<br/>This week shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said that the Labour Party would criminalise those who deliberately use AI tools for terrorist purposes.<br/>Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has appointed Ian Hogarth, a tech entrepreneur and AI investor to lead an AI taskforce. Mr Hogarth told me this week he wanted \"to better understand the risks associated with these frontier AI systems\" and hold the companies who develop them accountable.<br/>Other considerations in the framework include the data protection laws of various territories, whether it is clear to a user that they are interacting with AI, and whether human workers who input or tag data used to train the product were treated fairly.<br/>The full list is divided into three chapters: questions for individual developers, questions for a team to consider together, and questions for people testing the product.<br/>Some of the 84 questions are as follows:<br/>\"We're in this Wild West stage, where it's just kind of: 'Chuck it out in the open and see how it goes'.\" said Vince Lynch, founder of the firm IV.AI and advisor to the World Ethical Data Foundation board. He came up with the idea for the framework.<br/>\"And now those cracks that are in the foundations are becoming more apparent, as people are having conversations about intellectual property, how human rights are considered in relation to AI and what they're doing.\"<br/>If, for example, a model has been trained using some data that is copyright protected, it's not an option to just strip it out - the entire model may have to be trained again.<br/>\"That can cost hundreds of millions of dollars sometimes. It is incredibly expensive to get it wrong,\" Mr Lynch said.<br/>Other voluntary frameworks for the safe development of AI have been proposed.<br/>Margarethe Vestager, the EU's Competition Commissioner, is spearheading EU efforts to create a voluntary code of conduct with the US government, which would see companies using or developing AI sign up to a set of standards that are not legally binding.<br/>Willo is a Glasgow-based recruitment platform which has recently launched an AI tool to go with its service. <br/>The firm said it took three years to collect sufficient data to build it.<br/>Co-founder Andrew Wood said at one point the firm chose to pause its development in response to ethical concerns raised by its customers.<br/>\"We're not using our AI capabilities to do any decision making. The decision making is solely left with the employer,\" he said.<br/>\"There are certain areas where AI is really applicable, for example, scheduling interviews... but making the decision on whether to move forward [with hiring a candidate] or not, that's always going to be left to the human as far as we're concerned.\"<br/>Co-founder Euan Cameron said that transparency to users was for him an important section of the Foundation framework.<br/>\"If anyone's using AI, you can't sneak it through the backdoor and pretend it was a human who created that content,\" he said.<br/>\"It needs to be clear it was done by AI technology.

The result, many believe, will decide whether the relationship between Catalonia and Madrid improves or flares up once again.<br/>\"If the right wins, the situation could complicate in Catalonia,\" said Lola Garc\u00eda, a journalist at La Vanguardia newspaper who wrote an account of the 2017 crisis. <br/>\"We might well go back to seeing heightened tensions there.\"<br/>Socialist Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez declared improving the febrile atmosphere in Catalonia a priority when he first took office in 2018, and again when he formed a new coalition government in 2020.<br/>With that aim in mind, his administration pardoned nine politicians who had been jailed for their role in the 2017 independence bid. <br/>It also reformed the penal code, eliminating the crime of sedition and modifying the crime of misuse of public funds - both of which changes benefitted Catalan leaders who were facing legal action. <br/>Meanwhile, Mr S\u00e1nchez's government has also engaged in slow-moving talks with the pro-independence Catalan administration aimed at resolving the territorial problem.<br/>\"Today the situation in Catalonia is nothing like it was in 2017, 2018 or 2019,\" Mr S\u00e1nchez said recently, describing the Socialists as \"a party that defends the union of Spain\".<br/>However, reducing the tensions in Catalonia has come at a cost for Mr S\u00e1nchez.<br/>The conservative People's Party (PP) and far-right Vox have repeatedly attacked him for making concessions to nationalists and for receiving the parliamentary support of the pro-independence Catalan Republican Left (ERC).<br/>His reliance on the parliamentary votes of the Basque nationalists of EH Bildu - the successor to the political wing of the defunct Basque group Eta, which is deemed a terrorist organisation by the EU - has compounded that opprobrium, with some in his own party also expressing unease.<br/>Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o, the PP's candidate for prime minister, warned that Mr S\u00e1nchez has \"made Spain a hostage of those who want to break the territorial unity of our country\", a message many voters seem to endorse.<br/>The conservative leader has also tacitly criticised Mariano Rajoy, the PP's prime minister during the 2017 Catalan crisis.<br/>\"We probably should have acted earlier and not let things go as far as they did,\" Mr N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o said, suggesting he would be more proactive than his predecessor. <br/>A Spanish government that is hostile to regional identities could have an upside for the independence movement, reviving it after several years of in-fighting, according to journalist Lola Garc\u00eda. <br/>She also believes plans by the Catalan government, led by the moderate ERC, to stage a Madrid-approved referendum on independence in the coming legislature are likely to go nowhere.<br/>\"The Catalan government is aware that it will not achieve [a negotiated referendum] either with the PP in government or the Socialists,\" she said. Instead, she believes the regional administration is pushing for increased powers within its current arrangement as an autonomous region.   <br/>With the PP ahead of the Socialists according to most polls, but looking unlikely to secure an absolute majority, it is quite possible that Spain's next government will be formed by the conservatives in a coalition with the hardline unionists of Vox.<br/>\"We already know that a PP-Vox government would mean a threat to political freedoms and rights and democratic institutions here in Catalonia,\" said Meritxell Serret, minister of Foreign Action and the EU for the Catalan government.<br/>She pointed to areas of Spain where the two right-wing parties have already formed governing partnerships since local elections in May, such as the Valencia region and the Balearic Islands.<br/>In both cases, the new local government has announced plans to eliminate the office for defence of local languages, which opponents see as an attempt to eliminate regional identities.<br/>While Ms Serret says the Catalan government is not satisfied with the concessions made by the S\u00e1nchez administration, she frames the possibility of Vox entering a right-wing coalition in dramatic terms.<br/>\"Vox have been threatening they will illegalise pro-independence parties, for example,\" she said. <br/>\"We fear, and people fear, that they can represent a step back for our democracy to very dark moments when civil rights [and] freedoms were not only attacked, but were annulled.

so many consequences followed from that,\" he said.<br/>Typically, health authorities do not try to contain seasonal flu - instead relying on antiviral drugs and the flu jab, which could be adjusted to tackle a new pandemic form of the virus.<br/>Other witnesses, including Dame Jenny Harries, the chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), appeared to contradict Mr Cameron, describing the government's flu plan as \"actually pretty good\". <br/>Matt Hancock, former health secretary, meanwhile, said the bigger, more damaging mistake was the widespread assumption that Covid could not be stopped or contained when it started to spread. <br/>He said authorities were too narrowly focused on planning for the fallout, such as \"can we buy enough body bags?\".<br/>\"That was completely wrong,\" he added.<br/>Other countries managed more effectively to suppress the initial wave of Covid than the UK, reducing the number of deaths and - in some cases - avoiding strict lockdowns. <br/>Witnesses, including former health secretary and current Chancellor Jeremy Hunt, told the inquiry that the UK did not learn lessons from Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea, which had seen earlier outbreaks of two other coronaviruses - Sars and Mers. <br/>In those countries, faster contact-tracing and quarantine policies were subsequently deployed to promptly isolate cases and clamp down when Covid first emerged.<br/>In the UK, the civil service had previously run a mock-up training day - codenamed Exercise Alice - in 2016, in preparation for a major outbreak of the Mers virus.<br/>But the inquiry heard many of its recommendations, including advice to scale up testing capacity and examine different options for isolation, were not followed through. <br/>This video can not be played<br/>Prof Dame Sally Davies tells the Covid inquiry \"it wasn't just the deaths, it was the way they died\".<br/>Another major theme was the strength - or resilience - of the healthcare system when Covid emerged in 2020. <br/>England's former chief medical officer, Dame Sally Davies, was heavily critical of the state of the NHS at the time of the outbreak, saying it had been \"divested\" - with fewer doctors, nurses, beds and ventilators than similar countries.<br/>Academics Sir Michael Marmot and Clare Bambra produced a report stating that poorer regions and ethnic minority groups were disproportionally affected by a decade of austerity policies, with the UK entering the pandemic with \"depleted\" public services and rising inequality.<br/>Giving his evidence, George Osborne, who was chancellor from 2010 to 2016, said he \"completely rejected\" that description. <br/>\"If we had not had a clear plan to put the public finances on a sustainable path, then Britain might have experienced a financial crisis [and] would not have had the fiscal space to deal with coronavirus when it hit,\" he argued.<br/>From 2018, government departments were being asked to step up planning for a so-called 'no-deal Brexit', under the codename Operation Yellowhammer. <br/>According to documents seen by the inquiry, a number of internal 'workstreams' in the Department of Health related to pandemic planning were therefore paused, or slowed, as staff were moved and other tasks prioritised.<br/>That paused work included plans to better prepare the adult social care sector for a severe influenza pandemic.<br/>The Pandemic Flu Readiness Board, a cross-government body made up of civil servants from across Whitehall, did not meet for a whole year up to November 2019 because their work was \"reprioritised\" to plan for leaving the EU without a trade deal. <br/>Scotland's former first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, told the inquiry that the Scottish government was \"not at all happy\" about having to divert \"time, energy and resources\" in this way. <br/>But Conservative cabinet ministers Michael Gove and Oliver Dowden, both said that no-deal planning had increased staffing, compelled departments to work more closely together and secured supply chains for medical supplies. <br/>Additionally, Matt Hancock claimed that work on a no-deal exit was instrumental in preventing the UK running out of some intensive care drugs at the peak of the first wave of Covid.<br/>The inquiry also heard moving evidence from the families of some of those who lost their lives to Covid.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Bereaved families express their sense of loss in a film shown to the inquiry<br/>Anna-Louise Marsh-Rees's father, Ian, contracted the virus while being treated in hospital in Abergavenny for a gall bladder infection.<br/>Jane Morrison spoke about the loss of her wife, Jacky, who died in hospital in Dundee after being admitted for another unrelated condition - jaundice.<br/>Groups representing bereaved family members said poor infection control was a \"glaring flaw\" in hospital planning. <br/>They also described the handling of funerals - and how they were conducted during the pandemic - as traumatic, with relatives often unable to say a proper goodbye to loved ones. <br/>Witnesses described national lockdowns as the most \"extraordinary\" policy of the pandemic. <br/>The political decisions which led to nationwide lockdowns will be explored in detail during the inquiry's second phase in October. <br/>Already though, we know a strict lockdown - with widespread school and business closures - was never planned for in advance.<br/>Matt Hancock said there was \"no prep for how to do one, no work on how best to lock down with the least damage\". <br/>England's chief medical officer, Sir Chris Whitty, suggested it would have been near impossible for scientific advisers to plan in advance for something so radical without being asked to by a senior politician.<br/>The inquiry team will try to answer why - given it is the government's job to consider these things - the longer term impacts of lockdown were not properly thought through before 2020.<br/>You can follow Jim on twitter and threads.<br/>Covid Inquiry: Were We Prepared<br/>Watch on iPlayer: Jim Reed looks at the key moments from the first part of the Covid inquiry.<br/>Available now on BBC iPlayer (UK only)<br/>Covid inquiry: The UK pandemic in numbers<br/>What is the UK Covid inquiry and how long will it take?<br/>UK Covid-19 Inquiry<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing -

Prices are still rising quite sharply compared to a year ago, just at a slower rate than they have been.<br/>Prices are still likely to keep going up over the next few months, but not at the rate that has caused such a shock to households and businesses across the country over the last year.<br/>The inflation figure is an average - so your own cost of living could be rising at a very different rate to what's reported in the news, depending on what you spend your money on.<br/>The Office for National Statistics (ONS) which calculates inflation, bases its numbers on a basket of goods that reflects what most people across the UK are buying. But it doesn't include everything. So if you are buying a lot of unusual or niche items, or you have atypical tastes, you might find the cost of your own bag of shopping is going up more quickly - or more slowly - than the headlines suggest.<br/>Food inflation is currently at 17.3%, much higher than the average rate, so people who spend a greater proportion of their outgoings on food will find their personal inflation rate is higher than the 7.9% headline figure.<br/>The ONS says energy, food, and drink accounts for around 15% of lower-income households' spending, compared to 10% for high-income groups.<br/>The Bank of England tries to control inflation by putting up interest rates which makes it more expensive to borrow money. This encourages people to borrow and spend less, and save more.<br/>The Bank is expected to stick with that strategy - of putting up interest rates - throughout this year. So if you have a tracker mortgage or a credit card or loan you could find yourself paying more interest. That's another way your own personal inflation rate could be affected.<br/>Try our personal inflation rate calculator<br/>Occasionally prices will fall very slightly compared to the previous month, but they are much less likely to fall year-on-year.<br/>And while this might be difficult to believe right now, falling prices aren't always a good thing - here's why.<br/>If people expect that prices are likely to fall, they delay spending with the aim of getting a cheaper deal later on. <br/>That means businesses have less money coming in, so they try to find ways to cut costs - most likely by cutting wages or laying off staff. <br/>So prices falling can mean people lose their jobs, which in turn makes prices fall further. This is called \"deflation\", a different kind of economic crisis that brings its own set of problems.<br/>That's why the Bank of England aims to have prices consistently rising by 2% - it's better to aim for a bit of inflation than to risk the negative effects of prices falling.<br/>It's important to remember that the price rises we've seen recently have been primarily driven by global energy prices. These are expected to come down, but not to as low as they were before, and any fall in energy prices will take time to feed through into the wider economy.<br/>Petrol prices drop but food keeps inflation high<br/>Why is UK inflation so high?<br/>What do I do if I can't afford to pay my debts?<br/>Why inflation is worse for some people than others<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

He said the company was committed to reaching an \"equitable\" agreement that helped the industry move into the future. <br/>But he added: \"We've got a lot of work to do.\"<br/>Netflix has been wrestling with a sharp slowdown in growth since the pandemic, as competition heats up, households grapple with rising costs and it reaches what analysts see as saturation point in some of its biggest markets.<br/>In the first half of last year, it shed roughly 1 million accounts. Though it later more than made up those losses, the declines jolted the company and sent it scrambling to shore up its growth prospects. <br/>Netflix said customers were enticed by new options it has introduced that cost less than a standard subscription.<br/>The company introduced its \"paid sharing\" programme in the UK, US and other major markets in May, charging an extra fee if users want to share passwords with people outside their households.<br/>In the UK, it asks a little less than half of the \u00a310.99 cost of a standard subscription.<br/>The programme is now present in more than 100 countries. <br/>The company also launched a less expensive streaming plan with ads last year and cut prices in dozens of countries in February. <br/>Netflix said few people had cancelled as a result of the password changes and it believed the programme would fuel similar subscriber gains in the months ahead. <br/>It has estimated that more than 100 million households share passwords in breach of its official rules.<br/>\"While we're still in the early stages, we're seeing healthy conversion of borrower households,\" the company said in a quarterly update to investors. \"Now that we've launched paid sharing broadly we have increased confidence in our financial outlook.\"<br/>Paolo Pescatore, analyst at PP Foresight, said the subscriber gains were robust and a \"strong endorsement\" of Netflix's strategy.<br/>But he called the password crackdown a short-term measure, saying the company would need to fine-tune its pricing in the months ahead.<br/>\"The company is still in a far stronger position compared to rivals and remains the benchmark,\" he said, noting that Netflix's streaming plan with advertising is much cheaper than many current offerings from rivals.<br/>Analysts said the company's big library and the scale of its international production may help it in the months ahead, as Hollywood wrestles with the impact of the strikes. <br/>These have already disrupted production schedules for a number of films and series. <br/>\"Of everyone in the entertainment industry, Netflix appears to be the best positioned,\" said Brandon Katz, entertainment industry strategist at Parrot Analytics, which tracks streaming demand, noting that the company still leads its peers, despite strong competition.<br/>Despite the subscriber gains, the $8.18bn (\u00a36.32bn) in revenue Netflix reported disappointed investors, rising just 2.7% from last year. Profits were $1.49bn.  <br/>Netflix said that it has limited its price hikes in recent months, leading to a slowdown in revenue growth that gains from its password crackdown and new advertising were not big enough to offset.  <br/>It said it expected that to change by the end of this year, as advertising revenue increases. <br/>It has stopped offering its least expensive commercial-free plan in the US, UK and Canada in a bid to push price-conscious customers to the ad-funded version. <br/>Membership of its ads plan \"nearly doubled\" from March - though from a \"small base\", the company said.<br/>\"Netflix needs to squeeze as much juice as it can from different avenues, given a recent lack of price increases could suggest that inflation is starting to bite Netflix's ability to crank up its subscription price, as households look to trim their spending,\" said Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.<br/>\"Initial progress seems positive, but we are realms away from knowing for sure if this venture is the cash cow it's been sold as.\"<br/>Shares, which have surged 60% this year amid investor enthusiasm for the company's plans, dipped in after-hours trade. <br/>Ms Lund-Yates said the company had delivered a \"sturdy\" performance and the fall reflected the high expectations for the company.<br/>What happens next as Hollywood grinds to a halt<br/>Hollywood strike could last until end of the year<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

The RDG continues to call on the union to give its members a vote on the offer.<br/>RMT boss Mick Lynch said \"there are conditions in this offer that we can't live with\", and ministers had not granted the operators permission to negotiate further.<br/>But RDG boss Jacqueline Starr said the existing \"very good\" offer remained on the table, and the RDG was \"very open to continuing conversations\".  <br/>She added that the industry \"can't afford for the industry to stand still\", and would \"continue with reform\".<br/>Train firms are pressing ahead with plans to close the majority of ticket offices in England. <br/>The plans have faced criticism from disability campaigners and unions which are trying to block the reforms. <br/>The Transport Focus watchdog called the response to its consultation, which is running until Wednesday 26 July, \"huge\" so far.<br/>However, it said it was too soon to say whether the responses were mostly for or against the proposed closures.<br/>Five Labour mayors are preparing a legal challenge, saying the 21-day timescale for the consultation was  \"totally inadequate\".<br/>Under the proposals, some ticket kiosks would remain in large stations, but elsewhere staff will be on concourses to sell tickets, offer travel advice and help people with accessibility.<br/>However, Mr Lynch said that some stations would \"only get staff for two hours, so if you're an elderly person travelling off-peak, there will be no-one there to assist you\".<br/>He added that 2,300 station staff are \"not being moved from behind glass to assist passengers\" but instead would be made redundant \"en masse\".<br/>Last week, Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle challenged rail minister Huw Merriman over the planned closures.<br/>Mr Merriman had said \"no currently staffed station will become unstaffed\" as a result of the proposals.<br/>But Mr Hoyle said the railway station in his constituency, Chorley, would effectively become unstaffed after 4pm.<br/>Ms Starr said on Wednesday that the planned closures were \"about people bringing people out from behind the glass screens\".<br/>Staff would be \"on the concourse, enabling a conversation with customers, enabling them to assist customers, have a dialogue, and also, when necessary, helping customers to navigate the ticket vending machines which would be on the platform,\" she said.<br/>Ms Starr insisted the industry was \"genuinely listening to the accessibility groups that have a number of concerns\", and she was having meetings with the rail minister and disability groups.<br/>When asked by the BBC on Wednesday if she would promise that every ticket currently available at ticket offices could be found on at a machine or online, including the least expensive, Ms Starr replied: \"I'm not going to make promises that I can't keep.\"<br/>She added: \"We are working hard to ensure that where possible, every ticket is offered by a ticket vending machine\".<br/>Campaigner Natasha Winter, who set up the Save Stourbridge Ticket Office group, said when she found out about the consultation on the ticket office closures she was \"absolutely outraged\".<br/>\"We're talking about punishing and penalising the members of society who maybe can't use new technology,\" she said.<br/>\"The station is going to become less user-friendly for the whole community,\" she added. <br/>When are the train strikes and which lines are affected?<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Cheetahs, declared extinct in 1952 in India, were reintroduced as part of the world's first intercontinental relocation of a large carnivore. They are housed in Kuno national park in the central state of Madhya Pradesh.<br/>So far, eight cheetahs, including three cubs born in March, have died. <br/>Some of the deaths have been caused by unavoidable reasons, such as cardiac failure precipitated by stress or mating injuries. <br/>But several wildlife experts and veterinary doctors have told the BBC that the last two deaths were caused by maggot infestations following skin infections. And they say one of the reasons could be the radio collars that the animals are made to wear for their own protection.<br/>It's a theory the environment and forests ministry has strongly rejected. In an official statement, the ministry insisted that the adult cheetahs all died \"due to natural causes\" and said reports blaming radio collars were \"speculative and lacking in scientific evidence\". The BBC also contacted Rajesh Gopal, chairman of the cheetah project, but he hasn't responded yet. <br/>Wildlife experts, however, say such injuries are not uncommon among other big cats too, especially during India's humid rainy season.<br/>Alok Kumar, former chief conservator of forests in Madhya Pradesh, told the BBC that the deaths among big cats could be due to many reasons but radio collars - although key to their survival - could be a factor too. <br/>\"These collars carry chips that send information about the wearer through satellites and are necessary to monitor the movement of the animal for their safety and protection,\" Mr Kumar said, adding that he \"has seen infections caused by collars even in tigers\".<br/>Yadvendradev Jhala, veteran conservationist and one of the experts who planned and oversaw the translocation project, told the BBC that the wounds may be caused by the animal scratching the area around the collar because of humidity.<br/>\"This is the first monsoon for the cheetahs who have come from the jungles of Africa which are dry zones and they are still trying to acclimatise to Indian monsoon,\" he said.<br/>The cheetahs \"have a very heavy under-fur\" - thick hair under their neck - which absorbs a lot of moisture in very damp weather and that makes it soft and tender and itchy. <br/>\"And when the animal scratches, if the skin breaks, then flies lay eggs there and a maggot infestation happens which leads to a bacterial invasion and causes septicaemia, leading to death,\" he added.<br/>A lot of prestige is attached to the cheetah project in India - Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself travelled to Kuno last September to release the first batch of eight cheetahs from Namibia into the national park. (Another 12 of the big cats were brought in from South Africa earlier this year.) So it's no surprise that every death - and birth - makes headlines.<br/>The death of the cubs from \"malnourishment and dehydration\" had led many to ask why the authorities didn't intervene in time to ensure their survival. Similar questions are being asked now after last week's deaths.<br/>One vet who has seen a video of one of the two bodies said on condition of anonymity that \"it was covered with thousands of maggots from head to toe\".<br/>\"It takes several days for an animal to die from a maggot infestation, so how come no-one noticed?\" he asked. <br/>The last cheetah to die was Suraj, spotted last Friday by a monitoring team \"in a lethargic state\" with \"a fly around its neck\", the Indian Express reported. Three hours later, Suraj was found dead. <br/>A wildlife official said \"initial investigation found the cause of the feline's death to be wounds on the neck and back\". <br/>The paper quoted Madhya Pradesh principal chief conservator of forests JS Chauhan - who has since been removed from his position - as saying that another male cheetah, who had died a few days earlier, had similar injuries. Mr Chauhan said that \"one of the causes could be the satellite collars\".<br/>On Wednesday, reports said at least three other cheetahs were sick with similar wounds, with wildlife experts calling on the authorities to investigate the role of radio collars in the deaths.<br/>Mr Jhala says the only way to deal with the situation is to check all the remaining cheetahs to see if any of them have any lesions.<br/>\"And if they find any, then they have to treat them. The collars, of course, can't be put back on until an animal has fully healed, which means that the cheetahs will have to be brought back into protected enclosures for their safety,\" he adds.<br/>The action plan for the reintroduction of the cheetah in India had anticipated a 50% mortality rate in the first year of the project.<br/>Mr Jhala says it was anticipated that the deaths would be from snaring and poaching, accidents involving vehicles and in conflict with leopards. <br/>\"It's very positive that the anticipated causes haven't happened,\" he said. \"On the other hand, the deaths that have taken place have been a learning experience, a very expensive learning experience.\"<br/>Mr Kumar says that projects like these are expected to have a long gestation period.<br/>\"Cheetah is a new species in our home. It may take five to 10 years to settle them in the Indian subcontinent,\" he said. \"We are taking lessons every day, learning how to manage and protect them.\"<br/>BBC News India is now on YouTube.

Seeing them play at a World Cup for the first time will be a big moment.<br/>\"To have a past player like Ciara out there is incredible.\"<br/>Since the peace deal in 1998, people living in Northern Ireland can choose to be Irish, British or both. <br/>That choice for football fans and players came much earlier. <br/>Paul Rouse is a professor of history at University College Dublin and he says the split in football goes back to the partition of Ireland in the 1920s. <br/>He explains that teams in most sports were able to recruit players from both sides of the border.<br/>But in football, two rival governing bodies sprung up.<br/>Paul says there was a period until the 1950s when both teams called themselves Ireland and recruited players from either side of the border. <br/>But world governing body FIFA put a stop to this, insisting on \"a clear separation\", he says.<br/>\"One team was called Northern Ireland and the other the Republic of Ireland from that point on.\" <br/>Players in Northern Ireland can choose to represent either team, and that choice depends on their cultural identity, according to Paul. <br/>\"They pick a team that represents their national identity, often the community where they grow up.\"<br/>Sion Swift Kerry Brown has represented the Republic of Ireland at younger age groups. <br/>\"I've always supported Ireland. It's hard to describe what it's like to play for your country, hearing that national anthem is something special,\" she says.<br/>Kerry thinks seeing the team play in the World Cup will inspire young girls both north and south of the Irish border to play football.<br/>\"There are so many younger girls with those players' names on the back of their shirts now.\"<br/>Follow Newsbeat on Twitter and YouTube.<br/>Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.<br/>Who will win the 2023 Women's World Cup?<br/>'I loved football but it was taking its toll'<br/>Who will win Women's World Cup?

In fact, she signed up for it.<br/>\"It's a bit like that Black Mirror episode with Salma Hayek,\" Ms Yeo jokes.<br/>She was speaking to the BBC the day after the release of the new series of Charlie Brooker's Netflix show. In the first episode, actress Salma Hayek, playing a fictionalised version of herself, signs away her image to a production company.<br/>The deal allows it to use an artificial intelligence or AI-generated deepfake version of the Hollywood A-lister to \"star\" in their new TV drama. What she says and does in the show is controlled by the computer.<br/>The consequences for Ms Hayek - without spoiling the story - are not good.<br/>Concerns about the impact of AI are partly behind the first Hollywood actors' strike in more than four decades, bringing the US movie and television business to a halt.<br/>It comes after Screen Actors Guild (SAG-AFTRA) failed to reach an agreement in the US for better protections against the misuse of AI for its members.<br/>The actors' union has warned that \"artificial intelligence poses an existential threat to creative professions\" as it prepared to dig in over the issue.<br/>However, Ms Yeo is not worried. She is one of a growing number of celebrities embracing AI-generated advertising.<br/>The new technology is being met with a mixture of excitement and trepidation.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Singapore celeb Jamie Yeo has embraced AI deepfakes<br/>Ms Yeo has just agreed a deal with financial technology firm Hugosave, which allows it to use a digitally manipulated likeness of her to sell their content.<br/>The process is fairly simple. She spends a couple of hours in front of a green screen to capture her face and movements, then a couple more hours in a recording studio to capture her voice.<br/>An AI programme then synchronises the images with the audio to create a digital alter-ego capable of saying practically anything. The results are uncanny.<br/>\"I do understand the concern, but this technology is here to stay,\" she says. \"So even if you don't embrace it because you're scared, there will be other people who will embrace it.\"<br/>Some already have. As part of his deal with PepsiCo, superstar footballer Lionel Messi allowed it to use a deepfake version of himself to advertise Lay's crisps.<br/>Not only can online users create personalised video messages from \"Lionel Messi\", they can get him to say it in English, Spanish, Portuguese and Turkish.<br/>Fellow football superstar David Beckham and Hollywood legend Bruce Willis have also dabbled with deepfake technology - though, unlike Ms Yeo, they have so far stopped short of signing away full image rights.<br/>\"I think deepfakes will just become part of normal practice in the advertising industry over the next few years,\" says Dr Kirk Plangger, a marketing expert at King's College London.<br/>\"It opens the door to all kinds of creative options. They're able to micro-target consumers and are often extremely persuasive.\"<br/>The efficiency of the process also makes it attractive from a commercial point of view.<br/>\"You're not doing that much work for the money you're charging,\" Ms Yeo says.<br/>\"It's also good for the client on a budget because they get so much more content than from a normal shoot. So it works for everyone.\" <br/>The client - in this case Singapore-based Hugosave - agrees. <br/>\"Having this technology available means we can literally produce hundreds of videos in a matter of days. Compare that to the months, if not years, that we'd need if we were filming the content in the traditional way,\" says Braham Djidjelli, Hugosave's co-founder and chief product officer.<br/>\"We're able to leverage the benefit of AI while also retaining the human touch of a trusted local face - in this case Jamie's.\"<br/>But, as analysts such as Dr Plangger point out, there is a \"dark side\" to the technology. <br/>\"It's not something we can put back into the box,\" he says. \"The advertising industry needs to wake up to the risks as well as the possibilities of artificial intelligence. It means stepping back, as a society, and thinking about what is the proper or ethical use of this technology.\"<br/>One of the things Dr Plangger is referring to is a looming \"crisis of trust\", where consumers cannot tell between what is real or fake. This is something already being exploited by vested interests online and can range from synthetically manipulated pornography to misinformation to political messaging.<br/>This week BBC News is focussing on AI, how the technology affects our lives and what impacts it may have in the near future.<br/>But there are also more practical risks for the talent voluntarily signing up to be deepfaked. Currently, there are no clear laws relating to AI to ensure your image is properly protected.<br/>For example, what happens if a brand uses your digital avatar to endorse a product that may damage your image or your alter-ego makes a joke in poor taste?<br/>\"We are in uncharted territory when it comes to AI and deepfake technology,\" says Tng Sheng Rong, an intellectual property lawyer at Rajah and Tann in Singapore. <br/>\"Many, many issues can arise. Who owns the intellectual property? Who do you go to for legal recourse? The truth of the matter is that the existing laws don't provide a robust enough regulatory framework to guard against these issues.\"<br/>That may be the final hurdle for advertisers before they start buying rights to digital versions of Hollywood A-listers, for example.<br/>At this early stage, Ms Yeo says she is very mindful of the risks, but her decision was informed mainly by trust - both in Hugosave and in the way business is done in Singapore.<br/>But ultimately, she says, it is about staying ahead of the curve.<br/>\"If you want to still be in the game, then you've got to learn how to be in it. Because if you don't, you should probably just retire.\"<br/>The Black Mirror plot about AI that worries actors<br/>Students switch to AI to learn languages<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>AI 'godfather' says it won't destroy jobs forever<br/>What is AI and is it dangerous?<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

What happened with the daughters of Manipur can never be forgiven,\" he said, finally breaking his silence on Manipur more than two months after violence erupted. <br/>India video shows how rape is weaponised in conflict<br/>Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud also expressed concern over the assault, saying the Supreme Court was \"deeply disturbed over the video\". Telling the government to inform the court about the steps being taken against the accused, the chief justice said \"we will take action if you don't\". <br/>Deadly violence has plunged Manipur, a scenic Indian state bordering Myanmar, into turmoil for more than two months. <br/>Clashes between members of the majority Meitei and the Kuki tribal communities have resulted in their complete segregation. At least 130 people have died and 60,000 have been displaced.<br/>The two women, who are Kukis, were assaulted by men of the Meitei group.<br/>Warning: This article contains details some readers may find distressing.<br/>Police say the assault on the women took place on 4 May but it made national headlines on Thursday after the video started going viral on social media. The federal government has asked all social media companies to delete the video from their platforms. <br/>The horrific video of the two women was widely shared on social media on Wednesday. It shows them being dragged and groped by a mob of men who then push them into a field.<br/>The Indigenous Tribal Leaders' Forum (ITLF) said in a statement that the atrocities had been committed in a village in Kangpokpi district against women from the Kuki-Zo tribal community. It also alleged that the women had been gang raped. <br/>By Geeta Pandey, BBC News, Delhi<br/>It's well known that women's bodies often become a battleground during riots and conflicts, and rape and sexual assault are used as instruments of violence to punish them. <br/>The sexual assault of the Kuki women in Manipur is the latest example. The footage showing the women weeping, wincing in pain and begging their attackers to show some mercy is disturbing to watch. <br/>The fact that the first arrest has been made only now, more than two months after the attack was reported to police, does not inspire confidence in the authorities - all the more so since many of the men are clearly identifiable in the footage.<br/>But the outrage that followed the video's emergence in India has put the spotlight on the horrific crime. It has also raised questions about the failure of the state in comforting the survivors - and finally forced Mr Modi to make a statement on the ethnic violence that is tearing Manipur apart.<br/>To restore some sort of confidence in Manipur, especially among the minority Kuki community, the authorities are now under pressure to act swiftly against the perpetrators and bring justice to the women. People across the country feel this should not be happening in modern India.<br/>\"The gang rape of the women happened after the village was burnt down and two men - one middle-aged and another a teenager - were beaten to death by the mob,\" the ITLF said.<br/>But the police complaint filed by a relative of one of the women said only one of them was gang raped. It added that a third woman had been forced to strip but she is not seen in the video. <br/>Police said that the incident took place on 4 May and that a case of abduction and gang rape and murder had been registered in Thoubal district.  <br/>The assault has been condemned by politicians across the spectrum.<br/>Federal minister Smriti Irani, called it \"downright inhuman\".<br/>Several opposition leaders also criticised the Bharatiya Janata Party government for not doing enough to quell the violence in the state.<br/>Congress party leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadhra said that the \"images of sexual violence against women from Manipur are heart wrenching\".<br/>Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal weighed in too. \"This kind of heinous act cannot be tolerated in the Indian society,\" he said.<br/>BBC News India is now on YouTube.

Relations with the US have plummeted in recent years, as it has tested dozens of increasingly powerful missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads. <br/>On its travel advisory, the US tells its citizens not to travel to North Korea - one of the world's most isolated states - due to \"the continuing serious risk of arrest\" and the \"critical threat of wrongful detention\". <br/>It is unclear if PV2 King has defected or hopes to return. <br/>Experts say such a low-ranking soldier would have little propaganda and intelligence value, which may prompt North Korea into releasing him - but what will happen to him remains highly uncertain. <br/>The lack of precedent makes it hard to foresee next steps - it's been decades since a US soldier last defected to the North.<br/>The fact that Pyongyang is not responding to US attempts to communicate is adding to the uncertainty. <br/>PV2 King was due to fly back to the US from South Korea, where he was based, to face disciplinary action.<br/>But the 23-year-old did not board the plane when he parted ways with his military escorts at Incheon Airport near Seoul on Tuesday and instead embarked on an apparently pre-booked tour to the border - the details of how he managed to do that are still unclear. <br/>US defence officials said the soldier \"wilfully\" crossed into the North over one of the most heavily-fortified areas in the world. <br/>The DMZ has separated the two countries since the Korean War in the 1950s, in which the US backed the South. The war ended with an armistice, meaning that the two sides are still technically at war. Tens of thousands of US troops remain in the South.<br/>Pyongyang could use PV2 King as a propaganda tool to criticise the US military,  said James Fretwell, an analyst at Seoul-based specialist site NK News.<br/>\"King may well show up in North Korean state media at some point in the near future. But a lot depends on how long his interrogation, and maybe his Covid-19 quarantine, lasts,\" he added. North Korea still maintains a strict border lockdown in response to the pandemic. <br/>But Jenny Town, director of the Stimson Center's 38 North Program, believes Mr King \"does not make for a very ideal or compelling soldier story\".<br/>\"There have also been cases long ago of US soldiers who defected and were allowed to stay\u2026 But in those cases, there was political value to [their stories] and it was a very different time, and a different leader,\" she said.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Travis King's brother speaks after arrest<br/>Meanwhile, behind the scenes, diplomats and military officials are desperately trying to talk to the North Koreans to find out what is going on, but engaging them is not easy. <br/>State department spokesman Matthew Miller said the US, which has no diplomatic relations with North Korea, has other channels to communicate.<br/>He said department officials were engaging with counterparts in South Korea and Sweden to access information on PV2 King - but US officials knew nothing of his current condition or whereabouts.<br/>Given that the two countries do not have diplomatic relations, the Swedish embassy in Pyongyang tends to negotiate on behalf of the US.

But if the interruption in supplies leads to a prolonged period of higher prices, the impact will make itself felt around the world in the coming months.<br/>The sharp increase in grain cost after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year lead to rising prices - not just for food items based on grains, but also for meat and poultry, as animals are often fed with grain. <br/>Countries which depend most heavily on Ukraine's supplies are likely to be most affected. Before the war Lebanon received nearly three-quarters of its grain from Ukraine, while Pakistan, Libya and Ethiopia are also very heavily dependent. <br/>Earlier, President Vladimir Putin said he would return to the international grain agreement immediately if his demands were met. They include lifting sanctions on sales of Russian grain and fertiliser and reconnecting Russia's agricultural bank to a global payment system.<br/>Russian air strikes on the Black Sea coastal cities meanwhile continued for a third night, leaving more than 20 people wounded in Odesa and Mykolaiv. <br/>Mykolaiv regional governor Vitaliy Kim said 19 people had been hurt in the regional capital, including children. Apartment blocks were targeted and in one building the second and top floor were partially destroyed.<br/>Several people were also wounded in Odesa, when a four-storey building was badly damaged.<br/>Russian-occupied Crimea was also hit overnight, according to its Russian-appointee leader Sergei Aksyonov.<br/>A teenage girl was killed when a drone hit four administrative buildings in the north-west of the peninsula.<br/>Crimea has been hit on three consecutive days. A suspected Ukrainian drone attack from the sea damaged a bridge from the occupied peninsula to southern Russia on Monday. Part of a key motorway was also shut on Tuesday because of explosions at a nearby munitions depot.<br/>Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Russia of deliberately targeting grain export infrastructure and putting vulnerable countries at risk.<br/>Agriculture Minister Mykola Solskyi said strikes had destroyed 60,000 tonnes of grain and damaged considerable parts of the grain export infrastructure.<br/>The Black Sea grain deal enabled the UN's World Food Programme (WFP) to ship more than 725,000 tonnes of wheat from Ukraine to countries facing acute hunger, including Ethiopia, Yemen and Afghanistan. So Ukraine provided more than half the WFP's wheat grain last year.<br/>More than half the total grain shipped under the deal was corn, however. Of the nearly 33m tonnes exported, the biggest amount went to China (8m tonnes), then Spain (6m tonnes) and Turkey (3.2m tonnes), UN data shows.<br/>Turkey has been milling grain into flour for the WFP. Corn is used as biofuel and animal feed, besides human consumption.<br/>The defence ministry in Moscow said that from Thursday all vessels sailing on the Black Sea to Ukrainian ports would be regarded as \"potential carriers of military cargo\" and that the ships' \"flag states... will be considered to be involved in the Ukrainian conflict on the side of the Kyiv regime\".<br/>On Wednesday Mr Putin accused the West of using the grain deal as \"political blackmail\". Moscow has accused Ukraine of using the Black Sea grain corridor for \"combat purposes\". <br/>Ukraine's options for exporting grain by rail are also very limited: rail capacity is smaller than shipping volumes and several EU countries in Eastern Europe are blocking Ukrainian grain, in order to protect their own farmers.<br/>Some Ukrainian grain may now be shipped via the Danube, using Romanian territorial waters, though again the volumes are likely to be relatively small.<br/>Marex Capital analyst Charlie Sernatinger said Russia's threatened escalation could \"cut all of the waterborne grain shipments off from the Black Sea, both Russian, and Ukrainian\", which would cause a similar situation to that at the start of the war.<br/>Ukrainian MP Oleksiy Goncharenko called on the UK, US, France and Turkey to protect the grain ships with military convoys and provide Odesa with air defences.<br/>\"Clearly Putin has an aim to disrupt food security and cause a peak in world food prices, which in the developed countries will lead to inflation, but in developing countries that will lead to social destabilisation, starvation and new waves of migrants.\"<br/>Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>What was the Ukraine grain deal?<br/>Russia's grain deal exit stab in the back - Kenya<br/>Russia says Crimea bridge partially open to cars again<br/>No fast results in offensive, warns Ukrainian commander<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

He said the company was committed to reaching an \"equitable\" agreement that helped the industry move into the future. <br/>But he added: \"We've got a lot of work to do.\"<br/>Netflix has been wrestling with a sharp slowdown in growth since the pandemic, as competition heats up, households grapple with rising costs and it reaches what analysts see as saturation point in some of its biggest markets.<br/>In the first half of last year, it shed roughly 1 million accounts. Though it later more than made up those losses, the declines jolted the company and sent it scrambling to shore up its growth prospects. <br/>Netflix said customers were enticed by new options it has introduced that cost less than a standard subscription.<br/>The company introduced its \"paid sharing\" programme in the UK, US and other major markets in May, charging an extra fee if users want to share passwords with people outside their households.<br/>In the UK, it asks a little less than half of the \u00a310.99 cost of a standard subscription.<br/>The programme is now present in more than 100 countries. <br/>The company also launched a less expensive streaming plan with ads last year and cut prices in dozens of countries in February. <br/>Netflix said few people had cancelled as a result of the password changes and it believed the programme would fuel similar subscriber gains in the months ahead. <br/>It has estimated that more than 100 million households share passwords in breach of its official rules.<br/>\"While we're still in the early stages, we're seeing healthy conversion of borrower households,\" the company said in a quarterly update to investors. \"Now that we've launched paid sharing broadly we have increased confidence in our financial outlook.\"<br/>Paolo Pescatore, analyst at PP Foresight, said the subscriber gains were robust and a \"strong endorsement\" of Netflix's strategy.<br/>But he called the password crackdown a short-term measure, saying the company would need to fine-tune its pricing in the months ahead.<br/>\"The company is still in a far stronger position compared to rivals and remains the benchmark,\" he said, noting that Netflix's streaming plan with advertising is much cheaper than many current offerings from rivals.<br/>Analysts said the company's big library and the scale of its international production may help it in the months ahead, as Hollywood wrestles with the impact of the strikes. <br/>These have already disrupted production schedules for a number of films and series. <br/>\"Of everyone in the entertainment industry, Netflix appears to be the best positioned,\" said Brandon Katz, entertainment industry strategist at Parrot Analytics, which tracks streaming demand, noting that the company still leads its peers, despite strong competition.<br/>Despite the subscriber gains, the $8.18bn (\u00a36.32bn) in revenue Netflix reported disappointed investors, rising just 2.7% from last year. Profits were $1.49bn.  <br/>Netflix said that it has limited its price hikes in recent months, leading to a slowdown in revenue growth that gains from its password crackdown and new advertising were not big enough to offset.  <br/>It said it expected that to change by the end of this year, as advertising revenue increases. <br/>It has stopped offering its least expensive commercial-free plan in the US, UK and Canada in a bid to push price-conscious customers to the ad-funded version. <br/>Membership of its ads plan \"nearly doubled\" from March - though from a \"small base\", the company said.<br/>\"Netflix needs to squeeze as much juice as it can from different avenues, given a recent lack of price increases could suggest that inflation is starting to bite Netflix's ability to crank up its subscription price, as households look to trim their spending,\" said Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.<br/>\"Initial progress seems positive, but we are realms away from knowing for sure if this venture is the cash cow it's been sold as.\"<br/>Shares, which have surged 60% this year amid investor enthusiasm for the company's plans, dipped in after-hours trade. <br/>Ms Lund-Yates said the company had delivered a \"sturdy\" performance and the fall reflected the high expectations for the company.<br/>What happens next as Hollywood grinds to a halt<br/>Hollywood strike could last until end of the year<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Police have also told people to avoid the forest and seek shelter immediately if they see the lioness.<br/>Mr Grubert said authorities were focusing their search on a large area next to a wood where people walk their dogs.

A Mega Millions draw for $720m is due on Friday.<br/>The last time someone won the Powerball jackpot before Wednesday's draw was on 19 April for a top prize of nearly $253m. <br/>Powerball holds the current world record for the largest national lottery jackpot.<br/>A record prize was won in November by California resident Edwin Castro, who was the sole winner of the $2.05bn prize, according to the Guinness World Records.

When Ms Keshavarz protested, she was told it was necessary to counter future claims of torture.<br/>\"Who would see these videos and pictures? Would the regime use them later to silence us?\" she asked, referring to the risk of being blackmailed even when her sentence was over.<br/>Ms Keshavarz is a women's rights activist who has protested against the mandatory hijab, or headscarf. <br/>Her Instagram account features a series of artistic images of her without a hijab in a variety of public places.<br/>She was accused of \"conspiracy against national security, disrespecting Islam, propaganda against the Islamic Republic of Iran, and promoting corruption and obscenity\" and sentenced to 12 years and seven months in prison.<br/>More recently, she has been sentenced for \"corruption on Earth\" - a crime which carries the death penalty - and now lives in exile, from where she spoke to the BBC.<br/>Women prisoners have told the BBC that it has long been common practice to strip search drug-related detainees in Iran to look for hidden narcotics. But prisoners of conscience had not previously been typically subjected to it, and certainly not in front of the camera.<br/>In early June, Iran's judiciary denied the allegations of filming prisoners, dismissing them as \"hybrid warfare and full-scale Western propaganda against Iran\".<br/>However, in mid-June, the head of the judiciary committee in the Iranian parliament said \"only the female guards watch the footage of female prisoners\" - in doing so acknowledging that women prisoners are filmed.<br/>It is also alleged that the filming happens in areas where there should not be any cameras.<br/>\"According to prison regulations, CCTV is allowed only where prisoners are in motion, like in corridors,\" Mohammad Hossein Aghassi, a practising lawyer in Tehran, told the BBC.<br/>The practice of filming strip searches is not unique to Iran - there have been incidents in other countries such as a well-publicised case in the Australian state of New South Wales. <br/>Documents obtained under a freedom of information request revealed that officers routinely filmed searches while they were being conducted. <br/>What is different - and disturbing - about Iran is that our interviewees and many others allege a systematic, intentional practice designed to humiliate the detainees.<br/>The BBC has obtained confidential documents from a hacking group called Edaalat Ali, dated November 2021, which contain a letter from the Iranian Judiciary acknowledging one such case of strip searching. <br/>The letter specifically mentions Mojgan Kavoosi, a rights activist for the Kurdish ethnic minority, who was subjected to this practice in a prison in the city of Karaj.<br/>A source from within Iran who is familiar with the case told the BBC that Ms Kavoosi was subjected to strip searches on five occasions. <br/>The documents show that after Hrana, a human rights news agency, published a report about her strip search, Iran's prosecutors' office was asked to conduct an investigation into the matter.<br/>Ms Kavoosi is now free on bail.<br/>Elaheh Ejbari, a rights activist for the Baluch ethnic minority, who now lives in exile, told the BBC that officials \"mocked my body during the strip searches both times I was arrested\".<br/>She also showed us a scar on her hand, saying her interrogator had stubbed a cigarette out on her skin.<br/>Ms Ejbari was first arrested in September 2020 in Tehran on charges of \"propaganda against the Islamic Republic of Iran\" and spent six weeks in Evin prison. She was arrested a second time in November 2022 and was kept in an unknown location for three days.<br/>After receiving persistent calls from security forces threatening her arrest, she fled Iran. <br/>Nasibe Shamsaei is another Iranian women's rights activist who says she endured strip searches three times.<br/>She is one of the Girls of Revolution Street, a group who protested against the compulsory hijab in Iran in 2018 by public removing their headscarves. Dozens were arrested at the time.<br/>Accused of a number of crimes including \"propaganda against the Islamic Republic of Iran by removing hijab in public and disrespecting the founder of Islamic Republic of Iran and the Supreme Leader\", Ms Shamsaei was sentenced to 12 years in prison.<br/>She was released after almost three months in Qarchak prison, and now lives in exile.<br/>She recalls that when she complained about being exposed in front of CCTV cameras, a prison guard responded: \"From now on, everything is possible.\" <br/>Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Last month Beijing refused to let Mr Li meet his US counterpart Lloyd Austin at a forum in Singapore, citing the sanctions.<br/>It may be of little surprise that Mr Kissinger decided to take matters into his own hands with his visit.<br/>In an interview in December, Mr Kissinger had criticised the Trump and Biden administrations' approaches to China. He said the current US government was attempting a dialogue that \"usually begins with a statement of Chinese iniquities\" and that discussions were \"stymied\".<br/>While Mr Kissinger is no stranger to China - he has visited it more than 100 times and last met Mr Xi in 2019 - this trip comes at a turning point in the US-China relationship.<br/>After months of hostility exacerbated by this year's spy balloon incident, diplomatic negotiations appear to be back on track with China welcoming a series of top US officials in the space of a few weeks.<br/>Apart from Secretary of State Antony Blinken who visited last month, Mr Kissinger is the only US figure Mr Xi has met in recent weeks - a measure of the respect the veteran diplomat still commands in China.<br/>Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and US special envoy for climate John Kerry have also paid visits to Beijing, but did not get face time with China's president.<br/>With its overtly warm reception of Mr Kissinger, Beijing has clearly signalled it wants more engagement from the US, with Mr Wang saying \"the US' China policy needs Kissinger's diplomatic wisdom and Nixon's political courage\".<br/>But this will not change the fact that China will, in the end, stick to its priorities, said Wen-ti Sung, a political scientist with the Australian National University.<br/>\"Beijing may potentially consider making token gestures of goodwill after Kissinger's trip both as a thankyou to its friend and boost Kissinger's standing,\" he told the BBC.<br/>\"But do not expect it to meaningfully shift the fundamentals driving US-China relations, which will be governed not by individual considerations, but by what Beijing sees as its own national interests.\"<br/>Though Mr Kissinger has a controversial reputation in other parts of Asia for his role in the Vietnam War, in China he remains highly regarded for aiding the country's re-engagement with the world.<br/>In 1971, while the US and China officially had no ties, Mr Kissinger had paid clandestine visits to Beijing to arrange a trip by then-US President Richard Nixon. <br/>The following year Mr Nixon landed on Chinese soil and met top leaders including Mao Zedong.

Critics noted that a white mob lynched a young black man, Henry Choate, from the building in 1927. <br/>But Aldean said on Twitter on Tuesday that the song has nothing to do with race and is instead a celebration of small-town values. <br/>\"In the past 24 hours I have been accused of releasing a pro-lynching song (a song that has been out since May) and was subject to the comparison that I (direct quote) was not too pleased with the nationwide BLM protests,\" he said. <br/>\"These references are not only meritless, but dangerous.\" <br/>The award-winning country music artist was speaking a day after his video was dropped from air by Country Music Television. <br/>\"Try That in a Small Town, for me,\" he tweeted, \"refers to the feeling of a community that I had growing up, where we took care of our neighbors, regardless of differences of background or belief.\" <br/>Critics said the video sends a divisive message. <br/>Following Aldean's post, Sheryl Crow tweeted: \"I'm from a small town.

US authorities have said that he did so \"wilfully, of his own volition\" and expressed concern about his well-being. <br/>Private 2nd Class (PV2) King's mother Claudine Gates told ABC News she could not imagine her son doing such a thing. He \"had to be out of his mind\", she said.<br/>Ms Gates said she had last heard from the US soldier \"a few days ago\", when he told her he would soon be returning to Fort Bliss, his army base in Texas.<br/>PV2 King was reportedly investigated for assault in South Korea in September 2022. According to local media, he was suspected of punching a Korean national in a nightclub in Seoul. <br/>He was fined 5m won (\u00a3,3,000; $3,950) for \"repeatedly kicking\" the back door of a police car and screamed \"foul language\" at the officers trying to apprehend him. <br/>Local reports quoting officials said he was released on 10 July after serving two months in jail on assault charges, but did not elaborate.<br/>After his release, he was placed under military observation for about a week in South Korea. <br/>He was escorted to the airport in Incheon, near Seoul, for a flight back to the United States, where he was to face disciplinary action.<br/>But he did not board the plane. The Korea Times, quoting an airport official, said he arrived at the boarding gate alone as military police officers were not allowed to accompany him all the way to the plane.<br/>At the gate, he reportedly approached an American Airlines official and claimed his passport had gone missing. An airline employee then escorted him out of the departures area.<br/>After parting ways with his escort, he is reported to have left the terminal to embark on a tour of the Demilitarised Zone, or DMZ, between North and South Korea, where foreigners can visit via tour companies.<br/>It is not clear how PV2 King managed to get on one of these tours, as it typically takes between three days and a week for an individual to be authorised, and the trips are usually closely monitored. <br/>An eyewitness on the same border tour described hearing the soldier laughing loudly before making a run across the border. <br/>The United Nations Command, which operates the DMZ, said it believed the soldier was now in custody of the North. A senior US commander said there had been no contact with the soldier and the incident was being investigated by US Forces Korea.<br/>Retired General Robert Abrams, a former commander of United States Forces Korea, told BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight he believed we were \"seeing the opening act\" of a \"tragedy of the utmost proportion\".<br/>\"I've got serious concerns for [PV2 King's] health and welfare...

According to a police complaint, one of the women was gang raped. The complaint added that a third woman was also forced to strip but she is not seen in the video. <br/>The video shows the distraught women being pushed around and groped by their attackers. While the men's faces are visible, only one person has been arrested so far on charges of gang rape.<br/>Manipur, in north-eastern India, has been gripped by ethnic violence between the majority Meitei group and the tribal Kuki minority since May. Reports from the ground detail chilling accounts of shootings, looting and sexual assault.<br/>According to a report in The Print, the sexual violence shown in the video took place after fake news about a Meitei woman's rape and murder was circulated just after the violence began. It \"unleashed a new, deadly cycle of reprisal violence on Kuki tribal women allegedly by Meitei mobs\", says the report.<br/>Rape has long been used as a weapon during conflict. <br/>In most large-scale incidents of violence - the 1947 partition of India, the 1971 Bangladesh independence war, the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, the civil war in Sri Lanka, the 2002 Gujarat riots, to give just a few examples from South Asia - appalling instances of sexual assault and gang rape have been reported, with the scale of the brutality sometimes uncovered only decades later. <br/>Survivor accounts show that the crime is often attributed to revenge against the \"other\" through violating the bodies of women - seen as a site of honour for their communities.<br/>The state's mechanisms to end the conflict - such as the army and other security forces - have also been accused of brutal sexual violence in places such as Indian-administered Kashmir and the north-eastern states.<br/>\"The price that women pay for this violence done on their bodies is often hidden and very private. The women's movement has been bringing attention to this for decades, yet it continues,\" says Anuradha Chenoy, former professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi.<br/>What makes matters worse is state apathy. <br/>The assault in Manipur occurred on 4 May. According to the police complaint filed by a relative of one of the women, it took place when two men and three women from the tribal Kuki community were fleeing towards a forest to escape violence in Kangpokpi district.  <br/>The complaint alleges that they were rescued by a police team who were then ambushed by a mob who \"snatched\" the villagers. <br/>According to the complaint, the mob killed the two men and forced the women to remove their clothes.<br/>One of the women, a 21-year-old, was \"brutally gang-raped in broad daylight\", the complaint says, adding that the other two managed to escape. <br/>Vikram Singh, a former police chief in Uttar Pradesh state, says that the \"shameful\" incident raises grave questions about the police and administration.<br/>\"No administration in a country like India is so helpless that it cannot do anything when women are treated like this,\" he says, adding that apart from the perpetrators, the police officials in question should also be punished.<br/>Yet, the first arrest in the case was only made on Thursday morning, hours after the video was shared widely on Twitter and the Supreme Court said it was \"deeply disturbed\". <br/>Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has often spoken about empowering women and educating girls, had not publicly commented on the crisis in Manipur despite repeated calls from citizens and opposition leaders. He finally broke his silence a few hours ago, saying his heart was \"full of pain and anger\" and that the guilty would be punished.<br/>But the question remains - why did it take so long, especially when the faces of the perpetrators were clearly visible in the viral video?<br/>\"Ensuring access to justice is the state's responsibility. But in most cases, the state and administration are totally missing in the fight for justice,\" says Vrinda Grover, an advocate who has represented several victims of sexual violence.<br/>She adds that if it takes the Supreme Court's intervention for even one arrest to be \"miraculously\" made, it does not give any hope to victims of violence.<br/>Khushbu Sundar, a member of Mr Modi's party - the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which also governs Manipur - said the video was \"horrific\" and \"unacceptable\".<br/>\"This is a complete failure of law and order,\" she said, adding, however, that this was \"not the time for accusations\" and that all political parties needed to keep aside their differences and \"stand together against the violence in Manipur\".<br/>Lawyer Warisha Farasat, who researched the 1989 Bhagalpur riots in Bihar state in which more than 1,000 people were killed, said that two commissions set up by the government to investigate the violence did not mention sexual assault or rape at all in their reports.<br/>\"I did my research 21 years after the incident and people were still reluctant to talk about it. The only cases where families spoke about sexual violence were those where the victim had died in the assault, perhaps because there was no rape-related social stigma involved,\" she says.<br/>In India, sexual violence often goes unreported as traumatised victims fear being cast out by their families and ostracised by society.<br/>Ms Farasat says that victims of sexual violence in conflict zones are also facing overlapping traumas - from loss of livelihood to deaths of family members - which can make them minimise their experiences. <br/>She adds, however, that the reluctance does not always stem from shame. <br/>\"The problem is, when women come out to speak, they don't get justice. That's what needs to change,\" Ms Farasat adds.<br/>While there are sporadic instances of legal justice, it often takes years and a lot of strength from the victims, who are already economically marginalised and may have been forced to move away from their homes due to fear and shame.<br/>Earlier this year, two Hindu men were sentenced to 20 years in jail for gang-raping a Muslim woman in 2013 during communal riots in Uttar Pradesh. The verdict was a landmark one but Ms Grover, who represented the complainant, points out that seven women had initially approached the court alleging sexual violence.<br/>\"Finally, only one woman stood and testified against her attackers,\" she says.<br/>Another example, Ms Farasat says, is Bilkis Bano, who was gang-raped and saw 14 members of her family being murdered by a Hindu mob during the 2002 anti-Muslim riots in Gujarat state. But the 11 convicts in the case were granted an early release from jail last year by the state's BJP government - when the men walked free on India's independence day, relatives celebrated by giving them sweets and touching their feet. Reports said the men were also garlanded by activists of a hardline Hindu organisation. <br/>\"In Bilkis's case, the wheels of justice did turn in her favour but we've come full circle and now the convicts are out again. Yet, even for that limited justice, Bilkis is an exception because she was one of the very few victims who was able to fight her case. Hers is a landmark case because she was the exception to the rule,\" she says.<br/>The state often offers compensation to victims but what they need is reparations, Ms Grover says.<br/>\"That includes rehabilitation, the guarantee of non-recurrence of the attack and social and economic restitution,\" she says.<br/>What needs to end, adds Ms Farasat, is the culture of impunity that gets strengthened with each successive incident.<br/>\"It's not just mobs, but also authorities such as police officers and politicians - everyone needs to be held accountable.\"<br/>BBC News India is now on YouTube.

Mr Tan is married, while Ms Cheng is single.  <br/>More questions on transparency arose last week, when Singapore's anti-corruption watchdog arrested Transport Minister S Iswaran and billionaire hotelier Ong Beng Seng. The two men played key roles in bringing the Grand Prix to Singapore in 2008.<br/>Singaporeans were told last Wednesday that Mr Iswaran had been asked to take leave from his ministerial duties amid a probe. <br/>Deputy prime minister Lawrence Wong has told local media the corruption probe would be \"full, thorough and independent\", and that nothing will be swept under the carpet.<br/>But authorities only announced the arrests three days after they actually took place. Both men have not been charged and are currently out on bail. <br/>The arrests came on the heels of allegations that two other senior ministers had rented colonial-era bungalows in a high-end neighbourhood at below-market rates. <br/>While an anti-graft review cleared the two men, K Shanmugam and Vivian Balakrishnan, of wrongdoing, the matter sparked a heated debate on inequality in Singapore and political optics.<br/>The unusual series of events has bought out the inevitable memes. \"The writers of this season of Singapore have really outdone themselves,\" wrote the creators behind Instagram page yeolo.sg on Monday.<br/>A separate post, featuring actresses on the set of the Barbie movie crowding around a laptop, read: \"When me and the girlies are suddenly interested in sg politics.\"<br/>Another Instagram user wryly compared the current political situation to spilling tea, or sharing gossip. <br/>But beyond the jokes lie serious questions about the future of the PAP and how long it can hold on to Singaporeans' trust.<br/>It has weathered similar scandals in the recent past - in the last decade a previous parliamentary Speaker and a backbencher stepped down because of extramarital affairs. But the close timing of the scandals and corruption probe has heightened voters' scrutiny.<br/>The PAP has long prided itself on demanding high moral standards of its lawmakers, and its ability to keep its house in order. One of its founding members once compared joining the PAP to joining the priesthood.<br/>Mr Lee this week defended his party's handling of the recent scandals, saying it demonstrated \"how the system has to function\".<br/>\"Sometimes things cluster up, but we make sure we put them right,\" he said, adding that \"high standards of propriety and personal conduct\u2026 are the fundamental reasons Singaporeans trust and respect the PAP\".<br/>But other observers contend these controversies call into question Singapore's - and in particular, the PAP's -  claims to exceptional governance. <br/>\"I think the biggest questions surround restraints on authority, oversight, transparency, the impartiality of parliamentary process as well as the PAP's claim that it is a sufficient check on itself,\" said Singapore-based political scientist Ian Chong.<br/>He noted that the PAP has rejected political practices common in other developed jurisdictions, such as public disclosure of income and assets by political office holders, senior civil servants and their immediate family members.<br/>There are no robust mechanisms for holding powerful people to account, added Michael Barr, an Australia-based international relations professor who has written several books on Singapore politics.<br/>\"You just have to trust them. That is why this is such a dangerous and novel set of developments for the government. They are trashing their repositories of public trust,\" he said. <br/>Singapore is ranked the fifth-least corrupt country in Transparency International's latest Corruption Perceptions Index. Over the years, the government has justified seven-figure ministerial pay checks as a way to repress corrupt activity. <br/>But Dr Barr pointed out: \"Without extraordinary levels of public trust, the government must rely on one of two things to win elections: either repression and other measures that subvert democracy, or a high level of performance-based legitimacy. Their record in recent years is such that we can forget about performance legitimacy.\"<br/>The recent events also cast doubt on when Mr Lee would step down. <br/>The 71-year old, who has been prime minister since 2004, has often spoken of his wish to retire. A successor has already been designated: Lawrence Wong, who is also finance minister.<br/>But on Monday, Mr Lee said he has no plans to call for an immediate general election. The next polls are due by November 2025.<br/>The fact that Mr Wong has not been more active and visible in addressing the recent scandals also raises questions about him and his peers' readiness to take over as the city-state's leaders, noted Dr Chong.<br/>Singapore speaker in sex scandal<br/>Singapore ministers face pay cuts<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

It is unclear how Reid came into possession of the firearm as he did not own a license.<br/>He had moved through a construction site floor-by-floor in downtown Auckland while firing his weapon, <br/>Two people were killed, while injuries sustained by 10 other victims ranged from moderate to serious.<br/>Upon reaching the upper levels of the building, Reid barricaded himself in an elevator and shot at police officers, authorities said. The gunman was later found dead, but it is unclear if he died from the exchange of fire or if he had shot himself. <br/>Prime Minister Chris Hipkins said that while the incident was shocking, there was no wider security risk, and that the shooter did not appear to be ideologically or politically motivated.<br/>Police Commissioner Andrew Coster added that the shooter had been put on home detention for domestic violence, but had approval to travel to the building site where he had previously worked. <br/>He noted that the gunman had indications of a mental health history, but that there was no evidence that he was of \"high lethal risk\" to the public. <br/>Social media was awash with tributes to the victims, but some are also questioning if there is a bigger problem facing the country and its capital city.<br/>The question being asked by many is: \"How on earth did he get access to a firearm. He clearly didn't have a license.\"   <br/>\"NZ has sure gone downhill the past few years. Too much crime these days for such a small country,\" a top-liked comment on Facebook reads.<br/>With a general election just months away, political parties have been campaigning to get tough on crime, according to Hannah Short, a civil litigator in Auckland. <br/>She told the BBC that while gun violence in New Zealand is still relatively rare, the country has experienced a fairly significant increase in crime recently, with gang membership going up in recent years.<br/>\"The public definitely see this as another example of crime increasing. People don't feel safe in downtown Auckland at night anymore,\" she said. \"The city is generally a lot less safe now post-Covid, as a lot more work from home full time,\" she added. <br/>The incident comes as many football teams gather in New Zealand for the opening ceremony of the FIFA Women's World Cup on Thursday evening, which will go ahead as planned. <br/>Christchurch gunman 'planned third mosque attack'<br/>Christchurch victims confront gunman who killed 51<br/>Christchurch mass killer appeals against conviction<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

The result, many believe, will decide whether the relationship between Catalonia and Madrid improves or flares up once again.<br/>\"If the right wins, the situation could complicate in Catalonia,\" said Lola Garc\u00eda, a journalist at La Vanguardia newspaper who wrote an account of the 2017 crisis. <br/>\"We might well go back to seeing heightened tensions there.\"<br/>Socialist Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez declared improving the febrile atmosphere in Catalonia a priority when he first took office in 2018, and again when he formed a new coalition government in 2020.<br/>With that aim in mind, his administration pardoned nine politicians who had been jailed for their role in the 2017 independence bid. <br/>It also reformed the penal code, eliminating the crime of sedition and modifying the crime of misuse of public funds - both of which changes benefitted Catalan leaders who were facing legal action. <br/>Meanwhile, Mr S\u00e1nchez's government has also engaged in slow-moving talks with the pro-independence Catalan administration aimed at resolving the territorial problem.<br/>\"Today the situation in Catalonia is nothing like it was in 2017, 2018 or 2019,\" Mr S\u00e1nchez said recently, describing the Socialists as \"a party that defends the union of Spain\".<br/>However, reducing the tensions in Catalonia has come at a cost for Mr S\u00e1nchez.<br/>The conservative People's Party (PP) and far-right Vox have repeatedly attacked him for making concessions to nationalists and for receiving the parliamentary support of the pro-independence Catalan Republican Left (ERC).<br/>His reliance on the parliamentary votes of the Basque nationalists of EH Bildu - the successor to the political wing of the defunct Basque group Eta, which is deemed a terrorist organisation by the EU - has compounded that opprobrium, with some in his own party also expressing unease.<br/>Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o, the PP's candidate for prime minister, warned that Mr S\u00e1nchez has \"made Spain a hostage of those who want to break the territorial unity of our country\", a message many voters seem to endorse.<br/>The conservative leader has also tacitly criticised Mariano Rajoy, the PP's prime minister during the 2017 Catalan crisis.<br/>\"We probably should have acted earlier and not let things go as far as they did,\" Mr N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o said, suggesting he would be more proactive than his predecessor. <br/>A Spanish government that is hostile to regional identities could have an upside for the independence movement, reviving it after several years of in-fighting, according to journalist Lola Garc\u00eda. <br/>She also believes plans by the Catalan government, led by the moderate ERC, to stage a Madrid-approved referendum on independence in the coming legislature are likely to go nowhere.<br/>\"The Catalan government is aware that it will not achieve [a negotiated referendum] either with the PP in government or the Socialists,\" she said. Instead, she believes the regional administration is pushing for increased powers within its current arrangement as an autonomous region.   <br/>With the PP ahead of the Socialists according to most polls, but looking unlikely to secure an absolute majority, it is quite possible that Spain's next government will be formed by the conservatives in a coalition with the hardline unionists of Vox.<br/>\"We already know that a PP-Vox government would mean a threat to political freedoms and rights and democratic institutions here in Catalonia,\" said Meritxell Serret, minister of Foreign Action and the EU for the Catalan government.<br/>She pointed to areas of Spain where the two right-wing parties have already formed governing partnerships since local elections in May, such as the Valencia region and the Balearic Islands.<br/>In both cases, the new local government has announced plans to eliminate the office for defence of local languages, which opponents see as an attempt to eliminate regional identities.<br/>While Ms Serret says the Catalan government is not satisfied with the concessions made by the S\u00e1nchez administration, she frames the possibility of Vox entering a right-wing coalition in dramatic terms.<br/>\"Vox have been threatening they will illegalise pro-independence parties, for example,\" she said. <br/>\"We fear, and people fear, that they can represent a step back for our democracy to very dark moments when civil rights [and] freedoms were not only attacked, but were annulled.

I realised the danger of what I had done,\" he tells the BBC at his studio in the coastal city of Sfax.<br/>El General was fast becoming famous but with his baseball cap pulled down low of his forehead, few knew his real identity. However, with chanting protestors bellowing his song throughout the country, El General's cover was eventually blown and he was arrested. <br/>\"I thought this is the end, you know, because at that time if you went into the Ministry of Interior you wouldn't come out again.\"<br/>Thankfully and perhaps surprisingly, El General was freed after a few days. By this point his song was not only a revolutionary anthem in Tunisia but had become a rallying cry for pro-democracy protesters across the Middle East, from the streets of Egypt to the souks of Bahrain. <br/>El General's face adorned the front page of Time magazine, which listed him among the 100 most influential people in the world.<br/>By mid-January 2011, Ben Ali had fled the country. El General and all those who took to the streets in what became known as the Jasmin Revolution had won.<br/>Unfortunately, democracy was to prove a big disappointment to many in Tunisia. Although it survived there, unlike in other countries that rose up during the Arab Spring, successive governments did little to improve the lot of most Tunisians. <br/>Most politicians came to be viewed as more interested in pointless squabbling and their own self-importance than rescuing a nosediving economy. Democracy was soon seen by many as synonymous with anarchy, political inertia and the collapse of law and order.<br/>All of which led to the landslide victory of Kais Saied in the 2019 presidential election. The balding former law professor promised to rescue the country from political and economic chaos. What followed is described by his critics as akin to a coup.<br/>After suspending parliament in July 2021, the populist president went on to give himself the powers to rule by decree. Soon after that he scrapped parliament, which has since been replaced by a feebler version, largely stripped of powers to oppose the president. <br/>Mr Saied went on to dissolve the High Judicial Council, which guarded the independence of the courts, before sacking more than 50 judges. <br/>Last year Mr Saied rewrote the constitution after winning a referendum, which had been boycotted by most opposition groups, amassing even more power for himself. Next came the arrest of dozens of those who have opposed him, from politicians, lawyers and journalists to academics and activists. <br/>To El General, the clock appears to be turning right back to the days of fear and repression.<br/>\"We are more under control than ever. We don't know if we're living in the present or back in 2010. I'm one of many who feel our country is in danger. We are still in shock. We didn't expect this level of repression.\"<br/>While Mr Saied has been largely effective in supressing dissent, he has had much less success in keeping prices down. <br/>Inflation is pushing many foods beyond the price of even middle-class Tunisians and there are severe shortages of staples like rice, sugar and oil. All of which, one market vendor lamented, is forcing some people to sift through roadside rubbish for food.<br/>Nowhere is the rise in poverty more evident than in the struggling suburb of Ettadhamen in the capital, Tunis, where youth unemployment is particularly rife. <br/>With drug abuse soaring, a gym owner there, who preferred not to be identified, has begun offering kick-boxing classes. He hopes this will give young people some pride and an interest in something other than narcotics.<br/>One young man, sweating heavily from a vigorous work-out, explained that he aimed to get to the top of the sport, so that he could compete in kick-boxing competitions in Europe. The idea being to jump ship as soon as he got there.<br/>\"If I get the chance to go abroad and box, the first thing I'll do is think of a way to stay there. I can't lie, if I find a way to do this I won't come back.\"<br/>Sadly for him, the gym owner later revealed that the sport's authorities have got wise to wise to such schemes. <br/>He said they were now taking the passports of Tunisians competing overseas and escorting them to and from competitions. <br/>Thousands of other desperate Tunisians are joining soaring numbers of migrants from sub-Saharan Africa in trying to reach Europe in small makeshift boats. <br/>Sadly many don't make it. Since 2014 nearly 28,000 people have died attempting to cross the Mediterranean illegally.<br/>Many do survive the extremely dangerous journey. So far this year more than 60,000 migrants have arrived in Italy, double the number for the same period in 2022. <br/>As the numbers grow, so does the EU's determination to stop them coming. This is proving quite an earner for the Tunisian leader.<br/>Despite saying earlier this year that he was not willing to act as Europe's border guard, earlier this week Mr Saied accepted about $118m (\u00a390m) from the European Union (EU) to help combat Tunisia's people-trafficking trade. <br/>A further $1bn is being offered by the EU for investment in Tunisia. This, though, is dependent on Mr Saied agreeing to the terms of a $2bn bail-out package from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). So far he has refused to do that. <br/>The IMF deal requires him to cut costly subsidies and slim down the bloated government workforce, which Mr Saied knows will be highly unpopular and could even lead to another uprising, this time against him. <br/>For the time being at least Mr Saied remains surprisingly popular, though there are growing numbers of people who are deeply worried about the direction he is taking the country. From incendiary speeches about migrants and the jailing of his political opponents, to his deliberate enfeebling of parliament and the judiciary.<br/>One such person is El General, though times have changed. Since the huge success of his uprising anthem, he has got married and settled down to raise his family. <br/>The former firebrand now lives in a large imposing house in one of Sfax's upmarket suburbs. <br/>Having watched his country fall victim to growing repression all over again, El General says he felt compelled to return to song-writing. <br/>His insists the lyrics of his latest release include criticism of Mr Saied, though this time it is certainly no revolution rap.<br/>It seems El General is content to leave this fight to a new generation of rappers, who perhaps have a little less to lose.<br/>\"El General will always be El General, but maybe there is someone who would now be more revolutionary than me. Like in football, for example, we say Lionel Messi is the best of the best, and maybe in a few years there will be someone playing football better than him.\"<br/>You can listen to Mike Thomson's report on the BBC World Service's Assignment programme<br/>How African migrants survived racist attacks in Tunisia<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>What has happened to democracy in Tunisia?<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Total panic.<br/>\"It's hard not to believe that you're a criminal, that you're deserving of this,\" the Australian climate activist says.<br/>Last month, the 25-year-old had her home in Western Australia raided by counter-terrorism police. <br/>Her alleged crime - helping to flood a global fossil fuel giant's office with non-toxic gas.<br/>Stench gas, which smells like rotten eggs, is let off in mines to alert workers of danger. In this case, it was used by protesters to empty the Perth headquarters of Woodside Energy, to highlight the climate crisis.  <br/>Australia's largest oil and gas firm says the protests targeting its brand are \"unlawful\" activities by \"extreme groups\".<br/>But environmental campaigners say disruptive protest is key to their mission. <br/>Meanwhile, lawyers warn that the response to climate activism in Australia has become \"increasingly militarised\".<br/>Ms Sangalli says officers from Western Australia's State Security Investigation Group (SSIG) - whose duties include counter-terrorism - searched her home for hours, looking for evidence of her involvement in the Woodside protest. <br/>Despite facing no formal charges and not being present at the gas evacuation, she was forced to watch as her personal items were seized - including phones and laptops - and a male officer flicked through her diary. <br/>\"That was the most painful part,\" she told the BBC. <br/>\"Violated is a good word for it. You're rendered powerless.\" <br/>The activist has been involved with two climate protest groups - the global Extinction Rebellion, and the more local Disrupt Burrup Hub, which campaigns against fossil fuel projects on the state's Burrup Peninsula. <br/>Both groups follow a \"direct action\" strategy intended to end climate complacency, which means engaging in activities such as infiltrating fossil fuel conferences, blocking rush hour traffic, and superficially defacing artworks. <br/>Several members of the group are now facing criminal charges over the Woodside protest, with the company alleging four of its employees suffered dizziness, breathing difficulties, rashes, and nausea. <br/>\"Woodside condemns unlawful acts that are intended to threaten, harm, intimidate or disrupt our employees,\" the company said. <br/>But Disrupt Burrup maintains their protest stunt was carried out safely and was a necessary action against one of Australia's most powerful polluters.<br/>Its members are challenging the charges in court.<br/>Western Australia is a resource-rich state built on mining revenue, particularly iron ore, oil and gas.<br/>Its industry is concentrated in the Pilbara, a desert area in the state's far north. With an annual output of more than A$100bn (\u00a352bn; $67bn), it powers the national economy and is home to global mining giants, including Rio Tinto and BHP.  <br/>Some of Australia's most polluting projects are based there, including Woodside's North West Shelf gas facility and its Scarborough development - a controversial offshore drilling venture which scientists say will jeopardise the nation's climate targets. <br/>Both projects have sparked fierce debate and renewed accusations that the gas lobby has an outsized influence over state authorities. <br/>Access to ministers, timing of political donations and movement of mining executives into watchdogs, have all been cited as examples - including three former Woodside employees who chaired the advisory board of Australia's offshore oil and gas regulator. <br/>Gerard Mazza has led protests against Woodside's Pilbara projects, due to their emissions and damage to local ancient Aboriginal rock art. <br/>The 31-year-old's home was recently raided by SSIG police for his alleged role in attempting to evacuate Woodside's annual investors meeting in April, also using stench-gas.  <br/>He now faces charges of aggravated burglary, which carry a maximum 20-year sentence. <br/>Mr Mazza argues Western Australia is a \"petrostate\" designed to \"protect fossil fuel companies\" due to the money they bring in. <br/>\"If it was really all about public safety, the state would be cracking down on Woodside executives making obscene wealth by endangering lives and ecosystems. Instead, they're coming after us.\"<br/>The state government has routinely dismissed such claims, denying any influence. In response to the BBC's questions, it said it is \"committed to achieving net zero emissions by 2050\".<br/>But Western Australia's emissions continue to rise, while other states have recorded significant reductions over the past decade.<br/>A dozen raids - including those on Mr Mazza and Ms Sangalli's homes - have been carried out by the state's counter-terrorism police against climate protesters this year. <br/>The SSIG collaborates with federal intelligence agencies on matters of national security and is exempt from Freedom of Information laws, meaning its investigations remain secret. <br/>Lawyers such as Julia Grix says politicians and prosecutors are framing climate protesters as a threat to public safety to justify heavy-handed policing. <br/>The solicitor - who defends environmental activists - says her clients are increasingly being referred to as \"extremists\" in court documents. <br/>\"That sort of language is most commonly applied to organised crime of a very sophisticated kind, which I would associate with bikie (motorcycle) gangs, or terrorism,\" Ms Grix said. <br/>It's a \"demonisation strategy\" used to justify \"extreme measures never intended for regulating protests\", Australian legal scholar Luke McNamara says. <br/>The right to protest has long been defended by Australia's courts. <br/>In 2017, a landmark High Court case ruled that Tasmania's anti-protest laws were unconstitutional. And in 2020, a Queensland state court overturned suspended prison sentences against two activists who had blocked access to the major Adani coal mine. <br/>David Mejia-Canales, a lawyer at the Human Rights Law Centre, an Australian rights group, says those protections are key to a functioning democracy. <br/>\"Protest takes many forms, sometimes disruptive. But that's why it's effective, because it disrupts the everyday to demand attention for a cause,\" he said.<br/>\"As citizens of a democratic society, we should exercise a level of tolerance for disruption if the right to protest is going to have its full value.\"<br/>But Western Australia's emergency services minister, Stephen Dawson, recently argued in parliament that the evacuation of Woodside's offices could be viewed as \"an act of terrorism\" because \"people's health was put at risk by the material released\".<br/>And some of Australia's most prominent leaders - including former Prime Minister Scott Morrison - have called for demonstrations which obstruct critical infrastructure to be \"outlawed\". <br/>\"The right to protest does not mean there is an unlimited licence to disrupt people's lives,\" he said in 2019, labelling environmental campaigners \"anarchists\". <br/>The court cases under way in Western Australia are not taking place in isolation. <br/>They are part of a broader national crackdown which has seen Australian states criminalise disruptive protests through new laws, increased jail terms and penalties. This has sparked public outcry. <br/>In May, after several Extinction Rebellion protests, the South Australia government introduced a A$50,000 maximum fine and three months jail for anyone \"recklessly\" obstructing public spaces, while laws passed in New South Wales last year created a two-year maximum prison sentence for acts disrupting major roads or facilities. <br/>England, Wales and parts of Canada and the US have also adopted similar laws aimed at blocking disruptive climate activism. <br/>In Western Australia, climate protesters say they have been \"disabled\" by intimidating raids, strict bail conditions and orders which give authorities access to their devices and ban them from communicating with peers.<br/>According to Ms Grix, these tools were originally intended to deal with gangs and drug dealers.<br/>\"To apply [that]... to climate defenders, who are protesting about environmental concerns, seems to be a massive overreach,\" she says.<br/>Prof McNamara agrees. <br/>\"What we see in these situations is the police reaching for whatever is at their disposal,\" he told the BBC. <br/>\"Counterterrorism policing units and associated powers were never intended to be used against protesters.\"<br/>In the coming days, several court hearings will determine whether Mr Mazza and some of his peers could face prison. <br/>But the 31-year-old says that while \"climate and culture\" remain under threat, he will \"not be deterred\" from protesting.<br/>Climate activist's jailing ignites row in Australia<br/>How Australia is becoming more unliveable<br/>Is climate change killing Australian wine?<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

These are among the new finds being turned up at the Pompeii Archaeological Park.<br/>Dig anywhere in the ancient city destroyed by Mount Vesuvius in AD79 and you will unearth a treasure - a snapshot of a lost Roman world.<br/>It's extraordinary to think that one-third of the city buried under pumice and ash has yet to be excavated.<br/>\"Much of that will be for future generations,\" says Alessandro Russo, the co-lead archaeologist on the new dig.<br/>\"We have a problem to conserve what we've already found. Future generations may have new ideas, new techniques.\"<br/>The latest work returns to a sector in the park last explored in the late 19th Century. <br/>Back then, archaeologists had opened up the frontage of houses on Via Di Nola, one of Pompeii's main thoroughfares, but hadn't delved far behind. <br/>They had identified a laundry but that was about it.<br/>Now, the diggers are progressively pulling away the volcanic ash and pea-sized stones, known as lapilli, that smothered Pompeii during the two catastrophic days of the Vesuvian eruption.<br/>The dig site is, in effect, a whole city block. It is known as an insula and is some 3,000 sq m (32,000 sq ft) in size.<br/>BBC News has been given exclusive access to the investigation with Lion TV, which is making a three-part series to be aired early next year on the BBC.<br/>\"Every room in every house has its own micro-story in the grander story of Pompeii. I want to uncover those micro-stories,\" says Gennaro Iovino. <br/>The other co-lead archaeologist wants you to imagine that you are entering a delightful atrium - an entrance hall - with a hole in the roof where lion figureheads direct rainwater down onto a fountain, next to a statue. <br/>The builders were clearly doing some repairs at the time of the eruption because the roof tiles are neatly stacked in two piles. But this is not a magnificent villa, like some of the imposing homes found elsewhere in Pompeii. <br/>This building would have been part-commercial because, on turning right, you are confronted by a giant oven, big enough to be producing 100 loaves a day. <br/>Roughly 50 bakeries have already been found in Pompeii. This, however, can't have been a shop because there is no shop front. <br/>It's more likely to have been a wholesaler, distributing bread across town, perhaps to the many fast-food joints for which Pompeii was so famous.<br/>The discovery of a fresco depicting a piece of round flatbread on a silver tray, accompanied by pomegranate, dates, nuts and arbutus fruits, caused a sensation when it was announced to the world in June. <br/>It's not a pizza, though. Tomatoes and mozzarella, two ingredients in the classic Neapolitan recipe, were not available in Italy in the first century AD. <br/>Perhaps it's a piece of focaccia? The pizza thing started as a bit of a joke, says Gennaro. \"I emailed a picture to my boss, saying 'first the oven, now the pizza'.\" <br/>The world just went crazy after that. A cover will soon be built over the fresco to try to protect it from the elements. <br/>The 20,000 visitors who come to Pompeii every day will demand to see the \"ancestor to the pizza\", as some are now describing the fresco subject. <br/>It's easy to forget that Pompeii was a human tragedy. We have little idea how many died. You have to believe most residents left when they saw the horror unfolding at the top of Vesuvius. <br/>Skeletons have been recovered, perhaps 1,300 to 1,500 in total, and the new dig has its own examples: two women and a child of unknown sex. <br/>Looking at where the victims were found, it's obvious that they were trying to take cover, hoping that by hiding under a staircase, they would be safe. <br/>What they hadn't counted on was the roof collapsing from the weight of all the lapilli and ash. The heavy stonework smashed their bodies. <br/>The drama of those momentous days in October AD79 are also revealed on the other side of the atrium in what was once a bedroom. <br/>The bed itself is a charred mass - caused by a fire. It is barely recognisable apart from its broad outline seared into the walls and floor. <br/>If you look closely at the debris, you can see blackened fragments of the textile bedclothes and even the filling from the mattress. <br/>Archaeologists can tell from the position of these carbonised remains that the fire occurred relatively early in the eruption. They speculate that a lamp might have been knocked over in the panic to get out.<br/>\"It would be interesting to understand who were the people that didn't make it,\" wonders park director Gabriel Zuchtriegel. <br/>\"Were they the poor? More women than men? Or maybe people who had property and tried to stay to protect what they had, while others who had nothing just took off and ran.\"<br/>Towards the back of the area so far excavated there is a wall that encloses three rooms. It's here that the removal of lapilli and ash has exposed more astonishing artwork. <br/>In the middle room, covered by a tarpaulin, is yet another elegant fresco. It shows the episode in the myth of Achilles where the legendary hero soldier - with his unfortunate Achilles heel - tried to hide dressed as a woman to avoid fighting in the Trojan War. <br/>In the third room, I pull back another tarp to reveal a magnificent shrine. Two yellow serpents in relief slither up a burgundy background. \"These are good demons,\" says Alessandro. He points to a fresco further down the wall just above an opening to a box of some kind. <br/>\"This room is actually a kitchen. They would have made offerings here to their gods. Foods like fish or fruits. The snake is a connection between the gods and the humans.\"<br/>As the insula is further revealed, scaffolding is being put up around what remains of the buildings to make protective roofing. In the future, the park hopes to erect a high walkway so tourists can see the new treasures that are emerging.<br/>\"People sometimes ask [us], 'What would you like to find? What are you looking for?'\" explains Gabriel. He says such questions are misleading. <br/>\"What we're really looking for is what we don't know. We're always looking for a surprise. It's all emerging evidence, leading us somewhere, but we don't know where that journey goes.\"<br/>Additional reporting by Rebecca Morelle, Alison Francis and Tony Jolliffe.

The visit, organised by a China-based budget tour operator that specialises in off-the-beaten-track destinations, was a five-day trip to experience North Korea during the New Year's Eve period. His father later told the Washington Post that he was \"curious about their culture\" and \"wanted to meet the people of North Korea\". <br/>About two months after his detention on 2 January, a North Korean court sentenced Otto Warmbier to 15 years' imprisonment with hard labour on charges that he attempted to steal a propaganda poster. <br/>Shortly after the sentencing, Mr Warmbier suffered a neurological injury under unclear circumstances. <br/>He was freed - seriously ill - 17 months after his arrest, and died in a hospital six days after returning to the US in June 2017. <br/>US doctors described Mr Warmbier as being in a state of \"unresponsive wakefulness\", but the Warmbier family said calling this a coma was \"unfair\".<br/>His father said when they saw his son he was \"moving around, and jerking violently, making these howling and inhuman sounds\".<br/>His head was shaved, he was blind and deaf, his arms and legs were \"totally deformed\" and he had a huge scar on his foot, he said. It \"looked like someone had taken a pair of pliers and rearranged his bottom teeth\".<br/>\"Otto was systematically tortured and intentionally injured by Kim and his regime. This was no accident,\" his father said.<br/>A US federal court later found North Korea liable for Otto Warmbier's torture and death. <br/>While North Korea did not formally contest the charges, it has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. <br/>The state-run Korean Central News Agency claimed he was provided medical care \"with all sincerity\" despite having \"no reason to show mercy to such a criminal of the enemy state\". <br/>It also claimed that North Korea was \"the biggest victim\" of the death and subsequent \"smear campaign\" by the US. <br/>In October 2018, North Korea announced that Bruce Byron Lowrance - a 60-year-old from Michigan - had been detained while entering the country illegally from China.  <br/>US authorities later revealed that a man matching his name and description had been detained at the demilitarised zone separating North and South Korea. The man had allegedly told investigators that he believed that his visit would help ease geopolitical tensions between the two countries. <br/>Mr Lowrance was released about a month after being detained, which US officials suggested may have been an effort to improve relations with the US following high-profile talks between Kim Jong Un and then US President Donald Trump. <br/>He has not commented publicly on his detention and subsequent release.<br/>Matthew Miller, a 24-year-old teacher from California, was taken into custody by North Korean authorities and charged with \"hostile\" espionage acts while on an organised tour in April 2014. <br/>North Korean authorities later alleged he admitted to a \"wild ambition\" of exploring the country and investigating conditions there. <br/>He was sentenced to six years' imprisonment with hard labour in September 2014. In interviews before and after his release, he said he spent much of his time digging in fields, moving stones and taking out weeds, but was otherwise largely kept in strict isolation. <br/>Mr Miller was released the following month with another American detainee, Kenneth Bae. <br/>In a later interview with journalist Nate Thayer of the North Korea-focused NK News site, Mr Miller said he went to North Korea with the intention of defecting and getting to \"speak to an ordinary North Korean person about normal things\", regardless of politics. <br/>\"I was trying to stay in the country,\" Mr Miller said. \"They wanted me to leave. The very first night they said, 'We want you to leave on the next flight.' But I refused. I just did not leave.\" <br/>In the interview, Mr Miller said he eventually \"changed his mind\" about seeking asylum and requested help from the US government. <br/>The man released with Mr Miller, Washington state resident Kenneth Bae, was arrested in November 2012.<br/>A Korean-American Evangelical Christian missionary, he had visited the country many times. On this occasion he was stopped and a hard drive with Christian material was discovered.<br/>North Korea levelled an array of charges for what it called Mr Bae's \"hostile acts\" including attempting to establish bases for anti-government activities, smuggling in forbidden literature, and encouraging dissidents. <br/>This video can not be played<br/>Kenneth Bae was convicted by North Korea on charges of planning to overthrow the North Korean government<br/>He was sentenced to 15 years with hard labour, with state media suggesting that he only escaped the death penalty as a result of a \"candid confession\". <br/>During his time in captivity, his family said that his health deteriorated as a result of poor conditions and difficult labour. Part of his captivity was spent in a labour camp for foreigners in which he was the only inmate. <br/>Mr Bae was released and returned to the US along with Mr Miller following a secret visit to Pyongyang by Director of National Intelligence James Clapper. <br/>After his release, Mr Bae wrote a memoir, \"Not Forgotten: The True Story of My Imprisonment in North Korea\" in which he said that he was interrogated from 08:00 in the morning until 22:00 or 23:00 at night every day for the first four weeks of his imprisonment.<br/>His interrogators demanded hundreds of pages of confessions.<br/>He said one interrogator kept telling him: \"No-one remembers you. You have been forgotten by people, your government. You're not going home anytime soon. You'll be here for 15 years. You'll be 60 before you go home\".<br/>In March 2009, North Korea arrested two California-based journalists, Eura Lee and Laura Ling, who were filming a documentary about humanitarian conditions on China's border with North Korea. Two other members of their crew, a US cameraman and a Chinese guide, escaped and were briefly detained by Chinese authorities. <br/> Ms Ling later acknowledged they crossed the border, although she said they spent less than a minute in North Korea before attempting to turn back into China. <br/> Ms Lee and Ms Ling were soon charged with crossing the border illegally and in June 2009 were sentenced to 12 years imprisonment and hard labour. <br/>\"I had tried to prepare myself for a lengthy sentence but nothing could prepare me for the verdict,\" Ms Ling later told National Public Radio. \"I was wondering if those words meant that the window of opportunity had closed and my fate was sealed.\"<br/>In August that year, however, both were released after a previously unannounced visit to Pyongyang by former President Bill Clinton.<br/>While the visit came amid a flurry of back channel negotiations between North Korea's government and the Obama administration, the White House said that Mr Clinton's visit was a \"solely private mission\". <br/>\"No money was exchanged and no diplomacy was conducted,\" Ms Ling told NPR. \"It truly was a private humanitarian mission\". <br/>US soldier held by N Korea after crossing border<br/>North Koreans tell of neighbours starving to death<br/>N Korea fires long-range missile after threatening US<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

But the CMA found examples of retailers using grams and millilitres.<br/>The watchdog discovered a lack of transparency with missing or incorrectly calculated unit pricing information both in store and online. Examples include a 250ml bottle of handwash that was sold for \u00a31.19 but was mistakenly priced at \u00a3476.00 per 100ml.<br/>It also raised concerns about unit pricing information being too small to read and some retailers not displaying unit prices for any products on promotion.It added that some of the problems \"stem from the unit pricing rules themselves\", which fall under the Price Marking Order, saying the rules allowed \"unhelpful inconsistencies in retailers' practices and leave too much scope for interpretation\".<br/>Sue Davies, head of food policy at the consumer group Which?, said supermarkets must \"urgently act\" on the areas highlighted by the CMA.<br/>\"This includes the need to put unit pricing on promotions, such as on loyalty card offers and multi-buys, and make unit pricing clearer and more consistent,\" she said.<br/>She added that the the government must \"act swiftly on its promise to update pricing rules and close the loopholes that are allowing supermarkets to unnecessarily confuse shoppers\".<br/>While food price inflation remains at historically high levels - 17.3% in June - the watchdog said evidence it had collected indicated that competition issues had not been driving this.<br/>Ms Cardell told the BBC the CMA had found no evidence of profiteering on groceries, but said it was important to keep the market \"under review\" as the sector seeks to rebuild profits.<br/>It found that operating profits in the grocery sector fell by 41.5% in 2022-23, compared with the previous year, while average operating margins fell from 3.2% to 1.8%. <br/>This was due to retailers' costs increasing faster than their revenues, indicating that rising costs have not been passed on in full to consumers, the CMA said.<br/>It pointed to evidence that budget supermarkets Aldi and Lidl had gained market share, suggesting that supermarkets were \"restricted in their ability to raise prices without losing business\".<br/>However, it said that not everyone was able to benefit fully from strong competition, \"particularly those who cannot travel to large stores or shop online, and therefore may rely on higher-priced convenience stores\".<br/>The CMA said so far it had looked at competition overall between retailers but had not yet looked at individual product categories or across the wider grocery supply chain.<br/>It said it would now further analyse 10 product categories: baby formula, milk, bread, pet food, poultry, mayonnaise, baked beans, chilled desserts, ready meals, and lemonade. <br/>It added it did not have any provisional concerns that competition for these products was ineffective.<br/>Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, which represents supermarkets and other retailers, said: \"Supermarkets have been working hard to support their customers through the cost of living crisis and will be reflecting on the CMA's recommendations on unit pricing. <br/>\"The CMA itself notes that 'many of these problems stem from the rules themselves', and retailers stand ready to support proposed changes to the unit pricing rules.\"<br/>The government said it welcomed the findings into competition and unit pricing, and said it would launch a consultation in the autumn on the Price Marking Order \"to make it work for consumers\".<br/>Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said: \"It's reassuring that competition between supermarkets is working, but the CMA has my backing to look further into price rises for 10 everyday essentials.\"<br/>Read more tips here<br/>Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>Sainsbury\u2019s boss denies profiting from high prices<br/>How a big yellow label influences what we buy<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

He has also made lots of controversial comments, and when you have a bit of loose cannon like that, they could bring you into disrepute, even though it's not intentional.<br/>\"That risk has to be very closely managed because it might come with a financial cost. If the returns on the account do not justify the costs, then the bank will see no point in carrying on the relationship.\" <br/>The report stated that Coutts had been happy to carry on banking Mr Farage while he had a mortgage with them, but once he had paid it off they planned to terminate the relationship.<br/>However, Angela Knight, former chief executive of the British Bankers' Association, told the BBC's Today programme she found what had happened to the firmer United Kingdom Independence Party leader \"somewhat uncomfortable\".<br/>\"It is somewhat uncomfortable to see a situation arise where because of somebody's legitimate views, even though you don't agree with them, it somehow has resulted in a service being withdrawn and they are not being told about it.\"<br/>She added: \"In this instance what seems to have happened is nothing was really said to the individual concerned and then when they put in an application [to the bank to see the evidence] they suddenly find that there's a whole series of reasons which seems to centre around what they have said.\" <br/>On Thursday Mr Farage welcomed reports of a government crackdown, saying closing bank accounts for political reasons could stop people from going into public life.<br/>\"Refusal to open [accounts] and closures have happened to several members of my family... Which is perhaps, above all, what has made me angry, really angry and motivated me to [speak out].\"<br/>On Wednesdday Prime Minister Rishi Sunak tweeted that shutting someone's account over their views was \"wrong\", calling free speech the \"cornerstone of our democracy\". <br/>Meanwhile, Home Secretary Suella Braverman said elsewhere that the Coutts row \"exposes the sinister nature of much of the diversity, equity and inclusion industry\".<br/>The BBC had previously reported Mr Farage had fallen below the financial threshold needed for an account at Coutts, citing a source familiar with the move.<br/>The former politician accused the broadcaster of falling for \"spin\" and restated that he had been targeted for his political views.<br/>He cited the report by the bank's reputational risk committee which states that the Brexiteer's views did not \"align with our values\".<br/>\"Apparently, I'm a risk to them. I have virtually no links of any kind to Russia whatsoever. This is political. There is no other way of looking at it,\" he said.<br/>He later told BBC Newsnight he was \"literally shocked\" when he saw the report, which he described as a \"personal hit job\". \"This bank is behaving now like a political campaigning organisation,\" he said.<br/>Coutts has said it has offered Mr Farage an alternative account at its sister bank, NatWest and the offer still stands. <br/>Anyone concerned that they have not been treated fairly by their bank can appeal to the Financial Ombudsman Service.<br/>City regulator the Financial Conduct Authority is also talking to NatWest about the handling of Mr Farage's accounts, its boss told MPs on Wednesday.<br/>Nikhil Rathi said that current rules made clear banks should not discriminate on the basis of political views.<br/>Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>Farage launches fresh attack over Coutts bank closure<br/>Farage: Coutts file 'shows account shut over my views'<br/>Bank account closures probe 'must be fast tracked'<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Without the drop in inflation seen in June, that figure would have been much higher, around 6%.<br/>Although average rates ticked lower, some mortgage lenders have continued to raise costs for borrowers.<br/>Hannah Bashford, mortgage broker and director of Model Financial Solutions, said she did not think there will would be a meaningful drop in mortgage rates until later in the year.<br/>She added \"A rate drop will be largely dependent on whether energy prices don't push up inflation again in the autumn.\"<br/>Last month, a series of measures were agreed with mortgage lenders aimed at supporting people who are struggling with their repayments.<br/>In June, banks met the Chancellor and agreed there will be a minimum 12-month period before a home is repossessed.<br/>Borrowers will also be able to make a temporary change to their mortgage terms, for example by switching to an interest-only deal, then will be able to return to their original deal within six months without impacting their credit scores.<br/>Why is UK inflation so high?<br/>What do I do if I can't afford to pay my debts?<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

He said the company was committed to reaching an \"equitable\" agreement that helped the industry move into the future. <br/>But he added: \"We've got a lot of work to do.\"<br/>Netflix has been wrestling with a sharp slowdown in growth since the pandemic, as competition heats up, households grapple with rising costs and it reaches what analysts see as saturation point in some of its biggest markets.<br/>In the first half of last year, it shed roughly 1 million accounts. Though it later more than made up those losses, the declines jolted the company and sent it scrambling to shore up its growth prospects. <br/>Netflix said customers were enticed by new options it has introduced that cost less than a standard subscription.<br/>The company introduced its \"paid sharing\" programme in the UK, US and other major markets in May, charging an extra fee if users want to share passwords with people outside their households.<br/>In the UK, it asks a little less than half of the \u00a310.99 cost of a standard subscription.<br/>The programme is now present in more than 100 countries. <br/>The company also launched a less expensive streaming plan with ads last year and cut prices in dozens of countries in February. <br/>Netflix said few people had cancelled as a result of the password changes and it believed the programme would fuel similar subscriber gains in the months ahead. <br/>It has estimated that more than 100 million households share passwords in breach of its official rules.<br/>\"While we're still in the early stages, we're seeing healthy conversion of borrower households,\" the company said in a quarterly update to investors. \"Now that we've launched paid sharing broadly we have increased confidence in our financial outlook.\"<br/>Paolo Pescatore, analyst at PP Foresight, said the subscriber gains were robust and a \"strong endorsement\" of Netflix's strategy.<br/>But he called the password crackdown a short-term measure, saying the company would need to fine-tune its pricing in the months ahead.<br/>\"The company is still in a far stronger position compared to rivals and remains the benchmark,\" he said, noting that Netflix's streaming plan with advertising is much cheaper than many current offerings from rivals.<br/>Analysts said the company's big library and the scale of its international production may help it in the months ahead, as Hollywood wrestles with the impact of the strikes. <br/>These have already disrupted production schedules for a number of films and series. <br/>\"Of everyone in the entertainment industry, Netflix appears to be the best positioned,\" said Brandon Katz, entertainment industry strategist at Parrot Analytics, which tracks streaming demand, noting that the company still leads its peers, despite strong competition.<br/>Despite the subscriber gains, the $8.18bn (\u00a36.32bn) in revenue Netflix reported disappointed investors, rising just 2.7% from last year. Profits were $1.49bn.  <br/>Netflix said that it has limited its price hikes in recent months, leading to a slowdown in revenue growth that gains from its password crackdown and new advertising were not big enough to offset.  <br/>It said it expected that to change by the end of this year, as advertising revenue increases. <br/>It has stopped offering its least expensive commercial-free plan in the US, UK and Canada in a bid to push price-conscious customers to the ad-funded version. <br/>Membership of its ads plan \"nearly doubled\" from March - though from a \"small base\", the company said.<br/>\"Netflix needs to squeeze as much juice as it can from different avenues, given a recent lack of price increases could suggest that inflation is starting to bite Netflix's ability to crank up its subscription price, as households look to trim their spending,\" said Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.<br/>\"Initial progress seems positive, but we are realms away from knowing for sure if this venture is the cash cow it's been sold as.\"<br/>Shares, which have surged 60% this year amid investor enthusiasm for the company's plans, dipped in after-hours trade. <br/>Ms Lund-Yates said the company had delivered a \"sturdy\" performance and the fall reflected the high expectations for the company.<br/>What happens next as Hollywood grinds to a halt<br/>Hollywood strike could last until end of the year<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

The RDG continues to call on the union to give its members a vote on the offer.<br/>RMT boss Mick Lynch said \"there are conditions in this offer that we can't live with\", and ministers had not granted the operators permission to negotiate further.<br/>But RDG boss Jacqueline Starr said the existing \"very good\" offer remained on the table, and the RDG was \"very open to continuing conversations\".  <br/>She added that the industry \"can't afford for the industry to stand still\", and would \"continue with reform\".<br/>Train firms are pressing ahead with plans to close the majority of ticket offices in England. <br/>The plans have faced criticism from disability campaigners and unions which are trying to block the reforms. <br/>The Transport Focus watchdog called the response to its consultation, which is running until Wednesday 26 July, \"huge\" so far.<br/>However, it said it was too soon to say whether the responses were mostly for or against the proposed closures.<br/>Five Labour mayors are preparing a legal challenge, saying the 21-day timescale for the consultation was  \"totally inadequate\".<br/>Under the proposals, some ticket kiosks would remain in large stations, but elsewhere staff will be on concourses to sell tickets, offer travel advice and help people with accessibility.<br/>However, Mr Lynch said that some stations would \"only get staff for two hours, so if you're an elderly person travelling off-peak, there will be no-one there to assist you\".<br/>He added that 2,300 station staff are \"not being moved from behind glass to assist passengers\" but instead would be made redundant \"en masse\".<br/>Last week, Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle challenged rail minister Huw Merriman over the planned closures.<br/>Mr Merriman had said \"no currently staffed station will become unstaffed\" as a result of the proposals.<br/>But Mr Hoyle said the railway station in his constituency, Chorley, would effectively become unstaffed after 4pm.<br/>Ms Starr said on Wednesday that the planned closures were \"about people bringing people out from behind the glass screens\".<br/>Staff would be \"on the concourse, enabling a conversation with customers, enabling them to assist customers, have a dialogue, and also, when necessary, helping customers to navigate the ticket vending machines which would be on the platform,\" she said.<br/>Ms Starr insisted the industry was \"genuinely listening to the accessibility groups that have a number of concerns\", and she was having meetings with the rail minister and disability groups.<br/>When asked by the BBC on Wednesday if she would promise that every ticket currently available at ticket offices could be found on at a machine or online, including the least expensive, Ms Starr replied: \"I'm not going to make promises that I can't keep.\"<br/>She added: \"We are working hard to ensure that where possible, every ticket is offered by a ticket vending machine\".<br/>Campaigner Natasha Winter, who set up the Save Stourbridge Ticket Office group, said when she found out about the consultation on the ticket office closures she was \"absolutely outraged\".<br/>\"We're talking about punishing and penalising the members of society who maybe can't use new technology,\" she said.<br/>\"The station is going to become less user-friendly for the whole community,\" she added. <br/>When are the train strikes and which lines are affected?<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

The union has asked a taskforce to draft legal protections.<br/>The government said it was committed to improving and upholding worker rights.<br/>It comes as the boss of Octopus Energy told the BBC its customers prefer emails written by AI over his staff.<br/>Business leaders are hailing the potential of AI to spur innovation, productivity and improve customer service.<br/>But unions say they are \"deeply worried\" that UK employment law is not keeping pace with the AI revolution.<br/>Mary Towers, employment rights policy officer at the TUC said: \"The types of decisions that are being made by AI are significant and life changing - for example who should get a job, how work is carried out where it's carried out.\"<br/>A lack of AI specific legislation meant the UK was being left behind, she said. \"For example, in the EU, they are in the process of passing an AI Act. In this country, we don't have any equivalent.\"<br/>At Octopus Energy, AI is used to read, interpret and answer customer service queries. Chief executive Greg Jackson said it was doing work that would otherwise need an extra 250 people. <br/>He said customers appeared to prefer dealing with the AI than with a human. <br/>\"An email written by our team members has a 65% satisfaction rating from customers,\" he said. \"An email written by a by AI has an 80 or 85% satisfaction rating. And so what the AI is doing is enabling our team to do a better job of serving customers at a time of great need.\" <br/>He added that a human commanding an AI to write an email \"saves a lot of tedious typing\".<br/>\"But we have to ensure this is all done responsibly. And we need governments and economists and businesses to be ensuring that we're doing this by enhancing and creating jobs, not replacing them.\" <br/>AI could lead to huge breakthroughs in science and medicine according to the boss of drug giant GSK. Emma Walmsley told the BBC that the speed with which AI could process data and see patterns would revolutionise drug development. <br/>\"Biopharma is difficult. It takes sometimes a decade, billions, and it has a 90% failure rate,\" she said.<br/>\"But we are in the business of data at the heart of what we do. AI is helping us see things in this data faster.\"<br/>She said this meant drug and vaccine discovery and development should become \"more predictive and improve our probability of success\".<br/>And she said that could mean better health outcomes for hundreds of millions of people. <br/>\"One in three of us is going to be battling with dementia, there are still many cancers that don't have have solutions, infectious diseases are still causing one in six deaths in the world,\" she said.<br/>There was \"no doubt\" that AI would \"help us unlock better solutions to these challenges\", she said. \"And that's got to be something worth investing in with optimism whilst regulating responsibly.\" <br/>Ms Walmsley thinks improving productivity through the use of AI will create more jobs and \"change some jobs quite meaningfully\". <br/>\"I think some will need maybe some less headcount on but there'll be other spaces where we need a lot more,\" she said.<br/>It is sometimes assumed that the creative arts will be the least affected by AI as machine learning will struggle to replicate human creativity. <br/>But that's wrong according to actress and voice over artist Laurence Bouvard who said that AI is being used to sample, analyse and replicate human voices without paying the original artist. <br/>\"When we do a job, in order to get paid, we have to sign away all our rights,\" she said. \"And these AI companies are just taking it without asking who it belongs to.\"<br/>She said AI was a particular threat to the \"army\" of lesser known artists who voice cartoons, video games, dictionaries and other audio work who could see their careers totally destroyed. <br/>\"A writer and an artist and a photographer, even if their work is stolen, they can create new work. If my voice is stolen, if my career is over,\" she said.<br/>AI has great power and is already changing industries and the work place. Last week the OECD said the world was \"on the cusp of an AI revolution\". <br/>The Paris-based body said: \"Urgent action is required to make sure AI is used responsibly and in a trustworthy way in the workplace.\"<br/>With great power comes great responsibility - and it is not yet clear in the UK or internationally - who will or who should take on that responsibility.<br/>A government spokesperson said: \"AI is set to fuel growth and create new highly-paid jobs throughout the UK, while allowing us to carry out our existing jobs more efficiently and safely. <br/>\"That is why we are working with businesses and regulators to ensure AI is used safely and responsibility in business settings.\"<br/>Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>Why some celebrities are embracing AI deepfakes<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

I have virtually no links of any kind to Russia whatsoever. This is political. There is no other way of looking at it,\" he said.  <br/>The document also gave examples of Mr Farage's views, including his retweet of a Ricky Gervais joke about trans women and his friendship with tennis player Novak Djokovic, who is opposed to Covid vaccinations, to flag concerns that Mr Farage is \"xenophobic and racist\".<br/>He said the 40-page document shows that in November 2022, Coutts' reputational risk committee \"met and said, I did not align with their values, that somehow I wasn't part of their diversity and inclusion agenda and that for those reasons there should be a glide path to closing my account\".<br/>The document - which the BBC does not have a copy of - makes disclosures including:<br/>Mr Farage said the report stated \"very clearly\" that he had met the bank's commercial criteria.<br/>\"For them to try subsequently to pretend that it's for commercial reasons just is not true.\"<br/>He later told BBC Newsnight he was \"literally shocked\" when he saw the report, which he described as a \"personal hit job\". \"This bank is behaving now like a political campaigning organisation,\" he said.<br/>Economist Frances Coppola told the same programme that \"having read the report, I actually don't think that's the reason why they closed his account. The report makes it clear that the reason they closed the account was that Nigel paid off his mortgage and the house was released as a security and that brought him below the criteria for an account at that bank.\"<br/>The bank, owned by NatWest, says customers must borrow or invest \u00a31m or have \u00a33m in savings. Mr Farage previously did not dispute that he did not meet Coutts' threshold but said the bank had not had a problem with this for the past 10 years.<br/>Coutts said on Wednesday it recognised \"the substantial interest\" in Mr Farage's case.<br/>\"We cannot comment on the detail given our customer confidentiality obligations. However, it is not Coutts' policy to close customer accounts solely on the basis of legally held political and personal views. Decisions to close an account are not taken lightly and involve a number of factors including commercial viability, reputational considerations, and legal and regulatory requirements.<br/>\"We recognise the critical importance of access to banking. When it became clear that our client was unable to secure banking facilities elsewhere, and as he has confirmed publicly, he was offered alternative banking facilities with NatWest.

It has hundreds of signatories.<br/>AI lets a computer act and respond almost as if it were human.<br/>Computers can be fed huge amounts of information and trained to identify the patterns in it, in order to make predictions, solve problems, and even learn from their own mistakes.<br/>As well as data, AI relies on algorithms - lists of rules which must be followed in the correct order to complete a task.<br/>The Foundation was launched in 2018 and is a non-profit global group bringing together people working in tech and academia to look at the development of new technologies. <br/>Its questions for developers include how they will prevent an AI product from incorporating bias, and how they would deal with a situation in which the result generated by a tool results in law-breaking.<br/>This week shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said that the Labour Party would criminalise those who deliberately use AI tools for terrorist purposes.<br/>Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has appointed Ian Hogarth, a tech entrepreneur and AI investor to lead an AI taskforce. Mr Hogarth told me this week he wanted \"to better understand the risks associated with these frontier AI systems\" and hold the companies who develop them accountable.<br/>Other considerations in the framework include the data protection laws of various territories, whether it is clear to a user that they are interacting with AI, and whether human workers who input or tag data used to train the product were treated fairly.<br/>The full list is divided into three chapters: questions for individual developers, questions for a team to consider together, and questions for people testing the product.<br/>Some of the 84 questions are as follows:<br/>\"We're in this Wild West stage, where it's just kind of: 'Chuck it out in the open and see how it goes'.\" said Vince Lynch, founder of the firm IV.AI and advisor to the World Ethical Data Foundation board. He came up with the idea for the framework.<br/>\"And now those cracks that are in the foundations are becoming more apparent, as people are having conversations about intellectual property, how human rights are considered in relation to AI and what they're doing.\"<br/>If, for example, a model has been trained using some data that is copyright protected, it's not an option to just strip it out - the entire model may have to be trained again.<br/>\"That can cost hundreds of millions of dollars sometimes. It is incredibly expensive to get it wrong,\" Mr Lynch said.<br/>Other voluntary frameworks for the safe development of AI have been proposed.<br/>Margarethe Vestager, the EU's Competition Commissioner, is spearheading EU efforts to create a voluntary code of conduct with the US government, which would see companies using or developing AI sign up to a set of standards that are not legally binding.<br/>Willo is a Glasgow-based recruitment platform which has recently launched an AI tool to go with its service. <br/>The firm said it took three years to collect sufficient data to build it.<br/>Co-founder Andrew Wood said at one point the firm chose to pause its development in response to ethical concerns raised by its customers.<br/>\"We're not using our AI capabilities to do any decision making. The decision making is solely left with the employer,\" he said.<br/>\"There are certain areas where AI is really applicable, for example, scheduling interviews... but making the decision on whether to move forward [with hiring a candidate] or not, that's always going to be left to the human as far as we're concerned.\"<br/>Co-founder Euan Cameron said that transparency to users was for him an important section of the Foundation framework.<br/>\"If anyone's using AI, you can't sneak it through the backdoor and pretend it was a human who created that content,\" he said.<br/>\"It needs to be clear it was done by AI technology.

But if the interruption in supplies leads to a prolonged period of higher prices, the impact will make itself felt around the world in the coming months.<br/>The sharp increase in grain cost after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year lead to rising prices - not just for food items based on grains, but also for meat and poultry, as animals are often fed with grain. <br/>Countries which depend most heavily on Ukraine's supplies are likely to be most affected. Before the war Lebanon received nearly three-quarters of its grain from Ukraine, while Pakistan, Libya and Ethiopia are also very heavily dependent. <br/>Earlier, President Vladimir Putin said he would return to the international grain agreement immediately if his demands were met. They include lifting sanctions on sales of Russian grain and fertiliser and reconnecting Russia's agricultural bank to a global payment system.<br/>Russian air strikes on the Black Sea coastal cities meanwhile continued for a third night, leaving more than 20 people wounded in Odesa and Mykolaiv. <br/>Mykolaiv regional governor Vitaliy Kim said 19 people had been hurt in the regional capital, including children. Apartment blocks were targeted and in one building the second and top floor were partially destroyed.<br/>Several people were also wounded in Odesa, when a four-storey building was badly damaged.<br/>Russian-occupied Crimea was also hit overnight, according to its Russian-appointee leader Sergei Aksyonov.<br/>A teenage girl was killed when a drone hit four administrative buildings in the north-west of the peninsula.<br/>Crimea has been hit on three consecutive days. A suspected Ukrainian drone attack from the sea damaged a bridge from the occupied peninsula to southern Russia on Monday. Part of a key motorway was also shut on Tuesday because of explosions at a nearby munitions depot.<br/>Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Russia of deliberately targeting grain export infrastructure and putting vulnerable countries at risk.<br/>Agriculture Minister Mykola Solskyi said strikes had destroyed 60,000 tonnes of grain and damaged considerable parts of the grain export infrastructure.<br/>The Black Sea grain deal enabled the UN's World Food Programme (WFP) to ship more than 725,000 tonnes of wheat from Ukraine to countries facing acute hunger, including Ethiopia, Yemen and Afghanistan. So Ukraine provided more than half the WFP's wheat grain last year.<br/>More than half the total grain shipped under the deal was corn, however. Of the nearly 33m tonnes exported, the biggest amount went to China (8m tonnes), then Spain (6m tonnes) and Turkey (3.2m tonnes), UN data shows.<br/>Turkey has been milling grain into flour for the WFP. Corn is used as biofuel and animal feed, besides human consumption.<br/>The defence ministry in Moscow said that from Thursday all vessels sailing on the Black Sea to Ukrainian ports would be regarded as \"potential carriers of military cargo\" and that the ships' \"flag states... will be considered to be involved in the Ukrainian conflict on the side of the Kyiv regime\".<br/>On Wednesday Mr Putin accused the West of using the grain deal as \"political blackmail\". Moscow has accused Ukraine of using the Black Sea grain corridor for \"combat purposes\". <br/>Ukraine's options for exporting grain by rail are also very limited: rail capacity is smaller than shipping volumes and several EU countries in Eastern Europe are blocking Ukrainian grain, in order to protect their own farmers.<br/>Some Ukrainian grain may now be shipped via the Danube, using Romanian territorial waters, though again the volumes are likely to be relatively small.<br/>Marex Capital analyst Charlie Sernatinger said Russia's threatened escalation could \"cut all of the waterborne grain shipments off from the Black Sea, both Russian, and Ukrainian\", which would cause a similar situation to that at the start of the war.<br/>Ukrainian MP Oleksiy Goncharenko called on the UK, US, France and Turkey to protect the grain ships with military convoys and provide Odesa with air defences.<br/>\"Clearly Putin has an aim to disrupt food security and cause a peak in world food prices, which in the developed countries will lead to inflation, but in developing countries that will lead to social destabilisation, starvation and new waves of migrants.\"<br/>Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>What was the Ukraine grain deal?<br/>Russia's grain deal exit stab in the back - Kenya<br/>Russia says Crimea bridge partially open to cars again<br/>No fast results in offensive, warns Ukrainian commander<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

There have been tests done by asking these sort of blanket questions without gender being in the text prompt and, more often than not, it's reflecting these stereotypes.\"<br/>This extends to racial bias and also ableism, said Irene Fubara-Manuel, a lecturer at the University of Sussex.<br/>While they said they were excited about the possibilities provided by generative art, issues such as racial and gender biases in some images created were hard to overcome.<br/>\"I was trying to dye my hair over the summer, and I was just looking up 'people of colour, blonde locks',\" they said.<br/>\"What I got in response was this regal, I would say, fetishised image of black people. You know, chiselled jaw lines, their skin was iridescent.<br/>\"It's like, there are black people who are that beautiful, but the images that you see commonly in a lot of AI are very, very fetishised representations of people. <br/>\"You would not see people who are plus size, or people who have visible disabilities, for instance.\"<br/>Artists are now calling on regulators in the UK and worldwide to take more action to protect artists and the industry.<br/>Irene said artists were not against AI but, \"the argument is against exploitation\".<br/>\"But I'm hopeful that it will contribute to human creativity in general, just like how the creation of computers added more to creativity. I'm excited for its contribution,\" they said.<br/>Caroline said more regulation of the emerging AI industry in the UK would not \"stifle\" innovation.<br/>\"It makes things safer and that's why we have certain laws,\" she said.<br/>\"That's why right now we have seatbelts and airbags for cars and a lot of rules about them. When they were first invented, we didn't have any of that. <br/>\"So it's not at all out of step to sort of ask for, or to create, guardrails and protections.\"<br/>Additional reporting by Lola Mayor.<br/>Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>Elon Musk announces new AI start-up<br/>UK must be more open on use of AI, say campaigners<br/>Watch: What threats does AI pose?<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>What is AI and is it dangerous?<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Prices are still rising quite sharply compared to a year ago, just at a slower rate than they have been.<br/>Prices are still likely to keep going up over the next few months, but not at the rate that has caused such a shock to households and businesses across the country over the last year.<br/>The inflation figure is an average - so your own cost of living could be rising at a very different rate to what's reported in the news, depending on what you spend your money on.<br/>The Office for National Statistics (ONS) which calculates inflation, bases its numbers on a basket of goods that reflects what most people across the UK are buying. But it doesn't include everything. So if you are buying a lot of unusual or niche items, or you have atypical tastes, you might find the cost of your own bag of shopping is going up more quickly - or more slowly - than the headlines suggest.<br/>Food inflation is currently at 17.3%, much higher than the average rate, so people who spend a greater proportion of their outgoings on food will find their personal inflation rate is higher than the 7.9% headline figure.<br/>The ONS says energy, food, and drink accounts for around 15% of lower-income households' spending, compared to 10% for high-income groups.<br/>The Bank of England tries to control inflation by putting up interest rates which makes it more expensive to borrow money. This encourages people to borrow and spend less, and save more.<br/>The Bank is expected to stick with that strategy - of putting up interest rates - throughout this year. So if you have a tracker mortgage or a credit card or loan you could find yourself paying more interest. That's another way your own personal inflation rate could be affected.<br/>Try our personal inflation rate calculator<br/>Occasionally prices will fall very slightly compared to the previous month, but they are much less likely to fall year-on-year.<br/>And while this might be difficult to believe right now, falling prices aren't always a good thing - here's why.<br/>If people expect that prices are likely to fall, they delay spending with the aim of getting a cheaper deal later on. <br/>That means businesses have less money coming in, so they try to find ways to cut costs - most likely by cutting wages or laying off staff. <br/>So prices falling can mean people lose their jobs, which in turn makes prices fall further. This is called \"deflation\", a different kind of economic crisis that brings its own set of problems.<br/>That's why the Bank of England aims to have prices consistently rising by 2% - it's better to aim for a bit of inflation than to risk the negative effects of prices falling.<br/>It's important to remember that the price rises we've seen recently have been primarily driven by global energy prices. These are expected to come down, but not to as low as they were before, and any fall in energy prices will take time to feed through into the wider economy.<br/>Petrol prices drop but food keeps inflation high<br/>Why is UK inflation so high?<br/>What do I do if I can't afford to pay my debts?<br/>Why inflation is worse for some people than others<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

The idea is that by making borrowing more expensive, consumers will spend less and price rises will cool.  <br/>Rising interest rates have also driven up mortgage borrowing costs to their highest level in 15 years, leaving millions of homeowners facing higher monthly repayments. <br/>On Wednesday, the average two-year fixed residential mortgage rate crept up to 6.81%, while the five-year rate was 6.33%. This time last year rates were closer to 3%.<br/>With inflation finally falling by more than expected, economists are scaling down their expectations of immediate interest rate rises - although they still think there are more in store.<br/>How are interest rate changes affecting you?<br/>At its next decision on 3 August, the Bank is now widely expected to raise rates to 5.25% from the current 5%.<br/>Beyond that, analysts at Capital Economics predict rates will rise slightly higher due to the persistence of some inflation pressures - peaking at 5.5%. However, without June's drop in inflation, they say the peak would more likely have been above 6%. <br/>So the pain faced by those due to re-mortgage may be less acute than it could have been. Even so, a million households will be paying an extra \u00a3200 - or more - on their monthly mortgage payments by the end of the year.   <br/>While inflation is falling it does not mean prices are falling, just that they are rising less quickly. Many households continue to struggle with the soaring cost of living. <br/>Laura McLelland, a mum of three from Scorton in Lancashire, told BBC Breakfast that in order to give her family a treat meal every two weeks, she has to cut back on other household bills.<br/>\"I am just trying to reduce the washing in the house, trying not to put the light on, or put the cooker on twice a night, just trying to be outside more with my children,\" she says.<br/>Every fortnight, the family has a chippy tea.<br/>\"I put the money aside so I know I've got it,\" she says. \"I've got a budget. I sort of think, 'right I've got to put that aside' because everybody needs a treat now and again don't they?\" <br/>Read more tips here<br/>James Smith, research director at the Resolution Foundation think tank which focuses on improving living standards, said June's \"chunky inflation rate fall\" offered some \"unambiguously good news\" after months of disappointing data on the state of the economy.<br/>An 18-month squeeze on people's \"real\" wages was \"coming to an end\", he said.<br/>But Yael\u202fSelfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said that while inflation was likely to continue falling, it would not return to the Bank of England's 2% target before early 2025. <br/>As such, the Bank was likely to continue to raise rates.<br/>Inflation is now expected to fall below 7% next month as drops in household energy bills impact the numbers.<br/>So-called core inflation - which strips out volatile elements like fuel and energy prices - also dipped in June.<br/>However, annual food price inflation remained stubbornly high at 17.3%.  <br/>Chancellor Jeremy Hunt welcomed June's inflation figures but said the government wasn't complacent. \"We know that high prices are still a huge worry for families and businesses.\" <br/>But Rachel Reeves, Labour's shadow chancellor, said inflation had been \"persistently high and remains higher than our international peers\". <br/>And Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Sarah Olney said June's figures would \"bring cold comfort to countless families worried about their mortgage going up\".<br/>Additional reporting Elaine Doran <br/>How are the changing inflation and interest rates affecting you?

We cannot continually lag behind.\"   <br/>She said the government should use the opportunity to set out a \"strategic long-term industrial plan\", and require that the new factory be constructed with UK-made steel.<br/>Some industry insiders hope that the Tata battery investment will open the door to further battery investments in the UK. <br/>The UK currently only has one plant in operation next to Nissan's Sunderland factory, and one barely on the drawing board in Northumberland.<br/>Another proposed battery manufacturer, in the north east of England, Britishvolt, went into administration earlier this year.<br/>By contrast the EU has 35 plants open, under construction or planned.<br/>Shadow Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds welcomed Tata's new plant, adding that Labour would ensure \"announcements like this aren't a one-off, but the basis for a growing economy, with good jobs in our industrial heartlands\".<br/>As well as owning Jaguar Land Rover, Tata has extensive steel interests in the UK including the Port Talbot plant in South Wales and the government is also expected to offer around \u00a3300m to subsidise, upgrade, and decarbonise those operations.<br/>Parliament's cross-party Business and Trade Committee is holding an inquiry into the UK's electric vehicle battery manufacturing sector.<br/>Its chairman Darren Jones, said Tata's decision to site the new plant in the UK was \"very welcome\" but he raised questions over the scale of the subsidies provided.<br/>\"We will want to reflect... on the subsidy package that was required to secure this decision and if this approach is scalable to meet the need for further battery manufacturing sites for other car companies across the UK.\"<br/>Those concerns were echoed by the FairCharge group, which represents other companies in the electric vehicle sector.<br/>FairCharge's founder, Quentin Willson, said there was a fear in the industry that Tata's investment could \"sweep up\" all available government support.<br/>\"I truly hope that other companies in the battery, critical minerals, charging and EV supply chains won't be neglected,\" he said.<br/>Andy Palmer, former executive at Nissan and Aston Martin - who is now at EV charging firm Pod Point - said the UK needed a strategic industrial strategy to \"lift all boats\".<br/>\"Support must come in all shapes and sizes for businesses of all shapes and sizes,\" he said. \"One gigafactory doesn't equal success, it equals part of the puzzle.\"<br/>Car firm to pick UK over Spain for car battery plant<br/>Trade deal will benefit UK if we use it - Badenoch<br/>New global engine maker to have headquarters in UK<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

But Labour's Lord Stevenson did not move the amendment to a vote, though he urged further discussion about the issue at a later stage of the bill.<br/>And Conservative peer Lord Moylan had proposed an amendment that would exempt encrypted services from scanning altogether. He argued the governments plans \"opened a hole\" in encryption and said the powers were a \"major assault on privacy\". But he did not move it to a vote anticipating that the house would vote against it.<br/>But Children's charity the NSPCC backed the powers in the bill, telling the BBC it set out \"a balanced settlement that should encourage companies to mitigate the risks of child sexual abuse when designing and rolling out features like end-to-end encryption\".<br/>Apple joins opposition to message app scanning<br/>WhatsApp and messaging apps against 'surveillance'<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Are the guardrails strong enough for Llama 2 to prevent itself from being misused out in the wild, and what will Meta do if it is?<br/>Another interesting thing to note is Meta's decision to partner with Microsoft on this - Llama 2 will be available and usable via Microsoft platforms such as Azure - as Microsoft has also invested billions of dollars in ChatGPT creator OpenAI. <br/>This is a giant with its sights firmly set on AI, and the deep pockets to buy its way in with the key players.

Other female workers told us they were forced by managers to wear uniforms that were too tight for them.<br/>\"There is a saying at McDonald's, \"tits on tills\" - boys in the kitchen, girls on the counter.

The fast-food giant has more than 170,000 people working in 1,450 restaurants.<br/>Its staff are also one of the country's youngest workforces. Three quarters of its employees are aged between 16 and 25. For many, it is their first job.<br/>Most workers are not directly employed by the company as McDonald's uses a franchise system, which means individual operators are licensed to run the outlets and employ the staff.  <br/>Shelby was just 16 when she started working at a McDonald's restaurant in Berkshire last year.<br/>She said older male colleagues would use the cramped layout in the kitchen as an excuse to touch junior female staff inappropriately.<br/>\"They'd grope stomach, waists, bums,\" she said. \"Every shift I worked, there would be at least a comment being made, or I'd be brushed, a hand brushed across me, or it would be a more severe thing, like having my bum grabbed, hips grabbed.\"<br/>There was one man in his 50s, in particular, that managers \"warned\" young staff members to stay away from, Shelby said.<br/>One day last summer, she said she was standing at the front counter when he came up behind her and grabbed her onto him, pulling her onto his groin.<br/>\"I just froze,\" she said. \"I felt disgusted.\"<br/>Shelby says she told senior management about what was going on in the store, but nothing was done. In her resignation email, she said it was a \"toxic work environment\".<br/>McDonald's said it was \"deeply sorry\" to hear about what Shelby went through. It added that it was investigating why any issues that she raised were not formally escalated at the time.<br/>We do not know how many of the workers we spoke to made formal complaints. But a number of them told us they did - only for them to be ignored.<br/>In the case of 17-year-old Chinyere in Cheshire, who was sexually and racially harassed by a much older man, she initially raised it with a female colleague who was responsible for staff wellbeing. She told her to ignore the man's behaviour and go back to work. After months of harassment, Chinyere confided in her stepfather who wrote to the franchise, to corporate headquarters and the police.<br/>The man was then fired. Chinyere believes if her stepfather hadn't intervened, nothing would have happened. McDonald's described her experiences as \"abhorrent and unacceptable\" and apologised unreservedly. It said it took swift action as soon as the issue came to its attention and that the man was dismissed within three days. They added: \"It takes a great deal of courage to speak up and as soon as we were made aware of the situation the individual in question was offered both internal and independent external support.\"<br/>Another worker in Birmingham, who says she was smacked on the bottom by a male colleague when she was 19, reported it immediately to her manager. But despite it being caught on camera and her having a visible bruise, she was forced to continue working with him, which made her so uncomfortable that she eventually quit.<br/>Several workers also said that when complaints were made about managers, they were then moved from one McDonald's restaurant within the franchise to another, rather than being fired.<br/>Other employees said they didn't complain as they couldn't risk losing work. Young staff at McDonald's are often on zero hours contracts - it means their hours are flexible, but also that they are at the mercy of shift managers who decide their rotas.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Former McDonald's worker says the company has 'little to no regard for our feelings'<br/>In the February agreement, McDonald's pledged \"zero tolerance\" on sexual harassment and to deliver training for employees.<br/>But staff have told the BBC the training is not being taken seriously by managers.<br/>One employee described perching an iPad next to a McFlurry machine and speeding through the harassment training video while he made drinks.<br/>Baroness Kishwer Falkner, chairwoman of the EHRC, said every firm should have zero tolerance of sexual harassment and protect its workforce.<br/>McDonald's culture has faced scrutiny globally. In the US it is facing multimillion dollar lawsuits brought by employees over sexual harassment allegations.<br/>Its chief executive, Steve Easterbrook, was fired in 2019 after it was revealed he had inappropriate consensual relationships with McDonald's employees.<br/>Allegations of sexual harassment at McDonald's first surfaced in the UK five years ago when the Bakers, Food and Allied Workers Union (BFAWU) says it received 1,000 complaints. There was very little reporting of the allegations at the time - this could be because some cases were settled using confidentiality clauses.<br/>Sarah Woolley, BFAWU's general secretary, said the new allegations uncovered by the BBC were \"shocking\".<br/>Alistair Macrow, chief executive of McDonald's UK & Ireland, said there was \"simply no place for harassment, abuse, or discrimination\" at the company.<br/>\"Every one of the 177,000 employees in McDonald's UK deserves to work in a safe, respectful and inclusive workplace.  There are clearly instances where we have fallen short and for that we deeply apologise,\" he told the BBC.<br/>\"We will investigate all allegations brought to us, and all proven breaches of our code of conduct will be met with the most severe measures we can legally impose, up to and including dismissal.\"<br/>Mr Macrow said that more than 2,000 managers had completed full awareness training and that most restaurant teams were now working within the new protections which aim to create \"a safe and respectful workplace\".

The Bank has previously warned it has taken longer than expected for declines in wholesale costs to filter through to supermarket shelves.<br/>Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, said grocery price inflation had been falling for four months in row, which would come as \"good news for many households although, of course, the rate is still incredibly high\".<br/>But he cautioned that prices were rising quickly last summer, so the latest slowdown is \"partially down to current figures being compared with those higher rates one year ago\".<br/>The prices of basics such as pasta, eggs and cheese have rocketed since last year as food producers struggled with supply chains issues and soaring energy bills. <br/>However, these pressures appear to be easing while Kantar said UK shoppers had dramatically changed their behaviours to cut costs \"whether by trading down to cheaper products or visiting different grocers\".<br/>The research firm said spending on promotions now accounts for just over a quarter of all UK grocery spending.  <br/>Meanwhile, retailers are \"ramping up\" loyalty card deals such as Tesco's Clubcard Prices and Sainsbury's Nectar Prices.   <br/>Kantar said that at the current level of inflation, households would have spent \u00a3683 more on their annual grocery bill if they had bought the same products they did last year. <br/>However, by seeking out cheaper deals and retailers, customers had limited this rise to just \u00a3330, \"well below the hypothetical \u00a3683\", said Kantar.<br/>According to official figures, food price inflation, which is the rate at which prices for groceries have risen compared to the year before, was 18.3% in May, down slightly from 19% in April. That is close to its highest rate in nearly 45 years. <br/>Supermarkets have been accused of not passing on falling wholesale costs to consumers, prompting the competition watchdog to launch a probe. <br/>However, grocers deny profiteering and have cut the price of some basics like milk. <br/>In its latest results for the six months to 28 May, Ocado said its retail revenues rose by 5% to \u00a31.2bn in part due to average price inflation of 8.4% across the business. <br/>However, it said this had been offset by smaller basket sizes and fewer orders per week as shoppers looked to cut costs. <br/>Meanwhile, Kantar said competition between the UK's grocery chains remains intense. <br/>Aldi was again the fastest growing supermarket in June, with sales up by 24% compared with a year ago, followed closely by budget rival Lidl on 22.3%. <br/>Sainsbury's is seeing the fastest growth of the bigger supermarkets, with sales up 10.7% year on year, followed by Asda at 10.5% and Tesco on 10.2%.<br/>How are you coping with the increasing cost of living?

Some people went to prison following convictions for false accounting and theft, and many were financially ruined. Some victims have since died.<br/>There has been a public inquiry, led by Sir Wyn, which has been examining the treatment of thousands of sub-postmasters, and to establish who was to blame for the wrongful prosecutions and why nothing was done to prevent them.<br/>Sir Wyn said on Monday that his criticisms over delays in compensation \"remain justified\".<br/>Ms Saddiq, 39, along with fellow former sub-postmistress Mrs Palmer told the BBC the scandal had had a \"devastating\" impact on their lives.<br/>Ms Saddiq, who used to run three Post Offices in Newcastle upon Tyne, said she had \"lost everything\" as a result of being accused of crimes a decade ago, including her home above one branch.<br/>She did not end up facing criminal prosecution, but she had to leave the area with her two young children after being assaulted with flour in the street.<br/>\"I had to flee, me and my children overnight. They left their friends behind, they had to change schools,\" she said.<br/>Mrs Palmer, who was found not guilty after a trial, said the allegations had \"ruined my life\".<br/>\"I was made homeless, I now live in a one-bedroom studio flat (because of the financial impact),\" she said.<br/>Mrs Palmer, from Essex, had previously told the BBC she received a compensation payment in December, but soon realised it was not what it seemed, with a significant chunk of the money going straight to pay her creditors. She is now seeking proper compensation for the scandal.<br/>The former postmistresses welcomed the latest report by Sir Wyn, but both called for the compensation process to be sped up.<br/>\"To keep a human being in this fight mode for such a long time, it's torturous. I want to be free from this now,\" Ms Saddiq said.<br/>Mrs Palmer added: \"Words are no good now, we need actions. We need the Post Office to have accountability and the government.\"<br/>In the report laid before Parliament, Sir Wyn said there was no \"valid legal reason\" why the government and Post Office \"cannot give effect to the commitments they which they have made\" in providing \"full and fair\" compensation.<br/>The retired judge said it was his job to make sure ministers and Post Office executives \"made good on those promises\" made to provide compensation to legitimate claimants \"promptly\" and to make sure the amounts paid out was \"recognised to be full and fair\".<br/>Sir Wyn has long held concerns about the slow progress of compensation for Post Office staff.<br/>But the Post Office chief executive, Nick Read, told the BBC's World At One programme that the \"sheer scale\" of the miscarriage of justice had \"gone above and beyond anything that anybody could realistically expect\".<br/>\"It really is a huge apology from the Post Office. We are all in this together and we are all on the same side,\" he said, but he rejected claims the Post Office was deliberately delaying proceedings.<br/>Sir Wyn said it had been 16 months since he first started to hear the experiences of sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses, which he said \"consisted of graphic descriptions of hardship and suffering\".<br/>The former High Court judge there were 438 applications for compensation still to be resolved as of 27 April, which he said the Post Office had accepted were \"difficult to resolve\".<br/>\"I am left with the distinct impression that the most complex cases have not been addressed as speedily as might have been the case,\" he said.<br/>As the Post Office scandal has developed, three different compensation schemes have been set up. <br/>But Sir Wyn said he was \"sure\" that if the government and Post Office were devising a scheme to deliver compensation to all involved now, there would not be three of them.<br/>He also warned there was a \"clear and real risk\" that final compensation payments under one scheme - the Group Litigation Order set up by the government last year - \"will not be delivered to each applicant\" by the 7 August 2024 deadline.<br/>He set out a series of recommendations, one of which was for payments to be made after the deadline, which he described as an \"entirely artificial cut-off point\". <br/>Kevin Hollinrake, the Post Office Minister appointed last autumn, said the government would review the report and respond in due course.<br/>\"It is vital that we establish the facts behind this scandal and learn the lessons so that something like this can never happen again,\" he said.<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

At least not in Nooriyah's opinion.<br/>She's a 28-year-old DJ who lives in London. She plays venues around the world, sometimes to crowds of more than 40,000 people.<br/>AI programmes have been available in her industry for years, recommending songs to mix based on their tempos.<br/>But they haven't taken Nooriyah's job yet, and she thinks she knows why.<br/>\"Because the way that I connect with my audiences is very difficult to replicate,\" she says.<br/>\"Imagine a raver looking over at me when I'm DJing, seeing me sweat and dance just like them. <br/>\"In that moment they feel that intimate connection that AI couldn't.\"<br/>Hannah Rose learnt to DJ during lockdown and is working towards making it her main source of income.<br/>She's getting lots of work but has noticed venues cutting back budgets as the cost-of-living crisis bites.<br/>\"Since Covid there's been a massive shift towards people asking to stream sets,\" she says.<br/>\"Especially when it's somewhere overseas, if they don't have the money to get you to play in a different country, it's an easy and accessible way to get the artists on their line-ups without actually having to physically have them in the room.\"<br/>Hannah's noticed a lot of nightclubs already have a camera set up for streaming behind the decks.<br/>She's now worried that will extend to virtual sets.<br/>\"They've got a long way to go to match the emotional intelligence of a human being, but with AI generating original compositions, it could be quite a dark future for DJs,\" she says.<br/>In March this year, an East London venue hosted an AI rave to mixed reviews, with some saying the music felt \"dry and empty\".<br/>It may be that humans make the best DJs but it's not such a straightforward story for producers.<br/>As well as being a DJ, Nooriyah makes her own music.<br/>Her creative process currently involves experimenting with different sounds on software, before mastering tracks. It's this final stage where AI is coming in.<br/>\"To me, the conversation about AI in producing is very overdue,\" she says.<br/>\"There are already at least 10 different software programmes that mix music and could put producers out of jobs\".<br/>She wants to see a better dialogue between those in the music industry and AI developers.<br/>\"I think the danger here is there's work being done without a discussion about what it would mean for the music industry.\"<br/>One solution, she says, is to tax the AI companies.<br/>\"Firstly, let's slow down the release of these AI programmes, and tax the developers, investing that money in putting on training for people who lose their jobs to AI.\" <br/>Phil Kear agrees. He works with the Music Union and is worried AI will put limits put on the amount people are willing to pay for recordings made by human creators. <br/>\"AI music will be cheaper,\" he says. \"And I think that people will be tempted to use it, maybe bars.\"<br/>Although he says, its full influence will only go as far as humans will let it.<br/>\"A lot will be determined by the general public's willingness to accept AI or the quality of the music it can produce.\"<br/>He doesn't think the majority of commercial music will be impacted, but highlights \"background\" music as an area at risk.<br/>\"With music on TV and films, I think the public will be much more willing to accept AI-generated music because there's no personality associated with it,\" he says.<br/>\"Whereas I think in bars and clubs, there's a certain amount of investment.\"<br/>Like many industries, the world of music has already been influenced by advances in technology. <br/>For Nooriyah, this development is the same.<br/>\"Music has evolved rapidly over time.

However, the RMT union said that figure was too high because it does not include rail cleaning staff.<br/>The ONS says median pay for \"train and tram drivers\" is just under \u00a359,000.<br/>Although Aslef members tend to be better paid than other rail workers, Mick Whelan, general secretary of the union, told BBC News on 12 May that train drivers \"haven't had a pay rise for four years\". He was just referring to the ones who are taking industrial action.<br/>That's because a new pay deal has not been reached since their last agreement ended in 2019.<br/>However, Transport Minister Huw Merriman said the pay of train drivers \"has gone up by 39% since 2011... the highest increase of any employment group.\"<br/>He is right about the 39% increase, but we have not been able to establish whether it's the highest increase for any employment group. That's because of changes to the way the figures have been released over the last decade.<br/>The Rail Delivery Group (RDG), which represents the 14 train companies, made an offer that would have seen rail workers receive a backdated pay rise of 5% for 2022. It would then negotiate reforms ahead of a second year's pay rise with individual operators.<br/>On 5 May, RMT members voted to extend the strike mandate for another six months.  <br/>The Aslef union, meanwhile, has rejected a two-year offer which would see drivers get a backdated pay rise of 4% for 2022 and a 4% increase this year.<br/>Separately, a revised offer from Network Rail was accepted by RMT members on 20 March, ending that dispute. <br/>The union said the offer amounted to an uplift on salaries of between 14.4% for the lowest paid grades to 9.2% for the highest paid. <br/>Unions are obliged to give at least 14 days' notice of any strike action. <br/>How will the rail strikes affect your journey?

In fact, she signed up for it.<br/>\"It's a bit like that Black Mirror episode with Salma Hayek,\" Ms Yeo jokes.<br/>She was speaking to the BBC the day after the release of the new series of Charlie Brooker's Netflix show. In the first episode, actress Salma Hayek, playing a fictionalised version of herself, signs away her image to a production company.<br/>The deal allows it to use an artificial intelligence or AI-generated deepfake version of the Hollywood A-lister to \"star\" in their new TV drama. What she says and does in the show is controlled by the computer.<br/>The consequences for Ms Hayek - without spoiling the story - are not good.<br/>Concerns about the impact of AI are partly behind the first Hollywood actors' strike in more than four decades, bringing the US movie and television business to a halt.<br/>It comes after Screen Actors Guild (SAG-AFTRA) failed to reach an agreement in the US for better protections against the misuse of AI for its members.<br/>The actors' union has warned that \"artificial intelligence poses an existential threat to creative professions\" as it prepared to dig in over the issue.<br/>However, Ms Yeo is not worried. She is one of a growing number of celebrities embracing AI-generated advertising.<br/>The new technology is being met with a mixture of excitement and trepidation.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Singapore celeb Jamie Yeo has embraced AI deepfakes<br/>Ms Yeo has just agreed a deal with financial technology firm Hugosave, which allows it to use a digitally manipulated likeness of her to sell their content.<br/>The process is fairly simple. She spends a couple of hours in front of a green screen to capture her face and movements, then a couple more hours in a recording studio to capture her voice.<br/>An AI programme then synchronises the images with the audio to create a digital alter-ego capable of saying practically anything. The results are uncanny.<br/>\"I do understand the concern, but this technology is here to stay,\" she says. \"So even if you don't embrace it because you're scared, there will be other people who will embrace it.\"<br/>Some already have. As part of his deal with PepsiCo, superstar footballer Lionel Messi allowed it to use a deepfake version of himself to advertise Lay's crisps.<br/>Not only can online users create personalised video messages from \"Lionel Messi\", they can get him to say it in English, Spanish, Portuguese and Turkish.<br/>Fellow football superstar David Beckham and Hollywood legend Bruce Willis have also dabbled with deepfake technology - though, unlike Ms Yeo, they have so far stopped short of signing away full image rights.<br/>\"I think deepfakes will just become part of normal practice in the advertising industry over the next few years,\" says Dr Kirk Plangger, a marketing expert at King's College London.<br/>\"It opens the door to all kinds of creative options. They're able to micro-target consumers and are often extremely persuasive.\"<br/>The efficiency of the process also makes it attractive from a commercial point of view.<br/>\"You're not doing that much work for the money you're charging,\" Ms Yeo says.<br/>\"It's also good for the client on a budget because they get so much more content than from a normal shoot. So it works for everyone.\" <br/>The client - in this case Singapore-based Hugosave - agrees. <br/>\"Having this technology available means we can literally produce hundreds of videos in a matter of days. Compare that to the months, if not years, that we'd need if we were filming the content in the traditional way,\" says Braham Djidjelli, Hugosave's co-founder and chief product officer.<br/>\"We're able to leverage the benefit of AI while also retaining the human touch of a trusted local face - in this case Jamie's.\"<br/>But, as analysts such as Dr Plangger point out, there is a \"dark side\" to the technology. <br/>\"It's not something we can put back into the box,\" he says. \"The advertising industry needs to wake up to the risks as well as the possibilities of artificial intelligence. It means stepping back, as a society, and thinking about what is the proper or ethical use of this technology.\"<br/>One of the things Dr Plangger is referring to is a looming \"crisis of trust\", where consumers cannot tell between what is real or fake. This is something already being exploited by vested interests online and can range from synthetically manipulated pornography to misinformation to political messaging.<br/>This week BBC News is focussing on AI, how the technology affects our lives and what impacts it may have in the near future.<br/>But there are also more practical risks for the talent voluntarily signing up to be deepfaked. Currently, there are no clear laws relating to AI to ensure your image is properly protected.<br/>For example, what happens if a brand uses your digital avatar to endorse a product that may damage your image or your alter-ego makes a joke in poor taste?<br/>\"We are in uncharted territory when it comes to AI and deepfake technology,\" says Tng Sheng Rong, an intellectual property lawyer at Rajah and Tann in Singapore. <br/>\"Many, many issues can arise. Who owns the intellectual property? Who do you go to for legal recourse? The truth of the matter is that the existing laws don't provide a robust enough regulatory framework to guard against these issues.\"<br/>That may be the final hurdle for advertisers before they start buying rights to digital versions of Hollywood A-listers, for example.<br/>At this early stage, Ms Yeo says she is very mindful of the risks, but her decision was informed mainly by trust - both in Hugosave and in the way business is done in Singapore.<br/>But ultimately, she says, it is about staying ahead of the curve.<br/>\"If you want to still be in the game, then you've got to learn how to be in it. Because if you don't, you should probably just retire.\"<br/>The Black Mirror plot about AI that worries actors<br/>Students switch to AI to learn languages<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>AI 'godfather' says it won't destroy jobs forever<br/>What is AI and is it dangerous?<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Big tech was going to supercharge agriculture, one of the oldest industries in the world, and the revolution would start with salad leaves.<br/>Warehouse-grown greens, flourishing in trays neatly stacked beneath row upon row of glowing LEDs. It was lettuce - but sci-fi.<br/>US-based AeroFarms considered itself to be one of the leaders in the industry.<br/>\"We are so far above everybody else in this technology,\" AeroFarms' chief executive David Rosenberg boasted to the New Yorker in 2017. \"It will take years for the rest of the world to catch up.\"<br/>Hard times caught up with AeroFarms instead. In June, the firm filed for bankruptcy protection in the US and Mr Rosenberg stepped down.<br/>It is all part of a \"reset\" or \"pivot\", insists co-founder and chief marketing officer Marc Oshima: \"We're growing product every day, we're shipping product every day.\"<br/>But lately, AeroFarms has struggled to find enough capital to fuel its soaring ambition. \"The money just has not been there,\" admits Mr Oshima, though he adds that the firm still has some investors who are supplying \"millions of dollars\". <br/>AeroFarms famously designed its own indoor growing systems. \"We think it has served us well, we have unique technology,\" adds Mr Oshima.<br/>When asked whether initiatives, such as one targeting low income communities in Jersey City, New Jersey, will continue, he adds that these are currently \"being evaluated\".<br/>A spokeswoman for Jersey City says, \"We do not anticipate our operations to be interrupted in any way.\"<br/>A long list of other vertical farms have run into trouble in recent months.<br/>French firm Agricool went into receivership earlier this year, Pennsylvania-based Fifth Season shut down in late 2022, Iron Ox of California has laid off nearly half its workforce and Infarm has closed its operations in Europe - making 500 staff redundant.<br/>\"Infarm has decided to shift its geographical focus from Europe to high-potential regions better suited for indoor farming, with low energy prices and healthy market demand,\" the company says in a statement.<br/>Besides the major economic challenges that have hampered many industries during the last few years, within vertical farming a debate rages over the extent to which some companies may have set themselves up for a fall.<br/>\"My opinion is that we'll continue to see failures. It is bad,\" says Andrew Lloyd, chief operating officer at Intelligent Growth Solutions, which makes equipment for vertical farms. \"Many people are growing the wrong crops, they're very heavily focused on leafy greens.\"<br/>He also argues that some have foolishly attempted to design and build their own technology - such as robots that tend to the baby plants as they develop. <br/>That might sound like too easy a riposte for someone who sells such technology himself but Mr Lloyd does make a good point, says Mark Lefsrud at McGill University in Canada, who consults for the industry.<br/>\"I've seen to the extreme where one company redeveloped their own pipe,\" he says. \"Literally just a plastic pipe to transfer water through.<br/>\"I was like, 'I think the pipe has been developed'.\"<br/>What people don't often hear about vertical farming, though, is how an ability to care for plants, regardless of what technology you use, really matters, adds Mr Lefsrud.<br/>He says he has occasionally been called in by firms fretting over copious trays of crops that have started to die.<br/>\"You need somebody who's going to be full-time,\" he has told them, explaining that farming means giving constant attention to living things - not just firing up a few gadgets and waiting for the profits to roll in argues Mr Lefsrud.<br/>\"You have to be growing them properly all the time. You can't go, 'I'm not gonna work this weekend because I want to have a party' - and all the plants die on you. Which I've seen repetitively,\" he says.<br/>The industry has been blighted by \"hubris\", argues Chris Davies, chief executive and founder of Harvest London, which plans to open a new vertical farm in Beddington next year. The firm grows salad for companies including HSBC and Google.<br/>Mr Davies says he and his colleagues are trying to be cautious. For one thing, their new facility will be built near to a power-generating waste incinerator so that they can take advantage of cheap energy when it is available.<br/>\"Let's say we know that an hour from now power pricing is going to go up, we can just turn out the lights,\" he says. <br/>The firm has also successfully grown tomatoes, cucumbers and strawberries at a small scale and hopes to diversify its product line in the near future with these potentially higher value crops.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>It can be tricky to expand beyond growing just a few varieties of easy leafy greens, says David Meszaros, founder of Smartkas, a Dutch agricultural technology firm that owns the largest vertical farm in the UK - a 27,000 sq m facility in Harlow, Essex dedicated to growing strawberries.<br/>Dr Meszaros stresses that Smartkas operates a range of growing environments, including greenhouses, meaning the firm has not put all its eggs in the vertical farming basket alone. <br/>His company has still faced plenty of headaches lately, though. \"The big challenge came with the chip shortage,\" says Dr Meszaros, explaining how growing at one newly built facility was delayed by many months because Smartkas could not obtain the chips it required for the safety systems in robots tasked with moving around trays of plants.<br/>Without those chips, the robots would not have been able to detect collisions in the warehouse or dangerous levels of water or humidity, for example. <br/>Despite pitfalls, vertical farming still has a future, say many observers - even those who are critical of some business models. <br/>Growing more food indoors, and in urban places, is a matter of \"security\" says Paul Myers, managing director at Farm Urban, which is based in Liverpool. He mentions the veg shortage that hit British supermarkets earlier this year.<br/>\"What that highlights is that, actually, the UK should be investing in long-term solutions,\" he says.<br/>Britain is \"exposed\" to supply issues, agrees Jessica Davies at Lancaster University. She and colleagues published a study last year that suggested urban farming, including vertical farming, could boost agricultural production.<br/>For Mark Lefsrud, the vertical farming businesses falling by the wayside do not represent a death knell. Rather, they are a sign that the industry is maturing as the truly hardy growers emerge.<br/>\"It's a pruning that's required,\" he says. \"We do it to plants, so it makes sense to do it with businesses, too.\"<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Sri Lanka had to go back to pandemic-era measures such as online classes and working from home. But even this was not practical because of power cuts - some of which went on for up to 13 hours a day.<br/>Food, medicine and other essentials were also in short supply, exacerbating the crisis. People had to stand in such long queues in the brutal heat, that at least 16 people - mainly the elderly - died.<br/>But now, just a year later, food, fuel and medicine are available again, offices, schools and factories are all open, and public transport is back up and running.<br/>Restaurants, especially high-end ones, are bustling.<br/>\"Last year this time I was on the verge of selling my restaurant. We had to close for a few days as the shortage of fuel meant no customers were coming. But now footfall has gone up nearly 70%,\" said Chathura Ekanayake who runs a fine dining restaurant in Colombo.<br/>The country's main source of foreign currencies - tourism - is also witnessing a revival. The industry has recorded a 30% jump in revenue from the previous year.<br/>\"The recovery has been magical for us. Last year we didn't even know if the country would survive\", said Hiran Cooray, CEO of Jetwings Symphony, a leading travel and hospitality player in Sri Lanka.<br/>Despite these good news stories, Sri Lanka's economy is still in a precarious place.<br/>The country still has more than $80bn (\u00a361.1bn) of debt - both foreign and domestic. In the worst of the crisis last year, the country defaulted on its foreign debt for the first time in its history.<br/>Ranil Wickremesinghe who took charge as President after widespread protests saw then-ruler Gotabaya Rajapaksa resign, has managed to secure a lifeline of $2.9bn from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).<br/>This has been crucial to opening other funding channels and easing shortages, but the money came with strict economic and governance policy reforms. The country is now seeking to restructure terms of its debt payments with both foreign and domestic lenders, as mandated by the IMF.<br/>The main focus has been on restructuring its $36bn of foreign debt. This includes more than $7bn of loans from China, Sri Lanka's largest bilateral creditor.<br/>However, it is the restructuring of domestic debt that is likely to have a much bigger impact on the Sri Lankan people. Domestic borrowing accounts for around 50% of the country's total debt. Sri Lanka's cabinet recently approved a domestic debt restructuring proposal, but it has drawn massive criticism as it aims to cut workers' pensions, while banks will not be affected. There have been protests against the proposals in Colombo.<br/>It highlights that while life may seem to have returned to normal, in reality people are still struggling.<br/>Essentials are available, but unaffordable for many. Things are more expensive than ever before. Almost half of all Sri Lankan families spend about 70% of their household income on food alone. And prices of food, clothing and housing are continuing to rise.<br/>To add to the burden, income tax has been hiked to as much as 36% and subsidies on everything from food to household bills have been removed.<br/>One area where this has had a huge impact is electricity bills, which have soared by 65% after the subsidy was removed.<br/>\"Many families from the middle class have now slipped below the poverty line,\" said Malathy Knight, a senior economist with private think tank Verite Research.<br/>And according to the World Bank, this is likely to continue for a while.<br/>\"Poverty is projected to remain above 25% in the next few years due to the multiple risks to households' livelihoods,\" it said in a report. The organisation has extended a $700m loan to Sri Lanka for budgetary support, including $200m for the poor and vulnerable.<br/>The country's youth seem desperate to leave. <br/>An estimated 311,269 people left in 2022 - the country has never seen migration on such a large scale. Many are skilled workers like doctors, paramedical and IT professionals.<br/>The scale of the brain drain is leaving a worrying gap in the country's economic recovery.  Businesses trying to recover from the crisis are unable to find skilled labour. <br/>\"I am running daily advertisements but unable to get qualified chefs. Last year I had 14 chefs in my kitchen, now I am working with just 2. Even if I want to invest more money and expand, I cannot,\" Mr Ekanayake told the BBC. <br/>This is a dramatic fall for a country that was long held up as an economic success story and had one of the highest average incomes in South Asia. The quality of its infrastructure, its free public health and education systems and its high levels of social development have all been held in high regard.<br/>So how did things get so bad?<br/>The government blamed the crisis on the Covid pandemic, which badly affected tourism. However, although the pandemic was a factor, disastrous economic policies were more to blame. Populist moves like big tax cuts in 2019 cost the government $1.4bn in annual revenues. And a move to ban imports of chemical fertilisers in 2021 caused a domestic food shortage.<br/>In order to cut expenses further the government has proposed privatising state-owned enterprises like Sri Lankan Airlines, Sri Lankan Insurance Corporation and Sri Lanka Telecom. This has triggered a fresh wave of protests - this time by trade unions.<br/>\"The government should not put the burden of the reforms on the salaried class and middle class who are already affected by the economic crisis,\" said Anupa Nandula, the Vice President of the Ceylon Bank Employees Union.<br/>Mr Nandula and his union participated in a recent demonstration against the proposal to privatise the Sri Lankan Insurance Corporation. He believes privatisation will lead to massive job losses and further burden the working class.<br/>Ever since last year's demonstrations were violently broken up, Sri Lankan authorities have been using force - such as tear gas, water cannon and even beating protesters. But experts warn that this is not a tactic that can work.<br/>Rather than using force, the government needs to be transparent and explain that reshaping the economy will be tough, says Bhavani Fonseka, a constitutional lawyer working with Centre for Policy Alternatives.<br/>\"I think people since the crisis has happened have gotten used to a harder lifestyle. But in the absence of information coming, in the absence of answers being given, there is growing uncertainty and fear that we will go back to a crisis point.\"<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

If a child successfully found a Pok\u00e9mon then a computerised animation of the creature would appear on their handset's screen, superimposed on top of the actual view through the phone's camera.<br/>It proved irresistible to millions and millions of young users. But are adults equally impressed by the use of AR?<br/>Since Pok\u00e9mon Go's success, a growing number of consumer brands are continuing to embrace AR, such as Coca-Cola and US whiskey Jack Daniels. You use your phone camera to scan a QR code on the can or bottle label, and an animation or video pops up on your screen.<br/>Does this use of AR remain a novelty, a gimmick that most people ignore, or does it actually increase consumer engagement and sales?<br/>In 2021, US soft drink firm Jones Soda introduced its first AR campaign, which it called Reel Labels. If you scan an image on the bottle labels then it transforms into a short video.<br/>To create the videos the firm partnered with an initial 15 so-called influencers, including a skateboarder, a breakdancer, and a BMX bike rider. Since then the firm's customers have been able to send in their own videos to be featured. <br/>And last year Jones Soda worked with music labels Sub Pop and Hardly Art to promote videos from more than a dozen new bands.<br/>\"A brand's packaging is so much more than a container for a product,\" says Bohb Blair, Jones Soda's chief marketing officer. \"It's now an opportunity to make a consumer's moment with your product special.<br/>\"Content is a great way to do that, and AR is a fun and convenient distribution vehicle.\"<br/>Another drinks business that has used AR to connect with the music industry is Estonian milk brand Tere Piim. In 2019 it joined with the Eurovision Song Contest to enable customers to see mini digital animations of that year's entrants perform on their kitchen counters and tables. All they had to do was scan a label on the milk cartons.<br/>The AR technology was provided by Latvian software firm Overly. \"Although you may doubt the compatibility at first glance, milk and a song contest make a good cross-marketing duo,\" says Overly's chief executive Ainars Klavins.<br/>\"In this instance, a traditional milk carton became a new medium for broadcasting Eurovision songs. It inspired consumers who may not be existing viewers to explore the contestant line-up and choose their favourites.\"<br/>New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.<br/>He adds that consumers, especially younger ones, are ready to engage with brands \"in the augmented reality realm\".<br/>While you'd expect those involved in helping firms create AR to sing its praises, what do independent experts think?<br/>Stuart Duff is a leading business psychologist, who studies how firms can best connect with consumers. He says that AR can help products seem more \"interesting, engaging and memorable\".<br/>\"Research has highlighted that using AR not only captures our attention more quickly but also increases the likelihood of committing information to memory. So while AR may seem like a gimmick, it offers a genuine alternative approach to lodging brands in our psyche.\"<br/>Jenny Stanley is managing director of Appetite Creative, a Madrid-based tech and marketing firm that helps consumer businesses create AR labels.<br/>She says that a product's label is already an example of \"extremely targeted marketing\", whose effectiveness only increases further when AR content is added.<br/>\"It's not only impactful, but also cost effective. The average cost per digital advertising click is \u00a31.50, whereas a click or scan on packaging is technically free, giving brands a compelling reason to use connected packaging.\"<br/>Yet, as Mr Klavins of Overly cautions, content is key. And by that he means that what the AR offers has to be interesting and engaging.<br/>\"The key point here is that quality content for augmented reality is vital. I always say that AR content should either inspire, educate or entertain. It has to do at least one of those things to transform from a novelty tech into a strategic tool that drives business value.\"<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

But many airports and airlines that had made cuts during the pandemic struggled to recruit staff quickly enough.<br/>They insist they've pulled out all the stops to make their operations more resilient this year.<br/>For example, EasyJet told the BBC in March it started recruiting far earlier than usual and was already fully staffed for summer.<br/>However, there are different headaches this year, which could mean further disruption, although not necessarily on the scale of last year's problems.<br/>Strike action, notably by French air traffic controllers, has been causing cancellations and delays for months. <br/>Flights over France to destinations such as Spain and Portugal have also been affected, which Ryanair's boss has repeatedly complained about.<br/>The Unite union says ground handlers contracted by airlines at Gatwick Airport will take eight days of strike action in late July and early August. Gatwick is Europe's busiest single-runway airport.<br/>This could mean disruption, although the airport says it will work with airlines to ensure as many flights as possible operate as scheduled.<br/>Meanwhile, at Birmingham Airport, around 100 security officers and terminal technicians will begin continuous strike action from 18 July.<br/>But proposed summer strike action by security workers at Heathrow was called off after the Unite union accepted an improved pay offer.<br/>The threat of strikes by European air traffic managers at Eurocontrol remains, but no dates have been set. The union involved told the BBC it hopes to reach an agreement with the employer.<br/>Industrial action isn't the only issue. <br/>The air traffic control environment is \"challenging\", according to Willie Walsh, who heads up global airline body Iata.<br/>EasyJet has already axed 1,700 summer flights at Gatwick to reduce the chance of last-minute cancellations, blaming what it called \"unprecedented\" air traffic limitations.<br/>Europe's air space remains constrained and clogged up due to the Ukraine war.<br/>\"In the event of French strikes some flights may be rerouted through other, already congested, air space which itself creates additional pressure,\" says aviation expert John Strickland.<br/>\"Manpower shortages in parts of Europe such as Greece and Denmark [are] causing capacity bottlenecks, which create further delays. <br/>\"Indeed one European airline CEO told me that the whole of European air traffic control except the UK was 'a mess'.\"<br/>Mr Strickland thinks events like summer storms could add pressure to an already stretched system, leading to delays and cancellations.<br/>On the railway, the plans of thousands of people going on day trips or holidays could be affected.<br/>Another period of disruption will begin on Monday as train drivers in the Aslef union will refuse to work overtime at 15 train companies between 17 and 22 July. <br/>This isn't a full strike but could cause some reduced timetables and last-minute cancellations.<br/>It's worth checking before you set off. <br/>Then, rail workers in the RMT union at 14 train companies with government contracts are due to walk out on 20, 22 and 29 July. <br/>Their dispute over pay, jobs and working conditions has been going on for more than a year now.<br/>The operators are all based in England but some run services into Wales and Scotland.<br/>The level of disruption during these strikes will vary around the country. Many will run reduced services. <br/>Strike day timetables will be published a week before each date.  <br/>These RMT strikes are happening after the union rejected the latest proposals from the industry, which is backed by the government.<br/>The train companies are under pressure from the government to cut costs. With the national dispute at a standstill, they have since announced controversial plans to close most station ticket offices in England.  <br/>Passengers are being asked to provide their views until 26 July, in a consultation run by watchdogs Transport Focus and London Travelwatch.<br/>In London, the Underground will be affected by significant disruption between 23 and 28 July, with the RMT, Aslef and Unite scheduling strike action that week.<br/>Traffic is expected to increase as we head into the summer holiday season, and roads could be busier than usual as train strikes push people into cars instead. <br/>\"It's likely that people will consider altering their journey plans and they may well travel by car instead so it's important they check their vehicle is roadworthy before setting off,\" says Frank Bird, senior network planner at National Highways.<br/>\"We'd also remind motorists to check the weather forecast... and to take plenty of drinking water with them as well as food that won't be affected by the heat in case of delays.\"<br/>Dover is Europe's busiest ferry port, and summer is its peak time as passengers head across the Channel.<br/>It will be under the spotlight again after many passengers experienced long queues last July and during this year's Easter holidays.<br/>In late May, port boss Doug Bannister told the BBC everything possible had been done to prevent the same level of delays.<br/>However, he said \"it would be foolish\" to guarantee there would never be queues.<br/>Mr Bannister added that additional passport checks introduced after Brexit were a factor.<br/>The port's location between cliffs and the sea means space is limited. <br/>It says measures in place ahead of the summer holidays include working with coach and ferry operators to spread out travel at peak times, extra space to process coach passengers, and putting in more border control posts. <br/>Local authorities and emergency services have traffic management plans for busy times, including queuing up lorries on the M20 motorway.<br/>This system was reinstated on Thursday, ahead of the busy July and August period.<br/>Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>Strike action could hit holiday flights in Europe<br/>Easyjet cancels 1,700 flights from July to September<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Kreiz began working on it when he became CEO of Mattel in 2018 and he remains executive producer. <br/>Barbie and Ken are played by Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, with Greta Gerwig directing.<br/>Kreiz acknowledges there is some risk in giving Barbie the Hollywood treatment, working with directors and writers who have their own creative ideas.<br/>There is \"humour and self-deprecation\" in the film, he says (not least on his part, as he is played by Will Ferrell, a controlling and slightly stuffy CEO).<br/>It's clear even from the trailer that Barbie is the butt of jokes. <br/>If you're being generous, she is portrayed as na\u00efve and innocent. If you aren't, she's shallow and superficial, obsessed with appearance and unable to comprehend the meaning of sex, death - or life without high heels.<br/>Barbie's \"Dreamland\" is a pink utopia, divorced from reality.<br/>\"This movie has been 64 years in the making (Barbie launched in 1959),\" says Kreiz, \"but it represents how the culture sees Barbie today.\"<br/>Barbie remains Mattel's biggest-selling brand, making the company more than \u00a31bn ($1.5bn) annually. Its other brands include Hot Wheels, Masters of the Universe, Monster High, Bob the Builder and Thomas the Tank Engine.<br/>Kreiz argues Mattel's other brands also have the potential to be turned into successful spin-offs.<br/>\"The devil works hard but Barbie's marketing team is working harder,\" according to marketing expert Mike Buonaiuto, author of Founder Therapy, who admires the inventive advertising the team behind the film has been up to, including the Airbnb listing of a Barbie Dreamhouse. <br/>\"But let's be honest,\" Buonaiuto points out, \"the opportunity for the Mattel universe is vastly different to Marvel's, and whilst Barbie is being powered by millennial nostalgia collaborations, try and do the same for Thomas the Tank Engine or Hot Wheels and you probably won't get the same result. <br/>\"The depth of world-building Mattel can pull from isn't competition for Marvel's.\"<br/>But the recent collapse of Toys R Us shows why toymakers like Mattel need to diversify beyond the sale of physical products, adds Buonaiuto.<br/>Barbie was first introduced in America in 1959, developed by Ruth Handler, co-founder of Mattel. <br/>Before Barbie, dolls typically took the form of babies, so children could play at being a nurturing parent. However, Barbies encouraged children to play at being adolescents, imagining their future selves through the dolls.<br/>As the original TV adverts that ran during Mickey Mouse Club told children: \"Someday I'm going to be exactly like you.\"<br/>This proved alluring and good business. More than a billion Barbie dolls had been sold by the early 1990s.<br/>But there have also been questions about what exactly Barbie dolls teach children, especially around body image. <br/>The original Barbie design was extremely skinny and the messaging reinforced unhealthy ideas. One infamous slumber party set created in the mid-1960s featured bathroom scales fixed at 110 pounds (50kg) and a dieting book that advised: \"Don't eat\".<br/>Another talking Barbie created in the early 1990s had the doll saying, \"Math class is tough.\" Mattel later apologised.  <br/>These issues continued to affect people's perception of the brand and arguably lay behind a dip in popularity around a decade ago.<br/>Mattel has learned lessons and is now keeping up with the times, says Kreiz.<br/>\"Barbie is a flag carrier for diversity and inclusivity,\" he says, \"with more than 170 different Barbie types in terms of body shape and skin colour, and Barbie has more than 200 careers, so girls can explore their potential in different ways.\"<br/>Barbie has recently brought out dolls with disabilities, prosthetic limbs, and one with Down's Syndrome. <br/>The \"classic, traditional Barbie\" is less than half of the business now, says Kreiz.<br/>That new commitment to diversity is reflected in the cast of the film, while the classic Barbie, who is the central character, is gently mocked.<br/>More CEO Secrets interviews:<br/>Kreiz also points out that Mattel is restructuring the company to move with the times.<br/>Now it simply divides its products into categories (like dolls, vehicles and pre-school), rather than having teams devoted to separate boys' and girls' products. This is despite the fact that many shops still divide toys by gender, with pink aisles for girls who want to be princesses, and blue ones for boys who like dinosaurs and construction sets.<br/>The Barbie film is part of Kreiz's masterplan to position Mattel as a \"talent magnet\", working with people like film directors to try different things with its well-known creations.<br/>\"People who buy our products aren't just consumers,\" says Kreiz. \"They are fans, who have an emotional relationship to the products. Kids touch, hug and go to bed with our toys.<br/>\"We believe in the long-term opportunity for Barbie. But we need to evolve her, keep her relevant and in the centre of cultural conversation.\"<br/>Feeling the 'Kenergy' on Barbie movie pink carpet<br/>Everything you need to know about the Barbie movie<br/>Is Barbie's makeover working?<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

It cited the unavailability of quality tomatoes \"due to seasonal crop issues\" as the reason.<br/>The skyrocketing prices have been particularly hard on India's middle and lower classes, who make up the bulk of the population.<br/>In the western city of Pune, a vegetable seller allegedly smacked a customer in the face with a weighing scale for bickering over the price of 250g of tomatoes. <br/>In Varanasi - the holiest city for India's Hindu majority - a politician reportedly hired two bouncers to prevent people from haggling over tomato prices at his shop.<br/>There have been reports of people stealing tomatoes from fields and hijacking tomato-laden trucks.<br/>Allow Twitter content?<br/>This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The government has said that the soaring prices are a \"temporary problem\" and that they will drop in the coming months.<br/>Some states have started selling tomatoes at reduced prices at government-run or farmer-backed outlets to help consumers. On 30 June, the Indian government launched a Tomato Grand Challenge Hackathon in Delhi to encourage the public to share ideas to combat the escalating prices.<br/>The tomato holds a surprising amount of sway over Indian cooking - it's added to almost every dish. So when it becomes scarce and expensive, it becomes the subject of headlines and even political rows.<br/>Economists say the steep price rise could disrupt India's delicate inflation balance, pushing retail inflation towards 5.5% in July-September from 4-5% in April and May.<br/>Ironically, close to two months ago, farmers in India dumped crates of tomatoes on the road after prices crashed to 2-3 rupees a kilo in the wholesale market as supply exceeded demand. <br/>Farmers resorted to the same measure last year to draw attention to their plight and, in March, farmers in Maharashtra state took out a protest march to demand higher prices for onions.<br/>India often faces supply-demand challenges when it comes to perishable, but essential, vegetables like the onion and tomato. Both crops are grown almost around the year and produce from different states hits the market during different months.<br/>This year, a bumper crop of tomato was followed by a poor harvest season.<br/>\"The current bout of tomato prices is actually a result of unseasonal rains during March-April-May in tomato-growing areas, particularly Kolar belt [in southern Karnataka state], which has the largest tomato market of the country,\" says, Ashok Gulati, farm economist.<br/>\"From mid-June, the supplies have shrunk, while demand pressures have mounted, leading to spikes in fresh tomato prices,\" he adds.<br/>Mr Gulati says the excessive rains in north-western India are likely to put further pressures on supply. <br/>\"Significant areas are also reeling under floods, especially Himachal and Uttarakhand states. Supply lines during heavy rains often get displaced,\" he says.<br/>Anil Malhotra, an Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) member, told PTI news agency that though tomato prices escalate every monsoon, he had never seen them this high.<br/>\"There is a major dip in supply due to rains. Around half our stock, which we get from Himachal Pradesh, got damaged,\" he said.<br/>Arvind Malik, a tomato farmer from Haryana state, told the Guardian newspaper that while he usually sold 30,000kg of tomatoes every year, this year he could only harvest half of that as his crops had been destroyed by pests. <br/>\"Experts told us that irregular weather - sudden rise and decline in temperatures - is the reason behind the diseases in our tomatoes,\" he said.<br/>So how does India overcome this supply-demand gap? A straightforward solution would be to just store excess produce for the proverbial - and in this case, literal - rainy day. <br/>But experts say that this is easier said than done because tomatoes are highly perishable and tend to go bad after a few weeks even in cold storage. <br/>Mr Gulati says that one way to stabilise supply is to incentivise protected cultivation of tomatoes to save the crop from extreme heat or unseasonal heavy showers.<br/>Another step is to process tomatoes into puree, which can help consumers shift to processed tomatoes when prices of fresh tomatoes are running high. \"But to promote processing of tomatoes, the government has to incentivise the processing and lower GST [general sales tax] on tomato puree from 12% - 5%,\" says Mr Gulati.<br/>\"Overall, a value chain approach has to be adopted to de-risk the vegetable from production to consumption, but the framework is absent right now.\"<br/>BBC News India is now on YouTube.

The amount of money is expected to be more than $100m (\u00a378m) every 12 months.<br/>Meanwhile, the other 2% of the retailer's shares were transferred to a new trust, called the Patagonia Purpose Trust, which now runs the company, and - as the firm says - guides its environmental and philanthropic principals.<br/>Yvon Chouinard, who led Patagonia for 50 years, is now 84 years old. He and his family decided on the new business structure and cash giveaway as he stepped back from being in the company's driving seat.<br/>\"We looked at different approaches,\" says Patagonia's chair Charles Conn. He adds that one option could have been floating the firm on a stock exchange and  \"then give the money away\", but that may have resulted in the company subsequently not being run in such an environmentally-focused way.<br/>\"So we kept coming back to giving shares to environmental foundations, and using it to fight the environmental crisis,\" says Mr Conn. \"It's a radical thing to do, but we're dependent on Mother Earth.<br/>\"The family walked away from billions, but Yvon is the real deal. He doesn't have a mobile phone, they drive old cars.\"<br/>You might think that Patagonia is an unusual one-off, but a small number of other firms are making similar arrangements to add nature and the environment - at least figuratively  - to either their ownership or board rooms.<br/>UK beauty products company Faith in Nature now has two directors who are there \"to give nature a voice and a vote on how Faith In Nature is run\". These two external board members come from two environmental organisations - Earth Law Centre and Lawyers for Nature.<br/>\"It's about how to make business better, so less damage is done,\" says Anne Hopkins, creative director at Faith in Nature.<br/>\"We are a company with our hearts in the right place... we didn't want this to just be marketing. We wanted to create a formal and legal structure with a practical framework.\"<br/>Fellow creative director Simeon Rose adds that the two environmental directors come to an agreement \"and give nature's view\". He adds: \"The biggest difference is now it enables other board members to see what decisions nature makes, and it helps them make further conscious decisions\".<br/>Faith in Nature, which was founded back in 1974, has now created an online guide for any companies that would like to follow its example.<br/>In the Netherlands, Dutch vegan cheese-substitute company Willicroft appointed \"Mother Nature\" as its chief executive in 2020, replacing co-founder Brad Vanstone, who became head of impact.<br/>But what does that actually mean?<br/>\"It means that every single decision we make every day is geared towards the planet. For example, I now take the train when I travel to the UK, whereas before I wouldn't think about it, and I would fly,\" says Mr Vanstone.<br/>Since the new boss was appointed, other environmental decisions made by Willicroft include only accepting investors who are committed to ditching any fossil fuel investments within five years.<br/>In addition, the firm switched from making its cheese substitutes out of cashew nuts to using beans and pulses instead. This was because it calculated that the processing of cashews caused more carbon emissions.<br/>More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade.<br/>Mr Vanstone adds that next year the business will bring in an \"impact board\" to sit alongside the main board of the company, to challenge any decisions not deemed environmentally led.<br/>In addition, he has called for other businesses to follow Willicroft's nature-led lead, and he says that 15 companies in Amsterdam have now followed suit.<br/>The actions of Patagonia, Faith in Nature and Willicroft seem easy to celebrate, but they are not without their critics.<br/>Kandi White, program director at US environmental group Indigenous Environmental Network describes such initiatives as \"largely greenwashing and empty gestures\". Her organisation was set up in 1990 to protect the \"sacred sites, land, water, air, natural resources, [and] health\" of indigenous communities across North America.<br/>\"Even with a symbolic recognition of Mother Earth as a board member, or donating profits to philanthropic organisations, climate justice will not be achieved until the practice of profit and consumption ends,\" she says.<br/>\"Corporations must change how they relate to Mother Earth, to nature, and must dispel the dominant anthropocentric belief that Mother Earth belongs to humans. Lastly, they must establish values, principles, operations and practices that are reflective of natural law.\"<br/>Still, for companies wishing to add an environmental representative to their ownership or board, Tad Ostrowski, founder and managing director of UK law firm Artington Legal, says they should carry out due diligence first.<br/>\"Care would need to be taken to ensure that the finances of the company and the relationships with the other shareholders were clear, transparent and aligned with the company and its relevant stakeholders,\" he says.<br/>\"But done properly, there is no reason why the company's long-term success for the benefit of its members as a whole cannot be linked to positive decision making for the long-term benefit of nature.\"<br/>Back at clothing firm Patagonia, Mr Conn says it was vital to put Planet Earth in charge of the business. \"Many species are in decline, and climate change is impacting us all.

I have never seen anything so horrible and bleak in my life,\" said Stephen Brotherstone.<br/>He and David Lawrence are the authors of Scarred for Life - a series of books looking at the impact of 70s and 80s pop culture.<br/>Both vividly remember the film, with Brotherstone admitting he only managed to watch the first half when it was broadcast as it \"wrecked\" his head.<br/>However, he finally saw the full movie when it was repeated - and it has stayed with him ever since.<br/>\"I can still remember lying in bed in my bedroom and you can kind of see the next street on from my mum and dad's and it was almost like an overlaid image of blasted houses and rubble, because it affected me that much.\"<br/>Reece Dinsdale, who played central character Jimmy in the film, said it had \"looked really special\" when he read the script, largely because he admired the work of writer Hines.<br/>However, the Normanton-born actor, who was shortly to star in sitcom Home to Roost with John Thaw, had no idea of the drama's impact.<br/>\"We said 'wow if we can pull this off it'll be great,' but I didn't have a clue that it held that much of a punch.\"<br/>The film was shot on location in Sheffield and, after it was completed, 500 guests were attended a special screening in the city.<br/>\"There was complete silence and all you could hear was various people sobbing around the room,\" the actor recalled.<br/>\"People blame me to this day for scarring them for life. <br/>\"People say it is the most scary thing they've ever seen in their life and remains so to this day.\"<br/>Threads was made and shown in an era of heightened tension between the West and the then USSR.<br/>Lawrence and Brotherstone are currently working on a third volume of their series, which looks at the Cold War and includes a chapter on Threads.<br/>\"I think '83, '84 was the peak of Cold War paranoia in the 80s,\" said Lawrence.<br/>\"You've got nuclear war mentioned in a million pop songs, you've got it on TV, in your comics, and then Threads comes on and there's every nightmare you've ever had on screen.\"<br/>Brotherstone remembers feeling convinced he would not live to see 1990.<br/>\"It wasn't a question of if they pressed the button, but when are they going to press the button,\" he said.<br/>Jimmy, played by Dinsdale, and Ruth, played by Karen Meagher, have just learnt that Ruth is expecting a baby as the film opens.<br/>The growing tensions between East and West appear on TV and newspapers as Sheffield's residents go about their daily lives, ignoring the looming threat.<br/>\"There's the build-up to war, but you don't see it you, just hear about it in the background as they are discussing what to have for tea,\" Lawrence said.<br/>\"They are so wrapped up in their own lives, that is very powerful I think.\"<br/>For Dinsdale, it was a \"fantastic\" piece of writing by Hines.<br/>\"They are everyman and everywoman, they are just normal people with normal lives, there's nothing special about them and this very special event happens to them and it just draws you in.\"<br/>Brotherstone said director Jackson had initially thought of using the cast of Coronation Street.<br/>\"Until it was pointed out to him that it would be massively distracting to watch Deirdre Barlow get blown up,\" he said.<br/>\"It is very 70s, 80s Play for Today, but I think it works in its favour because it was so British.<br/>\"That was a house that looked like mine, there's Woolworths getting vaporised, it really struck home.\"<br/>The final parts of the film follow the characters as they struggle through the nuclear winter in the aftermath of the blasts.<br/>\"It is watching everyone die and it is watching society collapse forever. <br/>\"It makes the point we are never coming back as a society, language is gone, skills are gone, we are just in rags grunting at each other,\" Brotherstone said.<br/>For the actors and crew it was \"a ball\" to make, according to Dinsdale.<br/>\"We had the biggest laugh I remember, it was one of the happiest crews ever.\"<br/>To him though, Threads remains a \"seminal\" piece of television which still resonates with audiences.<br/>\"It was one of the most outstanding pieces of work the BBC has ever created,\" he said.<br/>\"It is so grim and gruesome and so truthful and real and so horrific.<br/>\"I am very proud of it.\"<br/>Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Travellers pay higher ticket prices and more tax. <br/>It is often cheaper to fly to another continent than to another African country.  <br/>For a quick comparison, flying from the German capital, Berlin, to Turkey's biggest city, Istanbul, will probably set you back around $150 (\u00a3120) for a direct flight taking less than three hours. <br/>But flying a similar distance, say between Kinshasa, capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Nigeria's biggest city, Lagos, you will be paying anything between $500 and $850, with at least one change, taking up to 20 hours. <br/>This makes doing business within Africa incredibly difficult, and expensive - and it is not just elite travellers that are affected.  <br/>The International Air Transport Association (IATA) - the global trade body representing some 300 airlines which make up about 83% of world air traffic - argues that if just 12 key countries in Africa worked together to improve connectivity and opened up their markets, it would create 155,000 jobs and boost those countries' Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by more than $1.3bn. <br/>\"Aviation contributes directly to the GDP in every country. It generates work and it activates the economy,\" says Kamil al-Awadhi, IATA's regional vice-president for Africa and the Middle East.<br/>Adefolake Adeyeye, an assistant professor of commercial law at the UK's Durham University, agrees that Africa as a whole is missing out because of its poor air service.   <br/>\"It's been shown that air transport does boost the economy. As we've seen in other continents, budget airlines can improve connectivity and cost, which boosts tourism, which then creates many more jobs,\" she says.  <br/>The poor quality of road networks and lack of railways in many African countries often makes air transport the practical choice for cargo too.  <br/>The climate emergency, which has severely impacted Africa, means everyone needs to be more careful about their carbon footprint and should aim to fly a lot less. <br/>But even though around 18% of the world's population lives in Africa, it accounts for less than 2% of global air travel and, according to the UN's Environment Programme, just 3.8% of global greenhouse gas emissions. This is in contrast to 19% from the US and 23% from China.  <br/>Africa may be rich in minerals and natural resources, but of the 46 nations on the UN's Least Developed Countries list, 33 are on the continent, and poverty continues to be the biggest daily threat for millions of people on the continent.  <br/>But there is also a growing middle-class who could potentially travel by air if the tickets were priced at similar levels to Europe or elsewhere.<br/>African states have been trying for decades to integrate the aviation sector, but they haven't been successful, yet. <br/>\"There needs to be a coherent strategy by Africa to address the issue of its poor air service if they want to transform Africa's economies,\" says Zemedeneh Negatu, the global chairman of US-based investment firm Fairfax Africa Fund.<br/>He says that flights within Africa are still structured around cumbersome bilateral agreements from one country to the next, and that most  flag-carrying state airlines in Africa barely cover their costs, while some even run at a loss.  <br/>\"Every government in Africa wants to see their flag on the tail of an aircraft at Heathrow or JFK airport, but African governments need to realise that stand alone carriers are not viable.\" <br/>Mr Zemedeneh argues that African airlines should take inspiration from Europe and form major partnerships, such as between flag-carriers Air France and KLM of The Netherlands, and the Anglo-Spanish International Airlines Group (IAG) formed between British Airways and Iberia. <br/>He says even in the rich market of Europe, conglomeration is the way forward for airliners to survive, and provide a cheaper more reliable service. <br/>The current system in Africa is very fragmented, and although 35 countries are signed up to the Single African Air Transport Market, an African Union (AU) initiative to free up the skies to African airlines and bring down costs, it could be years before it's implemented.  <br/>IATA's Mr Awadhi says governments are reluctant to work together. <br/>\"There is a hard-headedness where each state thinks they know how to handle it better and will stick to their remedies even when they are not very effective,\" he says.<br/>\"In the end it's a business and there is a level of protectionism that starts to hurt the aviation industry. Then there is no benefit to having your own national carrier.\" <br/>There is one notable exception in Africa of an airline that is absolutely thriving, and that could provide a blueprint for others to copy - Ethiopian Airlines.  <br/>Just over 15 years ago the company employed about 4,000 people. Now that figure is over 17,000. <br/>It is state-owned but run entirely as a commercial venture without government interference. <br/>It has more than doubled the size of its fleet of cargo and passenger planes and has made Addis Ababa a regional hub, driving foreign currency into the Ethiopian capital, and boosting the country's service industry.  <br/>At the turn of the millennium Ethiopia was one of the poorest countries in the world, now it's one of the fastest growing economies. <br/>Mr Zemedeneh, an Ethiopian-American who played a key role as an adviser to Ethiopian Airlines as it developed its strategy, says Ethiopian Airlines has played a part in that boom. <br/>\"Ethiopian Airlines generates millions of dollars in hard currency for the country, and it makes every Ethiopian proud that they have been able to create one of the most successful indigenous African-owned, African-operated, multinational companies,\" he adds.    <br/>African travellers will be hoping these kinds of commercial successes will ultimately impact their airfares, bringing them down more in line with Europe or Asia - and that they can finally get to where they want to go more quickly and cheaply.<br/>One woman, 30 African countries, five lessons<br/>Waiting for take-off in West Africa<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

But Mr Namasivayasivam recently divulged his blunder to dozens of people at an event in Toronto, Canada.<br/>His mistake seven years ago involved his work trying to ensure that when bands and solo artists submitted 10-second long, looping videos to accompany their songs, they would play smoothly on people's mobile phones.<br/>At the time the videos were being trialled in Canada.<br/>They should have been streamed to users' handsets just the one time, but due to Mr Namasivayasivam's error they were constantly re-downloaded onto people's phones every 10 seconds.  <br/>For those not connected to wi-fi, it quickly used up all their data.<br/>Mr Namasivayasivam only became aware of the mistake when he read complaints on an online forum. One person had written that it had \"killed his data\".<br/>Another said: \"I hate this feature so much. Whoever came up with this, should be fired and shot.\"<br/>While most of us might have wanted to keep such memories locked away, Mr Namasivayasivam revealed all into a microphone while standing on a stage in front of room full of strangers.<br/>The gathering was part of a global movement, with more than 250 cities now participating in public showcases of how entrepreneurs and other business leaders, mainly in the tech space, fail and then recover from their gaffes.<br/>The idea is that it is cathartic to talk about such things, and everyone in attendance can learn from the mistakes, and ask questions.<br/>Mr Namasivayasivam told the crowd in Toronto: \"It was at this moment that I messed up, and this is where the feelings of imposter syndrome and anxiety and shame came flooding in.\"<br/>He was one of three speakers at the event. Afterwards he told the BBC that it felt good to share his face-palm moment, \"and how someone can bounce back from that embarrassment\".<br/>Today Mr Namasivayasivam is the founder and chief executive of Skillify, a Toronto-based provider of software coding training.<br/>Bill Murray (not the famous actor), works for Canadian software firm Padiem, which makes systems that enable firms to handle timesheets and wages.<br/>He was in the audience watching Mr Namasivayasivam, and says that the story particularly resonated with him. <br/>\"If you've never made any mistakes as a coder, you probably weren't innovating enough,\" says Mr Murray.<br/>\"Most people want to hide their embarrassing moments or failures, but because the speakers open the floor with some of their toughest moments, it sets the stage for everyone attending to let their guard down and really get to know one another.\"<br/>Tech entrepreneurs shouldn't only celebrate their wins, Mr Murray adds. \"When you study someone's success, it's almost like asking them what lottery numbers they played to win.<br/>\"Of course you can learn lots from successful people, but to me the concept of openly talking about your failures felt like there was much more to learn from.\"<br/>Marsha Druker, who organises the regular failure talks in Toronto, says she looks for speakers willing to not just be open about their professional failure story.<br/>Instead she also wants them \"to tell audiences about what they learned about that mistake, now that they have had time to reflect on it\".<br/>She says a common theme to what tech entrepreneurs face when they fail is \"a story of resilience and coming out at the other side, and recognising that failure shouldn't be a taboo topic we don't talk about openly\".<br/>Venturing into that often off-limits topic is the reason why such celebrations of failure began in Mexico City in 2012, says Carlos Zimbr\u00f3n, a Mexican tech entrepreneur who first came up with the idea for the evenings.<br/>During a barbeque at home with other friends, Mr Zimbr\u00f3n says he expressed how boring it was to attend \"typical conference with keynote speakers talking about their successes, and how it was rare to hear the B-side of that story\".<br/>Soon after, he and his friends held the first failure talk in the same backyard space.<br/>As word spread about the Mexico City event, other entrepreneurs in cities in 80 countries around the world have since started their own parallel nights. They hold monthly talks, coupled with a Q&A session after each speaker.<br/>Mr Zimbron says that the talks, many of which are later uploaded to YouTube, \"can be inspiring for people who may have gone through the same problems\".<br/>He adds: \"When you can connect to someone else's mistakes, and can see how vulnerable they are in sharing that story, that's where you can connect with other entrepreneurs.\"<br/>New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.<br/>Leah Edwards, is both a director at US investment fund Lighter Capital, and a lecturer on leadership and innovation at University of California, Berkeley.<br/>She says she loves that these public talks about business failure are \"normalizing the fact that something is hard, and that it takes a number of at-bats [a baseball term for a batter's turn] in order to find the right combination of teams and market opportunity, and the right product or service\".<br/>Ms Edwards adds Silicon Valley has long had a high tolerance for start-ups not succeeding, and that it is good to see this spreading.<br/>\"There will always be entrepreneurs whose companies don't work out in the end, but they pick themselves back up and try again,\" she says. \"I'm excited to see this recognition of that kind of resilience spreading into other geographies and cultures.\"<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

It has hundreds of signatories.<br/>AI lets a computer act and respond almost as if it were human.<br/>Computers can be fed huge amounts of information and trained to identify the patterns in it, in order to make predictions, solve problems, and even learn from their own mistakes.<br/>As well as data, AI relies on algorithms - lists of rules which must be followed in the correct order to complete a task.<br/>The Foundation was launched in 2018 and is a non-profit global group bringing together people working in tech and academia to look at the development of new technologies. <br/>Its questions for developers include how they will prevent an AI product from incorporating bias, and how they would deal with a situation in which the result generated by a tool results in law-breaking.<br/>This week shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said that the Labour Party would criminalise those who deliberately use AI tools for terrorist purposes.<br/>Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has appointed Ian Hogarth, a tech entrepreneur and AI investor to lead an AI taskforce. Mr Hogarth told me this week he wanted \"to better understand the risks associated with these frontier AI systems\" and hold the companies who develop them accountable.<br/>Other considerations in the framework include the data protection laws of various territories, whether it is clear to a user that they are interacting with AI, and whether human workers who input or tag data used to train the product were treated fairly.<br/>The full list is divided into three chapters: questions for individual developers, questions for a team to consider together, and questions for people testing the product.<br/>Some of the 84 questions are as follows:<br/>\"We're in this Wild West stage, where it's just kind of: 'Chuck it out in the open and see how it goes'.\" said Vince Lynch, founder of the firm IV.AI and advisor to the World Ethical Data Foundation board. He came up with the idea for the framework.<br/>\"And now those cracks that are in the foundations are becoming more apparent, as people are having conversations about intellectual property, how human rights are considered in relation to AI and what they're doing.\"<br/>If, for example, a model has been trained using some data that is copyright protected, it's not an option to just strip it out - the entire model may have to be trained again.<br/>\"That can cost hundreds of millions of dollars sometimes. It is incredibly expensive to get it wrong,\" Mr Lynch said.<br/>Other voluntary frameworks for the safe development of AI have been proposed.<br/>Margarethe Vestager, the EU's Competition Commissioner, is spearheading EU efforts to create a voluntary code of conduct with the US government, which would see companies using or developing AI sign up to a set of standards that are not legally binding.<br/>Willo is a Glasgow-based recruitment platform which has recently launched an AI tool to go with its service. <br/>The firm said it took three years to collect sufficient data to build it.<br/>Co-founder Andrew Wood said at one point the firm chose to pause its development in response to ethical concerns raised by its customers.<br/>\"We're not using our AI capabilities to do any decision making. The decision making is solely left with the employer,\" he said.<br/>\"There are certain areas where AI is really applicable, for example, scheduling interviews... but making the decision on whether to move forward [with hiring a candidate] or not, that's always going to be left to the human as far as we're concerned.\"<br/>Co-founder Euan Cameron said that transparency to users was for him an important section of the Foundation framework.<br/>\"If anyone's using AI, you can't sneak it through the backdoor and pretend it was a human who created that content,\" he said.<br/>\"It needs to be clear it was done by AI technology.

But Labour's Lord Stevenson did not move the amendment to a vote, though he urged further discussion about the issue at a later stage of the bill.<br/>And Conservative peer Lord Moylan had proposed an amendment that would exempt encrypted services from scanning altogether. He argued the governments plans \"opened a hole\" in encryption and said the powers were a \"major assault on privacy\". But he did not move it to a vote anticipating that the house would vote against it.<br/>But Children's charity the NSPCC backed the powers in the bill, telling the BBC it set out \"a balanced settlement that should encourage companies to mitigate the risks of child sexual abuse when designing and rolling out features like end-to-end encryption\".<br/>Apple joins opposition to message app scanning<br/>WhatsApp and messaging apps against 'surveillance'<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

The union has asked a taskforce to draft legal protections.<br/>The government said it was committed to improving and upholding worker rights.<br/>It comes as the boss of Octopus Energy told the BBC its customers prefer emails written by AI over his staff.<br/>Business leaders are hailing the potential of AI to spur innovation, productivity and improve customer service.<br/>But unions say they are \"deeply worried\" that UK employment law is not keeping pace with the AI revolution.<br/>Mary Towers, employment rights policy officer at the TUC said: \"The types of decisions that are being made by AI are significant and life changing - for example who should get a job, how work is carried out where it's carried out.\"<br/>A lack of AI specific legislation meant the UK was being left behind, she said. \"For example, in the EU, they are in the process of passing an AI Act. In this country, we don't have any equivalent.\"<br/>At Octopus Energy, AI is used to read, interpret and answer customer service queries. Chief executive Greg Jackson said it was doing work that would otherwise need an extra 250 people. <br/>He said customers appeared to prefer dealing with the AI than with a human. <br/>\"An email written by our team members has a 65% satisfaction rating from customers,\" he said. \"An email written by a by AI has an 80 or 85% satisfaction rating. And so what the AI is doing is enabling our team to do a better job of serving customers at a time of great need.\" <br/>He added that a human commanding an AI to write an email \"saves a lot of tedious typing\".<br/>\"But we have to ensure this is all done responsibly. And we need governments and economists and businesses to be ensuring that we're doing this by enhancing and creating jobs, not replacing them.\" <br/>AI could lead to huge breakthroughs in science and medicine according to the boss of drug giant GSK. Emma Walmsley told the BBC that the speed with which AI could process data and see patterns would revolutionise drug development. <br/>\"Biopharma is difficult. It takes sometimes a decade, billions, and it has a 90% failure rate,\" she said.<br/>\"But we are in the business of data at the heart of what we do. AI is helping us see things in this data faster.\"<br/>She said this meant drug and vaccine discovery and development should become \"more predictive and improve our probability of success\".<br/>And she said that could mean better health outcomes for hundreds of millions of people. <br/>\"One in three of us is going to be battling with dementia, there are still many cancers that don't have have solutions, infectious diseases are still causing one in six deaths in the world,\" she said.<br/>There was \"no doubt\" that AI would \"help us unlock better solutions to these challenges\", she said. \"And that's got to be something worth investing in with optimism whilst regulating responsibly.\" <br/>Ms Walmsley thinks improving productivity through the use of AI will create more jobs and \"change some jobs quite meaningfully\". <br/>\"I think some will need maybe some less headcount on but there'll be other spaces where we need a lot more,\" she said.<br/>It is sometimes assumed that the creative arts will be the least affected by AI as machine learning will struggle to replicate human creativity. <br/>But that's wrong according to actress and voice over artist Laurence Bouvard who said that AI is being used to sample, analyse and replicate human voices without paying the original artist. <br/>\"When we do a job, in order to get paid, we have to sign away all our rights,\" she said. \"And these AI companies are just taking it without asking who it belongs to.\"<br/>She said AI was a particular threat to the \"army\" of lesser known artists who voice cartoons, video games, dictionaries and other audio work who could see their careers totally destroyed. <br/>\"A writer and an artist and a photographer, even if their work is stolen, they can create new work. If my voice is stolen, if my career is over,\" she said.<br/>AI has great power and is already changing industries and the work place. Last week the OECD said the world was \"on the cusp of an AI revolution\". <br/>The Paris-based body said: \"Urgent action is required to make sure AI is used responsibly and in a trustworthy way in the workplace.\"<br/>With great power comes great responsibility - and it is not yet clear in the UK or internationally - who will or who should take on that responsibility.<br/>A government spokesperson said: \"AI is set to fuel growth and create new highly-paid jobs throughout the UK, while allowing us to carry out our existing jobs more efficiently and safely. <br/>\"That is why we are working with businesses and regulators to ensure AI is used safely and responsibility in business settings.\"<br/>Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>Why some celebrities are embracing AI deepfakes<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

I don't know. I hope not.\"<br/>Harry said he thought there was more to art than how it looked.<br/>\"At the end of the day I think that there's a bigger reason why people are invested in Ketnipz and I don't think it's just the mere aesthetics of it.<br/>\"I think there's a personality behind it that I don't think someone imitating can really tap into.\"<br/>Artist James Lewis, from Cardiff, creates videos of his painting technique for more than seven million followers on TikTok and Instagram. <br/>He has yet to find out if his work has been used by the tools, but said because AI has learned from billions of artworks, it would be hard to trace which artists' works have been used in each image.<br/>\"If there was a way to go back and figure out who inspired this style of image that was generated, I think it would be fair for that artist to receive some sort of compensation,\" he said.<br/>In the meantime he thinks artists should keep being creative.<br/>\"I do have hope that as much as AI art will develop and it'll get better, but it will never be able to capture that true human essence, that true creativity that we have as people,\" he said.<br/>\"You will still need your own creative ideas, your own initiative.\"<br/>For artist and human rights researcher Caroline Sinders, it is for AI companies to address the problem.<br/>She said: \"Part of the argument we hear from companies is, 'we have so much data, it would be impossible for us to tell, like searching for a needle in a haystack'.<br/>\"I would like to say, well, that's a 'you' problem, not a 'me' problem. <br/>\"I have a copyright on the images and I plan to enact my copyright if my images are used without my consent.\"<br/>She said she was also worried about the bias that these tools created and how it meant AI art was not reflecting the real world.<br/>\"Let's say we ask an image generation AI system to generate a doctor assessing care to a family,\" she said.<br/>\"Most likely that doctor will be generated as male and probably as white, and the parent will probably be generated as female.<br/>\"And this is not an example I'm randomly making up. There have been tests done by asking these sort of blanket questions without gender being in the text prompt and, more often than not, it's reflecting these stereotypes.\"<br/>This extends to racial bias and also ableism, said Irene Fubara-Manuel, a lecturer at the University of Sussex.<br/>While they said they were excited about the possibilities provided by generative art, issues such as racial and gender biases in some images created were hard to overcome.<br/>\"I was trying to dye my hair over the summer, and I was just looking up 'people of colour, blonde locks',\" they said.<br/>\"What I got in response was this regal, I would say, fetishised image of black people. You know, chiselled jaw lines, their skin was iridescent.<br/>\"It's like, there are black people who are that beautiful, but the images that you see commonly in a lot of AI are very, very fetishised representations of people. <br/>\"You would not see people who are plus size, or people who have visible disabilities, for instance.\"<br/>Artists are now calling on regulators in the UK and worldwide to take more action to protect artists and the industry.<br/>Irene said artists were not against AI but, \"the argument is against exploitation\".<br/>\"But I'm hopeful that it will contribute to human creativity in general, just like how the creation of computers added more to creativity. I'm excited for its contribution,\" they said.<br/>Caroline said more regulation of the emerging AI industry in the UK would not \"stifle\" innovation.<br/>\"It makes things safer and that's why we have certain laws,\" she said.<br/>\"That's why right now we have seatbelts and airbags for cars and a lot of rules about them. When they were first invented, we didn't have any of that. <br/>\"So it's not at all out of step to sort of ask for, or to create, guardrails and protections.\"<br/>Additional reporting by Lola Mayor.<br/>Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>Elon Musk announces new AI start-up<br/>UK must be more open on use of AI, say campaigners<br/>Watch: What threats does AI pose?<br/>AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?<br/>What is AI and is it dangerous?<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

He added that the existential threat warnings issued by some AI experts relate to systems which don't yet exist.<br/>Meta's decision to make Llama 2 widely available for commercial businesses and researchers to use has divided the tech community. In some ways its hand has already been forced - the first generation, Llama, was leaked online within a week of its launch.<br/>Open-source is a well-trodden path in this sector - opening up your product for others to use gives you an enormous amount of free user testing data, identifying bugs, problems and improvements along the way. <br/>But the risk here is that this is a very powerful tool, whatever Sir Nick might say. <br/>We know previous iterations of chatbots have been manipulated to spout hate speech, generate false information and give harmful instructions. Are the guardrails strong enough for Llama 2 to prevent itself from being misused out in the wild, and what will Meta do if it is?<br/>Another interesting thing to note is Meta's decision to partner with Microsoft on this - Llama 2 will be available and usable via Microsoft platforms such as Azure - as Microsoft has also invested billions of dollars in ChatGPT creator OpenAI. <br/>This is a giant with its sights firmly set on AI, and the deep pockets to buy its way in with the key players. The risk is that the AI pool soon becomes full of a few very large fish - and is that healthy for competition in this still fairly young industry?<br/>Llama 2 marks a partnership between Microsoft and Meta.<br/>Unlike Llama 2, GPT-4 and fellow rival Palm - Google's LLM which powers the Bard chatbot - are not free to use for commercial or research purposes.<br/>It comes a week after US comedian Sarah Silverman announced she is suing both OpenAI and Meta, alleging that her copyright has been infringed in the training of the firms' AI systems.<br/>Dame Wendy Hall, Regents Professor of Computer Science at the University of Southampton, told the BBC that allowing AI to be open-sourced raised concerns around legislation.<br/>\"My worry about open-source is that is how we regulate them,\" she said.<br/>\"Can the industry be trusted to self-regulate, or will they work with the governments to regulate? It's a bit like giving people a template to build a nuclear bomb.\"<br/>Sir Nick said her comments were \"hyperbole\", and clarified that Meta's open-sourced system could not generate images, let alone \"build a bio weapon\".<br/>But he \"strongly agreed\" that AI needed to be regulated.<br/>\"Models are being open-sourced all the time already,\" he said. <br/>\"So it's not really whether open sourcing of these large language models is going to take place, the question is how can you do it as responsibly and safely as possible.<br/>\"I feel I can assert without any fear of contradiction, that the LLMs that we are open-sourcing are safer than any of the other AI LLMs which have been open-sourced.\"<br/>Sarah Silverman sues OpenAI and Meta<br/>AI image creator faces UK and US legal challenges<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

This was a view echoed by film director Christopher Nolan, who told the BBC that AI leaders he spoke to saw the present time \"as their Oppenheimer moment\". J.Robert Oppenheimer played a key role in the development of the first atomic bomb, and is the subject of Mr Nolan's latest film.<br/>But the BCS sees the situation in a more positive light, while still supporting the need for rules around AI.<br/>Richard Carter is a signatory to the BCS letter. Mr Carter, who founded an AI-powered startup cybersecurity business, feels the dire warnings are unrealistic: \"Frankly, this notion that AI is an existential threat to humanity is too far-fetched. We're just not in any kind of a position where that's even feasible\".<br/>Signatories to the BCS letter come from a range of backgrounds - business, academia, public bodies and think tanks, though none are as well known as Elon Musk, or run major AI companies like OpenAI.<br/>Those the BBC has spoken to stress the positive uses of AI. Hema Purohit, who leads on digital health and social care for the BCS, said the technology was enabling new ways to spot serious illness, for example medical systems that detect signs of issues such as cardiac disease or diabetes when a patient goes for an eye test.<br/>She said AI could also help accelerate the testing of new drugs.<br/>Signatory Sarah Burnett, author of a book on AI and business, pointed to agricultural uses of the tech, from robots that use artificial intelligence to pollinate plants to those that \"identify weeds and spray or zap them with lasers, rather than having whole crops sprayed with weed killer\".<br/>The letter argues: \"The UK can help lead the way in setting professional and technical standards in AI roles, supported by a robust code of conduct, international collaboration and fully resourced regulation\".<br/>By doing so, it says Britain \"can become a global byword for high-quality, ethical, inclusive AI\".<br/>In the autumn UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will host a global summit on AI regulation. <br/>While the BCS may argue existential threats are sci-fi, some issues are just over the horizon or are already presenting problems.<br/>It has been predicted that the equivalent of up to 300 million jobs could be automated, and some companies have already said they will pause hiring in some roles as a result of AI.<br/>But Mr Carter thinks AI - rather than replacing humans - will boost their productivity. In his own work he says ChatGPT is useful, but he says he is wary of putting too much trust in it, comparing it to a \"very knowledgeable and a very excitable, 12-year-old\". <br/>He argues companies will always need to have humans involved in the workplace, to take responsibility if things go wrong: \"If you take the human completely out of the loop, how do you manage accountability for some sort of catastrophic event happening?\"<br/>He, like other signatories, believes regulation will be needed to avoid the misuse of AI. <br/>Ms Purohit says a motive for signing was the need for rules to \"make sure that we don't just run off and create lots and lots of things without paying attention to the testing and the governance, and the assurance that sits behind it\".<br/>AI warning: 'Inevitable' jobs will be more automated<br/>Elon Musk announces new AI start-up<br/>Advanced AI risk to humanity - technology leaders<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Even though the experimental period allowed by the law ends in March 2025, they fear the French government's real aim is to make the new security provisions permanent.<br/>\"We've seen this before at previous Olympic Games like in Japan, Brazil and Greece. What were supposed to be special security arrangements for the special circumstances of the games, ended up being normalised,\" says No\u00e9mie Levain, of the digital rights campaign group La Quadrature du Net (Squaring the Web).<br/>A version of the new AI security system is already in place in some police stations around France. One of the pioneers is the southern Paris suburb of Massy.<br/>\"Around the town we have 250 security cameras - far too many for our team of four to monitor,\" says Massy's mayor Nicolas Samsoen.<br/>\"So the AI device monitors all the cameras. And when it sees something it's been told to look out for - like a sudden grouping of people - it raises an alert.<br/>\"It's then up to the humans - the police officers - to examine the situation and see what should be the appropriate action. Maybe it's something serious, maybe it's not.<br/>\"The important thing is that it's humans who make the ultimate decision about how to react - not the computer. The algorithm is empowering humans.<br/>As a test, we abandoned a piece of luggage on the street not far from the police station. Thirty seconds later the alarm was raised and CCTV footage of the suitcase popped up on the control room screen. <br/>Previously of course the algorithm has had to be taught what an abandoned piece of luggage looks like - which is where the AI comes in. The developers have fed the programme a massive bank of different images of lone bags on the street - a bank which continues to grow as more images accumulate.<br/>Crucially though, this \"learning\" process does not happen at the client interface but only in the \"back-office\" at the developers. Massy police station has bought a self-standing product which monitors the cameras, but cannot itself acquire new knowledge.  <br/>Detecting unattended luggage is a relatively easy task. Much harder might be spotting a person on the ground in a crowd; or seeing the lump in a person's clothes that is a concealed weapon; or differentiating between the beginning of a fight and an innocent temporary increase in crowd density. <br/>A French start-up specialising in computer vision software, the XXII group, is waiting for further specifications from the French government before fine-tuning their bid for part of the Olympics video surveillance contract.<br/>\"We expect the government to want the AI to be able to detect fire, fighting, people on the ground and abandoned luggage,\" says XXII's Fran\u00e7ois Mattens. \"But they need to get their act together. <br/>\"In theory the new systems are supposed to be in place for the Rugby World Cup [in France] in September. But that is absolutely out of the question. It is all going to take a lot of time to put in place.\"<br/>Fran\u00e7ois Mattens and other developers are alive to the criticism that they are enabling unacceptable levels of state surveillance. But they insist on the safeguards.<br/>\"We will not - and cannot by law - provide facial recognition, so this is a wholly different operation from what you see in China,\" he says.<br/>\"What makes us attractive is that we provide security, but within the framework of the law and ethics.\"<br/>But according to digital rights activist No\u00e9mie Levain, this is only a \"narrative\" that developers are using to sell their product - knowing full well that the government will almost certainly favour French companies over foreign firms when it comes to awarding the Olympics contracts.<br/>\"They say it makes all the difference that here there will be no facial recognition. We say it is essentially the same,\" she says.<br/>\"AI video monitoring is a surveillance tool which allows the state to analyse our bodies, our behaviour, and decide whether it is normal or suspicious. Even without facial recognition, it enables mass control.<br/>\"We see it as just as scary as what is happening in China. It's the same principle of losing the right to be anonymous, the right to act how we want to act in public, the right not to be watched.\"<br/>This week BBC News is focussing on AI, how the technology affects our lives and what impacts it may have in the near future.<br/>Why making AI safe isn't as easy as you might think<br/>What is AI and is it dangerous?<br/>Police raid Paris 2024 Olympics organisers' office<br/>Sam Altman: OpenAI has no plans to leave Europe<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

In fact, she signed up for it.<br/>\"It's a bit like that Black Mirror episode with Salma Hayek,\" Ms Yeo jokes.<br/>She was speaking to the BBC the day after the release of the new series of Charlie Brooker's Netflix show. In the first episode, actress Salma Hayek, playing a fictionalised version of herself, signs away her image to a production company.<br/>The deal allows it to use an artificial intelligence or AI-generated deepfake version of the Hollywood A-lister to \"star\" in their new TV drama. What she says and does in the show is controlled by the computer.<br/>The consequences for Ms Hayek - without spoiling the story - are not good.<br/>Concerns about the impact of AI are partly behind the first Hollywood actors' strike in more than four decades, bringing the US movie and television business to a halt.<br/>It comes after Screen Actors Guild (SAG-AFTRA) failed to reach an agreement in the US for better protections against the misuse of AI for its members.<br/>The actors' union has warned that \"artificial intelligence poses an existential threat to creative professions\" as it prepared to dig in over the issue.<br/>However, Ms Yeo is not worried. She is one of a growing number of celebrities embracing AI-generated advertising.<br/>The new technology is being met with a mixture of excitement and trepidation.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Singapore celeb Jamie Yeo has embraced AI deepfakes<br/>Ms Yeo has just agreed a deal with financial technology firm Hugosave, which allows it to use a digitally manipulated likeness of her to sell their content.<br/>The process is fairly simple. She spends a couple of hours in front of a green screen to capture her face and movements, then a couple more hours in a recording studio to capture her voice.<br/>An AI programme then synchronises the images with the audio to create a digital alter-ego capable of saying practically anything. The results are uncanny.<br/>\"I do understand the concern, but this technology is here to stay,\" she says. \"So even if you don't embrace it because you're scared, there will be other people who will embrace it.\"<br/>Some already have. As part of his deal with PepsiCo, superstar footballer Lionel Messi allowed it to use a deepfake version of himself to advertise Lay's crisps.<br/>Not only can online users create personalised video messages from \"Lionel Messi\", they can get him to say it in English, Spanish, Portuguese and Turkish.<br/>Fellow football superstar David Beckham and Hollywood legend Bruce Willis have also dabbled with deepfake technology - though, unlike Ms Yeo, they have so far stopped short of signing away full image rights.<br/>\"I think deepfakes will just become part of normal practice in the advertising industry over the next few years,\" says Dr Kirk Plangger, a marketing expert at King's College London.<br/>\"It opens the door to all kinds of creative options. They're able to micro-target consumers and are often extremely persuasive.\"<br/>The efficiency of the process also makes it attractive from a commercial point of view.<br/>\"You're not doing that much work for the money you're charging,\" Ms Yeo says.<br/>\"It's also good for the client on a budget because they get so much more content than from a normal shoot. So it works for everyone.\" <br/>The client - in this case Singapore-based Hugosave - agrees. <br/>\"Having this technology available means we can literally produce hundreds of videos in a matter of days. Compare that to the months, if not years, that we'd need if we were filming the content in the traditional way,\" says Braham Djidjelli, Hugosave's co-founder and chief product officer.<br/>\"We're able to leverage the benefit of AI while also retaining the human touch of a trusted local face - in this case Jamie's.\"<br/>But, as analysts such as Dr Plangger point out, there is a \"dark side\" to the technology. <br/>\"It's not something we can put back into the box,\" he says. \"The advertising industry needs to wake up to the risks as well as the possibilities of artificial intelligence. It means stepping back, as a society, and thinking about what is the proper or ethical use of this technology.\"<br/>One of the things Dr Plangger is referring to is a looming \"crisis of trust\", where consumers cannot tell between what is real or fake. This is something already being exploited by vested interests online and can range from synthetically manipulated pornography to misinformation to political messaging.<br/>This week BBC News is focussing on AI, how the technology affects our lives and what impacts it may have in the near future.<br/>But there are also more practical risks for the talent voluntarily signing up to be deepfaked. Currently, there are no clear laws relating to AI to ensure your image is properly protected.<br/>For example, what happens if a brand uses your digital avatar to endorse a product that may damage your image or your alter-ego makes a joke in poor taste?<br/>\"We are in uncharted territory when it comes to AI and deepfake technology,\" says Tng Sheng Rong, an intellectual property lawyer at Rajah and Tann in Singapore. <br/>\"Many, many issues can arise. Who owns the intellectual property? Who do you go to for legal recourse? The truth of the matter is that the existing laws don't provide a robust enough regulatory framework to guard against these issues.\"<br/>That may be the final hurdle for advertisers before they start buying rights to digital versions of Hollywood A-listers, for example.<br/>At this early stage, Ms Yeo says she is very mindful of the risks, but her decision was informed mainly by trust - both in Hugosave and in the way business is done in Singapore.<br/>But ultimately, she says, it is about staying ahead of the curve.<br/>\"If you want to still be in the game, then you've got to learn how to be in it.

Exactly what you're getting with each box is random. Some compare them to buying a Kinder Egg or a packet of football stickers. Others say it's like using a slot machine.<br/>The UK government has spent three years figuring out what to do about them - from threats to ban their use for under-18s in the UK, to an edict last summer that games companies must create new rules to protect children and young people.<br/>Are they a gateway to gambling addiction? Or just a fun mechanic that enhances players' gaming experiences?<br/>Some countries, like Belgium and the Netherlands, think the former and have banned them.<br/>Last July, then Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries said that because the evidence about loot boxes was still emerging, \"direct government intervention may risk unintended consequences\".<br/>The games industry should come up with measures itself before any new laws are introduced, she said.<br/>It's taken nearly 12 months for those measures to be agreed upon. <br/>Ukie has published principles that it believes will allow the industry to self-regulate the use of loot boxes.<br/>The first is a commitment to make available technological controls to effectively restrict anyone under 18 from acquiring a loot box without the consent or knowledge of a parent or guardian. Many of these controls are already available on games platforms but aren't as widely used as they could be. The new principles set out best-practice for their use in an effort to increase take-up. <br/>The second is to drive awareness of those controls with a public information campaign. An expert panel will be set up to share best practices on age assurance issues.<br/>Ukie says games companies will disclose the presence of loot boxes before someone chooses to buy a title, and games will have to show clear probabilities before the purchase of a loot box.<br/>The plans include rules on how loot boxes should be presented and a commitment to more lenient refund policies. <br/>There is also a proposal to tackle the black market that surrounds these purchases and do more research about their impact and use.<br/>Progress will be reviewed in 12 months.<br/>Some content creators have built careers on making exciting and entertaining videos around the use of loot boxes, and many players enjoy buying them responsibly every day.<br/>These regulations are largely designed to protect children and young people. However, they're not the only people who can develop an unhealthy relationship with the in-game mechanic. For Dave Sproson, buying loot boxes became a problem as an adult. <br/>He first came across one in a mobile game based on his favourite anime show. Soon he was getting frustrated as his progress began to slow, and so started buying boxes as a \"short cut\" to level-up his character.<br/>He would justify the purchases to himself by saying he was spending money to save the time it would take to enhance his characters through gameplay alone. For Mr Sproson, buying a loot box was the \"same feeling as scoring a goal in football\".<br/>\"As with any addiction, there's kind of an invisible line that's hard to pinpoint when I actually crossed it,\" he said.<br/>\"I started to realise that it was getting out of control when I could no longer sustain buying loot boxes with my income. I had to resort to using credit cards, which I'd never had before. I used payday loans. Over a period of 12 months, I had 28 from various different lenders.\"<br/>After a \u00a310,000 loan, he was struggling to keep his problem hidden. \"I started defaulting on loans. I forged my partner's signature to get a guarantee for a new loan.\"<br/>Mr Sproson's partner found out about his financial troubles with their baby due in a matter of weeks. Money earmarked for a new house and pushchairs was spent on clearing up the debt.<br/>\"We had to go to family and tell them what had happened to ask for help,\" he said. \"All along this journey there were times I lay in bed at night and I cried. I knew I had a son coming, I knew my partner wanted us to go for a house and I knew my credit score was in the toilet and I knew I'd gone too far.<br/>\"I was disgusted with myself, I was terrified. I didn't know if I would be around my son when he was born, whether I would be allowed? Worse than how I was feeling was how it made her feel - this was someone who trusted me unconditionally with money, with love and everything else and I'd betrayed it all.\"<br/>The vast majority of people who buy loot boxes in games don't end up with a compulsion like this. For many it is a fun and frivolous element of their gaming experience.  However cases like it, accompanied with criticism that some games have become \"pay-to-win\" and concerns over the addictive nature of the mechanic, were the basis of the government wanting action.<br/>By 2025, loot boxes will be responsible for generating an estimated $16bn in revenue for games companies across the world.<br/>Getting the balance right between protecting vulnerable users and allowing games companies the freedom to flourish culturally and economically has clearly been difficult. Given the length of time it has taken for any action, it is clear that the industry and the government have had different ideas about what should be done. <br/>In a statement, John Whittingdale, minister for the creative industries, said: \"We've been clear the video games industry needs to do more to protect children and adults from the harms associated with loot boxes. <br/>\"These new principles are a big step forward to make sure players can enjoy video games responsibly and safely. I look forward to seeing games companies put the plans into action and will be watching their progress closely.\"<br/>Mr Sproson now works as head of safer gambling in a risk management company. He and his partner reconciled and are now married - they have strict rules to restrict his spending. He bought his last loot box in July 2014.<br/>\"I'm still a big gaming fan and I still play now - with my eight-year-old son. But I make sure we play games where I can disable purchases. In my opinion you need to classify loot boxes as gambling. If you look at a loot box and look at a slot machine, there's no real difference.\"<br/>For more gaming content, go to Press X to Continue, the BBC Sounds gaming Podcast.<br/>Government says loot boxes will not be regulated<br/>Report blasts \"manipulative\" video game loot boxes<br/>In-game loot boxes linked to problem gambling<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

The price paid was not made public.<br/>DeepMind is developing a program called AlphaFold, which has the potential to advance the discovery of new medicines by predicting the structure of almost every protein in the human body.<br/>An earlier DeepMind product called AlphaGo beat the top human player of the Chinese strategy game Go, Lee Se-dol, 4-1 in a tournament held in 2016.<br/>He later retired from the game, saying \"there is an entity that cannot be defeated\". <br/>It was considered at the time to be a major breakthrough for artificial intelligence.<br/>Mustafa Suleyman's views represent one of the challenges facing Ian Hogarth, a British entrepreneur and investor who has been appointed to lead the UK's AI taskforce. <br/>He took up the position five weeks ago.<br/>In his first interview since getting the job, Mr Hogarth told the BBC that while the UK was a good place for start-ups, it should also be easier for them to grow.<br/>\"We've had some great [tech] companies and some of them got bought early, you know - Skype got bought by eBay, DeepMind got bought by Google.<br/>\"I think really our ecosystem needs to rise to the next level of the challenge.\"<br/>This week BBC News is focussing on AI, how the technology affects our lives and what impacts it may have in the near future.<br/>It's a view I hear often from small tech firms - they aim to be bought up by a US tech giant, rather than become a giant themselves.<br/>Emma McClenaghan and her partner Matt run an award-winning AI start-up in Northern Ireland but they struggle to access the infrastructure they need to advance their product.<br/>The week Emma contacted me, she said Twitter owner Elon Musk had purchased 10,000 specialised chips called GPUs, needed to build and train AI tools - and she had been waiting five months for a grant to buy one.<br/>\"That's the difference between us and them because it's going to take us, you know, four to seven days to train a model and if he's [able to] do it in minutes, then you know, we're never going to catch up,\" she said.<br/>Ian Hogarth thinks perhaps a future solution is for countries, rather than companies, to own this infrastructure.<br/>\"It is going to be a fundamental building block for the next generation of innovation,\" he said.<br/>Follow Zoe Kleinman on Twitter @zsk<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Big tech was going to supercharge agriculture, one of the oldest industries in the world, and the revolution would start with salad leaves.<br/>Warehouse-grown greens, flourishing in trays neatly stacked beneath row upon row of glowing LEDs. It was lettuce - but sci-fi.<br/>US-based AeroFarms considered itself to be one of the leaders in the industry.<br/>\"We are so far above everybody else in this technology,\" AeroFarms' chief executive David Rosenberg boasted to the New Yorker in 2017. \"It will take years for the rest of the world to catch up.\"<br/>Hard times caught up with AeroFarms instead. In June, the firm filed for bankruptcy protection in the US and Mr Rosenberg stepped down.<br/>It is all part of a \"reset\" or \"pivot\", insists co-founder and chief marketing officer Marc Oshima: \"We're growing product every day, we're shipping product every day.\"<br/>But lately, AeroFarms has struggled to find enough capital to fuel its soaring ambition. \"The money just has not been there,\" admits Mr Oshima, though he adds that the firm still has some investors who are supplying \"millions of dollars\". <br/>AeroFarms famously designed its own indoor growing systems. \"We think it has served us well, we have unique technology,\" adds Mr Oshima.<br/>When asked whether initiatives, such as one targeting low income communities in Jersey City, New Jersey, will continue, he adds that these are currently \"being evaluated\".<br/>A spokeswoman for Jersey City says, \"We do not anticipate our operations to be interrupted in any way.\"<br/>A long list of other vertical farms have run into trouble in recent months.<br/>French firm Agricool went into receivership earlier this year, Pennsylvania-based Fifth Season shut down in late 2022, Iron Ox of California has laid off nearly half its workforce and Infarm has closed its operations in Europe - making 500 staff redundant.<br/>\"Infarm has decided to shift its geographical focus from Europe to high-potential regions better suited for indoor farming, with low energy prices and healthy market demand,\" the company says in a statement.<br/>Besides the major economic challenges that have hampered many industries during the last few years, within vertical farming a debate rages over the extent to which some companies may have set themselves up for a fall.<br/>\"My opinion is that we'll continue to see failures. It is bad,\" says Andrew Lloyd, chief operating officer at Intelligent Growth Solutions, which makes equipment for vertical farms. \"Many people are growing the wrong crops, they're very heavily focused on leafy greens.\"<br/>He also argues that some have foolishly attempted to design and build their own technology - such as robots that tend to the baby plants as they develop. <br/>That might sound like too easy a riposte for someone who sells such technology himself but Mr Lloyd does make a good point, says Mark Lefsrud at McGill University in Canada, who consults for the industry.<br/>\"I've seen to the extreme where one company redeveloped their own pipe,\" he says. \"Literally just a plastic pipe to transfer water through.<br/>\"I was like, 'I think the pipe has been developed'.\"<br/>What people don't often hear about vertical farming, though, is how an ability to care for plants, regardless of what technology you use, really matters, adds Mr Lefsrud.<br/>He says he has occasionally been called in by firms fretting over copious trays of crops that have started to die.<br/>\"You need somebody who's going to be full-time,\" he has told them, explaining that farming means giving constant attention to living things - not just firing up a few gadgets and waiting for the profits to roll in argues Mr Lefsrud.<br/>\"You have to be growing them properly all the time. You can't go, 'I'm not gonna work this weekend because I want to have a party' - and all the plants die on you. Which I've seen repetitively,\" he says.<br/>The industry has been blighted by \"hubris\", argues Chris Davies, chief executive and founder of Harvest London, which plans to open a new vertical farm in Beddington next year. The firm grows salad for companies including HSBC and Google.<br/>Mr Davies says he and his colleagues are trying to be cautious. For one thing, their new facility will be built near to a power-generating waste incinerator so that they can take advantage of cheap energy when it is available.<br/>\"Let's say we know that an hour from now power pricing is going to go up, we can just turn out the lights,\" he says. <br/>The firm has also successfully grown tomatoes, cucumbers and strawberries at a small scale and hopes to diversify its product line in the near future with these potentially higher value crops.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>It can be tricky to expand beyond growing just a few varieties of easy leafy greens, says David Meszaros, founder of Smartkas, a Dutch agricultural technology firm that owns the largest vertical farm in the UK - a 27,000 sq m facility in Harlow, Essex dedicated to growing strawberries.<br/>Dr Meszaros stresses that Smartkas operates a range of growing environments, including greenhouses, meaning the firm has not put all its eggs in the vertical farming basket alone. <br/>His company has still faced plenty of headaches lately, though. \"The big challenge came with the chip shortage,\" says Dr Meszaros, explaining how growing at one newly built facility was delayed by many months because Smartkas could not obtain the chips it required for the safety systems in robots tasked with moving around trays of plants.<br/>Without those chips, the robots would not have been able to detect collisions in the warehouse or dangerous levels of water or humidity, for example. <br/>Despite pitfalls, vertical farming still has a future, say many observers - even those who are critical of some business models. <br/>Growing more food indoors, and in urban places, is a matter of \"security\" says Paul Myers, managing director at Farm Urban, which is based in Liverpool. He mentions the veg shortage that hit British supermarkets earlier this year.<br/>\"What that highlights is that, actually, the UK should be investing in long-term solutions,\" he says.<br/>Britain is \"exposed\" to supply issues, agrees Jessica Davies at Lancaster University. She and colleagues published a study last year that suggested urban farming, including vertical farming, could boost agricultural production.<br/>For Mark Lefsrud, the vertical farming businesses falling by the wayside do not represent a death knell. Rather, they are a sign that the industry is maturing as the truly hardy growers emerge.<br/>\"It's a pruning that's required,\" he says. \"We do it to plants, so it makes sense to do it with businesses, too.\"<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

If a child successfully found a Pok\u00e9mon then a computerised animation of the creature would appear on their handset's screen, superimposed on top of the actual view through the phone's camera.<br/>It proved irresistible to millions and millions of young users. But are adults equally impressed by the use of AR?<br/>Since Pok\u00e9mon Go's success, a growing number of consumer brands are continuing to embrace AR, such as Coca-Cola and US whiskey Jack Daniels. You use your phone camera to scan a QR code on the can or bottle label, and an animation or video pops up on your screen.<br/>Does this use of AR remain a novelty, a gimmick that most people ignore, or does it actually increase consumer engagement and sales?<br/>In 2021, US soft drink firm Jones Soda introduced its first AR campaign, which it called Reel Labels. If you scan an image on the bottle labels then it transforms into a short video.<br/>To create the videos the firm partnered with an initial 15 so-called influencers, including a skateboarder, a breakdancer, and a BMX bike rider. Since then the firm's customers have been able to send in their own videos to be featured. <br/>And last year Jones Soda worked with music labels Sub Pop and Hardly Art to promote videos from more than a dozen new bands.<br/>\"A brand's packaging is so much more than a container for a product,\" says Bohb Blair, Jones Soda's chief marketing officer. \"It's now an opportunity to make a consumer's moment with your product special.<br/>\"Content is a great way to do that, and AR is a fun and convenient distribution vehicle.\"<br/>Another drinks business that has used AR to connect with the music industry is Estonian milk brand Tere Piim. In 2019 it joined with the Eurovision Song Contest to enable customers to see mini digital animations of that year's entrants perform on their kitchen counters and tables. All they had to do was scan a label on the milk cartons.<br/>The AR technology was provided by Latvian software firm Overly. \"Although you may doubt the compatibility at first glance, milk and a song contest make a good cross-marketing duo,\" says Overly's chief executive Ainars Klavins.<br/>\"In this instance, a traditional milk carton became a new medium for broadcasting Eurovision songs. It inspired consumers who may not be existing viewers to explore the contestant line-up and choose their favourites.\"<br/>New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.<br/>He adds that consumers, especially younger ones, are ready to engage with brands \"in the augmented reality realm\".<br/>While you'd expect those involved in helping firms create AR to sing its praises, what do independent experts think?<br/>Stuart Duff is a leading business psychologist, who studies how firms can best connect with consumers. He says that AR can help products seem more \"interesting, engaging and memorable\".<br/>\"Research has highlighted that using AR not only captures our attention more quickly but also increases the likelihood of committing information to memory. So while AR may seem like a gimmick, it offers a genuine alternative approach to lodging brands in our psyche.\"<br/>Jenny Stanley is managing director of Appetite Creative, a Madrid-based tech and marketing firm that helps consumer businesses create AR labels.<br/>She says that a product's label is already an example of \"extremely targeted marketing\", whose effectiveness only increases further when AR content is added.<br/>\"It's not only impactful, but also cost effective. The average cost per digital advertising click is \u00a31.50, whereas a click or scan on packaging is technically free, giving brands a compelling reason to use connected packaging.\"<br/>Yet, as Mr Klavins of Overly cautions, content is key. And by that he means that what the AR offers has to be interesting and engaging.<br/>\"The key point here is that quality content for augmented reality is vital. I always say that AR content should either inspire, educate or entertain. It has to do at least one of those things to transform from a novelty tech into a strategic tool that drives business value.\"<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

That creates a force - called the Lorentz force - which acts on the sea water and propels the craft along.<br/>Without propellers or a drive shaft churning up the water, a working MHD drive could provide fast and completely silent travel.<br/>Engineers have been working on MHD drives for decades and the original concept dates back to the 1960s.<br/>In 1992, the Japanese Ship and Ocean Foundation built Yamato-1, a 30m-long ship that tested a MHD drive.<br/>However, the drive was so heavy that the Yamato-1 could only manage to plod along at a speed of 6.6 knots. It also used up a lot of energy.<br/>But researchers say the project proved such a drive could work and provided useful data.<br/>\"Authentic information on defects and weak points, together with what should be made... when we carry out a Yamato-2 in the future,\" says Hiromitsu Kitagawa, visiting research fellow at the Ocean Policy Research Institute, of which the Japanese Ship and Ocean Foundation is now part.<br/>The Yamato project showed that much more powerful magnets would be needed, plus more robust electrodes - the parts of the drive which make contact with the water.<br/>According to Ms Swithenbank, the first of these problems may well be easily solvable now, with a new generation of magnets, developed by the nuclear fusion industry.<br/>Fusion is the reaction which powers stars. But to make it happen here on earth often requires extremely powerful magnets to contain swirling clouds of burning hot plasma.<br/>The force generated by these new magnets has been likened to double the pressure at the bottom of the deepest ocean trench.<br/>While more powerful magnets are now available, the second problem, how to protect the electrodes, still needs work.<br/>Metal corrodes when placed in seawater and an electrical current accelerates that process. Some types of magnetic field have the same corrosive effect.<br/>On the Yamato-1 it was found that electrodes were losing around 3% of their mass per year.<br/>Jeffrey Long, a research chemist at the US Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), is a battery specialist, and is expecting to take part in the Darpa programme, along with colleague Zachary Neale.<br/>\"If you have ever placed paper clips in a cup of salt water connected to a 9-volt battery, you'd notice the water turns colour because the metal is corroding,\" he says.<br/>\"Essentially, we want electrodes that don't corrode, while still supporting the high electrical current density required for effective operation.\"<br/>However, improvements in coatings by the fuel cell and battery industries in recent years mean this problem may well now be solvable.<br/>While these are important advances, other problems remain.<br/>Passing a current across seawater breaks the hydrogen-oxygen bond, creating gas bubbles on the electrodes which creates resistance and reduces the efficiency of the MHD.<br/>Potential solutions will have to be tested, including gas-diffusing electrodes created by the fuel cell industry. Other techniques sweep away the bubbles before they build up.<br/>Finally, there's the issue of erosion, with collapsing bubbles creating pitting. \"It's like having sandpaper on your electrode,\" says Ms Swithenbank. Here too, though, work in other industries is showing promise.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>If the Darpa team can overcome the problems, the advantages will be enormous.<br/>Without moving parts, MHD drives should need much less maintenance than existing propulsion systems.<br/>\"But the real reason everybody's interested in it is that, because there's no moving parts, it's also much quieter,\" says Ms Swithenbank. \"There's no question that for national defence, that's a huge advantage.\"<br/>A quiet system, without dangerous propellers thrashing around, could be better for wildlife as well.<br/>Work on the project will begin in earnest next spring, with a two-year programme to develop materials - in particular, electrode materials - followed by an 18-month period to design, manufacture and test the drive. <br/>The aim is to produce a prototype MHD drive that could propel a small ship, but that could be scaled up to propel a container ship or a military vessel. <br/>The drive would also have to demonstrate an energy efficiency that could match existing propeller systems.<br/>\"Do I see this being used in commercial ships in the next five years? No. But it's absolutely possible in the future,\" say Ms Swithenbank.<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

I have never seen anything so horrible and bleak in my life,\" said Stephen Brotherstone.<br/>He and David Lawrence are the authors of Scarred for Life - a series of books looking at the impact of 70s and 80s pop culture.<br/>Both vividly remember the film, with Brotherstone admitting he only managed to watch the first half when it was broadcast as it \"wrecked\" his head.<br/>However, he finally saw the full movie when it was repeated - and it has stayed with him ever since.<br/>\"I can still remember lying in bed in my bedroom and you can kind of see the next street on from my mum and dad's and it was almost like an overlaid image of blasted houses and rubble, because it affected me that much.\"<br/>Reece Dinsdale, who played central character Jimmy in the film, said it had \"looked really special\" when he read the script, largely because he admired the work of writer Hines.<br/>However, the Normanton-born actor, who was shortly to star in sitcom Home to Roost with John Thaw, had no idea of the drama's impact.<br/>\"We said 'wow if we can pull this off it'll be great,' but I didn't have a clue that it held that much of a punch.\"<br/>The film was shot on location in Sheffield and, after it was completed, 500 guests were attended a special screening in the city.<br/>\"There was complete silence and all you could hear was various people sobbing around the room,\" the actor recalled.<br/>\"People blame me to this day for scarring them for life. <br/>\"People say it is the most scary thing they've ever seen in their life and remains so to this day.\"<br/>Threads was made and shown in an era of heightened tension between the West and the then USSR.<br/>Lawrence and Brotherstone are currently working on a third volume of their series, which looks at the Cold War and includes a chapter on Threads.<br/>\"I think '83, '84 was the peak of Cold War paranoia in the 80s,\" said Lawrence.<br/>\"You've got nuclear war mentioned in a million pop songs, you've got it on TV, in your comics, and then Threads comes on and there's every nightmare you've ever had on screen.\"<br/>Brotherstone remembers feeling convinced he would not live to see 1990.<br/>\"It wasn't a question of if they pressed the button, but when are they going to press the button,\" he said.<br/>Jimmy, played by Dinsdale, and Ruth, played by Karen Meagher, have just learnt that Ruth is expecting a baby as the film opens.<br/>The growing tensions between East and West appear on TV and newspapers as Sheffield's residents go about their daily lives, ignoring the looming threat.<br/>\"There's the build-up to war, but you don't see it you, just hear about it in the background as they are discussing what to have for tea,\" Lawrence said.<br/>\"They are so wrapped up in their own lives, that is very powerful I think.\"<br/>For Dinsdale, it was a \"fantastic\" piece of writing by Hines.<br/>\"They are everyman and everywoman, they are just normal people with normal lives, there's nothing special about them and this very special event happens to them and it just draws you in.\"<br/>Brotherstone said director Jackson had initially thought of using the cast of Coronation Street.<br/>\"Until it was pointed out to him that it would be massively distracting to watch Deirdre Barlow get blown up,\" he said.<br/>\"It is very 70s, 80s Play for Today, but I think it works in its favour because it was so British.<br/>\"That was a house that looked like mine, there's Woolworths getting vaporised, it really struck home.\"<br/>The final parts of the film follow the characters as they struggle through the nuclear winter in the aftermath of the blasts.<br/>\"It is watching everyone die and it is watching society collapse forever. <br/>\"It makes the point we are never coming back as a society, language is gone, skills are gone, we are just in rags grunting at each other,\" Brotherstone said.<br/>For the actors and crew it was \"a ball\" to make, according to Dinsdale.<br/>\"We had the biggest laugh I remember, it was one of the happiest crews ever.\"<br/>To him though, Threads remains a \"seminal\" piece of television which still resonates with audiences.<br/>\"It was one of the most outstanding pieces of work the BBC has ever created,\" he said.<br/>\"It is so grim and gruesome and so truthful and real and so horrific.<br/>\"I am very proud of it.\"<br/>Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Shells struck the house, she says.<br/>There's emotion in her voice as she explains what the building used to be like. <br/>An old photo she sends via WhatsApp shows a large property with balconies and a pond in the front garden. Images taken after the attack capture the soot-stained, crumbling walls left by the assault.<br/>But Mrs Pylypenko and her family now have a new home in the garden of their old one - a factory-made house that was assembled in just a few days last autumn.<br/>The building, a donation to the family, was one of the first homes of its kind built by Ukrainian firm HOMErs, which says its designs could benefit millions of refugees and people still in Ukraine who have lost their properties in the conflict. <br/>HOMErs, previously known as Tera Monada, has a range of modular houses, made from standardised factory-made units that slot together quickly to achieve the desired final design. <br/>Given the extent of damage in Ukraine, any reconstruction efforts will have to be both fast and cost-effective. In March, the World Bank estimated that it could take $411bn (\u00a3323bn) to rebuild the country. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has, in the past, put the figure at $1tn.<br/>\"There are about 200 destroyed houses in my community,\" says Mrs Pylypenko. \"Modular houses are absolutely important for us.\"<br/>Her new property is significantly smaller than her old one, she notes. But it is the only such building in her village and accommodates six, including Mrs Pylypenko's 10-month old granddaughter. Her daughter, who was pregnant at the time of the Russian attack on the village last year, was brought to Poland by volunteers where she gave birth.<br/>Lots of Ukrainians, sadly, know this predicament, says HOMErs co-founder Alex Stepura.<br/>\"In our own company, so many of our people lost their accommodations, their houses, their apartments,\" he says, pointing out how makeshift shipping container homes have become a common sight in the country during the past year or so.<br/>In order to provide a more appropriate solution, Mr Stepura and his colleagues have developed modular homes that are comprised of multiple three-by-three metre units. An entire house as well as furniture and white goods can be flat-packed and loaded on a single lorry, he says.<br/>To date, the company has supplied around 50 homes to families in Ukraine, a spokesman for HOMErs says. In a video shared by the firm, factory workers slot a wall section into a foundation piece and rotate a lever downwards, locking the two tightly together, demonstrating the ease of construction.<br/>HOMErs' Kyiv factory is currently producing around 10 homes per month, according to Mr Stepura's business partner Chris Baxter, a British investor. But the pair are hoping to raise roughly \u20ac5m (\u00a34.2m) to build a new factory in Slovakia, which would boost production to a couple of hundred homes per month, or so.<br/>Mr Stepura has decades of experience in engineering and robotics. His companies produce vending machines and drones, for example. Some of those drones are currently deployed on reconnaissance missions for the Ukrainian military, he adds.<br/>The modular homes should be high-tech but also intuitive and easy to use - the architectural equivalent of a new smartphone, he suggests.<br/>It must be said that there's nothing new about this idea. Modular homes been around for decades and many companies, including Ikea, have invested in the concept. Mr Baxter argues that the HOMErs modules will attain a good balance of quality and affordability. <br/>One grid-connected, fully furnished, three-module home costs $18,000 (\u00a314,000), with additional modules priced at $6,000. The designs might offer a good solution for Ukrainian refugees currently living abroad who hope one day to return home, suggests Mr Baxter.<br/>\"Those houses can be packed up and moved together with the people to repopulate the country as quickly as possible without having to wait for all of this construction to take place,\" he says.<br/>Such a thing is possible in theory, though \"little tested\" says Gemma Burgess at the Cambridge Centre for Housing and Planning Research.<br/>That said, rebuilding towns and cities with modular properties could be a smart way to go, she adds.<br/>\"In Ukraine, if you're trying to build large volumes of housing, it might be a much cheaper, more efficient way to do it.\"<br/>There are other ventures in Ukraine using the latest technology to help communities rebuild after shelling or missile strikes. Take the 3D-printed school in Lviv, which is currently undergoing a second phase of construction. Or the prefabricated concrete building panels developed by Ukrainian firm Well-being ConTech.<br/>All such efforts ought to avoid repeating the rush to build properties - often of low standard - that followed the Second World War in countries including the UK, adds Dr Burgess: \"Quality and sustainability is going to be key.\"<br/>More technology of business:<br/>Mr Stepura emphasises his commitment to high quality design and accurate manufacturing. Mr Baxter is taking delivery of one of the modular homes himself, where he will live while his UK house is renovated in the coming months. He points out that his version will come with pre-installed solar panels on the roof. <br/>The modular homes also feature 200mm-thick insulation in their walls - roughly twice the UK standard.<br/>Mrs Pylypenko praises the facilities that came with her new house: an electric stove, a fridge, dishwasher and washing machine. And although the house is small - there are bunk beds for the adults, as well as a cot for the baby - it is a big step up from living in the damaged basement of her former house, a situation she had endured for months.<br/>\"We didn't know how to live,\" she says. Even now, life remains very hard. Every day, through the window of her modular house, Mrs Pylypenko sees the charred remnants of her old Ukrainian villa - a tattered ruin that was once her home.<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

But Mr Namasivayasivam recently divulged his blunder to dozens of people at an event in Toronto, Canada.<br/>His mistake seven years ago involved his work trying to ensure that when bands and solo artists submitted 10-second long, looping videos to accompany their songs, they would play smoothly on people's mobile phones.<br/>At the time the videos were being trialled in Canada.<br/>They should have been streamed to users' handsets just the one time, but due to Mr Namasivayasivam's error they were constantly re-downloaded onto people's phones every 10 seconds.  <br/>For those not connected to wi-fi, it quickly used up all their data.<br/>Mr Namasivayasivam only became aware of the mistake when he read complaints on an online forum. One person had written that it had \"killed his data\".<br/>Another said: \"I hate this feature so much. Whoever came up with this, should be fired and shot.\"<br/>While most of us might have wanted to keep such memories locked away, Mr Namasivayasivam revealed all into a microphone while standing on a stage in front of room full of strangers.<br/>The gathering was part of a global movement, with more than 250 cities now participating in public showcases of how entrepreneurs and other business leaders, mainly in the tech space, fail and then recover from their gaffes.<br/>The idea is that it is cathartic to talk about such things, and everyone in attendance can learn from the mistakes, and ask questions.<br/>Mr Namasivayasivam told the crowd in Toronto: \"It was at this moment that I messed up, and this is where the feelings of imposter syndrome and anxiety and shame came flooding in.\"<br/>He was one of three speakers at the event. Afterwards he told the BBC that it felt good to share his face-palm moment, \"and how someone can bounce back from that embarrassment\".<br/>Today Mr Namasivayasivam is the founder and chief executive of Skillify, a Toronto-based provider of software coding training.<br/>Bill Murray (not the famous actor), works for Canadian software firm Padiem, which makes systems that enable firms to handle timesheets and wages.<br/>He was in the audience watching Mr Namasivayasivam, and says that the story particularly resonated with him. <br/>\"If you've never made any mistakes as a coder, you probably weren't innovating enough,\" says Mr Murray.<br/>\"Most people want to hide their embarrassing moments or failures, but because the speakers open the floor with some of their toughest moments, it sets the stage for everyone attending to let their guard down and really get to know one another.\"<br/>Tech entrepreneurs shouldn't only celebrate their wins, Mr Murray adds. \"When you study someone's success, it's almost like asking them what lottery numbers they played to win.<br/>\"Of course you can learn lots from successful people, but to me the concept of openly talking about your failures felt like there was much more to learn from.\"<br/>Marsha Druker, who organises the regular failure talks in Toronto, says she looks for speakers willing to not just be open about their professional failure story.<br/>Instead she also wants them \"to tell audiences about what they learned about that mistake, now that they have had time to reflect on it\".<br/>She says a common theme to what tech entrepreneurs face when they fail is \"a story of resilience and coming out at the other side, and recognising that failure shouldn't be a taboo topic we don't talk about openly\".<br/>Venturing into that often off-limits topic is the reason why such celebrations of failure began in Mexico City in 2012, says Carlos Zimbr\u00f3n, a Mexican tech entrepreneur who first came up with the idea for the evenings.<br/>During a barbeque at home with other friends, Mr Zimbr\u00f3n says he expressed how boring it was to attend \"typical conference with keynote speakers talking about their successes, and how it was rare to hear the B-side of that story\".<br/>Soon after, he and his friends held the first failure talk in the same backyard space.<br/>As word spread about the Mexico City event, other entrepreneurs in cities in 80 countries around the world have since started their own parallel nights. They hold monthly talks, coupled with a Q&A session after each speaker.<br/>Mr Zimbron says that the talks, many of which are later uploaded to YouTube, \"can be inspiring for people who may have gone through the same problems\".<br/>He adds: \"When you can connect to someone else's mistakes, and can see how vulnerable they are in sharing that story, that's where you can connect with other entrepreneurs.\"<br/>New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.<br/>Leah Edwards, is both a director at US investment fund Lighter Capital, and a lecturer on leadership and innovation at University of California, Berkeley.<br/>She says she loves that these public talks about business failure are \"normalizing the fact that something is hard, and that it takes a number of at-bats [a baseball term for a batter's turn] in order to find the right combination of teams and market opportunity, and the right product or service\".<br/>Ms Edwards adds Silicon Valley has long had a high tolerance for start-ups not succeeding, and that it is good to see this spreading.<br/>\"There will always be entrepreneurs whose companies don't work out in the end, but they pick themselves back up and try again,\" she says. \"I'm excited to see this recognition of that kind of resilience spreading into other geographies and cultures.\"<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

It rattled me, there was a lot of swearing and finger pointing. But it was very well done. It was uncomfortable in a good way.\" <br/>The play, called Smile, was about the life of legendary Dundee United manager Jim McLean. <br/>Ms Doyle had been expecting a conventional performance of a play featuring the blunt-spoken manager when she arrived at the Dundee Repertory earlier this year. <br/>Before the curtain rose she accepted an invite to a section of the foyer where VR headsets were on offer to curious theatre-goers.<br/>The intense preview sequence came from Box Office VR, a firm founded by Kelman and Gemma Greig-Kicks of Box Office VR.<br/>Having spent careers in film-making and touring theatre, the husband and wife team, hope that VR can extend the reach of theatre to untapped audiences.<br/>Anyone who wants to use the service would have to buy their own headset, but Box Office VR is designed to work on cheap systems like Google Cardboard VR Glasses. <br/>To watch a show the customer has to insert their phone into the VR device.<br/>Once the phone is place, the users strap the box, effectively a pair of cardboard goggles, around their head and plug in their own headphones. <br/>The app then streams a recorded performance to the phone, which the VR headset amplifies, taking the viewer into a 180 degree view of the stage and auditorium. <br/>It is aimed at anyone who might not think of visiting the theatre, or who cannot physically reach a venue. <br/>So far that's a small audience. Around a 100 people have downloaded a show through Box Office VR.<br/>Ms Greig-Kicks admits that Box Office VR is \"a passion project\" for her and her husband.<br/>Yet she says the potential is real. \"It means they can host shows that wouldn't otherwise be able to tour due to size or cost.\" <br/>Box Office VR has filmed other productions, including one for London's Sadler's Wells dance theatre which has a Digital Stage label for its own online repertoire. <br/>Other established names such as the York Theatre Royal have also experimented with making shows available via VR headsets.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>While an interesting use case for virtual reality, it's not going to make much of a dent in the billions of dollars invested in VR by technology giants like Meta (the owner of Facebook) and more recently Apple, which launched its VR system in June.<br/>But for cash-strapped regional theatre any exposure or extra revenue is welcome. <br/>The technology is also an exciting way to introduce schoolchildren to theatre.<br/>Lisa Kilbride teaches drama at Monifieth High School in Dundee and has harnessed Box Office VR for her mission to spread a love of theatre. <br/>The school has a large rural catchment area, meaning some pupils have to travel in for nearly an hour by bus. So bolting on a trip to see a play in the evening creates problems for pupils with a far-flung home to return to. <br/>Her drama teaching covers much more than acting. Ms Kilbride's pupils are studying for Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) exams and picking up skills needed in theatre directing, lighting or sound. <br/>The VR headset sparked excitement in her 12 and 13 year old SQA students. No-one turned down the chance to pull on the simple goggles. <br/>She is sure they're a valuable addition to her teaching toolkit and uses them to lure reluctant theatre-goers into a whole new experience. <br/>\"It's easy to pause and rewind the action and all of the kids talked about the lighting, the sound, the set.\"<br/>Sharing the thrill of theatre means everything to Ms Kilbride. \"If one child says 'I want to go to the theatre' after using the headset then I'm happy.\"<br/>The action on stage unfolds in front of the viewer, but the VR goggles also let them look about the theatre. <br/>Ms Kilbride wanted her students to become familiar with a whole world surrounding the stage, one they had never visited.  <br/>When she asked her students why they were tilting their heads up and around they explained they were glancing at the theatre itself. They had never seen anything like the interior of the Dundee Rep before. <br/>Liam Sinclair, business manager at the Dundee Rep, knows about the impact an early encounter with theatre can have. He owes his career to \"a brilliant drama teacher at school\" who left him intrigued by the whole question of how theatre works. <br/>Mr Sinclair explains how Smile brought a new audience, who loved both football and the Dundee United team, to his venue. <br/>And Box Office VR made a huge impression on the late manager's living relatives. <br/>\"We did this film version of it with Box Office VR and created the sample sessions using VR goggles. Jim's family came to the press night of the show and got really involved, putting the googles on. When they watched the VR they teared up. It was really like Jim was present and in the room.\" <br/>He realised that in this case technology had triggered deeper emotions than a stage performance. \"VR is a very personal experience as opposed to theatre, which is communal.\" <br/>Ms Doyle confirms this take on her memorable night out. \"Once you're sworn at by Jim McLean you stay sworn at!\"<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

He has also made lots of controversial comments, and when you have a bit of loose cannon like that, they could bring you into disrepute, even though it's not intentional.<br/>\"That risk has to be very closely managed because it might come with a financial cost. If the returns on the account do not justify the costs, then the bank will see no point in carrying on the relationship.\" <br/>The report stated that Coutts had been happy to carry on banking Mr Farage while he had a mortgage with them, but once he had paid it off they planned to terminate the relationship.<br/>However, Angela Knight, former chief executive of the British Bankers' Association, told the BBC's Today programme she found what had happened to the firmer United Kingdom Independence Party leader \"somewhat uncomfortable\".<br/>\"It is somewhat uncomfortable to see a situation arise where because of somebody's legitimate views, even though you don't agree with them, it somehow has resulted in a service being withdrawn and they are not being told about it.\"<br/>She added: \"In this instance what seems to have happened is nothing was really said to the individual concerned and then when they put in an application [to the bank to see the evidence] they suddenly find that there's a whole series of reasons which seems to centre around what they have said.\" <br/>On Thursday Mr Farage welcomed reports of a government crackdown, saying closing bank accounts for political reasons could stop people from going into public life.<br/>\"Refusal to open [accounts] and closures have happened to several members of my family... Which is perhaps, above all, what has made me angry, really angry and motivated me to [speak out].\"<br/>On Wednesdday Prime Minister Rishi Sunak tweeted that shutting someone's account over their views was \"wrong\", calling free speech the \"cornerstone of our democracy\". <br/>Meanwhile, Home Secretary Suella Braverman said elsewhere that the Coutts row \"exposes the sinister nature of much of the diversity, equity and inclusion industry\".<br/>The BBC had previously reported Mr Farage had fallen below the financial threshold needed for an account at Coutts, citing a source familiar with the move.<br/>The former politician accused the broadcaster of falling for \"spin\" and restated that he had been targeted for his political views.<br/>He cited the report by the bank's reputational risk committee which states that the Brexiteer's views did not \"align with our values\".<br/>\"Apparently, I'm a risk to them. I have virtually no links of any kind to Russia whatsoever. This is political. There is no other way of looking at it,\" he said.<br/>He later told BBC Newsnight he was \"literally shocked\" when he saw the report, which he described as a \"personal hit job\". \"This bank is behaving now like a political campaigning organisation,\" he said.<br/>Coutts has said it has offered Mr Farage an alternative account at its sister bank, NatWest and the offer still stands. <br/>Anyone concerned that they have not been treated fairly by their bank can appeal to the Financial Ombudsman Service.<br/>City regulator the Financial Conduct Authority is also talking to NatWest about the handling of Mr Farage's accounts, its boss told MPs on Wednesday.<br/>Nikhil Rathi said that current rules made clear banks should not discriminate on the basis of political views.<br/>Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>Farage launches fresh attack over Coutts bank closure<br/>Farage: Coutts file 'shows account shut over my views'<br/>Bank account closures probe 'must be fast tracked'<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

According to the report, the Ministry of Defence said at the time that justification for the policy included \"maintenance of operational effectiveness and efficiency\" - but the report said there had been an \"incomprehensible policy of homophobic bigotry\" in the armed forces. <br/>It heard shocking accounts of homophobia, bullying, blackmail, sexual assaults, \"disgraceful\" medical examinations, and conversion therapy.<br/>It makes 49 recommendations to the government including:<br/>The government said it would respond in full after summer recess.<br/>Some of the veterans affected watched the PM's public apology.<br/>One of them, Emma Riley, 51, was a Royal Navy radio operator for three years before she was arrested and discharged for being a lesbian after telling a colleague her sexuality in the early 1990s.<br/>She told BBC News she welcomed the report, and hoped it would be put into place \"swiftly.\"<br/>\"Having our history, experiences and enormous pain acknowledged and apologised for, hearing that the armed services and government that perpetuated institutional bullying will now be held accountable to finally support LBGT+ veterans, is a relief,\" she said.<br/>Veterans have previously told the BBC how their lives were devastated by the ban. <br/>Carol Morgan, who was dismissed after telling her bosses she was gay in 1978, kept her sexuality secret for another 30 years and said she had been \"robbed\" of her life. <br/>Ken Wright, 62, served in the Royal Air Force Police before losing his job when his bosses found out he was gay.<br/>He described how losing his position in the military had left him feeling as though \"his country didn't want him.\"<br/>He added: \"After being denied the opportunity to defend one's country, being told you aren't good enough to wear the uniform, it takes huge inner strength to feel reconciled all of a sudden today.<br/>\"Carrying that insult for 35 years scars you for life.\"<br/>Olympian Dame Kelly Holmes, who served in the army and came out as gay last year, called the publication of the report a \"historic moment\", while Catherine Dixon, a former army officer who is now vice chair at Stonewall, said it was \"an important step towards justice\" for those whose military careers were \"ruined\" because of their sexuality. <br/>\"Many were imprisoned, experienced corrective violence and lived with the stain of criminal convictions because of who they loved and which left some homeless and many unable to work,\" she said. <br/>The report says many faced invasive medical examinations, intrusive police investigations and in some cases, as recently as 1996, were sent to prison for their sexuality. Many still have a criminal record to this day.<br/>It also details how some veterans faced a complete loss of income, while others were deemed ineligible to claim their pension because of their dismissal.<br/>The report comes more than 20 years after four servicemen and women, who were sacked for being gay, won a case in the European Court of Human Rights and overturned the ban.<br/>The armed forces charity Royal British Legion called on the government to accept the report's recommendations in full.<br/>The charity's director general Charles Byrne welcomed both the report and Mr Sunak's \"landmark apology\", saying many people who had dedicated their lives to the country were \"forced or felt pressured to leave the armed forces, and this mistreatment destroyed or shortened their career\". <br/>Following the report, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said he was \"deeply sorry\" on behalf of the government and the armed forces. <br/>\"I say again to the veterans' community I'm deeply sorry for what happened to you. The very tolerance and values of western democracy that we expected you to fight for, we denied to you - it was profoundly wrong,\" he said in the House of Commons.<br/>Veterans Minister Johnny Mercer also said he was pleased with the apology and that it was a \"significant moment\" for the LGBT community. <br/>This video can not be played<br/>Rishi Sunak: \"On behalf of the British state I apologise\"<br/>LGBT veterans call for PM apology for treatment<br/>LGBT veterans want military ban report immediately<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

"This video can not be played<br/>Watch: SNP criticises Labour child benefit cap stance at PMQs<br/>Rishi Sunak has said he welcomed Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer's backing for the two-child benefit cap, as they clashed at Prime Minister's Questions.<br/>The Labour leader has said he would not scrap the benefits policy if the party win the next general election.<br/>It has sparked a backlash from some in his party, while the SNP has accused Labour of supporting child poverty.<br/>A spokesman for Sir Keir said he would not make \"unfunded spending commitments\". <br/>The issue came up at PMQs after the Labour leader grilled Mr Sunak over his government's NHS record in England.<br/>The cap, which the Conservative government introduced in 2017, restricts child tax credit and universal credit to the first two children in a family, with only a few exceptions.<br/>The SNP's Westminster leader, Stephen Flynn, said the policy had plunged more children into poverty in Scotland.<br/>Analysis by the House of Commons Library commissioned by the SNP found that an additional 20,000 children in Scotland were placed into poverty as a result of the benefits cap.<br/>Mr Flynn asked the prime minister if he took \"comfort in knowing that the heinous legacy of that policy will no longer just be protected by Conservative members, but by Labour members too\".<br/>In reply, Mr Sunak said: \"I welcome the Labour leader's newfound support for our policy, even though he previously committed to a different approach.\"<br/>He added that Labour MPs did not have to worry about Sir Keir's position on this issue, \"because given the Labour leader's track record, he has never actually kept a promise that he has made\".<br/>Sir Keir had supported scrapping the cap before he was party leader, but has since shifted his position, insisting that \"tough choices\" on spending are needed if Labour is to win the next election.<br/>A spokesman for the Labour leader said: \"We are not going to be in a position where we are advocating changes in policy that we cannot say how we can pay for it.\"<br/>He declined to say whether it was an \"aspiration\" to reverse the policy or whether, if economic circumstances changed, removing the cap might be possible.<br/>The BBC has been told that Sir Keir's refusal to abolish the cap will be challenged at a meeting of the party's policy forum this weekend.<br/>His spokesman said no shadow cabinet ministers had threatened to resign over the issue.<br/>With his party leading in the polls, Sir Keir has been seeking to stress his party's economic credibility, and he did so again at the final PMQs before Parliament's summer recess.<br/>The Labour leader quizzed Mr Sunak over NHS waiting times, pointing out they have got longer since he took office last year.<br/>The latest data shows that 7.4 million patients in England were waiting to start routine hospital treatment at the end of May.<br/>Mr Sunak blamed the growing waiting list on strike action by junior doctors and consultants, who he urged to accept pay deals offered by the government.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>PM Rishi Sunak blames industrial action for rising NHS waiting times in England<br/>Sir Keir also criticised Mr Sunak over his government's NHS workforce plan, which he claimed was not costed.<br/>The Labour leader asked: \"Is his uncosted spending coming from more tax rises, more cuts, or is it just the latest spending promise to fall from the Tories' magic money tree?\"<br/>Mr Sunak said the chancellor would set out how the workforce plan would be funded in the next autumn statement.<br/>The prime minister said he was \"glad he's now interested in fiscal responsibility, which is very welcome\".<br/>Nodding to the tactics of Just Stop Oil protests, Mr Sunak urged Sir Keir to \"unglue himself from the fence\" and call on consultants and junior doctors to end their strike action.<br/>Sir Keir has been reluctant to make any new spending commitments, as he seeks to avoid Tory accusations of economic irresponsibility.<br/>In the past, the Conservatives have used the \"magic money tree\" line to attack Labour's plans for spending in government.<br/>The Labour leader also highlighted a report from the National Audit Office, which showed the government is on track to break a key promise to build 40 new hospitals by 2030.<br/>Despite this report, Mr Sunak insisted the pledge would be honoured, adding: \"We're not just stopping there, we're also delivering 100 hospital upgrades across the country and crucially over 100 new community diagnostic centres to speed up treatment for people.\"<br/>PMQs is expected to be back on the week starting 4 September, when Parliament returns from its summer

The DfE has been contacted for comment.<br/>There are no official estimates of how many trans, non-binary or gender fluid pupils are in the UK. But in May a survey of 7,000 teachers in England for BBC News suggested that about 8% of primary-school and 75% of secondary school teachers taught trans or non-binary pupils.<br/>Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: \"It is frustrating that [the government] has now got to the point of producing something but appears to be locked in an internal political squabble which is causing a further delay.<br/>\"At present, schools have to navigate this complex and sensitive subject entirely on their own. <br/>\"We will be looking very closely at the guidance when it is published and consulting with our members to ensure it is proportionate, fair and deliverable.\"<br/>Teachers walk tightropes in face of no trans guidance<br/>PM pledges trans guidance for schools for summer<br/>Gender guidance: Parents should be in the know - minister<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Unfortunately, this has not happened.<br/>\"This amendment will help to deliver on the government's own promise to unlock investment in one of the cheapest forms of energy. Ultimately this will bring down household bills and improve our energy security.\"<br/>A consultation on relaxing planning restrictions closed in March but the government's response is not expected to be published until the autumn. <br/>The proposals, which included relaxing a requirement for turbines to be built on pre-designated land, were criticised by the renewable energy industry as not going far enough. <br/>The current rules, introduced under David Cameron in 2015, mean an objection from just one person over an onshore wind development in England could stop it going ahead. <br/>Trade body RenewableUK said this could still be the case under the government's proposals. <br/>The government is also consulting on plans to allow communities in England who want to host wind farms to directly benefit from them, for example through energy bill discounts. <br/>A government spokesperson said: \"We support the development of onshore wind where there is local support, recognising it as an efficient, low-cost and a widely supported source of energy, while being a key part of helping reduce the UK's reliance on importing expensive, foreign fossil fuels.<br/>\"We consulted on changes to national planning policy that could give local authorities more flexibility to respond to the views of their communities, and to demonstrate their support for areas suitable for onshore wind proposals.\"<br/>Call for wind farm planning rules to be changed<br/>Onshore wind rules to be relaxed after Tory revolt<br/>'I've saved \u00a3200 because of my local wind turbine'<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

including restating the commitment to rail nationalisation and improving the provision of early years education - though without a spending commitment attached.<br/>But a range of other proposed changes have not been agreed, and will be up for debate - including on welfare.<br/>Both the county's largest union, Unison and the shop workers' union Usdaw are backing an amendment to \"end the punitive features\" of the benefit system, including specifically the benefits cap and the two-child limit.<br/>The cap, which came into force in 2017, restricts child tax credit and universal credit to the first two children in a family, with only a few exceptions. <br/>The Child Poverty Action Group estimates removing the limit would cost \u00a31.3bn a year but would lift 250,000 children out of poverty overnight. <br/>Sir Keir told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg the policy would not change under a Labour government.<br/>Although he did not give a reason during the interview, members of his shadow cabinet said it was because this would constitute an unfunded spending commitment.<br/>Sir Keir referenced the backlash to his interview during an event with former Labour leader Sir Tony Blair on Tuesday, saying there was a row ongoing within the party about \"tough choices\". <br/>\"We have to take the tough decisions,\" he said, adding that the experience of former PM Liz Truss's premiership showed \"if you make unfunded commitments then the economy is damaged and working people pay the price\". <br/>This video can not be played<br/>Starmer: Labour will not make \"unfunded commitments\" like Liz Truss<br/>The leadership wants to establish economic credibility above all, and avoid giving the Conservatives the ammunition to run a \"Labour's tax bombshell\" campaign, which proved so successful in 1992 - also after 13 years of Tory government.<br/>Sir Keir's critics fall in to two camps - both of which go beyond his usual detractors.<br/>The first involve those who want to see the policy changed - from Unison, which nominated Sir Keir for the leadership, to some former shadow ministers, to Labour's moderate leader in Scotland, Anas Sarwar. <br/>The second group - who are muttering privately rather than publicly - are with the programme when it comes to refraining from uncosted commitments.<br/>This includes some serving shadow ministers.<br/>Their view is roughly this:<br/>That Sir Keir committed to not changing a Conservative policy in his interview with the BBC on Sunday. <br/>They feel instead - like deputy leader Angela Rayner and shadow work and pensions secretary Jonathan Ashworth - he could have denounced the policy, but simply explained the money was not there to change it yet, as the Conservatives have crashed the economy.<br/>They feel that approach would have left the door open to addressing the issue when or if the economy improves, and therefore have avoided the current row.<br/>Sir Keir, though, will be aware that the two-child limit is far less unpopular with potential voters than it is with party members.<br/>But a shadow cabinet ally of Sir Keir's denied that he had attempted to throw potential voters in former Labour strongholds in the Midlands and northern England - known as the \"red wall\" - some red meat.<br/>The ally insisted Sir Keir was absolutely committed to tackling child poverty and that his robust response on the issue was simply to quash any speculation that an unfunded commitment could be wrung out of him.<br/>But there is a wider frustration that while Labour is attacking the government's record - for example, on child poverty - shadow ministers are constrained in proposing solutions.<br/>At the policy forum this weekend, there will also be a push by some unions and left-wing delegates in particular for the party to commit to free school meals for all primary school children in England.<br/>The left-wing group Momentum will be pushing for a more radical agenda across the board this weekend - from public ownership to rent controls and increasing international aid.<br/>They are unlikely to win many victories but in alliance with the unions their hope is that on benefits and school meals, the leadership will be given a clear message.<br/>There are many in the party that would not sign up to some of Momentum's preferred policies.<br/>But there is a wider concern in Labour's ranks about whether the party's programme can inspire, and not just reassure, potential voters. <br/>Starmer won't commit to more public services money<br/>Kuenssberg: What could go wrong for Keir Starmer?<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing -

One of the biggest stumbling blocks was that Ukraine was beset with corruption and its businesses run by powerful oligarchs.<br/>For all his Western leanings, Mr Kuchma's own government was tainted by the gruesome 2000 murder of a journalist, Georgiy Gongadze, who was one of the Ukrainian leader's biggest public critics. Mr Kuchma has always denied complicity in his death.<br/>According to the newly released documents, Roger Liddle, who served as an adviser to Mr Blair on European affairs, said immediate EU or Nato membership was unlikely but he urged the prime minister to become more engaged.<br/>After July 2001 talks in Crimea, 13 years before it was seized by Russia, he wrote to the prime minister: \"Strengthening Ukraine's shaky democracy and economy increases stability on the EU's future eastern borders and acts as a formidable barrier to any resurgence of Russian imperialism to the West.\"<br/>By December 2001, after a Ukrainian delegation had taken part in talks in the UK, Mr Liddle said the Ukrainians were \"depressed... that most of Europe and the new US administration is running them down\". <br/>George W Bush had become US president that year, and had decided that Russia's Vladimir Putin was a \"very straightforward and trustworthy\" leader. The 9/11 attacks were very recent and the US needed Russian support to enable the military campaign to go ahead in Afghanistan.<br/>Other stories from the National Archives:<br/>Kataryna Wolczuk, professor of East European politics at the University of Birmingham, believes that by 2001 UK leaders had little concern about Russia's future plans for Ukraine, as President Putin was \"still in his Euro-Atlantic ally mood\".<br/>After the talks at Chevening with the Ukrainians, Roger Liddle's conclusion was: \"We have too rosy a view of Putin (who according to them is a clever, presentable power politician, but no democratic hero). And we rubbish Ukraine.\"<br/>Prof Wolczuk argues that President Kuchma and his entourage were instinctively pro-European: \"They knew they couldn't trust Putin and Russia, and yet the system Kuchma presided over was a hostage of that system.\"<br/>The archive documents also show support for Ukraine's position from the UK's ambassador to Kyiv, Roland Smith, who cautioned against a proposal by then-Foreign Secretary Jack Straw for the EU to give Ukraine \"special neighbour status\" along with Belarus and Moldova.<br/>The ambassador wondered why the plan appeared formulated to deny Ukraine the chance of full EU membership: \"Because Ukraine is simply too big? Because really we think that Ukraine ought to go back to Russia where she belongs?\"<br/>He asked why it differed from the plan for countries such as Bulgaria and Romania, which eventually joined the EU in 2007.<br/>In 2004 Ukrainians took to the streets protesting against electoral fraud, in an Orange Revolution that saw supporters back a pro-European president over a candidate backed by the Kremlin.<br/>In the event the EU did choose a watered-down relationship for Ukraine and its neighbours, and the UK played a big role in supporting it.<br/>But Mr Blair's European adviser said in his archived note at the end of 2001 that the main Ukrainian pitch had been for \"associate membership\" of the EU - far stronger than what was then being offered.<br/>That agreement was eventually signed in 2014, months after Ukraine's pro-Russian president had refused to go through with it, triggering a revolution that ultimately brought him down. <br/>How might Russia react if Ukraine joins the EU?<br/>No short cuts on Ukraine, warns EU ahead of summit<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

It's been a common theme recently.<br/>Last week, Sir Keir penned an article with lines that wouldn't have felt out of place in Labour's 1996 manifesto.<br/>One of the most distinct parallels was the language on spending. For example, the '96 manifesto says: \"The level of public spending is no longer the best measure of the effectiveness of government action in the public interest.\"<br/>And Sir Keir's article says: \"Pointing at problems and promising vast sums of money to fix them has too often been the comfort zone of Labour oppositions.\"<br/>Like Sir Tony was in the 90s, Sir Keir is at pains to stress that economic credibility must come before all else, in part to nullify Tory attacks on Labour's financial competence.<br/>Sir Keir has made no secret of his admiration for Sir Tony and his record for winning elections. Behind the scenes, Sir Keir has been advised by some of the former prime minister's closest allies, including the architect of New Labour, Peter Mandelson.<br/>The comparisons between Sir Keir and Sir Tony only go so far though.<br/>The circumstances now are very different to those in the 1990s, an era of sustained economic growth and optimism following the end of the Cold War.<br/>In 2023, the UK is on the brink of a recession, with inflation and interest rates soaring to highs not seen in decades. And that's not to mention the challenges posed by climate change, migration, artificial intelligence, the invasion of Ukraine and an ageing population.<br/>\"Make no mistake, it's a new age of insecurity and we're not even close to match-fit,\" Sir Keir said in his conference speech.<br/>The task awaiting the next government is a daunting one, and Sir Tony reflected that in a conversation with Sir Keir, following the Labour leader's speech.<br/>\"I think we both agree that 1997 is very different from 2023,\" Sir Tony said. In short, \"it's grim\", the former PM said.<br/>For those old enough to remember, one of the hallmarks of the Blair ascendancy was Things Can Only Get Better, the euphoric dance-pop hit that New Labour adopted as its campaign theme song.<br/>The song \"resonated because it felt like that was the mood of the country,\" Sir Keir said.<br/>\"That's not the position now, by a long shot.\"<br/>He went on: \"It's a mistake to speak to the country as if it's 1996. We've got to the speak to the country as it is in 2023.\"<br/>As Sir Keir seems to acknowledge here, in these difficult times, the Blair model is no off-the-shelf guide to victory at the next general election.<br/>Starmer to face challenge on two-child benefit cap<br/>Labour mayor quits party over selection row<br/>Young climate activists turn up heat on Starmer<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Despite the significant progress in the last 20 years, some dissident groups continue to carry out attacks.\"<br/>To conclude, she said: \"The threat continues to evolve and is increasing, meaning we must also evolve to keep the British people safe. We will work with the public and our international allies.\"<br/>In the strategy, the Home Office states: \"In the UK, the primary domestic threat comes from Islamic terrorism, which accounts for approximately 67% of attacks in 2018, about three quarters of MI5 caseload and 64% of those in custody for terrorism-connected offences.\"<br/>The report goes on to say that the \"domestic terror threat\u2026 is less predictable, harder to detect and investigate.\"<br/>It points out there is \"a persistent and evolving threat from Islamist terrorist groups overseas\".<br/>And it says there is \"an operating environment where accelerating advances in technology provide both opportunity and risk to our counter-terrorism efforts.\"<br/>It concludes: \"It is within this context that we judge that the risk from terrorism is once again rising.\"<br/>The government said it was also monitoring the risk posed by the so-called incel movement.<br/>The incel movement is an online subculture to which multiple mass murders and hate crimes against women have been attributed.<br/>Incel is short for \"involuntary celibate\".

But there are no similar return deals with any other countries, our correspondent said.<br/>And the Rwanda plan was ruled unlawful by the Court of Appeal last month, although ministers are challenging the judgement.<br/>On Tuesday, an accommodation barge arrived in Portland Port, Dorset, where it is due to eventually house 500 asylum seekers.<br/>The first asylum seekers are expected to board the Bibby Stockholm later this month, despite protests from locals. <br/>The prime minister's official spokesman said that the government wants to \"open more\" accommodation facilities for asylum seekers.<br/>For weeks, the government was locked in a battle over the final shape of the bill with the Lords, where a cross-party group of peers made repeated amendments.<br/>In the last few days, the bill passed between the House of Commons and House of Lords three times, in a process known as parliamentary ping-pong.<br/>Former Prime Minister Theresa May led a series of backbench rebellions in the Commons over plans to restrict access to the UK asylum system for victims of modern slavery.<br/>Under the bill the duty to remove anyone who comes to the UK illegally applies to victims of trafficking and slavery, accompanied children and unaccompanied children as soon as they turn 18.<br/>Ms May, who as home secretary introduced the Modern Slavery Act, said the bill \"will enable more slave drivers to operate and make money out of human misery\".<br/>The government argued that anyone identified as a potential victim of modern slavery would be returned home or to another \"safe country away from those who have trafficked them\".<br/>However, on Monday Mrs May did not vote for an exemption from the bill for suspected victims of slavery to allow them to access support and co-operate with criminal proceedings against traffickers.<br/>The legislation would also scrap existing legal caps on how long those entering the UK illegally can be held ahead of being deported. <br/>MPs and peers had attempted to reinsert the three day-limit on how long children can be detained, as well as the 24-hour maximum for children unaccompanied by an adult. But the plans were dropped after they were again rejected in the House of Commons.<br/>The government had already made concessions on the detention of unaccompanied children, who will be granted immigration bail after eight days, and on pregnant women, for whom the current limit of 72 hours detention will be retained. <br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Braverman \"disappointed\" with Rwanda ruling<br/>The end of the stand-off between peers and MPs paves the way for the bill to receive royal assent - when the King formally agrees to make the bill into an Act of Parliament, or law.<br/>During the Lords debate, Home Office minister Lord Murray of Blidworth said the number of small boat arrivals had \"overwhelmed\" the UK's asylum system and that accommodation was costing taxpayers \u00a36m per day.<br/>\"With over 45,000 people making dangerous Channel crossings last year this is simply no longer sustainable,\" he told peers, adding it was \"only right\" that the \"business model\" of human traffickers be broken. <br/>He urged the Lords to \"respect the will of the elected House and the British people by passing this bill\".<br/>Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper called he new law \"a con which will only make the Tories asylum chaos worse\".<br/>\"The asylum backlog is a record high, the number of people in hotels is still increasing, the Rwanda plan is unravelling and June boat crossings were higher than last year,\" she said. <br/>Ministers overturn Lords changes to migration bill<br/>Chris Mason: Big moment on small boats but solution still far off<br/>How is the UK stopping Channel crossings?<br/>Senior Tories criticise Illegal Migration Bill<br/>How many people cross the Channel in small boats?<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

That's something I don't want to risk any more.\"<br/>The experience of Ukraine's armed forces, and the way in which allies have been able to assist - including quick adaptations of existing equipment to suit Kyiv's needs - is a thread running through much of Tuesday's paper.<br/>It says one of the lessons learnt from the war is that the pace of innovation is getting faster - and cannot be met by the traditional, often decades-long programmes to get equipment.Instead, equipment should be designed with the possibility of making quick upgrades, the paper says.<br/>It also highlights the need to harness the latest technology - including AI and quantum computing - to make Britain's armed forces more agile and adaptive. <br/>\"New technologies are not gimmicks, they're fundamentally key to how we fight a modern war,\" Mr Wallace said.<br/>He added that analysing the strategies playing out in Ukraine would help \"make sure that we can be match fit for any future conflict\".<br/>The document also sets out plans for more personnel to have a \"zigzag\" career path - which could include leaving the military to gain experience elsewhere and then re-joining.<br/>Young people \"envisage careers that are flexible and see themselves working in a number of different professions, rather than progressing within a single organisation\", the document says -and so the government will embrace\"greater opportunity for career mobility between jobs in defence and whatever other employment they'd like to pursue elsewhere\".<br/>And it says \u00a3400m will be spent on modernising accommodation for service families. This money was already in the defence budget but has been reallocated.<br/>The refresh is not about cuts to the size of the army - this was already announced in a review in 2021, with a plan to cut the Army to 72,500 soldiers by 2025.<br/>Another such lesson from the war in Ukraine is the \"power of electronic warfare\", Mr Wallace said, explaining: \"The use of [electronic] warfare either to act as a decoy or to act as a defence is becoming really important, so it goes up the priority list.\"<br/>He said that the war in Ukraine had also concentrated minds on the use of \"deep fire\" artillery, and had informed the decision to retire old 155mm guns and bring in new replacements.<br/>\"We have seen a generational shift in ranges of 'deep fire' artillery,\" he said. \"The 155mm gun roughly had a 22-25km range for about 50 years. <br/>\"The new generation ... you're getting ranges of 60km in future. So I have taken a decision to phase out the old 155mm [for] the Swedish Archer 1.\"<br/>Artillery has played a significant role for both sides in Ukraine. Britain's armed forces, however, have scaled down their artillery forces since the end of the Cold War.<br/>Mr Wallace said: \"At the end of the Second World War, 35% of the army was artillery. Now, it's roughly 8%. Deep fire is something we need to rebalance. These are the lessons.\"<br/>Labour said the plan was \"driven by costs, not by threats\", and also questioned whether it would stand the test of time, with Mr Wallace due to step down.<br/>\"As his own future is now short, how long is the shelf life of his plan?\" asked shadow defence secretary John Healey. <br/>\"Industry and military leaders cannot be sure his successor will agree with his decisions, will accept his cuts, will act on his approach.\"<br/>Speaking in the Commons after Mr Wallace set out his plan, Mr Healey also criticised the time it has taken to update the paper, saying: \"Why has this plan been so delayed? It's 510 days since Putin shattered European security.\"<br/>Former soldier Mr Wallace played a key role in the UK's response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.<br/>His Wyre and Preston North constituency in Lancashire will disappear at the next general election because of boundary changes and he has said he will not seek a new seat.<br/>Speaking about the mark he hoped to leave on the MoD, Mr Wallace told the BBC that Prime Minister Rishi Sunak had given his department a \"massive \u00a324bn legacy\". <br/>\"I've come in, and we've had a real term rise in our defence spending,\" he said. <br/>He also warned that the conflict in Ukraine served as a reminder that \"there are bad people out there wanting to do bad things to Britain and her allies\".<br/>Ben Wallace says he will not be next Nato chief<br/>Sunak unveils \u00a35bn extra defence funds on US trip<br/>Cuts leave military at risk as threats rise - MPs<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

This compares to an increase of 42% in the overall economy. <br/>Adding construction workers to the shortage list would not make a major difference to overall migration figures, MAC found.<br/>The committee said its review was based on whether an occupation made up more than 0.5% of the sector workforce and earned below the current general threshold for migrants which stands at \u00a326,200. <br/>It said it also considered the \"strategic importance of construction for the UK economy\" and how its workforce was likely to change in the next decade, with \"demand likely to increase markedly\".<br/>Suzannah Nichol, Build UK chief executive, said she welcomed the news, adding: \"It is vital that construction is able to fill vacancies and quickly address shortages around particular roles.\"<br/>On 3 July, a group of Tory MPs suggested policies it wanted to see to drastically cut migration, warning the failure to do so \"risks eroding public trust\".<br/>They proposed only granting visas to skilled workers earning more than \u00a338,000 a year.<br/>Currently, in most cases foreign nationals have to earn at least \u00a326,200 to qualify for a skilled worker visa, although this can drop to \u00a320,960 if they are taking up a job on a shortage list.<br/>Have you been affected by the issues raised in this story?

You've broken that promise.\"<br/>Mr Driscoll said it was with a \"heavy heart and deep disappointment\" he was leaving the party that he had been a member of since 1985.<br/>He said Sir Keir had \"U-turned on so many promises\", including pledges to end university tuition fees and spend \u00a328bn a year on tackling climate change.<br/>He also accused the party leader of being \"not interested in hope and change\".<br/>In a subsequent tweet, Mr Driscoll said he required about \u00a3150,000 to run for mayor as an independent and vowed he would stand if he could muster \u00a325,000 via online crowdfunding - which he did inside two hours. <br/>The new role covers Northumberland, Tyne and Wear and County Durham as part of a combined authority and follows a \u00a31.4bn devolution deal which will give the holder powers over transport, housing and skills.<br/>In his letter, the mayor wrote: \"You'd think the Labour leadership would shout about my integrity and success. <br/>\"But when push comes to shove, they only want candidates who'll do what they're told by party HQ. I have hundreds telling me they want an experienced, independent North East voice.\u00a0<br/>\"Independents have won mayoral elections many times.<br/>\"Most famously, after Labour stitched up Ken Livingstone to stop him running for London Mayor in 2000. He won by a landslide, 667,877 to Labour's 223,884.\"<br/>Labour's announcement in June that Mr Driscoll had been excluded from the mayoral contest prompted a backlash.<br/>A senior Labour source linked the decision to his sharing a stage with Loach, who was expelled from the party in a drive to eliminate antisemitism.<br/>But figures on Labour's left blamed \"factionalism\" under Sir Keir's leadership.<br/>Responding to Mr Driscoll's exit, a Labour spokesperson said: \"With Keir Starmer as leader, the Labour party is a changed party, relentlessly focussed on delivering for working people, and we make no apologies that Labour candidates are held to the highest standard.\"<br/>Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said Labour had \"clear high standards\" for its candidates. <br/>Speaking to the BBC's World at One, she said that she did not know all the details but that \"what we're all working for, is to get a Labour government\".<br/>Asked whether there was any sadness that the Labour left feel squeezed out, she said: \"We've always been a party that has people from all sorts of different views and perspectives, and that needs to continue, that's really important to who we are. <br/>\"It's also important that we focus together on making sure we've got great candidates to stand for election.\"<br/>Momentum, a grassroots group set up by backers of Jeremy Corbyn, said Mr Driscoll's departure was a \"major loss\" for the party.<br/>\"Keir Starmer's anti-democratic purge has just cost Labour a popular and effective mayor,\" a statement said. <br/>\"By needlessly blocking Jamie Driscoll for running in the North East mayoralty he himself helped secure, Starmer's acolytes have divided the Labour Party, denied unions and members a fair say and alienated a sitting mayor who has been delivering for North Tyne on housing and green jobs.<br/>\"This is a mess entirely of Keir Starmer's making.\"<br/>Mr Driscoll told the BBC the North East was known for being a Leave-voting area, not because voters were interested in the \"intricacies\" of the European Commission, but because they wanted \"decisions made locally by someone who would put them before party HQ\".<br/>He said: \"I've always been independently minded and I think that might be the reason I was blocked.<br/>\"We need more power, closer to communities in regions and out of Westminster. I've never been a fan of a mono-culture in politics. <br/>\"We need plurality, we need different voices but the whole point of political representation is that we are supposed to represent the people you stand for and in that case, the North East.\"<br/>Shortly after Mr Driscoll quit, Northumberland county councillor Mary Murphy also left Labour.<br/>She said she had been \"inspired\" by Mr Driscoll's decision and and wanted to show her support. <br/>Speaking to the Local Democracy Reporting Service, she said: \"The thing that has kept me from resigning previously is I stood on a Labour ticket, and I don't take lightly that I'm walking away from that.<br/>\"But, if I can't speak out on the things that I think are important, or campaign on the things I think local people need, what is the point\u00a0of me being there?<br/>\"I saw Jamie Driscoll's statement and I was inspired by it.

It also warned that cost-cutting and inaccurate modelling of future demand could mean new hospitals are too small.<br/>The health department remained \"firmly committed\" to delivering the England building pledge, a spokesperson said.<br/>But Labour called the report \"damning\".<br/>The hospitals plan was a Conservative manifesto commitment during the December 2019 election campaign, and it was made policy the following year. <br/>When the health department officially set out the plan in October 2020, eight hospital construction projects already under way were not included in the target. But recent government statements about building 40 new hospitals include these eight projects, referred to as \"legacy hospitals\". <br/>And in May, the government changed the scope of the scheme to include hospitals in urgent need of repairs, including five judged to be at risk of collapse because of crumbling concrete infrastructure.<br/>Now the National Audit Office has analysed the plans and found that, by the definition set out in 2020, the target will be missed, and only 32 will be built in time. The NAO said the government has used a \"broad\" definition of \"new\", which includes refurbishment of existing buildings as well as completely new hospitals.<br/>The 32 that will be built in time include 24 from the original new hospitals programme, five that were added in May, and three new mental health hospitals. <br/>It said a further eight do not count towards the original definition of \"new\" because they were already under way when the commitment was made.<br/>Questions have been asked for some time about whether the programme is on track and it is significant that the watchdog has now ruled that, judged by the original template, it is not.<br/>In May, a BBC News investigation found that building work had not started on 33 of the projects. <br/>The NAO said staff shortages mean a planned design for a standardised hospital has been delayed until May 2024.<br/>It also warned that a push to meet the target at the lowest possible cost - combined with optimistic forecasts about how much care will be outside hospitals in the future - could result in new hospitals that are too small.<br/>The government had failed to achieve good value for money, the NAO said, as it called for a review of the underlying assumptions behind the plans to make sure the new hospitals are fit for purpose.<br/>Health Secretary Steve Barclay had already told MPs in May that some of the original group included in the new hospitals programme might not be completed by 2030.<br/>He made the admission as he updated the department's building plans to deal with hospitals built with a lightweight concrete that was used in the 1980s and is now judged to be unsafe.<br/>But he restated the commitment to deliver 40 new hospitals by the end of the decade.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>The PM says delivering 40 new hospitals is \"one of the many things\" the government is doing for the health service.<br/>The Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has also said the target will be met.<br/>He described the plans to build the hospitals as one of the \"many things we're doing\" to improve healthcare, citing \"community diagnostics in local communities\" and the workforce plan as \"all ways we're backing the NHS\" and \"cutting waiting lists\".<br/>Gareth Davies, head of the NAO, said the programme included \"innovative plans\" to improve efficiency and quality. But there are important lessons to ensure future major projects were affordable, transparent and delivered on time, he said.<br/>Sir Julian Hartley, chief executive of NHS Providers, urged the government to \"shift gears\" to get the hospitals built and warned that costs had \"spiralled due to high inflation\".<br/>He said many NHS trusts were \"deeply disappointed\" by delays and said the government \"could have better managed expectations about the funding available, given the uncertainty involved and the impact of inflation\".<br/>Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper said the \"utterly damning report demolishes the government's claims to be building 40 'new hospitals'\".<br/>She called on the health secretary to make an urgent statement in Parliament addressing its findings, saying \"the public deserves answers\".<br/>Labour's shadow health secretary Wes Streeting said: \"The Conservatives have overpromised, under-delivered, and they've been found out. <br/>\"Meanwhile patients are being treated in outdated, crumbling hospitals.\"<br/>A health department spokesperson said: \"The NAO's report acknowledges that despite changes to the original programme, 40 new hospitals are still expected to be delivered by 2030 and praises the programme's innovative plans to standardise hospital construction, deliver efficiencies and improve quality.<br/>\"We remain firmly committed to delivering these hospitals, which are now expected to be backed by over \u00a320 billion of investment, helping to cut waiting lists so people can get the treatment they need quicker.<br/>\"Three new hospitals have already opened and more will open this year so patients and staff can benefit from major new hospital buildings, equipped with the latest technology.\" <br/>Work yet to start on 33 of 40 new hospitals<br/>Ministers set out plan to train and keep more NHS staff<br/>NHS waiting lists hit record high in England<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Get in touch.<br/>The government said courses that do not have \"good outcomes\" for students would include those that have high drop-out rates or have a low proportion of students going on to professional jobs. It will also look at potential earnings when deciding if a degree offers enough value.<br/>PM Rishi Sunak said: \"The UK is home to some of the best universities in the world and studying for a degree can be immensely rewarding. But too many young people are being sold a false dream and end up doing a poor-quality course at the taxpayers' expense that doesn't offer the prospect of a decent job at the end of it.\"<br/>Nearly three-in-10 graduates do not progress into highly-skilled jobs or further study 15 months after graduating, according to the OfS. <br/>The OfS already has the power to investigate and sanction universities which offer degrees falling below minimum performance thresholds - but the new rules would permit the regulator to limit student numbers for those courses.<br/>The current thresholds for full-time students doing a first degree are for: <br/>This announcement does not change these criteria, and other aspects of the policy are unclear, such as how many students may be denied a place at university in future.<br/>If one in five students would have been better off not going to university (according to a study from the Institute for Fiscal Studies) is that the kind of numbers the government has in mind? It won't say.<br/>What are these poor quality courses? Are some subjects more likely to have high drop out rates than others? <br/>The Department for Education can't say which courses would be at risk of recruitment limits - that would be for the OfS to determine.<br/>But this raises a further question: If some courses are of such poor quality, why not just scrap them entirely?<br/>Speaking on Radio 4's Today programme, Education Minister Robert Halfon said putting limits on underperforming degrees will mean those courses \"will then improve\". <br/>\"Students will be able to make informed choices,\" he said. \"If a course has poor outcomes they might choose to do another course at university, they may still decide to do that course but will have the recruitment limits on it.\"<br/>He said any recruitment limits on courses will be a matter for the regulator, the OfS, rather than the government.<br/>He suggested that the OfS would use \"existing powers\" to look into poor quality courses, saying: \"We can't order the Office for Students to do anything.\"<br/>Labour's shadow education secretary Bridget Phillipson said the announcement was \"an attack on the aspirations of young people\". <br/>This video can not be played<br/>Rishi Sunak says apprenticeships are an \u201cequally high alternative to universities\u201d.<br/>But Mr Halfon dubbed that accusation as \"nonsense\". <br/>\"The Labour party has been obsessed with quantity over quality and had been party of poor standards in education,\" he said. <br/>Liberal Democrat education spokesperson Munira Wilson said the prime minister was \"out of ideas\" and had \"dug up a policy the Conservatives announced and then unannounced twice over\".<br/>She said: \"Universities don't want this. It's a cap on aspiration, making it harder for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds to go on to further study.\"<br/>Universities UK said the UK had the highest completion rates of any OECD country and overall satisfaction rates were high. <br/>\"However, it is right that the regulatory framework is there as a backstop to protect student interests in the very small proportion of instances where quality needs to be improved,\" a spokeswoman said. <br/>The idea originated in a 2018 review set up under then-Prime Minister Theresa May. The same review also suggested that more money needed to be pumped into education and that tuition fees needed to be cut - but these are not being implemented.<br/>The new pledge comes ahead of three by-elections in Conservative-held seats on Thursday.<br/>The government also announced it would reduce the maximum fees universities can charge for classroom-based foundation-year courses, from \u00a39,250 to \u00a35,760. In 2021/22, 29,080 students were studying a foundation degree.<br/>Foundation year courses are designed to help prepare students for degrees with specific entry requirements or knowledge, such as medicine and veterinary sciences. <br/>However, the government said research suggested too many people were encouraged to take a foundation year in some subjects like business, where it was not necessary. <br/>University Alliance, which represents professional and technical universities, said cutting fees for foundation year courses was \"disappointingly regressive\" and \"makes them financially unviable to deliver\". <br/>Chief executive Vanessa Wilson said: \"Disadvantaged students and the 'Covid generation' will lose out if this provision is reduced or lost.\"<br/>She added that the government had chosen \"to berate one of the few UK sectors which is genuinely world-leading\". <br/>University student complaints hit another record high<br/>'Dumbed down' courses 'take advantage' of students<br/>How much will university cost me?<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Opposition sources speculate there could be as many as 30 government defeats by the time the bill bounces back to MPs in the autumn.<br/>The end of term is often a moment for internal matters, and on Wednesday MPs will debate a significant tightening of the rules for all-party parliamentary groups. <br/>There are hundreds of these cross-party organisations of MPs and peers, on topics ranging from diseases to sports, to cycling and beer.  <br/>Some are little more than social organisations, others have serious influence on policy and legislation - a good recent example is the APPG on Autism, under the late Dame Cheryl Gillan, which saw a private member's bill passed and then pushed ministers for action to help people with autism. <br/>The concern is that some APPGs may act as a conduit for outside interests, including foreign governments, to influence Parliament or the UK government. <br/>So new rules are being proposed to sharpen MPs' responsibility for the running of APPGs, with the focus on those groups receiving financial benefits. <br/>Those APPGs will be required to register them, and the new rules would ban foreign governments from financing the secretariats of APPGs (MPs who serve as officers of an APPG will be expected to exercise due diligence in checking where their funding comes from).<br/>In the Lords, some of those who received peerages in Boris Johnson's resignation honours list will take their seats, starting with his former political secretary Ben Gascoigne and former London mayoral candidate Shaun Bailey when the Lords sits on Tuesday.<br/>On Thursday, it will be the turn of former Conservative Party political director Ross Kempsell, and Kulveer Ranger, who was Mr Johnson's director of transport policy when he was mayor of London.<br/>Finally, with the end of term in sight, committee action is concentrated on Monday and Tuesday, and there are some important select committee reports to watch out for. <br/>On Tuesday, the Public Accounts Committee reports on the awarding of Covid contracts to PPE Medpro, following a Commons vote last year calling on the government to release correspondence, documents and advice to the committee. <br/>And then there's the publication of the Defence Select Committee's six-month inquiry into the UK's defence procurement system, which was led by Conservative former minister and sub-committee chair Mark Francois. <br/>Having watched some of the hearings, it's hard to imagine they're going to conclude that all's well, and Mr Francois is an experienced parliamentary guerrilla, who can be expected to follow up their findings with continued pressure on ministers - watch out for an intervention at PMQs if Mr Speaker gives him the chance. <br/>Elsewhere, the Transport Committee has re-opened its call for evidence for its inquiry into accessible transport, after train operating companies announced plans to close over 300 ticket offices across the rail network. <br/>Commons: (14:30) Education Questions, with any urgent questions or government statements following at 15:30.<br/>Main debate: MPs respond to Lords amendments to the Illegal Migration Bill - where peers are still pressing nine issues, including child detention, protection for LGBT refugees, safe and legal routes for asylum seekers, and more. There will also be ping-pong on the Strikes (Minimum Service Levels) Bill - where the main outstanding issue is on the consultation required before minimum service levels are set. There will be an hour set aside for each bill.<br/>Westminster Hall: (16:30) MPs consider a petition urging the government to give teaching assistants a pay rise.<br/>Committees: Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (16.00) ends its inquiry into financial reporting and audit in local authorities, with questions to local government minister Lee Rowley. With more councils in effect going bankrupt, they will ask whether there is an auditing crisis in England's councils and examine the future role of the Auditing, Reporting and Governance Authority (ARGA).<br/>Lords: (14:30) It's the last of four days of report stage debate on the Online Safety Bill. No votes are expected. There's also a slot to allow peers to consider the latest Commons amendments to the Illegal Migration Bill.<br/>Commons: It's Foreign Office Questions at 11:30. The DUP's Jim Shannon will present a ten-minute rule bill to require a report on increasing the income threshold for the high-income Child Benefit Charge in line with inflation. Labour's Richard Burgon will present a bill to ban MPs from receiving financial or other benefits from oil and gas companies. This will happen without debate, but there's an interesting sense of a marker going down. <br/>Main debate: Further consideration of more Lords amendments to assorted bills, including the Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Bill, where the government lost votes on immunity from prosecution for those who co-operate with the proposed new mechanism for investigating historic crimes, and on minimum investigation standards. Peers are not scheduled to respond to any changes made by the Commons until September.  <br/>Committees: Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs (10.00) looks at the government's new smartphone-based public warning system with its siren-like emergency alerts, after the nationwide test in April failed to reach an estimated 7 per cent of compatible devices.<br/>The Lords Communications Committee (14:30) questions BBC Director-General Tim Davie and acting chair Dame Elan Closs Stephens on BBC leadership. As they delicately put it: \"In light of recent events, what concerns have been raised about the adequacy of the BBC's governance arrangements, and how it is addressing these?\"<br/>Lords: (14:30) It's day three of seven of report stage debate on the Levelling-Up and Regeneration Bill, with votes expected on the devolution of bus services, an attempt to scrap the proposed new Infrastructure Levy (over concerns that it will not do enough to provide affordable housing), and a new clause on the governance of national parks from Conservative peer Lord Randall.<br/>Peers are also preparing for a long night processing Commons amendments to the Illegal Migration Bill, with restaurants and bars opening late, and hot snacks available until half an hour after the close of business. <br/>Commons: (11:30) Science, Innovation and Technology Questions, followed at noon by Prime Minister's Question Time.<br/>Main debate: More ping-pong with the Lords, followed by a debate on proposed new rules for all-party parliamentary groups (see above).<br/>Committees: Health (10.00) continues its future cancer inquiry with evidence on the new cutting-edge technologies that could boost earlier cancer diagnosis, including the NHS-Galleri blood test, which could change cancer screening. Home Affairs (10.00) concludes its inquiry into human trafficking with evidence from safeguarding minister Sara Dines on how potential victims of trafficking and modern slavery are supported.<br/>Lords: (15:00) It's day five of five of report stage debate on the Online Safety Bill. If the schedule holds and peers complete report consideration today, the bill will have its third reading immediately after they return from their summer recess in early September. There's also another slot available for consideration of Commons amendments to the Illegal Migration Bill.<br/>Commons: (09:30) Culture, Media and Sport Questions, followed by mini-question times for the MPs who speak for the Church Commissioners, the House of Commons Commission (the administrative body of the House), the Public Accounts Commission, the Restoration and Renewal Client Board (which represents MPs and peers' views in the mega-project to revamp Parliament's main buildings) and the Electoral Commission. <br/>Then comes the weekly update on the forthcoming Commons agenda, from the Leader of the House - this time setting out what MPs will be debating when they return after recess.<br/>Main debate: It's the Sir David Amess summer adjournment debate - the traditional end of term debate, in which any MP can raise any subject they choose, named in honour of the murdered veteran MP.<br/>Lords: (11:00) Day four of seven of report stage on the Levelling-Up and Regeneration Bill.

They as good as broke our public services, they've created a situation in which wages have been stagnant for many, many years and they need to sort out this mess.\"<br/>Public sector workers including teachers, police and doctors have been offered pay rises of between 5% and 7%, with junior doctors in England in line for 6%. <br/>Four education unions said the deal would allow them to end their pay disputes and that they would advise members to accept the offer. <br/>However, junior doctors in England have asked for a 35% rise to make up for years of below-inflation increases. <br/>Their latest walkout, which lasts five days, runs until Tuesday. <br/>This video can not be played<br/>Starmer: We would negotiate and settle pay dispute<br/>Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has said the pay offer is \"final\" and a \"fair deal\" for workers and taxpayers, adding that the government was supporting the NHS with record funding. <br/>A Liberal Democrat spokesperson said: \"The Conservatives' reckless mismanagement of the economy has driven our public services into the ground.<br/>\"Liberal Democrats would invest in our NHS, schools and local services, to give people a fair deal and get our economy back on the right track.\"<br/>Sir Keir also confirmed his party would not change the two-child benefit cap, which generally restricts tax credit and universal credit to the first two children in a family.<br/>He had previously supported scrapping the cap before he was Labour leader. <br/>He would not commit to unfreezing housing benefit, saying the party would set out its policy before the election. <br/>Momentum, the left-wing campaign group set up to support Jeremy Corbyn when he was Labour leader, said fixing the \"mess\" left by the Conservatives \"requires real ambition\", \"real investment in our decaying infrastructure\" and \"an end to the scourge of low pay\". <br/>It described the two-child benefit cap as \"a heinous policy\" and called for it to be scrapped. <br/>Mick Lynch, head of the RMT union, which is not affiliated to Labour, said many people could not \"spot the difference\" between Labour and the Conservatives.<br/>\"He's got to show that he's on the side of working people and progressive politics, and I don't think we're seeing that,\" he told Sky's Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme. <br/>Sir Keir was also challenged over his commitment to combatting climate change,after the party rowed back on a pledge to invest \u00a328bn a year in green industries if it wins power. <br/>Instead the party says it will ramp up investment over time, reaching \u00a328bn a year after 2027, arguing it needs to be responsible with the public finances. <br/>The Labour leader insisted he still had \"a massive agenda when it comes to climate change\" and that the party was committed to its aim of generating all electricity without using fossil fuels by 2030. <br/>\"It's the outcome that matters\u2026 the funding isn't the sole issue,\" he added. <br/>Be bolder, Unite union leader urges Starmer<br/>Kuenssberg: What could go wrong for Keir Starmer?<br/>Labour waters down \u00a328bn green projects pledge<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

The Asia Pacific is going to be responsible for at least 50% of global growth that we're expecting between now and 2035.\"<br/>The treaty will be scrutinised and ratified by members before coming into force, which could take at least a year.<br/>As it announced the signing of the deal, the government said CPTPP-owned businesses employed about 400,000 people across the UK.<br/>It also said that CPTPP companies \"punch above their weight economically\", as while they account for 0.3% of all businesses in the UK, they generate 6.1% of total turnover.<br/>Business lobby group the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said the deal was \"good news for UK businesses to enter or upscale their trade in these markets\".<br/>\"We see particular relevance for small- and medium-sized businesses in reduced costs to import components from member countries to use in manufactured goods for export,\" said William Bain, the BCC's head of trade policy.<br/>However, there have been some doubts expressed. Paul Nowak, general secretary of the TUC trade union body, said the pact was \"bad for workers at home and abroad\".<br/>\"Once again, Conservative ministers have turned a blind eye to egregious human and workers' rights abuses in their pursuit of trade deals,\" he said.<br/>Concern has also been expressed over how the UK intends to make sure that environmental and animal welfare standards are met.<br/>The chair of the John Lewis Partnership, Dame Sharon White, told the Laura Kuenssberg programme that she would like to hear more on the impact on British farmers.<br/>She said she would want to be sure that \"we're not undercutting British farmers, we are not undercutting great animal welfare standards in this country that we've had for many, many years\".<br/>\"I think that matters to many people.\"<br/>Overall, she said that while signing the CPTPP was \"obviously a positive\u2026 I don't think it's going to be a gangbusters substantive shift\".<br/>Questioned on why the UK has not yet signed a free trade agreement (FTA) with the US, Ms Badenoch said that was due to the change in government.<br/>\"Yes, it was expected that we would sign an FTA with the US, but that was with a different president.  You cannot force a country to do something if its administration changes.\"<br/>On the issue of whether China should be allowed to join the CPTPP, Ms Badenoch said that was \"one of the things that we have been discussing\".<br/>However, when pressed on whether the UK should veto China's membership, as some have suggested, she said: \"When you join a club, the very first thing you don't do is tell the other club members who should be or shouldn't be allowed to join.\"<br/>UK agrees to join Asia's trade club - but what is it?<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

There had been years of vicious infighting, and agonies over antisemitism. <br/>By any measure, restoring the party to a credible political organisation is an enormous accomplishment. <br/>Without question, Sir Keir has been helped by the Conservatives' rolling series of crises - the chaos of Boris Johnson's downfall, the market meltdown of Liz Truss' several dozens of days in office, and now the profound problems in the economy. <br/>But even with the much more ordered regime of Rishi Sunak, Labour has managed to stay significantly ahead in the polls, making important advances in local elections, and soon to be tested again in a flurry of by-elections you can read about here. <br/>As a result of a solid and sustained opinion poll lead, Labour is thinking not just about how to win anymore, but in detail about what they would do if they get there. <br/>Sir Keir is the first to warn of complacency, repeatedly telling his team to fight \"like they are five points behind\". <br/>But there is no question he is mulling over how he would govern. <br/>\"He is thinking, I want to be ready and I want to be a good prime minister,\" says an ally. <br/>Another source tells me he is already using a red box system, like a prime minister would. <br/>\"Everything goes in by late afternoon with a hard deadline and he spends his evenings poring over papers, ideas, drafts, or submissions\", all dealt with by the morning. <br/>But it may be more than a year still until he has the chance to swap the bag that holds his papers for a real government red box. And there is still an awful lot that could go wrong. <br/>Sensing the opportunity and worrying it could go south is \"scary as hell\", says a shadow minister. <br/>There is a widespread awareness that Labour's massive lead now is likely to narrow as a general election comes closer. <br/>The Tories \"aren't dead\", says one shadow minister and their party HQ has one of the most successful campaign fighting records in the Western world.  <br/>And the first rule of politics is always, learn to count. <br/>A whopping national poll lead does not automatically translate into winning many more seats in a general election, as one Labour MP in a tightly-fought constituency worries - \"The biggest danger is that you rack up big majorities and don't seal the deal with enough of the seats\". <br/>Sir Keir's team can't change the fact that Labour fell so far behind in 2019 that winning an overall majority isn't just climbing a mountain, more scaling the Himalayas. They also of course, like any political organisation, can't control unforeseen events that can shape how voters make decisions.<br/>Not much however is without risk, even issues that ought to be within Starmer's control. <br/>First, one source half jokes what could go wrong is \"The Labour Party\"! <br/>The danger is \"it loses discipline and focus and makes unforced errors\", they tell me. <br/>\"It's been 20 years since we won a general election\", they add, and the party simply doesn't have the habit. <br/>A shadow minister says \"we have to hold our nerve\" and not make any mistakes, or give into pressure from the left of the party. <br/>The leadership has been accused of control freakery, trying to suppress the left, expelling party members unfairly. <br/>But a source says the danger of disputes with the left is \"way down the risk register\", the focus has to be on potential voters. <br/>One shadow minister believes Sir Keir thinks \"I can't be in government and dependent on these people\".<br/>The logic goes that battles with the left over who gets to run as a Labour MP now are well worth having to avoid having an awkward squad that could make life difficult in Parliament later. Particularly if Labour has to try to run the country as a minority government or with a tiny majority.<br/>The leadership's most central strategy is one of the reasons why there are grumbles on the left - and that is risky too. <br/>As we heard from Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves last week, and Sir Keir is likely to argue in our interview on Sunday morning, Labour has put watching the pennies strictly at the top of its list. <br/>With the economy in serious trouble, they share some of the ethos of the current government, however uncomfortable that might feel, that now is not the time for huge spending or huge tax cuts. <br/>That discipline means the party has dropped or watered down some promises that activists loved - the plan for free university tuition in England, delaying big spending proposals for green projects. <br/>No-one is getting promises from Rachel Reeves' cheque book, as we talked about last week.<br/>It has had an effect on the leader's reputation. <br/>One union leader says Starmer has \"had the blame for shifts in policy that have made him look a bit shifty\". <br/>And there is concern that all the talk of keeping a lid on spending on what Keir Starmer once described as \"good Labour things\" will lead voters to wonder what Labour really would offer. <br/>Another senior figure tells me: \"The economy is on its knees - sitting there saying, we are very sensible, who is going to listen to that?\"<br/>There is also a question of the political argument being made.<br/>Keir Starmer and his team have made the case for many years that the deep roots of many of the country's problems relate to the austerity of the coalition years, when George Osborne kept strict limits on spending. <br/>But if Labour's plan does not include filling in the holes financially to undo that damage, does that stack up? <br/>One of his MPs, not from the far left of the party, ponders \"it is pretty hard to criticise this government without acknowledging the damage that austerity has caused, and then not say you would spend more\u2026 no-one really believes that he wouldn't spend more\".  As Labour approaches its National Policy Forum next week, an important powwow with activists and unions, calls for more ambition, like from the leader of the Unite union, Sharon Graham, may become familiar.  <br/>The leadership's answer? <br/>Stressing the importance of reforming and improving public services, and getting the economy growing without spending billions extra and certainly not borrowing without good reason. <br/>Labour's top team is stuck like glue to the idea that they have to show they would keep a tight grip on public spending, almost as if they are traumatised by past elections when the Conservatives have run the attack that they would splash the cash. <br/>A senior figure suggests the leadership is \"very nervous about making any wrong moves on the economy\". <br/>But those at the top believe the messiness of the past few months, particularly the rising cost of mortgages, make discipline even more important. <br/>One shadow minister says: \"The mortgage stuff hits homeowners in places like Stevenage and Luton, swing voters, who are looking for people who are serious on the economy.\"<br/>But insiders acknowledge turning discipline into electoral excitement might not be easy. Making promises about abstract reform doesn't necessarily get voters running to the polling booths. <br/>As Parliament packs up for the summer, there is no question that Sir Keir Starmer has cause to be confident. His party is well ahead, but risk is all around. <br/>There are traps to avoid, big decisions to take, many thousands of miles of campaigning still to go.  <br/>With less time to play football, the Labour leader now tries to stay in a hotel with a gym, to run on a treadmill. <br/>After more than three years in the job, even having clocked up many successes, he knows the journey to the job he craves in Number 10 is still a marathon, not a sprint. <br/>Follow Laura on Twitter<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

It is expected to be towed to Portland in the coming days.<br/>The BBC's west of England correspondent Dan Johnson has been to see how people on the island are reacting to this new and controversial government policy. <br/>\"They think Portland's a dumping ground,\" Charles Richards says. <br/>\"They've dumped it here because they think we don't matter and they think we won't make a fuss. Portland has been treated with contempt.\"<br/>The 78-year-old has lived his entire life on the island.<br/>We settle on his garden wall overlooking the port where he worked for the Ministry of Defence (MoD), packing missiles. It seems everyone here is connected to the military or the prison service.<br/>\"Portland has always been exploited,\" he continues. <br/>\"The stone firms exploited the land and dug great holes in it. The MoD exploited it to make fortifications and naval bases. The government used it for prisoners. We've had people dumped on us for a long time.\"<br/>Portland is one of those places on the edge, an extremity of England dangling from the Dorset coast by the fine thread of Chesil beach. <br/>I notice a sign in a neighbour's window: \"Keep Portland weird.\" <br/>It only takes 10 minutes to drive from end to end, but it is not insular and there's a sense this rugged, weather-beaten landscape bears more than its fair share of our national weight.<br/>Between the quarries that sent bright, white stone to face Buckingham Palace and St Paul's Cathedral sits His Majesty's Prison The Verne, home to 580 sex offenders - recently reported to include Gary Glitter. Then there's HMP Portland with another 500 inmates.<br/>Completing an unholy trinity of incarceration used to be the prison ship HMP Weare - a \"temporary measure\" to ease overcrowding that lasted eight years. Its 400 prisoners put the proportion of the island's population held behind bars then at 11%. <br/>Now another barge is heading for the same spot. It is the flagship of the government's latest plan to \"stop the boats\" and deter dangerous channel crossings. <br/>Dorset Council is receiving \u00a31.7m over the planned 18-month duration of the vessel's stay in the port - based on \u00a33,500 per bed space, with a further \u00a3377,000 available to fund support and activities its residents. <br/>Although Councillor Laura Beddow says the authority had \"serious concerns\" and believes Portland is the wrong place to site a barge, she admits: \"We are in a position where we have statutory services we must provide.\"<br/>The Home Office claims the vessel will ease the pressure on the asylum system.<br/>However, it has amassed opposition from a wide range of voices, here and beyond, and there is still hope a legal challenge could be mounted.<br/>\"People are worried about these young blokes,\" Mr Richards says.<br/>\"What are they going to be doing? Wandering about? We don't know what they'll get up to, where they're going to go, or who they're going to mix with. Are they going to be involved in drug dealing? It's something we don't need.\"<br/>I hear the same questions between the clanking bowls on the green at Victoria Gardens. <br/>\"Yes, they have to go somewhere,\" Kathy Smith agrees.<br/>\"But for a barge to come here\u2026 our infrastructure on the island is very difficult. We've got one road on, one road off. We have problems getting doctors' appointments as it is - will they get priority?\"<br/>The same concerns are echoed on protest banners, amplified in Facebook groups and aired during a fiery public meeting. <br/>Representatives of the town and county councils, the local NHS and Dorset Police face angry residents, joined on a temperamental video link by officials from the Home Office.<br/>One lady fears for the safety of women and girls. Another worries about conditions for those on board. There are questions about mental health support for the migrants, their spiritual wellbeing and how free they will be to come and go. <br/>Is this really cheaper than using hotels? What about security? And who should be guarded from who? <br/>Some reckon the drab accommodation block will put off tourists. Everyone - local officials included - are enraged by the lack of consultation. <br/>There are not many answers or much detail. The man from the Home Office describes an \"emergency situation\", saying the asylum seekers have all passed initial assessment and been checked against police and immigration databases. <br/>He talks about devising \"activities for those on board that help occupy their time productively\". There's derision. \"You're a liar and a coward,\" one man shouts.<br/>Then the discussion turns to the state of Portland's public services. \"It can take four weeks to see a doctor,\" a woman complains. There is no dentist and the pharmacy's overrun, the meeting hears. <br/>Some feel anti-social behaviour is beyond control already - the island has more lighthouses than police officers.<br/>The officials seem stunned. They promise more information and improved services but then they admit that all 500 men will have to be registered with GPs in the area. <br/>It is too much for one chap who bellows: \"If we go to our health centre and it is clogged up with asylum seekers there will be a kick back, because we are fed up to the back teeth. You can't even give us proper healthcare now. It's disgusting and you should be ashamed.\"<br/>In amongst these concerns are hints of prejudice and flashes of racism. Some want to make much broader points.<br/>\"These people are not refugees,\" another man shouts. <br/>\"They're not coming from a war-torn country, they are economic migrants.\" <br/>Ms Beddow suggests comments about immigration policy need to be directed to the government. <br/>As the chair struggles to wrap up the debate another man shouts one final comment: \"Where is your duty of care to us? We should come first.\"<br/>It is an awkward collision of central policy and local experience. It reveals a powerful sense of a community feeling forgotten, with emotions stirred by the very thing - the barge - designed to reassure voters that asylum seekers are not living in taxpayer-funded luxury.<br/>Back on the bowling green, Tim Munro, a former mayor of Portland, sums it up for me: \"We really don't want the nightmare scenario to come true, that we have lots of young men looking for things to do around the island.\" <br/>I question why his presumption is so negative.<br/>\"They can't work,\" he says. \"And clearly they're not going to sit on a boat in Portland Harbour all the time so what are they going to do? I don't know, so I can only imagine the bad things that might happen.\"<br/>Mr Munro reminds me the island accommodated thousands of young men when the Navy ran the port - \"boozing and doing what young men do,\" he says.

For households who pay their bills by direct debit, the support was given automatically through monthly payments from October to March.<br/>But people who live off-grid, on narrow boats, travellers, people in park homes and some tenants and people on heat networks, did not automatically receive the support, because they did not have an energy provider. <br/>The government set up the Alternative Funding scheme for the over 900,000 households in those categories. It also applied to people living in care homes, who are charged for energy costs in their bills.<br/>But only 141,000 bill-payers managed to apply for and receive the subsidy before the scheme closed on 31 May. <br/>There remain 750,000 eligible households who have missed out on the \u00a3400 support payment.<br/>PHD student Sheree Smith said she spent more time at university than at her flat so she didn't have to pay higher energy bills.<br/>She told BBC Breakfast: \"I was really hoping that \u00a3400 would have helped me to weather the storm so I could stay in my flat, but ultimately it didn't come in time. <br/>\"I ended up having to return to my parents.\"<br/>Mr MacNeil, a former SNP member, who now sits as an independent and chairs Parliament's energy security and net zero committee, said the scheme should be improved and extended so that people could claim the subsidy they were entitled to.<br/>\"A lot of these will be vulnerable people who are particularly suffering the bite of the energy price spike and government should be moving heaven and earth almost, to make sure these people are getting the money,\" Mr MacNeil said in an interview with the BBC's Money Box programme.<br/>In his role as chair of the parliamentary committee, Mr MacNeil is due to question Energy Security and Net Zero Secretary Grant Shapps in September. Mr MacNeil said he would ask him to relaunch the scheme and make it easier to use, since \"clearly delivery has failed\".<br/>Some applicants criticised the scheme for being too complex or not recognising their circumstances. Others said their applications were repeatedly rejected, despite being eligible.<br/>A government spokesperson said: \"We spent billions to protect families when prices rose over winter, covering nearly half a typical household's energy bill.<br/>\"We're now seeing costs fall even further with wholesale energy prices down by over two thirds since their peak.\"<br/>You can hear more on this story on the Money Box podcast after broadcast.<br/>Follow Money Box or Dan on Twitter.<br/>Additional reporting by Daniel Wainwright<br/>More than 700,000 miss out on energy bill support<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

If they push those ideas, politicians tend to move when they speak to voters.\"  <br/>Her over-arching criticism is that Labour's leadership is not setting out a distinctive enough alternative to the government, and feels too constrained by the state of the economy.<br/>She argued that \"we need be as bold as the 1945 Labour government\" which created the NHS. \"There wasn't much money about then, I can tell you,\" she said. <br/>The next Labour government could leave a lasting legacy, she suggested. <br/>\"People will say they remember when energy companies were privatised and when they paid massive bills, and it was a Labour government that stopped all that.\"  <br/>The Labour leadership would argue that unless the party is trusted on the economy, many of the things trade unions want - like increased employment rights - simply won't happen.<br/>Its strategists also believe that it has to be seen to be moving away from Corbyn-era policies to win back voters who abandoned the party in 2019.<br/>But Ms Graham told me that abiding strictly by shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves's \"fiscal rules\" had led to \"inertia\", and people were beginning to ask: \"What's the difference?\" between government and opposition.<br/>\"If Labour are saying what's happening now is awful, and it is absolutely awful, they have to come out with solutions to that.\"<br/>While Labour is criticising the number of children in poverty, its shadow ministers have been told they can't commit, for example, to provide free school meals for all primary children, because that would be a spending commitment. <br/>Ms Graham said the party must \"talk about what they can do to change Britain. People want something to vote for.\"<br/>She told her members this week that maintaining Unite's financial link to Labour would give her \"maximum leverage\" with the party.<br/>But so far she hasn't moved policy on energy and steel. So by guaranteeing funds to Sir Keir Starmer, wasn't she actually reducing her bargaining power?<br/>\"The affiliation fee is what you pay to be part of the club. But most of the money we gave Labour traditionally was outside the affiliation fee,\" she said. <br/>For example, the union donated an additional \u00a33m to Labour before the last election. <br/>But Ms Graham warned there were \"no blank cheques\".<br/>\"I want to see some movement if we are going to give what we usually give...

It says nearly 300m e-cigarettes (disposable and otherwise) were sold in the UK over the last year. <br/>Elfbar and Lost Mary, which are made by the same Chinese firm, Shenzhen Imiracle Technology Co, made up more than half that number. That is an increase of more than four times compared to their sales the year before. <br/>Councillor David Fothergill, chairman of the LGA\u2019s Community Wellbeing Board, said: \u201cDisposable vapes are fundamentally flawed in their design and inherently unsustainable products, meaning an outright ban will prove more effective than attempts to recycle more vapes.\u201d<br/>Councils are not against vaping altogether as they believe vapes are less harmful than tobacco and can help smokers to quit.<br/>John Dunne, director general of the UK Vaping Industry Association, said that the \u201clow price, accessibility and ease of use\u201d of disposable products had helped bring UK smoking rates to an \"all-time low\u201d.<br/>\u201cThe vape industry is working hard to minimise its environmental impact, but this is mainly a consumer education issue about how to dispose of used vapes, which overall are evidenced to be highly recyclable,\" he said.<br/>He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"Disposables have been around for well over a decade and provide a low priced accessible product that helps smokers to quit smoking tobacco.\".<br/>A blanket ban could see \u201cpotentially deadly\u201d black market products flood the UK, Mr Dunne warned.<br/>Selling vapes and e-cigarettes to under 18s is illegal in the UK.<br/>Lancashire County Council director of public health Dr Sakthi Karunanithi said vaping had originally been seen as a way to curtail the harm caused by tobacco, but said there was a marketing problem.<br/>He told BBC Breakfast the advertising was \"unvetted and unscrupulous\".<br/>Councils are also worried that disposable varieties with \u201cfruity and bubble gum flavours, and colourful child-friendly packaging\u201d could appeal to under-age vapers, and called for restrictions on their display and marketing, similar to those used for conventional tobacco.<br/>The anti-smoking charity ASH said it did not support a ban, as it would \"turbo-charge\" illegal sales, increasing the risk that children would be able to buy them. It favours higher taxes on disposables and stronger controls on import and sales, deputy chief executive Hazel Cheeseman said.<br/>A spokeswoman for Elfbar said the firm is working on developing a \"comprehensive programme\" to safeguard and protect children.<br/>\"Simply calling for a ban on single use vapes will do nothing to tackle these issues,\" she said.<br/>\"The illicit market will simply fill the void with products that are unlicensed and unregulated containing substances that potentially pose a health risk.\"<br/>A government spokesperson said it was also concerned about the use of vaping products, particularly among young people. Earlier this year it launched a consultation looking into the environmental and health impacts of vaping, and is considering responses.<br/>\u201cWe strongly encourage all consumers to consider the environment and dispose of electrical waste, including by making use of take-back schemes at participating retailers,\u201d the spokesperson said.<br/>In Scotland, Lorna Slater, Minister for Circular Economy, said in June that single use vapes had become a \"big problem - for our environment, local communities and young people,\u201d and promised to announce new plans in the autumn. <br/>Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>Millions of vapes littered in Scotland, says report<br/>High lead and nickel levels found in illegal vapes<br/>New measures to crack down on illegal teen vaping<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Wethersfield Airfield in Essex to house up to 1,700 men.<br/>West Lindsey District Council was challenging similar plans for RAF Scampton in Lincolnshire.<br/>The court has ruled that points made by both councils needed a fresh hearing.<br/>This week's two-day hearing began on Wednesday as the first 46 migrants began arriving at Wethersfield.<br/>The councils made the challenge in conjunction with Gabriel Clarke-Holland, who lives about 80ft from one of Wethersfield's gates. <br/>Reserving judgement until Friday, Mrs Justice Thornton has ruled that two of 15 points made by the authorities and Mr Clarke-Holland could be considered at a further hearing.<br/>\"The decision to accommodate asylum seekers on the sites may give rise to strong local opinion,\" she said, adding that there might also be wider discussions about the welfare of the migrants.<br/>\"Those are not, however, matters for the court,\" the judge added.<br/>The judge said one of the issues to be considered at a further hearing was the potential use of \"emergency\" planning powers by the Home Office.<br/>The High Court previously heard from the government that the planning law which would allow the airfields to be used for housing migrants covered the change of use of the bases to prevent or mitigate an emergency which \"threatens serious damage to human welfare\".<br/>The two councils and Mr Clarke-Holland have challenged the use of these planning powers, while the Home Office argued their use was justified.<br/>In written submissions made on behalf of the government department, Paul Brown KC said there were \"misapprehensions\" underpinning claims by both councils and Mr Clarke-Holland.<br/>He said none had raised \"any arguable point\".<br/>The councils previously lost bids for legal injunctions preventing the government using the bases for migrants.<br/>On Wednesday, the Home Office said it planned for Wethersfield to be \"fully operational\" by the autumn.<br/>West Lindsey District Council said it understood the first asylum seekers would arrive at Scampton in mid-August.<br/>Chief executive of the refugee charity Care4Calais, Steve Smith, said: \"Refugees should be treated with dignity and housed in communities, not warehoused in disused barracks and barges.<br/>\"Care4Calais witnessed the horrors of poor institutional accommodation at Napier Barracks [in Kent] and we've supported people in their recovery from the aftermath of that scandal.\"<br/>The government's \"rhetoric and demonisation of refugees\" was at the heart of plans to house asylum seekers at bases and was \"totally unnecessary\", he added.<br/>Braintree District Council's lawyers told the hearing that the Home Office had failed to take into account issues including access to healthcare and waste water provision.<br/>Following the ruling, Graham Butland, Conservative leader at Braintree, said: \"We are grateful to have had another opportunity to put our views and the views of our local community across to the High Court at this initial stage, as we still believe Wethersfield Airfield is not a suitable site for these plans.\"<br/>The council would continue to work with the Home Office and other partners to minimise the impact on residents  while supporting asylum seekers coming to the district, he said.<br/>West Lindsey District Council wants to use Scampton for aviation, heritage, tourism, education and research, with a deal to develop the site through partners Scampton Holdings Limited announced in March.<br/>Lawyers for the council told the High Court the project would create thousands of skilled jobs, but there were growing concerns that the investors might scrap plans if the government proposals for the site were implemented.<br/>Trevor Young, Liberal Democrat leader at West Lindsey, welcomed the judge's ruling. <br/>Going forward he said the council must \"balance our legal process with our duty of care as a local authority, to hold the Home Office to account on their proposals\".<br/>\"We will continue to raise our concerns with the Home Office so it can put in place mitigating actions. We will also continue to push for open and transparent engagement with our community,\" he said.<br/>Conservative MP for Gainsborough, Sir Edward Leigh, said he was \"absolutely delighted\" by the ruling and called the Home Office plans \"perverse\". <br/>Peter Hewitt of Scampton Holdings said the decision was a \"major step forward for common sense\". <br/>A Home Office spokesperson said: \"As this matter is subject to ongoing litigation it would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage.<br/>\"We remain committed to deliver accommodation on surplus military sites which are not only more affordable for taxpayers, helping to reduce the use the \u00a36million daily cost of hotels but are also more manageable for local communities.\"<br/>Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

Yes, they are high by historic standards too.<br/>So how is this being paid for?<br/>Ministers have been scrabbling about looking for money within existing budgets. The additional cost of these plans is around \u00a32bn.<br/>About half of that, they hope, will be raised by cranking up the cost of visas and the surcharge that migrants have to pay to use the NHS.<br/>What about the other half, the best part of a billion pounds?<br/>This is the chunk being looked for by what are described by those in government as \"underspends and reallocations.\"<br/>They are not keen on using the word cuts.<br/>Whatever the word you use, what this amounts to is money that had been allocated to one pot, being taken out of it and put into the pay pots.<br/>The government, just like the rest of us, can't spend the same pound twice.<br/>And so the priority has still to be decided. So, what won't be happening because of these pay rises that might otherwise have happened?<br/>Officials haven't given many examples, even though the process of moving money around has been completed.<br/>Two of the examples offered are a freeze on civil servant recruitment in the Ministry of Defence and offering fewer traineeships in the civil service.<br/>And where are Labour in all this? <br/>It is striking that Keir Starmer did not directly criticise the government's announcement. They are offers for workers and unions to consider and he had little to add, he said.<br/>The big question now is what difference will these pay offers make? Will they stop the strikes?<br/>The leadership of the teaching unions have welcomed the settlement they have been offered.<br/>So much so that Mary Bousted, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union, put her name to a joint statement with the prime minister.<br/>The Sunak-Bousted double act is not something many would have imagined a few months back.<br/>But, as ever, it will be up to union members to decide whether they accept these suggestions.<br/>And some are lukewarm at best.<br/>The doctors' union the BMA and Unite, a huge trade union, are both sounding very sceptical.<br/>It is a reminder than in an era of high taxes, high government spending, high inflation and stagnant growth, there are few easy answers for any of us: workers, unions, opposition parties or the government.<br/>Why is UK inflation so high?<br/>Teachers' strikes: When, where and why?<br/>Record pay rises fuel fresh inflation fears<br/>Public sector workers offered pay rises of around 6%<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

To be able to talk to somebody face-on, to be able to smile at somebody, is something I haven't done for several years.\"<br/>Disappearing Dentists<br/>Some people are going to extraordinary measure to do DIY dentistry as they struggle to find affordable dental care. Are we witnessing the death of NHS dentistry? <br/>Watch now on BBC iPlayer<br/>Ensuring that everyone who needs an NHS dentist is able to access one within a reasonable timeframe and a reasonable distance, is one of the key recommendations in the report.<br/>Other recommendations include:<br/>\"We are concerned this will be too little too late for those dentists who have already left the NHS,\" the report says. <br/>It adds the current dental contract, which pays dentists for batches or courses of treatments delivered rather than for every single item or procedure, such as a check-up or a filling, is not fit for purpose.<br/>The system of paying NHS \"units of dental activity\" (UDAs) can be a disincentive to dentists seeing new patients, including those who have higher levels of disease and require more time to treat, the report warns.<br/>The British Dental Association (BDA) told the committee: \"We have a higher award for treating three or more teeth, but many of the new patients presenting to dentists and their teams now have far more disease than that. People have not been able to present [during Covid restrictions]. They are presenting much later; they have far more disease and the disease is often more complex to treat.\"<br/>The BDA says workload backlogs, made worse by Covid, will take many years to clear. <br/>Some dental practices are struggling to deliver their NHS contractual commitments, often simply as a result of being unable to fill vacancies, the association claims.<br/>The government says it recently announced a 40% increase in dentistry training places and has made changes \"so dental therapists and hygienists can deliver more treatments\". <br/>\"We invest more than \u00a33bn a year in dentistry and have already increased the funding practices receive for high needs patients to encourage dentists to provide more NHS treatments,\" said a spokesperson from the Department of Health and Social Care. <br/>It says the NHS dental contract has been reformed to encourage more dentists to provide NHS treatments and to allow dental therapists and hygienists to offer extra services. <br/>The government also said it would set out further measures \"to improve access shortly\". <br/>Louise Ansari from Healthwatch England said: \"Ultimately, only a fundamental and fully resourced dental contract reform can tackle these deep-seated problems, and we call on the government to publish its dental recovery plan urgently.\"<br/>Are you struggling to find an NHS dentist?

(It uses the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) measure, which tracks the price of a typical basket of goods).<br/>At the time the PM stated his intentions - in January, many experts already expected inflation in the UK to drop. <br/>But prices have continued to increase since the pledge, and inflation did not drop as predicted between April and May, remaining at 8.7%.<br/>However, in June, it fell to 7.9%, its lowest level in more than a year.<br/>Analysts remain divided about whether the PM's goal will be achieved.<br/>When will we know? Inflation figures for the fourth quarter of 2023 will be published on 17 January 2024.<br/>Downing Street said the pledge to \"grow the economy\" will be met if the economy is bigger in October-December 2023 than it was during the previous quarter (July-September).<br/>It is using GDP (or Gross Domestic Product), a measure of all the activity of companies, governments and individuals.<br/>This would not normally be seen as a difficult pledge, because the UK's economy is usually growing.<br/>But there has not been a lot of growth recently, and the UK economy is still smaller than it was before the pandemic.<br/>The pledge to grow the economy is made more difficult by the government's promise to halve inflation.<br/>The Bank of England has been putting up interest rates in an attempt to reduce spending and stop prices rising so quickly.<br/>However, this slows economic growth.<br/>When will we know? GDP for the fourth quarter of 2023 will be published on 13 February 2024.<br/>When governments talk about debt falling, they almost always mean as a proportion of GDP.<br/>The idea is that debt is falling if it is growing more slowly than the economy.<br/>But debt rose above 100% of GDP for the first time since 1961.<br/>And if Mr Sunak does not achieve his second priority of growing the economy, then cutting debt becomes even harder.<br/>The deadline for this pledge is not clear.<br/>In the Budget in March, the government claimed to be on track because the independent Office for Budget Responsibility - which checks the health of the economy - forecast that debt as a proportion of GDP would fall in 2027-28.<br/>But what it actually said was that it would rise from 88.9% in 2022 to 94.8% in 2026-27, before falling slightly to 94.6% in 2027-28. And it issued some stark warnings about the sustainability of UK debt.<br/>When will we know? The next debt forecasts will be published alongside the 2023 Autumn Statement. <br/>Mr Sunak said: \"NHS waiting lists will fall and people will get the care they need more quickly.\"<br/>His pledge only refers to waiting lists in England, because Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland manage their own health systems.<br/>However, the overall number of patients waiting for treatment in England rose from 7.42 million in April, to 7.47 million in May.<br/>Mr Sunak has claimed that he is cutting waiting lists, but that is only true of certain lists. <br/>The number of people waiting more than 18 months, for example, fell between April and May.<br/>The NHS target is to see people within 18 weeks for non-urgent consultant-led treatment.<br/>We asked Downing Street when the prime minister aims to have waiting lists falling. <br/>It pointed us towards the plan for tackling the backlog of elective care (care planned in advance), which said the overall waiting list was expected to be falling by about March 2024.  <br/>When will we know?: Waiting list figures are usually published on the second Thursday of each month. <br/>The final priority was to stop the small boats which bring people across the English Channel, after 45,755 migrants crossed over from France in 2022. <br/>The prime minister proposed to do this through new legislation. The government finally passed its Illegal Migration Bill on 17 July, ending a long-running stand-off between MPs and Lords.<br/>Mr Sunak has said that his plan to tackle small boat crossings is \"starting to work\".<br/>However, most arrivals cross the Channel in the summer months. As at 16 July, 13,200 had done so. That figure includes 3,824 in June, the highest number for any June on record.<br/>When will we know?

The incumbent, John Masefield, had died after 37 years in the post.<br/>It was the middle of the so-called \"swinging '60s\" and the idea of a poet laureate seemed archaic to many.<br/>But poetry was increasingly popular, thanks to the work of a new generation of writers, like Allen Ginsberg in the US, and the Liverpool poets in Britain.<br/>Harold Wilson, the prime minister, was in no rush to make a decision. John Hewitt, who was appointments secretary at Number 10, was told to investigate potential candidates.<br/>Other stories from the National Archives:<br/>He approached leading figures in the arts, as well as dons at Oxford and Cambridge. Dame Helen Gardner, Merton Professor of English at Oxford, had some \"fairly caustic\" comments about the \"present quality of poetry\" and the \"lack of any outstanding talent\", the papers reveal. <br/>Auden was excluded because he was an American citizen. John Betjeman was one of the most popular poets. But Dame Helen described him as \"a lightweight, amusing but rather trivial\". He had \"critical views about the establishment\", she said, which were deemed to be not appropriate.<br/>Robert Graves was \"probably the best poet available\", she added, but his \"manner of life must surely rule him out\". Graves had criticised the role and spent most of his time in Majorca.<br/>The popular poet Stevie Smith she dismissed as \"absurd\". She \"wrote 'little girl poetry' about herself mostly.\" Cecil Day-Lewis was \"a possible\" - he produced \"run of the mill poetry but nothing particularly outstanding\".<br/>That view was echoed by the chair of the Poetry Society, Geoffrey Handley-Taylor. He told Hewitt that Graves was \"too peculiar\" and \"too anti-establishment\". Betjeman, he said, \"called himself a poetic hack and there was some truth to this\".<br/>He described Smith as \"unstable\". By contrast Day-Lewis was \"a good administrative poet\" and \"a safe bet\".<br/>As the months passed, more names were put forward. Some nominated themselves. Allen Ginsberg proposed the singer Donovan, just 21, whose work \"Sunshine Superman\" and \"Mellow Yellow\" had topped the charts. In August, Ginsberg sent a hand drawn \"flower card\" to Number 10 with the words \"Donovan for Laureate\".  Officials did not respond.<br/>On September 14, 1967, Hewitt wrote to the prime minister proposing Day-Lewis. The alternative, Betjeman, would be a \"backward-looking choice\", he said. He had been described as \"the songster of tennis lawns and cathedral cloisters\". <br/>Harold Wilson agreed, but he wanted Hewitt to explore the possibility of appointing additional poets laureate for Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales. That was not pursued, and in January 1968, the announcement was made. <br/>But four years later, the search began again, after Day-Lewis died. <br/>Auden was again under consideration, according to newspaper reports, and apparently the bookies' favourite.<br/>Number 10 was warned by Ross McWhirter - of the Guinness Book of Records - that Auden was said to be the author of a \"pornographic\" poem entitled \"The Gobble\", published in an underground magazine. <br/>McWhirter worried that if Auden were selected this could \"bring disgrace upon the appointment\" and this would reflect on the Queen herself. The now-Sir John Hewitt told him Auden wasn't on the shortlist.<br/>This time Philip Larkin was under serious consideration - described by Hewitt as \"a first-rate craftsman\". But the critic Jon Stallworthy warned Larkin disliked public speaking. Officials were advised he was a \"reserved\" man who would not be an ambassador for poetry.<br/>The so-called \"poets' conference\", representing younger writers, suggested Adrian Mitchell and George MacBeth - but they didn't make it into the final selection.<br/>Then Prime Minister Ted Heath, picked Betjeman - who accepted, writing that he was \"honoured and delighted and at the same time humbled\".<br/>In 1984, a new laureate was needed, following Betjeman's death. There is no discussion of merit in the file. <br/>Mrs Thatcher's officials put together a list of names and recommendations. Larkin was the most popular choice, but one unnamed figure objected. <br/>Ted Hughes was picked, even though only two people proposed him - and no explanation was given.<br/>The trial of selecting a new laureate following the death of the previous one is now a thing of the past. Whereas it used to be a lifetime post, since 1999 the appointment has been for a fixed term of 10 years. Current incumbent Simon Armitage's tenure runs until 2029.<br/>Reacting to the newly declassified files, Mark Ford, Professor of English at University College London, said: \"The laureateship is such a peculiar role that finding a suitable candidate is not easy - 1967 was clearly a particularly trying year.\" <br/>Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>Blair was warned of 'appalling' UK attack after 9/11<br/>Blair was urged to back Ukraine's EU dream - records<br/>Poet laureate marks 100 years of the BBC<br/>Simon Armitage to be next Poet Laureate<br/>Zephaniah rules out being poet laureate<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

He also called for the UK to re-engage with the Taliban government and for Kabul's British embassy to reopen.<br/>He put out a tweet with a video saying that security was vastly improved, corruption reduced and the opium trade \"ended\".<br/>Some social media users criticised the comments, pointing out the massive curtailment of rights for women and girls under the Taliban government. <br/>Taliban chief spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, shared the video but erroneously described the Bournemouth East MP as \"a British reporter\".<br/>In his tweet, Mr Elwood wrote that the \"opium trade ended\" (although in the accompanying video he qualified it by saying the trade had \"all but disappeared\").<br/>However, this claim is incorrect.<br/>Opium cultivation in 2022 was up by 32% compared with 2021, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).<br/>The Taliban government took over in August 2021 and announced a ban on opium cultivation the following April. A BBC investigation this year found that this was beginning to have an effect with a huge fall in poppy production in major opium-growing provinces.<br/>However, the ban on production doesn't mean the end of the opium trade. Experts says that while production has significantly reduced in poppy-growing areas, the opium trade out of Afghanistan has not stopped.<br/>\"Given that prices have unsurprisingly increased and farmers or traders are stockpiling their inventories, it seems very unlikely that trading will or can be stopped,\" says Prof Jonathan Goodhand, an Afghanistan expert at SOAS University of London.<br/>Mr Ellwood told the BBC he was basing his claim on a visit to Helmand and Kandahar provinces, as well as his time in the capital, Kabul.<br/>He said: \"I'm sure it's still grown, but as a 'mass trade' the locals reported it is no longer there.\"<br/>Mr Ellwood also claimed corruption is down.<br/>He clarified to the BBC his observation was based on conversations with locals.<br/>Corruption in Afghanistan has fallen slightly in 2022, according to the Berlin-based group, Transparency International. It tracks public sector corruption using World Bank and World Economic Forum data.<br/>Last year, it placed Afghanistan at 150 out of the 180 countries included in its survey, up slightly from its 2021 ranking of 174, but still very low.<br/>Experts say this slight improvement might be because the massive inflows of military assistance and foreign aid spending have stopped, which some believe were fuelling local corruption.<br/>Prof Goodhand says the Taliban does have a \"commitment to tackle 'immoral' behaviour,\" but also warns that it may not last as petty corruption continues in the country.<br/>Jan Koehler, a researcher on Afghanistan at SOAS says there's evidence of other forms of corruption.<br/>He says this includes the \"misuse of power to get people into jobs, and personal ties enabling access to the Taliban very much improving ones chances to get one's way in land, water or other resource conflicts\". <br/>Mr Ellwood also claimed Afghanistan's security situation had \"vastly improved\".<br/>The number of casualties recorded since the Taliban government took over are well below figures from previous years, when foreign forces were still in the country.<br/>Between August 2021 and May 2023, total civilian casualties stood at 3,774, according to the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan.<br/>In the years before the takeover, levels of violence were much higher, with civilian casualties peaking in 2016 at over 11,000.<br/>But rebel groups like the local Islamic State group (which opposes the Taliban government) continue to target both Taliban members and civilians.<br/>The UN says that there has been a \"rise in attacks on places of worship and against minority groups\" by such groups.<br/>It also highlights violence directed by some Taliban members against civilian and military officials associated with the former Afghan government.<br/>As for women's safety, a survey conducted earlier this year by UN showed that 68% women believed their physical safety was \"very bad\" or \"bad\".<br/>The Taliban government has also imposed increasing restrictions on women and girls' ability to work, attend school and university or freely move in public spaces.<br/>What do you want BBC Verify to investigate?<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

They plan to continue these protests until Labour's annual party conference in October, and are not ruling out further disruption - including interrupting speeches - if Sir Keir fails to meet their demands.<br/>\"We're escalating our campaign against Labour now, because we want to influence their manifesto,\" says Hannah Martin, co-director of Green New Deal Rising.<br/>\"We want what they offer to voters to be something bold.\"<br/>Labour says it is already offering voters something bold - a plan to turn Britain into a \"clean energy superpower\".<br/>The plan involves creating a publicly owned energy company, insulating millions of homes, and using a national wealth fund to build green industries.<br/>\"Labour is the only party with a long-term mission to make Britain a clean energy superpower to cut bills, create jobs, provide energy security, and tackle the climate emergency,\" a Labour spokesperson said.<br/>The BBC has been told Green New Deal Rising has been offered a meeting with party officials, but has shown no interest.<br/>Instead, the group appears to have its sights set on Sir Keir and those at the top of the party. With no time for a chat in Gillingham, the wait for a meeting goes on.<br/>\"We were removed from the building,\" says Sophia Coningham, one of the activists involved in the Gillingham stunt.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Climate change protesters interrupt Sir Keir Starmer speech calling for a \"green new deal right now\"<br/>She says they gatecrashed the speech to remind Sir Keir that, \"to really stand up for young people, they need to commit to a green new deal\".<br/>\"There's a feeling that Labour is backsliding,\" says Ms Coningham, an 18-year-old who has just finished her A-levels.<br/>So what is a green new deal?<br/>Campaigners say it's a set of policy proposals to address the root causes of climate change while promoting a more sustainable model of economic growth. It harks back to the New Deal economic programme of 1930s US president Franklin D Roosevelt, and more recently, it's an idea that's been revived and modernised by Democratic politicians in the United States.<br/>It's been fiercely opposed by Republicans there. Donald Trump cast the Green New Deal as a socialist \"takeover\" when he was in the White House. <br/>Back in the UK, the idea has been floating around for more than a decade, with campaign groups and left-wing MPs - including Labour's shadow climate change secretary Ed Miliband - calling for different flavours of a green new deal.<br/>For the Conservatives, what they see as the economic dangers of funding such green policies through borrowing have been deployed as a political attack line against Labour.<br/>By the time Green New Deal Rising emerged in 2021, the notion of an economic approach centred on clean energy had entered the political mainstream.<br/>Even so, since its launch, the group of about 500 organisers and young climate activists has been lobbying Labour and claims its campaigning has influenced the party's energy policies.<br/>Now it is trying to push Labour to go even further.<br/>\"Part of why we took action last week was that we want to see a future government that's committed to the green new deal,\" says Ms Martin. \"We're not going to be silent.\"<br/>In a campaign targeted at Labour, Green New Deal Rising has put five demands to the party. One Labour source argues that two of the five demands - \"expand public ownership\" and \"tax wealth now\" - are not related to green policies.<br/>The other three demands include creating more green jobs, setting up a national nature service, and making polluting companies pay.<br/>\"What they're asking for isn't radical,\" says Labour MP Clive Lewis. \"If you look at the science, and what that's showing us on climate change, then their asks are quite mild.\"<br/>He describes recent briefings against activists as \"attempts by some close to the [Labour] leadership to put some distance between them and the climate movement\".<br/>With Prime Minister Rishi Sunak accusing Sir Keir of being in the pocket of \"eco-zealots\", some senior Labour figures have begun lashing out at climate protesters, with the Labour leader himself branding Just Stop Oil \"arrogant\".<br/>Mr Lewis says he hopes activists from Green New Deal Rising have \"done everything to engage with Labour MPs\" before resorting to disruptive tactics.<br/>\"If they feel they have no option but to do this, then that's their prerogative,\" he says. \"The danger is that this pushes politicians into a corner where they might react in a negative way. Politicians are human.\"<br/>If disruptive tactics became more commonplace, it's possible a more antagonistic relationship could develop between Labour and climate activists. <br/>That could risk alienating some younger voters, as Ms Coningham explains.<br/>\"I think Labour has to earn my vote and that means signing up to our demands,\" she says. \"Labour need to stop taking young people's votes for granted.\"<br/>Voters from younger generations who care about the climate are a big constituency and one that Labour will want to win over. As things stands, a more radical Labour plan on energy and climate seems unlikely, given the financial discipline the party has been signalling.<br/>But with the Labour manifesto yet to be completed, there is still time for minds to be changed - and a meeting or two perhaps.<br/>Labour waters down \u00a328bn green projects pledge<br/>Why has Labour U-turned on its green pledge?<br/>Sir Keir Starmer sets out Labour's green energy strategy<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

They will also discuss providing more weapons and ammunition. <br/>On the membership issue, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky wants Nato to say Ukraine could join as soon as possible after the fighting ends - setting out explicitly how and when this could be achieved. <br/>But some Nato nations are reluctant to go too far, fearing the promise of near-automatic membership could give Russia an incentive both to escalate and drag out the war. <br/>Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato secretary general, said no final decision had been made on the language of the final communiqu\u00e9, but added: \"I am absolutely certain that we will have unity and a strong message on Ukraine.\"<br/>But after late night talks on Monday, he announced that Turkey had agreed to support Sweden's application to join Nato. The news was welcomed by the US and Germany, as well as Sweden itself.<br/>Turkey had spent months blocking Stockholm's application, accusing it of hosting Kurdish militants. Mr Stoltenberg said the two sides had worked together to address Turkey's \"legitimate security concerns\".<br/>Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan earlier suggested he would back Sweden if the EU re-opened frozen membership talks with Ankara - a request that was rejected by EU officials.<br/>Over their two-day meeting, Nato leaders are expected to agree new plans to deter and defend the alliance against future Russian aggression by beefing up their forces in the east. <br/>And they are also expected to step up their financial commitment, making the target of spending 2% of national wealth on defence a minimum figure, rather than a general ambition. Rishi Sunak's spokesman said the UK prime minister would call on allies directly to meet this target. <br/>Security is tight in Vilnius, with Nato forces - including Patriot air defence missiles - defending a summit taking place only a short distance from Belarus and the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. <br/>The overarching aim of the meeting is for Nato to convince President Vladimir Putin of the alliance's long-term military commitment to Ukraine. <br/>Officials hope this could begin to change the Russian leader's thinking, putting doubt in his mind that he can outwait the West. <br/>As such, some see this summit as potentially as important as military gains on the battlefield in persuading Mr Putin to change his strategy. <br/>So some Nato members will promise Ukraine new security guarantees. US President Joe Biden has suggested Ukraine could get the kind of military support his country gives Israel - long-term commitments designed to deter potential aggressors. <br/>The alliance will also deepen its institutional links with Ukraine. An existing forum - the Ukraine Nato Commission - will be upgraded to a Ukraine Nato Council. This will give Ukraine the ability to summon meetings of the alliance as an equal partner round the table. \"The right to consult is not insignificant,\" said one official.<br/>But perhaps most importantly, some members are expected to set out more explicitly Ukraine's pathway to joining the alliance. <br/>Nato agreed at its 2008 summit in Bucharest that Ukraine \"will\" become a member and supported its application. But the alliance did not say how and when this might happen. Critics say giving Ukraine a destination but no itinerary allowed Mr Putin to risk his invasions in both 2014 and 2022. <br/>Mr Biden will meet Mr Zelensky at the summit, a US official told Reuters, although the Ukrainian president is yet to officially confirm his participation at the event.<br/>Kyiv accepts Nato cannot formally invite Ukraine to join while fighting rages. That would risk plunging the alliance into war with Russia, as Nato would be obliged under Article 5 of its treaty to defend any member that is under attack.<br/>Instead, Kyiv wants a clear promise of post-war membership with a timeline, so it knows victory will bring the security guarantee of Nato's nuclear umbrella.  <br/>One way for Nato to signal its desire to welcome Ukraine into its ranks would be to shorten the so-called membership application plan, known as the MAP. This is the formal process which tests whether a country meets Nato's strict military and governmental standards - and it can take decades. <br/>But it is what Nato might actually say about Ukraine's potential membership that is dividing the alliance. <br/>The Baltic states and eastern European nations are pushing for as much clarity as possible. They want the alliance to make clear how much progress Ukraine has made towards membership, especially how much more closely its army can operate with other Nato forces, now that it shares similar weapons and strategies. They also want Nato to make clear what further conditions Ukraine must meet to achieve membership. <br/>Gitanas Nauseda, the president of Lithuania, said Nato should avoid Ukraine's membership becoming a horizon: \"The more you walk towards it, the farther it is.\"<br/>But some allies - including the US and Germany - are cautious about promising Ukraine too much. They want Ukraine to do more to tackle corruption, strengthen its judiciary and ensure civilian control over its military. <br/>Some also worry about Nato getting dragged into open conflict with Russia. They fear promising Ukraine membership after the war would give Putin an incentive both to escalate the conflict and drag it out, maintaining low-intensity fighting to prevent Ukraine ever joining. <br/>Other allies also fear losing room for manoeuvre in any post-war negotiations. They want to use the promise of Nato membership as a carrot for Ukraine and a stick for Russia, but only after the fighting has ended. <br/>Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>What is Nato and when will Ukraine join?<br/>Why is US giving Ukraine 'abhorrent' weapons?<br/>Poland strengthens Belarus border over Wagner fears<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

The Deposit Return Scheme has been sent for recycling.<br/>A ban on alcohol advertising has been scotched; Highly Protected Marine Areas have sunk beneath the waves.<br/>In quite a few of these cases, Mr Yousaf may have been left with little choice.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Five things to know about Scotland's new first minister Humza Yousaf<br/>Questions abounded over how the care service would work and be paid for; the recycling plans were beset with issues including a stand-off with the UK government. <br/>The no-fishing zones had prompted a backbench rebellion spearheaded by Ms Forbes and former minister Fergus Ewing, who acted out the fury of coastal communities by shredding a consultation document in the chamber.<br/>But Mr Yousaf will also feel he has acted decisively to rip up the more controversial items left in his in-tray by Ms Sturgeon. <br/>Comprehensive changes have been made to the government's agenda in a short space of time.<br/>He has also moved to reset a number of relationships with groups which felt neglected by the previous administration.<br/>The first was with business groups, in part via the reboot on alcohol advertising and recycling. There is talk of reforming business rates, and a \"new deal\" with the private sector.<br/>He also signed a new pact with local government which is known as the Verity House Agreement.<br/>Although there is always furious spin around the figures, councils have borne the brunt of budget cuts in recent years.<br/>Mr Yousaf has promised a new \"fiscal framework\" between town halls and the administration in Edinburgh, along with \"improved engagement on budgetary matters\".<br/>Fine words - but they will need to be backed up with hard cash if that relationship is to truly improve.<br/>Has Mr Yousaf also reset relations between the SNP and its leadership?<br/>He has certainly tried to run his government out of a bigger tent. <br/>Ms Sturgeon was famous for keeping a very tight circle of advisors who micromanaged most aspects of policy.<br/>Mr Yousaf meanwhile has actively sought to push decisions and responsibility out to his ministers.<br/>His initial policy prospectus featured each cabinet secretary outlining their goals and duties in their own words, introduced with the words \"I commit that by 2026, I will have...\".<br/>That may give them more autonomy to make decisions to deliver on these targets, but on the flip side it likely means they will have to carry the can for any issues in their portfolio.<br/>The departure of several of Ms Sturgeon's top team from government means there is now an assortment of big names with big views on the back benches - which range along a spectrum of loyalty.<br/>The likes of John Swinney can be relied upon for unswerving support, while Fergus Ewing has ranged off into almost outright rebellion.<br/>MSPs with views differing from those of the leadership tended to be quite shy about airing them publicly when Ms Sturgeon was in charge, but that is no longer the case.<br/>A broader debate over the SNP's core policy - independence - has also flourished under Mr Yousaf.<br/>He has sought to establish himself as the \"first activist\", getting out on the doorsteps regularly - but he also carried responsibility for setting the course of the main pro-independence party.<br/>Ms Sturgeon generally sought to keep the membership marching along to the beat of a strategy she herself had drawn up.<br/>By contrast, Mr Yousaf's big speech to the SNP's independence convention last month instead embraced just about every possible plan.<br/>There are elements within the party which variously favour a gradual build-up of support; continued efforts to secure a referendum; forcing the issue via an election result; and doubling down on public events like marches.<br/>Mr Yousaf's approach is to encourage all of them. Perhaps that will serve to keep them all happy for now, but he may need to swing firmly behind one particular strategy come the party's autumn conference - which unlike the convention is a decision-making event where members get a vote.<br/>Ms Sturgeon kept the SNP together as an election-winning machine by corralling pro-independence figures from right across the political spectrum behind one tightly-controlled central vision.<br/>It remains to be seen whether her successor's more relaxed approach encourages healthy debate - or furious infighting.<br/>Looking ahead, one thing Mr Yousaf has retained from the Sturgeon era is her deal with the Greens.<br/>That was underlined when he stood up in the chamber to defend Green minister Lorna Slater from a confidence vote tabled by the Tories.<br/>That may have helped smooth over the fact that several totems of the Bute House Agreement - like HMPAs - have been ditched.<br/>The Greens will also hope to wield influence from within the big tent as Mr Yousaf draws up his own policy plans.<br/>He will spend the summer recess preparing his own Programme for Government - the things he is actually doing, rather than cancelling.<br/>However, budgets remain tight. New finance secretary Shona Robison has already warned of a \u00a31bn shortfall next year, and that could double within four years.<br/>So he may need to be pragmatic and cut his cloth. There is already talk of a retreat from \"universalism\", in particular when it comes to free school meals in secondary schools.<br/>Beyond that, a September court date has been set for the first round of the showdown with the UK government over their move to block Holyrood's gender reforms.<br/>Whoever loses will likely appeal to the Inner House, and eventually to the Supreme Court, so an issue which the government had hoped to put to bed by passing reforms could well follow Mr Yousaf right up to the next set of elections.<br/>And there is the small matter of that SNP conference, where Mr Yousaf has promised to bring forward the results of a party governance review as well as a finalised independence strategy.<br/>Yousaf confirmed as Scotland's new first minister<br/>Who is Scotland's new first minister, Humza Yousaf?

Around the world, governments that also oppose the popular technology are watching the showdown closely to see who will blink first.<br/>\"End-to-end encryption\", \"backdoors\" and \"client-side scanning\" - the biggest row in technology sounds very complicated.<br/>But really it comes down to a very simple question. Should technology companies be able to read people's messages?<br/>That is the crux of a row that has been brewing for years between Silicon Valley and the governments of at least a dozen countries around the world.<br/>WhatsApp, iMessage, Android Messages and Signal all use the super-secure system called end-to-end encryption.<br/>The technology means only the sender, at one end, and the receiver, at the other, can read messages, see media or hear phone calls. Even the app makers cannot access the content. <br/>In the past 10 years, end-to-end encrypted apps have become increasingly popular, with billions of people using them every day. <br/>Most governments and security agencies reluctantly accepted the technology's rise - until four years ago, when Mr Zuckerberg announced on stage the Messenger app and then Instagram would move to end-to-end encryption as standard. <br/>\"We're going to enable more than two billion people around the world to have their most personal conversations with each other privately,\" he said.<br/>Since then, Mr Zuckerberg and his army of engineers have slowly and quietly been cracking on with the project. The company is refusing to speak to reporters on the record about how the mammoth task is going or when the big switchover will be. \"By the end of 2023,\" is all it will say publicly.<br/>Meanwhile, the calls to stop the switchover or build in safeguards have been growing louder.<br/>Authorities in the UK, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United States, India, Turkey, Japan and Brazil - plus law-enforcement agencies such as Interpol - have criticised the technology.<br/>But no government in the democratic world has risked passing a law that will interfere with these popular apps - until now.<br/>Making technology companies build in some sort of technical backdoor to allow messages to be scanned for illegal material is one of the central tenets of the UK's wide-reaching Online Safety Bill, which looks likely to be passed into law in the near future.<br/>Police officers, if they can no longer ask Meta for the contents of people's messages, will miss out on a key source of evidence they regularly use to convict criminals or terrorists, the government says. <br/>And there is a particular concern about children being groomed online in secret.<br/>End-to-end encryption \"will be a huge boon to anyone who wants to hurt a child\", Home Secretary Suella Braverman wrote to Mr Zuckerberg on Monday.<br/>And on Wednesday, the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) has released a YouGov survey it commissioned, suggesting the British public wants police officers to be able to access people's messages, to protect children. <br/>Of the 1,723 adults surveyed across the UK, 73% said technology companies should, by law, have to scan private messaging for child sexual abuse and disrupt it in end-to-end encrypted environments.<br/>Most already scanned for child sexual abuse on their services, leading to many successful convictions, the NSPCC said.<br/>\"It is now clear that companies who wish to pit children's fundamental right to safety against the privacy rights of adults are out of step with the public and, ultimately, their user base,\" Richard Collard, at the charity, said.<br/>In response to the survey, a Meta spokesman said the company had \"developed safety measures that prevent, detect and allow us to take action against this heinous abuse\" - age restrictions for contacting strangers, for example.<br/>Also on Wednesday, as if to highlight the passions on both sides of the debate, 68 prominent security and privacy researchers have published a letter saying the Online Safety Bill would effectively break end-to-end encryption.<br/>The bill puts the onus on tech firms to find a way to implement child safety measures whilst maintaining privacy for users but the experts say this is impossible. <br/>\"Our concern is that surveillance technologies are deployed in the spirit of providing online safety,\" the letter says.<br/>\"This act undermines privacy guarantees and, indeed, safety online.\"<br/>It also sets a precedent for repressive regimes around the world to monitor and control what people are sharing, experts say.<br/>WhatsApp and Signal, meanwhile, have said they would rather remove their services from the UK than degrade end-to-end encryption security.  <br/>And to make matters worse for critics of the technology, Elon Musk announced, in May, he too was building end to end encryption, into Twitter messages.<br/>Switching to the technology is complex and expensive, as evidenced by Meta, but ultimately worth it tech bosses think.<br/>After years of data scandals, big tech sees it as key to rebuilding trust in its services.<br/>And in a happy coincidence, end-to-end encryption makes these embattled companies' tricky job of moderation a lot easier - if they cannot see what users are sharing, then neither can they police it.<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Three former offenders who have turned their lives around delivered some home truths to the peers this week.<br/>\"You can't tell someone to stop having a drink, if you have never had a drink. The problem is there are a lot of people in probation who have not been drug dealers, have never been in front of a magistrate.\"<br/>DeQeon credits the transformation that has taken place in his life to a probation officer, a woman he describes as his \"guardian angel\", who saw potential in him and went the extra mile to help him realise it.<br/>\"My other probation officers after Louise were not as good. I feel like a lot of them had no life experience. They are academics, they have not been in the real world,\" he told the committee.<br/>They had a \"tick box\" mentality, he explained, and did not \"get\" the challenges someone from a tough background like his faced. <br/>It was a message echoed by Caroline and Ayesha, who were also giving evidence about their experiences of the probation service.<br/>DeQeon told the peers: \"People like me need to be in probation because it would change the system. It would make the system a lot better. We wouldn't be sitting here talking about the situation if there was people like us being probation officers.\"<br/>But why stop at the probation service?<br/>\"Not a lot of people sitting on this panel have been on the other side of the system, have they?\" asked DeQeon. <br/>\"The problem is that if we had, we wouldn't be here,\" replied Labour peer and former Home Secretary Lord Blunkett.<br/>\"You could be... you've got to have life experience!\" DeQeon responded.<br/>The three witnesses had all served community sentences, where low-level offenders are ordered to do unpaid work and have drug, alcohol or mental health treatment instead of going to prison.<br/>They are now \"lived experience\" advisers with charity Revolving Doors, which campaigns for more community sentences and an end to prison sentences of 12 months or less in England and Wales, like in Scotland.<br/>The probation service - which has struggled with its workload in recent months - is key to making community sentences work.<br/>Last month, Kim Thornden-Edwards, head of the service in England, told the Lords committee new investment going into alcohol and drug treatment programmes was a potential \"game changer\". <br/>She also acknowledged problems with pre-sentence reports - the all-important advice given to judges and magistrates on how to deal with offenders. A new, simpler form was about to be rolled out, she told the peers. Individually-tailored treatment orders were also coming down the track, she said.<br/>The three former offenders told the committee pre-sentence reports were often out of date and did not have any input from the offenders themselves - and that some of the court-ordered programmes did not make a lot of sense.<br/>Ayesha, a recovering addict, suggested drug treatment orders should be dropped in favour of a more \"holistic\" approach. She said she had gone into a treatment centre only after her community sentence had ended, with little input from probation. <br/>She also spoke movingly of her ambition to go to university to study criminology, and her fear that despite all her efforts her criminal record would still be held against her.<br/>The Ministry of Justice says it is keen to set an example to other employers when it comes to giving a chance to ex-offenders. <br/>A spokesperson said: \"We know finding work is one of the surest ways for prison leavers to stay on the straight and narrow, which is why our Going Forward into Employment (GFIE) scheme provides employment opportunities for ex-offenders - helping to cut crime and protect the public.\"<br/>People with criminal records can apply for jobs with the probation service - and the wider Ministry of Justice - through the GFIE scheme.<br/>But the scheme does not include the role of probation officer.<br/>There is nothing to stop people with criminal convictions applying to be a probation officer \"in the usual way\", the MoJ says, and having a conviction will not necessarily count against them.<br/>But those with experience of the system say they will face a lengthy vetting process and there is no record of how many ex-offenders, if any, have ever been successful.<br/>Some ex-offenders work as volunteer \"peer mentors\", using their own experience of the criminal justice system to offer guidance and support to those struggling to cope with it.<br/>Caroline, who overcame problems with alcohol and mental health, told the Lords committee about her work with the NHS Liaison and Diversion service, which supports vulnerable people when they first come into contact with the criminal justice system.<br/>She said she was keen to work for the probation service in a similar role.<br/>\"However, due to my criminal record I have been pushed back several times. And it's so frustrating because I have come such a long, long way, but because of something that happened years ago when I wasn't very well, they are like 'nah'.

He was adopted by Eric Blair - better known by his pen name of George Orwell. <br/>Orwell's novel 1984 was the origin of the popular understanding of \"Big Brother\" and \"Room 101\".<br/>Mr Blair told BBC Politics East: \"He would have thought, what's changed?\" <br/>Mr Blair spoke as a new biography on Orwell by Norwich writer and novelist DJ Taylor was published.<br/>With Russia calling the war in Ukraine a \"special military operation\" and with many supporters of former US president Donald Trump believing his falsehood that he won the last election, many people see 1984 as more relevant than ever, Mr Taylor said.<br/>Asked about how his father would react if he came back today, Mr Blair said: \"Has it changed from the world of 1984 and Animal Farm? It's been the same for a millennia. I suppose it will be the same in another 100 years' time.<br/>\"He would have a certain sense of deja vu. He would have thought, what's changed?\" <br/>He added: \"My father was a great patriot. A great defender of his country and he was also a critic of both sides of the political debate. He would criticise both left and right.\" <br/>Prof Jean Seaton, official historian of the BBC, said Orwell was still incredibly important.<br/>\"We live in a world with surveillance, facial recognition. 1984 is about the capacity of authoritarian regimes like Russia, China, to make you believe what is not true,\" she said.<br/>Mr Blair spoke as a new biography on Orwell by Norwich writer and novelist DJ Taylor was published.<br/>An award-winning writer and critic, Mr Taylor's new biography \"Orwell: The New Life\" is the first to reveal insights about Orwell from newly uncovered letters to Eleanor Collings and Brenda Salkend, who had become part of his life when he lived in Southwold, Suffolk.<br/>\"These two caches of new material, letters he'd written to Suffolk girlfriends in the 1930s, don't just tell us about the relationship with the two women, they tell us about all kinds of things,\" said Mr Taylor.<br/>\"They tell us about what he was reading, his politics and where he was, geographical information.\"<br/>He added: \"In terms of improving our understanding of Orwell's work, I suspect his letters to Eleanor reminiscing about their country walks at Southwold may have inspired similar passages describing Winston's affair with Julia in 1984.\"<br/>While in Southwold, Orwell wrote the 1935 novel A Clergyman's Daughter, which is set in a fictionalised version of the town.<br/>Mr Taylor said: \"I think Southwold and its ambience and its values were an awful lot of the things Orwell felt he was rebelling against.<br/>\"On the other side, he had a very traditional nature. Somebody said of him, he was a conservative in everything but politics.<br/>\"I have a feeling there were certain aspects of Southwold he found very congenial.\"<br/>The newly discovered letters were bought by Mr Blair and donated to the Orwell Archive at University College London.<br/>Mr Blair said: \"I thought I better make an offer to secure the letters for posterity.<br/>\"I was interested that my father maintained his correspondence with Brenda Salkend for a great number of years. He always seemed to hold out a candle for all his girlfriends, certainly these two, as far as I can see.\"<br/>BBC Politics East will broadcast on Sunday, 2 July at 10:00 BST on BBC One andavailable after broadcast on BBC iPlayer.<br/>Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

That decision could itself be challenged at the Supreme Court.<br/>The five-year trial - announced in April 2022 - would see some asylum seekers sent to Rwanda on a one-way ticket, to claim asylum there.<br/>They may be granted refugee status to stay in Rwanda. If not, they can apply to settle there on other grounds, or seek asylum in another \"safe third country\". <br/>The government says the plan will deter people arriving in the UK through \"illegal, dangerous or unnecessary methods\", such as on small boats which cross the English Channel.  <br/>More than 45,700 people used this route to come to the UK in 2022, the highest figure since records began.<br/>Small-boat crossings decreased slightly in the first few months of 2023 but numbers could rise again in the summer. <br/>No asylum seeker has actually been sent to Rwanda so far. The first flight was scheduled to go in June 2022, but was cancelled after legal challenges.<br/>In June 2023, the Court of Appeal overturned an earlier ruling by the High Court that the Rwanda plan was lawful.<br/>The judges ruled that the east African nation is not a safe third country because of \"deficiencies\" in its asylum system which mean that some claimants could be sent back to their home countries, where they might face persecution. <br/>It said that \"unless and until\" those deficiencies are corrected, removal of asylum seekers to Rwanda is unlawful.<br/>The ruling also said that the Rwanda policy breaches Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which prohibits torture and inhuman treatment. <br/>It was not a unanimous decision. Two judges agreed to reverse the High Court decision but a third did not. <br/>The judges said their decision does not imply a view about the \"political merits\" of the policy. <br/>Asylum Aid, the charity which brought the case against the government, said the judgement was a \"vindication of the importance of the rule of law and basic fairness when fundamental rights are at stake\". <br/>The UN's refugee agency, which advised the court on matters of international refugee law during the appeal, also welcomed the ruling, and urged the UK government to \"pursue other measures\" instead.<br/>But Home Secretary Suella Braverman called the judgment \"disappointing\", and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak confirmed the government will seek permission to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court.<br/>While legal proceedings continue, flights still cannot take off for Rwanda. <br/>The UK government previously said \"anyone entering the UK illegally\" after 1 January 2022 could be sent, with no limit on numbers.<br/>Rwanda says it can process 1,000 asylum seekers during the trial period, but has capacity for more. <br/>Under the deal, Rwanda can also ask the UK to take in some of its most vulnerable refugees.  <br/>But in October 2022, Privilege Style - the airline which was scheduled to take asylum seekers to Rwanda - withdrew from its Home Office contract, after a campaign by refugee charities. <br/>At the time the Guardian reported that two other airlines which had previously conducted deportation flights had also ruled out participation in the Rwanda scheme. <br/>So far the UK has paid the Rwandan government \u00a3140m for the scheme but it has not provided an overall cost. <br/>An economic-impact assessment prepared for the government's Illegal Migration Bill estimated that removing each individual to a third country, such as Rwanda, would cost \u00a363,000 more than keeping them in the UK. <br/>That figure is the difference between the total cost of removing an individual - estimated to be \u00a3169,000 - and the \u00a3106,000 spent on housing support if they remain in the UK.<br/>The \u00a3169,000 total includes a payment to the third country of around \u00a3105,000 per person, as well as \u00a322,000 for flights.<br/>The Home Office said no cost would be incurred if the policy deterred an individual from entering the UK illegally. <br/>But it said it was \"uncertain\" how many people would be deterred because the policy was \"novel and untested\".<br/>The UK's asylum system costs \u00a33bn a year. Almost \u00a37m a day is spent on hotel accommodation for refugees and asylum seekers. <br/>Critics say the daily cost is so high because of the time taken to decide on applications, and a ban on asylum seekers working while waiting for confirmation of their status.<br/>The UN Refugee Agency defines an asylum seeker as someone who has applied for shelter and protection in another country. <br/>A refugee is a person who has fled conflict or persecution in their own country. <br/>The legal rights of refugees are protected by international law. However, it is up to host countries to decide whether an asylum seeker is granted refugee status. <br/>In 2022, the UK received more than 89,000 asylum applications, the highest number for 20 years. Of these, more than 23,800 people and their dependants were granted a form of protection. <br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

If people spend less in businesses, what does that mean for jobs? If people end up out of work, what does that mean for the government's welfare bill? And, therefore, for that third priority of the prime minister's: reducing national debt.  <br/>The increased cost of borrowing from high interest rates can also disincentivise investment in business, which can also lead to lower economic growth. <br/>The tricky balancing act between inflation and recession is getting worse.<br/>So what is in the government's power?<br/>One quick lever the government can pull is taxes. <br/>Raising taxes is another way to stop groups of people from spending more. <br/>But that's an unpalatable political choice too. <br/>Mr Sunak has previously made it clear, and pledged in the past, that he wants to cut - not raise - taxes before the next election. <br/>Some Tory MPs have been repeatedly calling for tax cuts. <br/>Governments can also reduce spending. <br/>While we do hear ministers talk about making \"efficiencies\", departments talking about making cuts is - again - an unpalatable narrative ahead of an election. <br/>Mr Sunak has said, for now, that he wants to make sure government is \"responsible\" with borrowing. <br/>Another quick lever would be price controls - the government setting limits on price increases. <br/>Mr Sunak says ministers are \"looking at\" supermarkets to make sure they are behaving responsibly, for example. <br/>But Number 10 have been clear they are not introducing price caps and any such schemes would be at retailers' discretion. <br/>The governor of the Bank of England has suggested workers shouldn't ask for excessive pay rises. <br/>The government has also been very reluctant to hike public sector wages, especially if funded by more borrowing. <br/>Both argue giving people more money in their pockets could fuel inflation: if people's wages keep up with rising prices, they can buy the same things, so demand (and prices) remain similar. <br/>In blunter terms - their strategy of reducing inflation by reducing demand means people need to be able to afford less.  <br/>This argument has led to strikes in multiple sectors, with unions arguing this is unfair for workers. <br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Sunak makes five pledges on the NHS, economy and migrants<br/>This is also a tricky balancing act here for the economy. <br/>If people can afford less: what does that mean for growing the economy? And jobs? <br/>Potentially putting people out of work has a government price tag too. <br/>So what about pushing supply up, rather than demand down, to lower prices? <br/>Supply-side reforms are, in simple terms, decisions that could make industries more productive to increase the supply of goods and services - and grow the economy too. <br/>Free-market examples include things like cutting business taxes, regulation, red tape, or even certain worker protections or welfare benefits. Or increasing migration for certain sectors. <br/>State-intervention examples could be building more houses, investing in infrastructure, or investing in homegrown energy supplies like nuclear power or renewables.  <br/>Clearly, any of these involve political choices too. <br/>But they also take time to come into effect. <br/>The government - and Labour - have ruled out direct support to help people with mortgages, saying this would fuel inflation - and instead point to existing benefits for the most vulnerable.<br/>Ministers are continuing to point to interest rates as the solution, though most are reluctant to admit that involves a lot of pain for it to work. <br/>It's important to remember when the government says it can't do something that what they're usually referring to is a choice. <br/>Each choice comes with its own shade of political thorniness, and potentially means trading the prime minister's priorities off against each other.<br/>UK inflation shock: This is really grim<br/>Why is UK inflation so high?<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

As the party in government, the Conservatives bear the most responsibility for this.<br/>The Greens aren't entirely off the hook, though. Their decisions to oppose some solar farms shape our energy system, and give the impression that local objections have more weight than national missions.<br/>Frank Adlington-Stringer is one Green councillor who has opposed a solar farm in the past.<br/>In 2021, before he was elected to North East Derbyshire Council, Mr Adlington-Stringer wrote an article explaining why he could not support a solar farm in the county.<br/>He said \"the loss of green space\" and the restriction of \"already limited habitats\" were among his main concerns.<br/>In the end, the application was rejected by government planning inspectors. At the time, one local Green councillor said \"younger generations are very concerned about the effects of climate change, and might see things differently\".<br/>In this case, at least, Mr Adlington-Stringer, 25, did not. He says while he is open to solar farms, he believes such projects should not be a \"priority\".<br/>\"We shouldn't be exchanging green energy for green spaces,\" he says.<br/>Julia Hilton is another Green councillor who campaigned against a solar farm in Hastings, before she was elected in 2021.<br/>Although it didn't have any councillors at the time, the local Green Party rallied against proposed solar panels within agricultural fields in Hastings Country Park.<br/>The Labour-led council then abandoned the project after the government's environmental adviser, Natural England, said the scheme \"would result in significant landscape and visual impacts\".<br/>The label of NIMBY - an acronym for \"not in my backyard\" - is sometimes applied to those do not want something visually unappealing to be built near their home.<br/>Ms Hilton, now the Green group leader on Hastings Borough Council, bristles at the suggestion of the \"NIMBY argument\" in these circumstances.<br/>The proposed site, she says, was \"not compatible with a solar farm, which would industrialise this very precious landscape habitat\".<br/>Whatever the merits of individual solar proposals, the optics of Green politicians objecting to renewable energy have thrown up awkward questions for the party's leadership.<br/>Green Party of England and Wales co-leader, Adrian Ramsay, insists Greens \"see an important role for solar farms as part of the mix\".<br/>\"It's not about being ideological,\" he tells the BBC. \"The [solar] application has to be considered on its merits.\"<br/>He denies solar farms are a political problem for his party, and says there are Greens supporting them in Oxfordshire, Lancaster and Kent.<br/>Allow Twitter content?<br/>This article contains content provided by Twitter.

It's a plea we hear a lot from the Green Party, which has been campaigning to make solar panels mandatory on the roofs of all suitable new homes.<br/>But will rooftops alone really fill our solar-shaped hole?<br/>Simon Evans, the deputy editor of Carbon Brief, says \"restricting cheap, utility-scale solar\" would make the challenge of net zero \"even more difficult\".<br/>The government's energy security strategy talks of expanding UK solar capacity to 70GW by 2035. \"It would not be possible to build that much solar capacity on the UK's rooftops,\" Mr Evans says.<br/>In a report, the government's climate adviser estimated a maximum potential of 37GW on rooftops. \"Even if it were possible to reach 70GW of solar on the UK's rooftops, it would be significantly more expensive to do so,\" Mr Evans says.<br/>This kind of assessment has not stopped some Greens and other parties standing in the way of solar farms in Suffolk.<br/>Earlier this year, two Green councillors sided with four Tories on Mid-Suffolk Council to block a solar farm near Somersham. And on the Suffolk-Cambridgeshire border, a plan to build one of Europe's largest solar farms - with the potential to power 172,000 homes - has been met with fierce resistance.<br/>Andrew Stringer - the first Green district councillor to be elected in Suffolk in 2003 - says the proposed Sunnica Energy Farm is a \"symptom of a wider problem\".<br/>He blames the Conservatives for failing to legislate to put more solar on roofs. A solar farm has to \"make sense\", he says, adding if it doesn't, and a Green councillor can't reconcile their opposition with their party's national policy, \"we embrace that\".<br/>\"It's called democracy,\" he says.<br/>Democracy served the party well in May's local elections, with the Greens making records gains, notably in some rural areas with a history of voting Conservative. This pivot to the countryside has expanded the party's base beyond its core voters in urban areas.<br/>The party has built \"a potentially unstable coalition, requiring some degree of hypocrisy, like their NIMBY stance\", said Dr James Dennison, a political scientist.<br/>On solar farms, the Greens \"are in danger of letting this narrative of hypocrisy spread and more so than for other parties given their environmental ideology,\" said Dr James Dennison, an expert on the party.<br/>\"This would hurt their national performance more than local.\"<br/>As the Greens seek to add parliamentary seats to their council ones, is there a temptation to a focus on wooing the type of rural voters who dislike the idea of solar farms?<br/>\"We put across our values for the local elections just gone and people came behind them very strongly, including in Suffolk and many rural areas around the country,\" says Mr Ramsay, who's eyeing up a seat in the Suffolk countryside.<br/>\"It will be the same at the general election.\"<br/>How UK Greens are learning from overseas allies<br/>Too late to save planet, says Green Party founder<br/>Labour hints at solar panel policy for new builds<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

And are those who wanted to remain still reeling?<br/>One of the most memorable images of the night the UK voted to remove itself from the EU came from Sunderland. An overjoyed woman dressed in a once-familiar red Vote Leave T-shirt, thrust on to a man's shoulders, raising her arms in jubilation.<br/>At around a quarter past midnight, on 24 June, 2016, the city became the first to declare it wanted out: 61.3% Leave and 38.7% Remain.<br/>It took another four years before Brexit actually happened, but would those who voted for it do so again?<br/>\"I would 100% vote leave,\" said Keith Rowe, who lives near the city's marina.<br/>\"I basically voted leave for my two daughters and my new granddaughter - for maximising their opportunities.\"<br/>Keith remembers when the UK joined the then European Economic Community in 1973, when he was a boy.<br/>\"It brought a lot of positives,\" he said.<br/>\"They brought a lot of health and safety legislations and helped employment law for workers but I think over the last 10 to 15 years we saw a lot of policies that were enforced on the United Kingdom.\"<br/>He thinks the referendum was \"predominantly a vote for change\". <br/>\"We were given a whole spiel of negatives but generally most people who voted for leave were quite positive types who wanted to maximise the opportunities of Brexit.<br/>\"You were labelled as thick if you were a leaver. I've got a science degree, I'm not thick. I can read around a subject like most people and work it out for myself.\"<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Brexit: How did we get here?<br/>He highlighted \"two major benefits\" of leaving the EU: The UK's response to the Covid-19 vaccine and coming out of the Common Agricultural Policy.<br/>\"I know there have been negatives. We've seen some short-term employment issues in the hospitality industry and travel but generally it's a bit more paperwork, they can still come,\" he added.<br/>\"In Sunderland we've seen a massive, massive incoming of migrant workers, good workers, coming mainly to things like our NHS. <br/>\"In 20 years I'd love to see how people look back and we can turn around and tell the Remainers \"I told you so\".\"<br/>Sunderland was not alone in the north-east of England when it came to backing leave.<br/>In the North East of England, Newcastle was alone in supporting Remain, with a 1% margin.<br/>James and Janet Sheerin, who live in the city, proudly fly an EU flag outside their home. In one of the windows sits a flashing neon sign bearing the words \"Brexit has failed\".<br/>\"We have had so many people, complete strangers, call at the front door and say thank you for flying the flag,\" said Janet.<br/>The city narrowly voted to stay within the EU, the results declared live as the clock struck midnight: 50.7% remain, 49.3% leave. <br/>\"I had a bet on the result and I won,\" said James.<br/>\"There was a lot of disquiet with Europe but really it was disquiet with Westminster and what was going on there.<br/>\"Most of my life I've lived in Europe, I'm a European person, we've travelled in Europe and it seemed good for us and good for the country.<br/>\"I couldn't understand why people would want to leave. Well I could, but I didn't agree with the reasons.\"<br/>Janet voted remain so the UK did not become \"alone and isolated\".<br/>\"I thought it was awful the way that the Brexit vote made people who had been working here, living here, contributing here for many, many years - we made them feel unwanted and unwelcome,\" she said.<br/>\"And we've sent so many of them back to Europe. So many doctors and nurses. We don't have enough vegetable and fruit pickers in our fields we don't have enough HGV drivers. It's really damaged the economy and I cannot think of a single good reasons for leaving the EU.\" <br/>The couple take a long pause when asked if they feel there have been any positives to Brexit.<br/>\"No,\" said Janet.<br/>\"I'm trying hard to think about it,\" said James.<br/>He highlights the many new friends the couple have made who have come together for \"a common cause\".<br/>\"We can't continue as a little island on our own doing trade with people the other side of the world,\" he added.<br/>\"We're not going away and we won't go away until we rejoin the EU.\"<br/>Follow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

We were disrespected and manipulated.\" <br/>Like Ms Msezane, he was recruited last year by an agent in his home country via an advertisement on social media, and had to pay for his own airfare and visa before being put to work on fruit farms in the south of England.<br/>Ms Msezane, who is from Johannesburg, is now a care worker for an English local authority.<br/>She told the BBC she was treated with respect in her new role, in sharp contrast to her experience last year as a seasonal agricultural worker, picking and packing strawberries for British supermarkets.<br/>\"I could not have thought that the conditions I found in 2022, in the United Kingdom, were what I found. It was beyond shocking.<br/>\"I'd spent close to, almost, \u00a32,500 equivalent. There is no way I am going home at that point. I am here to make money. That's essentially it. So you get to work.\"<br/>She had to pay rent to live in a caravan with six people of different nationalities, both men and women, who had a single shower and fridge between them.<br/>\"My country is going through a lot economically. People need work. So I would never say to people not to come on the seasonal worker visa,\" she told the BBC.<br/>\"Everyone who was on the scheme with me was able to support their families in different ways.\"<br/>But she added: \"You need to be aware that you are coming into a country where you don't have as many rights as a worker as you do in South Africa. So that can be challenging.\"<br/>Vadim Sardov, from Kazakhstan, said conditions on his farm were so bad several people had decided to leave and work illegally instead.<br/>Seasonal workers were not asking for \"five star hotels\", he told the committee, but \"employers must provide proper living and working conditions\".<br/>Emiliano Mellino, a journalist for the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, who has written a series of articles on the treatment of migrant workers, told the Lords committee some workers had been subjected to bullying and abuse.<br/>He said many take out loans to cover the costs of coming to the UK, and they also had to pay rent of up to \u00a380 a week for their accommodation, which meant they were reluctant to speak out for fear of losing their job.<br/>The government's official policy is to train British workers to fill the 50,000 seasonal jobs on British farms currently carried out by migrant workers.<br/>Before the UK left EU, most of these casual workers came from Europe.<br/>When the current seasonal workers visa scheme was launched in 2019, it had a quota of just 2,500 places a year, with most coming from Russia and Ukraine.<br/>It was expanded to 38,000 visas in 2022, following pressure from the farming industry, who had been forced to leave crops unpicked.<br/>The net was cast to a wider range of nationalities, including South Africa and central Asian countries like Kazakhstan.<br/>The scheme is due to run until 2024, with debate raging in government over whether it should be expanded to keep food costs down and help tame inflation.<br/>The government has authorised only a small number of recruitment companies, known as \"scheme operators\", to arrange seasonal worker visas. <br/>Farmers must hire their overseas workers through those companies and must demonstrate that they are actively trying to recruit UK-based workers as well. <br/>Scheme operators also have explicit duties to look after workers' welfare and make sure they are paid properly.<br/>At an earlier committee hearing, in April this year, farmer Mike Newey said it was a \"myth\" that seasonal fruit picking was a low skilled, poorly paid job with bad accommodation.<br/>\"Our seasonal workers are paid a minimum of \u00a310.42, the national living wage, and often earn \u00a315 to \u00a320 an hour when they are on piece-work rates. It is good pay. They have subsidised accommodation on the farm.\"<br/>He added: \"We should be proud of giving people from other countries a leg up.

He stresses that he's as dedicated to independence as anyone in the SNP, but he believes that patience is required.<br/>He's urged fellow members to focus on convincing more undecided voters to support independence, which he believes will create \"overwhelming\" pressure on the UK government to grant a second referendum.<br/>But others feel another referendum won't happen, and that brings us to option two. This involves using elections to secure independence.<br/>It's a tactic that's gained prominence in SNP circles in recent years. <br/>Towards the end of her leadership, Nicola Sturgeon floated the idea of running an election as a \"de facto\" referendum.<br/>The concept is fairly simple: the SNP would contest an election (or elections) insisting that a vote for them is a vote for independence. This could be stated in the opening line of a manifesto.<br/>Ash Regan, who ran to replace Nicola Sturgeon earlier this year, backs this approach.<br/>She believes the SNP could even team up with other pro-independence parties, meaning that more than 50% of the vote combined would lead to independence.<br/>She thinks it's time to move away from relying on the referendum path, saying \"we've been thinking of it as the gold standard, but in fact it's the ballot box that's the gold standard route\".<br/>But there are potential weaknesses with this option.<br/>Why would the UK government agree to this? Would the international community recognise it? <br/>Most advocates of such a Plan B feel that Westminster intransigence on a second referendum means that a radical alternative is needed.<br/>But others fear it won't deliver independence and would alienate the middle-ground of Scottish politics.<br/>Option three involves taking to the streets - mass demonstrations calling for independence. <br/>Perhaps this option should be seen as complementing others, rather than being a route to independence in itself. <br/>The cross-party All Under One Banner movement will march from Stirling to Bannockburn at the very same time the SNP gathers in Dundee.<br/>As a party member, Patrick McCarthy could have attended the convention.

Two years before the Brexit referendum, Clacton-on-Sea saw its MP defect to Brexit-supporting UKIP. How do people in the resort feel about it all now?<br/>The Tendring area of Essex - which includes the seaside town of Clacton - recorded one of the highest leave votes in England in the 2016 referendum. Almost 70% of people voted out - and turnout was 74.5%.<br/>Clacton was considered by many to be the beating heart of Brexit after its Conservative MP Douglas Carswell defected to UKIP in 2014. In 2015, 22 UKIP councillors were elected on to the district council.<br/>But what do people in the resort feel about Brexit today?<br/>\"I voted to leave, but I wish I hadn't,\" says Clacton resident Jill Ayling, 76. <br/>\"We didn't know the whole truth, did we? We were supposed to get money for the National Health Service, but to my mind it hasn't happened.  <br/>\"If I had to vote again, I'd vote to stay.\"<br/>She believes people were swayed by the political arguments at the time but it will have a lasting effect on younger generations. <br/>\"For younger people, it has altered dramatically for them. Things have changed,\" she says.<br/>Billy Ball, 42, the managing director of Clacton Pier, did not want to reveal how he voted in the 2016 referendum.<br/>\"The biggest challenge for hospitality and the seaside as a whole - and Clacton Pier - has been how the Eastern European labour took the decision to move home,\" he says.<br/>\"We've never really recovered from that. The British don't see hospitality as a long-term career path.<br/>\"It is an older demographic in Clacton and perhaps there's some idealism, with people thinking standing on our own two feet was a good thing. <br/>\"We were one of the country's only UKIP areas but it was probably all a bit of a flash in the pan. <br/>\"People tend to have forgotten why the resulting problems exist.\" <br/>Jason Smedley, 53, has lived in Clacton for 15 years and owns a number of businesses, including the Royal Hotel.<br/>He did not vote in the referendum.<br/>\"In all of my businesses, I can't see any difference,\" he says. \"Covid is the only thing that's had an impact here and around the country.\"<br/>He says he took the strong Brexit sentiment in Clacton with \"a pinch of salt\".<br/>\"I had a look at the main points and how it would affect me as a business and thought - actually, it doesn't - either way,\" he says.<br/>\"I was waiting to see this catastrophic failure of everything in the country.\"<br/>His view is echoed by the hotel's general manager, Victoria Hart. The 23-year-old was too young to vote in the 2016 ballot. <br/>\"It hasn't affected us at all,\" she says, \"especially people my age and my friends here in Clacton, we don't talk about it. <br/>\"Covid is the only thing that has severely impacted my life.\" <br/>Ryan Richards, 22, says he feels \"left out\" as he too was unable to vote in the referendum.<br/>\"We should have stayed with the EU,\" he says. <br/>\"With the trade routes and the way prices are going up now, it's becoming impossible for people my age even to get a home, let alone anything else - I blame Brexit for that.<br/>\"When it all happened we were under the age - I couldn't vote. <br/>\"I can understand why they want to make their their own trade routes without having to rely on someone, but they should have at least gone to young people, who are going or be majorly affected by it all. <br/>\"I feel left out.\"<br/>\"I don't think you can tell if it has worked, because of the pandemic and the trouble we've had with the government keeping changing, there hasn't been a time when you can say there's been a smooth period,\" says Ronald Oudnie.<br/>The 74-year-old voted for Brexit.<br/>\"You've got to wait until you've got a government that's been in for a few years, that it's been stable and able to sort things out.   <br/>\"I can remember when we actually joined the EU. We didn't sign up to a lot of things then that they brought in after, it was more like an economic thing. <br/>\"But they implemented laws on us when we should be implementing our own laws, it's as simple as that.\"<br/>Peter Lenard, 79, voted to stay in the EU.<br/>\"It's been a disaster, Brexit,\" he says.<br/>\"We were all promised we were going to put so much money into the NHS and I honestly think if you were to ask a lot of people today who voted out, I think a lot would change their mind.\"<br/>He says there is an element of \"I told you so\".  <br/>\"All my friends say the same,\" he says.<br/>\"I voted out because of Brussels, I was fed up of having to answer to them for every single thing, no for any other reason,\" says Beverley Banks.   <br/>\"I was hoping a lot of Europe was going to do the same and then we could form again and do it differently. <br/>\"It didn't happen. The Ukraine war didn't help, but everything is so much more expensive.\"<br/>Her friend Rosalie Pope says: \"I knew it was a bad idea, and it was.<br/>\"I travel internationally for business all the time and didn't want the rigmarole - so I voted 'in'.\" <br/>Small business owner Neil Stock, 55, is a former Conservative leader of Tendring District Council. <br/>\"How you judge whether that's been a success or a failure, or good or bad, or wrong or right, is down to your own independent view of the world,\" he says. <br/>\"If you were going to and from Europe on a regular basis I should imagine it's been quite irksome. <br/>\"But for most people it hasn't even touched the sides. I don't regret voting leave at all. If you reran the referendum, despite the opinion polls you'd get a very similar result. <br/>\"People who never vote came out and wielded the pencil in the ballot box and said 'I want to leave'. The decision was made on a whole raft of emotions, including sovereignty.<br/>\"We live in a post-Brexit world. It doesn't mean the world ended in 2016.\"<br/>The government has previously said it was \"making the most of Brexit freedoms\".<br/>\"The government is making the most of our Brexit freedoms to grow the economy, including ambitious financial services sector reforms which will unlock over \u00a3100bn of investment, and we are reviewing EU-derived rules in other critical growth sectors this year,\" said a spokesperson.<br/>Question Time is hosting a special debate from Clacton on BBC One from 22:40 BST.<br/>Photography by Martin Giles<br/>Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

But inflation in the UK has climbed faster and been more stubborn than in the US and EU.  <br/>Some, including Mark Carney, the former governor of the Bank of England, claim Brexit may be to blame. But it's a complex picture.<br/>Singling out the impact of Brexit isn't easy, especially with the effects of a pandemic and a war. But there is evidence that the red tape - the form filling and other hurdles - required to bring goods into the country may have added to food bills. <br/>More than a quarter of our food is imported from the EU. <br/>Researchers at the London School of Economics (LSE) compared how the prices of some of those items rose compared with those of food from elsewhere. The differences may reflect other factors, and may not be purely down to Brexit. <br/>But the academics claimed that if they were, then the extra red tape could have added \u00a3250 in total to the typical household's grocery shopping bills between December 2019 and March 2023, with meat and cheese particularly affected.<br/>Most of that rise - about \u00a3210 - they say came through before our current cost-of-living crunch, in 2020 and 2021, as businesses were preparing and first implementing the new processes. <br/>But in total, the LSE team reckons the changes could have accounted for over a quarter of the rise in food bills we've seen since the end of 2019. By contrast, the cost savings in new trade deals agreed since then have been minimal.<br/>So while Brexit may not have been the biggest reason for our surging food inflation, the higher costs it added may have played a significant part.<br/>But here's a small crumb of comfort - even with these changes, academics at Oxford Economics believe food is 7% cheaper in the UK than on average in the EU. <br/>And official statistics show a smaller part of spending in the UK goes on food - less than \u00a31 in every \u00a38 - than in France or Germany.<br/>However, a trip to the butchers, deli counter or nipping out for a pizza could become still more expensive.  <br/>The remainder of post-Brexit import checks and formalities on items brought into the UK to guard against risks to animal health and food fraud are due to be phased in from October, after they were postponed during the pandemic. <br/>The government has streamlined several processes in the meantime, considerably reducing the extra bills importers were due to face.<br/>But meat, dairy or fish products, for example, will have to be signed off as safe by a vet before entry, at a cost of hundreds of euros. <br/>Every consignment of goods in such medium- and high-risk categories entering the UK will face a new charge at border posts of up to \u00a343. <br/>The changes will cost businesses hundreds of millions of pounds per year. And customers may ultimately foot the bill.<br/>Meanwhile, the end of free movement means 330,000 fewer workers in the UK, according to one estimate from economists at the Centre for European Reform. <br/>That is 1% of the workforce, but it is hitting some sectors harder than others - transport, hospitality and retail are all seeing more acute staff shortages. <br/>Such employers tend to have to offer larger pay rises to attract and keep staff. While that is good news for those in work, who might have scored a bigger pay rise than they would have done otherwise, those costs are often passed on to customers. <br/>Then there is a less visible possible impact. Investment - in things like equipment, skills and IT - has stalled since the referendum. <br/>Economists, including those at the government's own independent forecasters, say part of that gap may reflect Brexit-related costs or uncertainty. That makes the UK less efficient than it could be, meaning the cost of producing stuff is higher.  <br/>But with the Windsor Framework settling the arrangements for trading with the EU between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, economists hope some uncertainty has disappeared, and investment may get a boost. But that takes time. <br/>The current inflation shock is truly global. But those escalating bills in the UK may come with a Brexit surcharge on top - just when households and businesses feel they can least cope. <br/>Bread to loo roll: UK prices compared to Europe<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

We we were told he was talking about the first three months of 2023, when UK food price inflation was 18% and Sweden, Germany and Portugal were all over 20%.<br/>The reason UK food inflation is so high has been the focus of a recent Office for National Statistics (ONS) analysis. The ONS is responsible for calculating the UK's inflation figures.<br/>It identified three main reasons behind the price rises:<br/>The good news is that global wholesale food prices (that's the amount producers charge for their produce) have been falling. However, it generally takes time for that to feed through to supermarket prices, so customers have to wait before their bills stop rising.<br/>The ONS says one reason the UK's prices have been rising faster for longer could be down to a reliance on food imports. This suggests European countries that grow more of their own food have seen smaller food prices increases.<br/>The next set of UK inflation figures - covering the year to May - will be published on Wednesday.<br/>Read more about BBC Verify: Explaining the 'how' - the launch of BBC Verify<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

This does not apply for \"personal\" actions against them, for example if they are sued for libel.<br/>As a former minister, he would normally be expected to receive taxpayer-funded legal help for his evidence to the ongoing Covid inquiry.<br/>Documents submitted to the inquiry show that he was receiving support from the government's in-house legal department, but he cut ties with them in May after being referred to police for potential rule breaches during the pandemic.<br/>Shortly afterwards, he said he was \"instructing new solicitors\" but this was dependent on funding being agreed with the Cabinet Office.<br/>The department, however, has since said he won't get funding if he tries to \"undermine\" the government's position in relation to the inquiry, amid a row over the submission of his unredacted WhatsApps.<br/>All former prime ministers since John Major have been entitled to a yearly \u00a3115,000 allowance to support their \"special position in public life\".<br/>They can claim from it to fund things like running an office, paying for staff, and travel to events where they are appearing as an ex-PM. The money can't be used to support private or parliamentary duties.<br/>It is not yet known whether Mr Johnson has claimed it since leaving No 10, as the most recent annual figures are yet to be published.<br/>Former premiers have not always claimed the full amount. It is not paid automatically, and they have to provide receipts.<br/>In addition, they can claim up to 10% of the yearly allowance to put towards the pensions of their staff.<br/>Ex-MPs are entitled to a parliamentary pass, the so-called former member's pass, which was known as an \"X\" pass.<br/>It gives access to certain parts of Parliament and some of the catering facilities.<br/>Former MPs are not allowed to use the pass to help with \"lobbying\" - or trying to influence - government ministers.<br/>But the committee has recommended that Mr Johnson shouldn't be given one.

This was when he said he had corrected the record (referring to his statement of 8 December 2021).<br/>\"When I said - I came to this house and said in all sincerity that the rules and guidance had been followed at all times - it was what I believed to be true. It was certainly the case when I was present at gatherings to wish staff farewell\", he said. <br/>Committee chair Harriet Harman asked him if he still believed that to be the case in March 2023 and he replied: \"My view remains that the guidance allowed social distancing not to be carried out with rigid, drill sergeant precision.\"<br/>We know that at least two of the events that he attended (13 November and 14 January) led to police fines but we can't tell whether the rule breaches happened when he was there.<br/>When it comes to the guidance, the photos of the Lee Cain event apparently show people closer than 1m together, and thus not following the guidance, while Mr Johnson was in the room and looking on. <br/>The initial report from the Privileges Committee said it had received evidence that Mr Johnson had said at the 27 November 2020 event that it was \"probably the most unsocially distanced gathering in the UK right now\".<br/>Mr Johnson said he did not remember saying that, but pointed out that the official who had provided that quote went on to say of the former prime minister: \"he had a glass of water in his hand, made a short speech and then went up to his flat. He was the most sensible person there to be honest.\"<br/>What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

These include immunity from legal prosecution for anything said in Parliament, to allow MPs to speak freely.<br/>The committee was established in its current form in 2013 in the House of Commons. Similar work was previously done by a larger committee called the Standards and Privileges Committee. <br/>Ahead of the release of its report, Boris Johnson accused members of the committee of having a bias against him. He said: \"Their purpose from the beginning has been to find me guilty, regardless of the facts.\"<br/>However, four of the seven members of the committee are Conservative MPs (Sir Bernard Jenkin, Sir Charles Walker, Andy Carter and Alberto Costa).<br/>Two members are Labour MPs (Harriet Harman and Yvonne Fovargue) and one represents the SNP (Allan Dorans).<br/>The rules state the chair has to be a member of the official opposition - ie from the Labour party. Harriet Harman was unanimously elected to the post in June 2022.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: What is the hearing all about? Harriet Harman explains<br/>The committee has said that if Mr Johnson had not already resigned as an MP, it would have recommended a 90-day suspension, which is an unusually long period.<br/>A suspension of more than two weeks can trigger something called a recall petition, which in turn could lead to a by-election.<br/>Two MPs on the committee - the SNP's Allan Dorans and Labour's Yvonne Fovargue - wanted Mr Johnson expelled from the House of Commons - a far more serious sanction.<br/>In addition to the suspension, the committee also recommended that he should not be given a parliamentary pass, as is common for former MPs.<br/>Commons leader Penny Mordaunt has confirmed that MPs will be able to debate \"an amendable motion\" related to the report in Parliament on Monday. <br/>The debate will be followed by a free vote, which means political parties will not tell MPs what to do. <br/>Boris Johnson was widely criticised for describing the committee as \"a kangaroo court\" in his resignation statement.<br/>The phrase generally refers to a group acting without legal authority which hastily reaches a verdict without considering evidence.<br/>Mr Johnson's conduct was referred to the committee after a vote in the House of Commons in April 2022. It did not call for evidence until June 2022, once the police investigation into Partygate had finished.<br/>At his evidence hearing, Mr Johnson criticised committee chair Harriet Harman for having \"said some things about this matter before reading the evidence\". <br/>He was referring to comments she made on Twitter in April 2022, when she said that if Boris Johnson and then Chancellor Rishi Sunak accepted a fine for a lockdown breaking party, \"they are also admitting that they misled the House of Commons\".<br/>Ms Harman replaced the previous chair Sir Chris Bryant, who decided he should not lead the investigation because of his previous criticism of Mr Johnson's rule-breaking. <br/>No - it can also decide if non-MPs have been in contempt of Parliament.<br/>In 2019, the Privileges Committee examined the refusal of Boris Johnson's former adviser Dominic Cummings to give evidence to another parliamentary committee.<br/>It found that Mr Cummings was in contempt of Parliament and recommended that the House of Commons should pass a resolution criticising him. <br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

They can also ask for more guidance from COPFS.<br/>If a suspect is charged with a crime, they generally cannot be questioned again by the police although they can make a statement. <br/>Ultimately, the detectives will send what is called a standard prosecution report to COPFS.<br/>Prosecutors will then consider whether there is sufficient evidence to suggest a crime was committed and the suspect was responsible.<br/>They will take the public interest into account. That can be influenced by the particular circumstances of the case - for example, whether the person involved was in a position of trust or authority.<br/>If they feel the evidence meets the necessary tests, the case will go to court.<br/>Alternatively, COPFS can instruct the police to carry out further inquiries if they decide there is insufficient evidence.<br/>If they are still not satisfied there is enough to justify a prosecution, the case would go no further.<br/>The law officers at the top of the Crown Office will not be involved in this lengthy process.<br/>The Lord Advocate Dorothy Bain KC and Solicitor General Ruth Charteris KC have dual roles as public prosecutors and principal legal advisors to the Scottish government, which has been run by the SNP since 2007.<br/>For that reason, they will not be consulted when a decision is made about what should happen to Ms Sturgeon, Mr Murrell or Mr Beattie, with that task falling to others. <br/>And for anyone wondering why the inquiry is called Operation Branchform, the titles for Police Scotland investigations are picked at random and the name does not actually mean anything.<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

And it was prominent.<br/>At Labour's 2021 conference, shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves announced her ambition to be the UK's first \"green\" chancellor.<br/>To stress her bona fides, she pledged to invest \u00a328bn a year, every year to 2030 to \"green\" the economy.<br/>Labour's Green Prosperity Plan was one of its defining policies. It gave the party a clear dividing line with government.<br/>Ms Reeves said there would be \"no dither, and no delay\" in tackling the climate crisis.<br/>It was also an answer to the government's \"levelling up\" pledge.<br/>The borrowed cash would underpin well-paid jobs in every corner of the UK in the energy sector.<br/>So why has Ms Reeves kicked the pledge into the second half of the next Parliament, if Labour wins?<br/>The first reason is obvious. <br/>Ms Reeves now says she was \"green\" - in a different sense of the word - in 2021, in that she hadn't foreseen what then-Prime Minister Liz Truss would do to the economy.<br/>With interest rates up, the cost of borrowing rises too, making the \u00a328bn pledge more expensive to deliver.<br/>And Ms Reeves wants to emphasise that if any spending commitments clash with her fiscal rules, the rules would win every time.<br/>But did the \u00a328bn green pledge really clash with her rules?<br/>In their own detailed briefing on their fiscal rules, Labour said: \"It is essential that for our future prosperity that we retain the ability to borrow for investing in capital projects which over time will pay for themselves.<br/>\"And that is why our target for eliminating the deficit excludes investment.\"<br/>So borrowing to invest in the future technology and jobs shouldn't fall foul of that fiscal rule.<br/>But there is another rule which Ms Reeves cited this morning - to have debt falling as a percentage of GDP or Gross Domestic Product, a measure of economic activity. <br/>Meeting that rule may have contributed to putting the \u00a328bn on the backburner - though I remember at the 2021 conference some senior Labour figures questioning the wisdom of borrowing the equivalent of half the defence budget every year even then.<br/>And some senior figures in Labour are far less convinced that \u00a328bn would necessarily bust the debt rule - economic forecasts can change by far greater margins.<br/>One of the other justifications for the change of position is that \u00a328bn shouldn't be poured in to the economy straight away. <br/>That's because it will take time to train workers, to create and bolster supply chains. Hence \"ramping up\" to \u00a328bn. <br/>One shadow minister said that while today's announcement felt like a bit of a handbrake turn, it was nonetheless inevitable and sensible.<br/>The scale of the ambition remained the same, but pragmatically the shadow chancellor was simply not committing to spending which would be difficult to deliver.<br/>But all this must have been known in 2021, too.<br/>So why announce the U-turn today?<br/>The change of position was discussed within Labour's Treasury team for some time.<br/>Engagement with investors convinced them the government itself may not need to pump in a huge amount of cash straight away - the private sector would provide green jobs without state help. <br/>And while Ms Reeves has ditched the \u00a328bn pledge in the first half of the Parliament, this doesn't mean that a Labour government would spend nothing on its Green Prosperity Plan.<br/>I understand cash will be prioritised for projects where the private sector would not commit without state assistance - nuclear and hydrogen for example.<br/>But it seems clear that politics and not just economics played a role in today's announcement. <br/>There have been grumbles and growls over how the policy has landed over the past two years within Labour's ranks and internal criticism has increased, not receded.<br/>One concern was that the amount to be borrowed - the \u00a328bn - was better known than what the money would buy - from home insulation and heat pumps to new carbon capture technology.<br/>But it was crystal clear this week that the Conservatives felt that they had seen a vulnerability that could be exploited.<br/>The front page of the Daily Mail blared this week about the alleged dangers of the policy - the extra borrowing would put up interest and therefore mortgage costs.<br/>The independent Institute for Fiscal Studies was also being cited by Conservative ministers. <br/>Its director Paul Johnson had warned that while additional borrowing would pump money in to the economy, it also drives up interest rates.<br/>As Labour has been attacking the Conservatives for their handling of the economy, and the \"mortgage premium\" they claim the government has caused, it was understandable that they did not want the same attack to be aimed at them, and Ms Reeves this morning sought to eliminate a potential negative.<br/>As one Labour shadow minister put it: \"They [the Conservatives] will be pulling their hair out that one of their attack lines has failed.\"<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Rachel Reeves says Labour will now \"ramp up\" its plan to spend \u00a328bn a year on green industries<br/>Some in Labour's ranks, though, believe the party should have insulated (no pun intended) itself from attack by making the case more stridently that borrowing to invest is different from borrowing to meet day-to-day spending.<br/>Labour's opinion poll lead is wide but pessimists in their ranks fear it is shallow. <br/>Establishing economic credibility is seen as key.<br/>But while it may have been the lesser of two evils, today's change of tack isn't cost-free.<br/>The party has committed to achieve a net-zero power system by 2030. <br/>But with potentially significantly less investment, is this target in danger too?<br/>And unlike many of the left-wing commitments that have been ditched - where the leadership don't really mind the backlash - this was the shadow chancellor watering down her own highest-profile pledge.<br/>That in itself has allowed the Conservatives to shout about Labour's economic plans being \"in tatters\". <br/>As Labour is still committed to its Green Prosperity Plan - just not the original timescale - they will still claim they have clear dividing lines with the government.<br/>But one of their key arguments has been this: With the US pouring subsidies in to domestic green industries, the UK will get left behind if it doesn't follow suit. And fast.<br/>A delay doesn't destroy - but it does potentially weaken - the Labour case.<br/>But there is another concern amongst those who are most certainly not on the Corbyn left.<br/>Emphasising competence and fiscal credibility over climate change commitments could leave some target voters cold.<br/>Labour waters down \u00a328bn green projects pledge<br/>Labour unveils Biden-inspired economic strategy<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Councils are required by law to balance their budgets and provide \"best value\" to their constituents. <br/>Woking is the latest council to be put under intervention, with minister Lee Rowley appointing commissioners last week because of the authority's \u00a31.9bn in debt.<br/>Local elections are always in part seen as a test of the public mood nationally - and the message from May's polls is that voters are turning away from the Conservatives.<br/>But it is not always easy to say how much impact local issues have on the way people vote.<br/>\"Generally, people aren't voting on specific local issues\" says Prof Paula Surridge of Bristol University, who researches voting behaviour, \"but when things are particularly bad, that really raises the profile\".<br/>She says voters often don't know much about councils, but \"when your council has been labelled as failing, even if you don't know exactly what they do, you're going to know they're not doing it right\".<br/>Local elections also often see lower turnout levels than national polls. But are voters aware enough to take action when their council's been labelled as failing?<br/>Slough saw a dramatic shift. The sitting Labour administration lost 18 seats, with 16 of them going to the Tories and a few to the Liberal Democrats.<br/>What's so notable about Slough is it heavily defied the national trend. Instead votes flew in the opposite direction, leading to a Labour collapse. <br/>\"Slough is clear, simple and straightforward - an 18 point swing from Labour to Tory. It's so out of line [with the national picture],\" says Prof Sir John Curtice, polling expert at the University of Strathclyde.<br/>Dexter Smith, leader of Slough Conservatives, who now run the town in partnership with the Lib Dems, says the council's failings \"definitely\" had an impact on the results.<br/>He said voters would talk about the council's bankruptcy on the doorstep, but also \"lots of missed bin collections, rather poor performance in a variety of services\".<br/>Max Caller, the former commissioner sent in by the government to Slough, agrees that \"people had an understanding of how bad things were\", with the local press covering the problems extensively.<br/>Slough issued its section 114 notice in July 2021, but Mr Smith claims it didn't have much of an impact on the results in the election most recently after that - May 2022 - because voters hadn't felt the effects of the bankruptcy yet. <br/>But since then, the council selling off \u00a3200m of assets, a new fee for garden waste collection - and the killer, a nearly 10% council tax rise, has made voters take notice, he says.<br/>Because of the dire state of the authority's finances, Slough was given permission by the government to implement the council tax rise without a local referendum. <br/>Most of England had their council tax increased by nearly 5%. Slough Labour planned to raise council tax by nearly 10% again next year.<br/>The Conservatives committed not to doing this, says Mr Smith, and treated the election \"more like a referendum\" on the rise. <br/>Slough Labour did not respond to attempts to contact them for this article.<br/>Mr Smith blames Slough's problems on the \"tax and spend approach by Labour\". But it's not only Labour councils that get into trouble.<br/>Thurrock Council saw the incumbent Conservative administration lose two seats to Labour, who also gained three from independents. It left the Tories with a majority of one. Labour's vote share was up significantly compared to the last time these seats were elected.<br/>Thurrock Council has debts of more than \u00a31bn.<br/>Labour group leader John Kent says \"there's a growing awareness [of the council's problems], it kind of comes in waves\". <br/>These waves peaked when the government intervened and when the council went bankrupt, he says. <br/>\"In my ward we knocked on doors, and people I know are Tories said we're voting for you because of what they've done, they've bankrupted the council,\" he says.<br/>The most recent wave was the council tax increase. <br/>Like Slough, Thurrock put its council tax up by nearly 10%. And again like in Slough, Mr Kent identifies this rise, coupled with the failure to deliver local services, as the reason voters took action.<br/>\"It was the inability of the council to empty the bins \u2026 people in their own minds ally that with the council tax.\"<br/>Thurrock Conservatives declined to be interviewed for this article.<br/>The Essex authority is a less clear-cut case on whether voters punished a failing council, as it still followed the national trend of Conservatives losing seats, although Prof Curtice says it \"probably\" had an impact. <br/>\"The vote figures were down so sharply this could reasonably be that the Tories were being punished. They escaped retribution in terms of seats because of a bad baseline\".<br/>The last time these seats were contested - the baseline Prof Curtice is talking about - was 2019, when the Conservatives were hit by infighting over Theresa May's Brexit deal.<br/>The impact was also \"masked\", Prof Curtice adds, by the fact that Thurrock is among those English councils that only elect a third of their seats three out of every four years, instead of all their seats every four years. <br/>By contrast, Slough moved to all-out elections this year for the first time.<br/>If Thurrock had elected all its councillors in May, both Prof Curtice and Mr Kent agree that Labour would have unseated the Tories as the largest party on the council.<br/>Sandwell and Liverpool councils both saw the incumbent parties lose support, but on a smaller scale.<br/>Prof Curtice does not think voters punished Labour in Sandwell, but says it's more difficult to tell in Liverpool. Labour lost nine seats in the city, but their vote share held up.<br/>Liverpool continues to be dominated by Labour, although the party's share dropped in 2021, the first elections after corruption allegations emerged around former mayor Joe Anderson. He denies any wrongdoing.<br/>Croydon, in south London, is another council with huge debts that has had commissioners sent in during recent years. Last year, voters elected a Conservative mayor - even though the council itself is Labour.<br/>Commissioners have reported good progress at Sandwell and are \"optimistic\" about Liverpool - both areas where the incumbent party's vote has held up.<br/>Progress at Slough on the other hand has \"been very slow\", according to the commissioners, while Thurrock had another commissioner appointed in March after the government said it was \"continuing to fail in its best value duty\".<br/>So perhaps we can conclude that voters do pay attention to local issues - and are prepared to punish failed administrations at the ballot box.<br/>The people paying the price for a bankrupt council<br/>Commissioners will oversee troubled council<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Let me explain. <br/>The inquiry's chair Baroness Hallett is demanding unredacted WhatsApp messages and notebooks from Boris Johnson.<br/>They cover the period of the pandemic when he was prime minister and making key decisions.<br/>She is adamant that it is her job to decide what is and isn't relevant to her inquiry.<br/>The government disagrees - and speaking to people close to the process, I don't think they're going to back down. <br/>They argue that they need to protect the privacy of ministers and others. They say they will not send information that is \"unambiguously irrelevant\" to the inquiry.<br/>Insiders have told the BBC they will send relevant messages - for example, WhatsApp conversations that led to a policy decision. They would not send messages involving personal conversations. <br/>But they think that decision is for the government - and its lawyers - to make.<br/>So who is going to win?<br/>The more likely answer seems to be the Covid inquiry.<br/>It has legal powers to compel people to produce documents. It also had a pretty broad remit under the terms established by the government. <br/>And some senior Conservatives are now urging the Cabinet Office to back down. <br/>William Wragg is the chair of the Commons public administration and constitutional affairs committee. It's his job is to look at constitutional issues like this. <br/>He told me: \"If the inquiry requests documents and info - then whoever it has asked should comply.\"<br/>He said this included the government.                             <br/>Caroline Nokes - another select committee chair - said Baroness Hallett was unlikely to roll over and there would be \"less pain for the government if they hand [the messages] over quickly\".<br/>Former Conservative health secretary Matt Hancock is among those who have made clear they are happy to share unredacted messages in full.<br/>Boris Johnson's allies have also made clear he is happy to send more information - and he says he has given his WhatsApp messages and notebooks in full to the Cabinet Office.<br/>He has also said he will bypass the Cabinet Office by providing WhatsApps dating from April 2021 onwards directly to the inquiry. <br/>So where does this leave the government? <br/>Potentially in a tricky place. <br/>It has now launched a legal battle with the inquiry looking into how it functioned during a public health crisis that changed all of our lives. <br/>If it loses, that would be an embarrassing defeat. Questions would be asked about using public money to fight the case. <br/>If it wins, it's quite possible the Covid inquiry will be seriously undermined. <br/>Will bereaved families who have demanded full transparency accept this? Where would such a ruling leave inquiry chair Baroness Hallett, who has made her position clear? <br/>Cabinet minister Mel Stride has questioned the need for \"irrelevant\" documents to be provided to the inquiry - saying they would not add value.<br/>He told the BBC the government would be \"robust and open and candid\" in its dealings with the inquiry.<br/>But he drew a distinction with information that was \"unambiguously, entirely irrelevant\".<br/>He added: \"It seems to me to request lots and lots of that kind of data is not something which is adding any value\". <br/>With the government and the inquiry now locked in a legal battle, this row looks set to drag on.<br/>Covid inquiry demands release of Johnson WhatsApps<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

And then there was this wave of nationalism and Nicola Sturgeon,\" the 25-year-old says.<br/>Euan, who lives in Glasgow, says he's \"delighted\" Ms Sturgeon has left and believes voters are motivated to remove a \"very bad SNP government\".<br/>\"Some people did have a soft spot for Nicola Sturgeon,\" he says.<br/>\"But now you look at the opinion poll ratings of Humza Yousaf, they certainly don't feel that way about him.<br/>\"I think that's going to motivate people to go out and vote for unionist parties and particularly the Scottish Conservatives.\"<br/>But how does Euan think the Scottish Tories will appeal to young voters, a group they haven't always been associated with?<br/>\"I think we've got a big task, I'm not going to pretend lots and lots of young people are voting Scottish Conservative,\" he says. <br/>\"But I think it's why we've got to direct policies to young people that will benefit them. <br/>\"We need to build more houses, all of my friends are struggling to get on the housing ladder.

No ifs. No buts.\"<br/>It's a promise that came back to haunt the Conservatives - as the target receded further and further into the distance.<br/>As Thursday's Office for National Statistics data show, net migration is nowhere near that figure. In fact, migration added 606,000 to the UK's population in 2022, the highest number on record and sharply up on recent levels.<br/>There are a range of factors behind that rise, as we report here, and a lively debate over the benefits and disadvantages of immigration.<br/>But for some years now, the focus has not been on immigration per se, but on \"net migration\" - the difference between those entering and leaving the UK.<br/>It was David Cameron, who when he became prime minister in 2010, introduced the concept to the wider public. <br/>\"Net migration was not really a metric that people thought about or used in the run up to 2010,\" says Rob McNeil, deputy director of the University of Oxford's Migration Observatory.<br/>\"It created the idea that management of migration was a technocratic process. The reality is, it's much more complicated than that.\"<br/>Mr Cameron was keen to curb immigration but, he argued, what voters really cared about was not the numbers coming from overseas but the overall growth in the size of the UK's population. <br/>In a 2007 speech, he stressed the \"positive impact on our economy\" of immigration but added that it was \"time for change\".<br/>\"We need policy to reduce the level of net immigration,\" he declared.<br/>Unfortunately for Mr Cameron, his chosen measure was already on an upward trajectory.<br/>And there were question marks about how much control any government could exert over the number of people emigrating from the UK - a key component of net migration.<br/>There was a time when that number was very high, as Britons left for pastures new. As a result, UK net migration was routinely below zero before the 1990s. <br/>But since 1994, immigration to the UK has exceeded emigration every year to date.<br/>The figures show that immigration started to rise more sharply under Tony Blair's New Labour government.<br/>Net migration rose above 200,000 for the first time in 2004, after Mr Blair's government opened up the UK to workers from new EU member states in eastern Europe.<br/>\"Suddenly from being a steady trickle, immigration turned into a flood,\" said Damian Green, the former immigration minister and Conservative MP. \"It became a huge political issue.\"<br/>Analysis by the Migration Observatory in 2011, found government policies were not on track to reduce net migration to the tens of thousands.<br/>And yet Mr Green - who was the immigration minister at the time - continued to insist the government was on course to meet its target.<br/>\"It was doable,\" said Mr Green.<br/>\"I remember once seeing a projection in the Home Office that showed if everything stayed the same, by the 2015 election, we'd have net migration down to 116,000. It wasn't completely unrealistic.\"<br/>The promise of net migration in the tens of thousands appeared again in the Conservative Party's 2015 manifesto.<br/>Alongside that manifesto promise was one of a referendum on the UK's membership of the EU. With the Eurosceptic party UKIP rising in the polls, Mr Cameron was looking exposed on immigration.<br/>A migrant crisis, partly triggered by conflicts in the Middle East, was deepening in Europe, while UKIP was gaining political momentum and a bigger audience for its opposition to \"mass immigration\" ahead of the 2015 general election.<br/>Having won a majority at that election, Mr Cameron announced the Brexit referendum in 2016 and struck a deal to redraw the terms of the UK's EU membership.<br/>Concessions on immigration, including restrictions on benefits to EU migrants, formed the backbone of Mr Cameron's deal, but it wasn't enough to convince enough voters to back Remain.<br/>Instead, the Leave campaign - with its contentious warnings of an influx of migrants from the EU - proved more compelling to the 52% who voted for Brexit.<br/>Richard Tice, a prominent Eurosceptic and leader of Reform UK, said the Conservative MPs who backed Brexit promised they would take control of migration following the referendum.<br/>\"And we believed their promises,\" Mr Tice said. \"The data has shown that actually, they've abandoned those promises.<br/>\"We're brought up to trust what politicians say. But when they continually fail to do it, that trust evaporates.\"<br/>The promise remained unkept under former prime minister Theresa May, who held the line of \"net migration down to the tens of thousands\" in the Conservative Party's 2017 manifesto.<br/>Only in its 2019 manifesto, when Boris Johnson succeeded her as Tory leader, did the party ditch the under-100,000 pledge.<br/>Instead, the Conservatives - rather more vaguely - said \"the overall numbers will come down\" and \"we will ensure that the British people are always in control\".<br/>Liz Truss's tenure as prime minister was so short - just 49 days - and she didn't have a chance to set out her stall on migration.<br/>Migration has slipped down the political agenda, with YouGov polling showing immigration and asylum ranking behind the economy and housing as the most important issues facing the country.<br/>So far, the current prime minister, Rishi Sunak, has mostly focused on curbing illegal immigration and stopping small boats crossing the English Channel.<br/>Unlike his predecessors, Mr Sunak has so far shied away from putting a figure on what net migration should be, only calling the current level \"too high\".<br/>Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has similarly refused to set a target for net migration.<br/>\"I'm not putting a specific number on it,\" he said this week. \"The only thing we know about those targets is that they're routinely missed.\"<br/>As Mr Cameron found out the hard way, making commitments on something as difficult to control as the movement of people can create hostages to fortune, and leave promises unfulfilled.<br/>Sunak denies he's lost control of rising migration<br/>Legal migration is too high, says Rishi Sunak<br/>Who is allowed to come to live in the UK?<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

For MPs from the party, the data on voting intention highlights their thin support among younger generations.<br/>A YouGov poll found only 21% of 18 to 24-year-olds said they voted Conservative at the last general election in 2019, compared to 67% in the over-70s category.<br/>In recent polling, done at this month's local elections, only 8% of the 18 to 24 group said they would vote Conservative.<br/>\"For the 29 to 49-year-olds, that figure was 10%,\" Mr Hancock tells the event.<br/>That 10% figure, Mr Hancock says, \"is catastrophic for the electability of the Conservative Party, not just now, but for a decade\".<br/>\"We need to have credible policies that address the issues that younger people care about,\" he says.<br/>As a TikTok enthusiast with 184,000 followers on the platform, Mr Hancock claims to have an antenna for what young people are looking for in politics.<br/>Curbing climate change, providing more affordable housing, and technological innovation are what young people care about - not some \"divisive culture war\", Mr Hancock says.<br/>Even though he's been suspended as a Tory MP over his appearance on ITV's I'm a Celebrity, Mr Hancock is well received here.<br/>But does his analysis really reflect the hopes and fears of younger generations?<br/>At the event, we speak to five people under the age of 30, and tellingly, all of them say housing is their biggest worry.<br/>Eve Redmond, a 23-year-old renter who recently moved to London, says: \"I don't think I'll get on the property ladder in the next 10 to 15 years.<br/>\"I do think housing is a particularly important political issue for young people under the age of 30, millennials like me.\"<br/>Joe Lynch, the 18-year-old chairman of Romford Young Conservatives, agrees.<br/>\"We need more affordable housing,\" he says. \"If we can do that as a party, more young people can flock to us.\"<br/>He says the creeping Americanisation of British politics has damaged the Conservative brand.<br/>Some young people, he says, \"think we're all Make American Great Again lunatics, but that's not the case at all\".<br/>The perception among young people of being \"the nasty party\" troubles Nathan Stone, 20.<br/>He says the war against woke - a term that has come to symbolise conservative resistance to social changes - has been \"taken to the extremes\" lately.<br/>He says some of the ideas expressed at this week's National Conservatism Conference - an event organised by a right-wing American think tank - are \"not really going to appeal to younger people\".<br/>In his comments, Mr Hancock savages the \"Conservative Corbynistas\" in his party, who \"preach the same sort of cancel culture and virtue signalling that they say that they abhor on the left\".<br/>\"Looking at what's going on at other conferences, sometimes it felt like 'I'm a Conservative get me out of here',\" he says.<br/>With Mr Hancock standing down as an MP at the next election, he soon will be out of there. And yet, he still believes the liberal wing of his party has the answers to today's political questions.<br/>They will need answers if they are to bridge the generational gulfs exposed at recent general elections. In 2017 and 2019 elections, as well as the EU referendum in 2016, age became the most prominent dividing line in British politics.<br/>A report by the Onward think tank, from 2019, said 83% of Conservative voters were over 45, while 4% were under 24.<br/>At the last election, the tipping point - the age at which people are more likely to vote Conservative than Labour - was 39, according to YouGov.<br/>But recent data analysis suggests younger generations are upending one of the stickiest assumptions in politics.<br/>In research this year, two political scientists from King's College London showed how millennials and Gen Z-ers are not becoming more Conservative as they age.<br/>In analysis of Conservative support by age, the research showed a 40% gap between oldest and youngest in 2020, compared with 10% in the early 1990s.<br/>One important factor is how the life chances of a generation have been shaped by events, such as the financial crash in 2008, Brexit and the Covid-19 pandemic.<br/>Bobby Duffy, professor of public policy at King's, says decisions by recent Conservative governments have not supported young people, while the increasing focus on culture-war issues has polarised the generations.<br/>\"This generational divide looks like terrible news for future support for the Conservatives, as clearly older generations are dying out and being replaced by these younger generations,\" the professor says.<br/>Still, there are reasons to view predictions of Conservative extinction through a sceptical lens.<br/>\"The Conservatives do face a real challenge, but it may be as much to do with the current offer from this version of conservatism than the underlying principles and values,\" Prof Duffy says. \"Decline is not inevitable for the Tories, but to avoid it, they do need to change.\"<br/>The Conservative Party did not wish to comment.<br/>Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary, told the BBC it was important \"not to think about the country in terms of young or old\" and insisted the Tories had \"great young talent\", who appealed to voters of all ages.<br/>While the Tories wait to test that proposition in a general election, their party is being pulled in different political directions after 13 years in power.<br/>Meanwhile, Mr Hancock, apparently joking, turns to his pink tie for inspiration.<br/>\"I occasionally wear a tie,\" he says. \"Today was the first time I put on a suit in two weeks, because I'm a normal person, now. I'm not a Conservative MP. It's just like, be normal, like the people who we represent.

For example, workers pay income tax, everyone pays VAT on certain goods and companies pay tax on their profits.<br/>It could, in theory, cover all of its spending from taxes, and in some years that happens.<br/>But if it can't, it needs to either raise taxes, cut spending or borrow. <br/>Higher taxes mean people have less money to spend, so businesses make less profit, which can be bad for jobs and wages. Lower profits also mean companies pay less tax.<br/>So, governments often borrow to boost the economy. They also borrow to pay for big projects - such as new railways and roads - which they hope will help the economy.<br/>The government borrows money by selling financial products called bonds.<br/>A bond is a promise to pay money in the future. Most require the borrower to make regular interest payments over the bond's lifetime. <br/>UK government bonds - known as \"gilts\" - are normally considered very safe, with little risk the money will not be repaid.<br/>Gilts are mainly bought by financial institutions in the UK and abroad, such as pension funds, investment funds, banks and insurance companies. <br/>The Bank of England has also bought hundreds of billions of pounds' worth of government bonds in the past to support the economy, through a process called \"quantitative easing\".<br/>The amount the government borrows varies from month to month. <br/>For instance, when people submit tax returns in January, they often pay a large chunk of their annual tax bill in one go, so the government sees a jump in the amount of money it takes in. <br/>So it is more helpful to look at the whole year, or the year-to-date.<br/>In the 2022-23 financial year, the government borrowed \u00a3134.1bn. That was about \u00a312bn higher than the previous year.<br/>In May, the government borrowed \u00a320bn, which was the second-highest borrowing figure for May since records began in 1993.<br/>The total amount the government owes is called the national debt. It is currently about \u00a32.57tn.<br/>That is roughly the same as the value of all the goods and services produced in the UK in a year, known as the gross domestic product, or GDP.<br/>That current level is more than double what was seen from the 1980s through to the financial crisis of 2008. <br/>The combination of the financial crash and the Covid pandemic pushed the UK's debt up from those historic lows to its current level.<br/>But in relation to the size of the economy, today's debt is still low compared with much of the last century, as shown above, and also compared with some other leading economies. <br/>The larger the national debt gets, the more interest the government has to pay. <br/>That extra cost was not as big when the interest rates due were low through the 2010s. But it is more noticeable now that interest rates have been rising. <br/>Two months in 2022 saw record levels of money set aside for debt interest: \u00a320bn in June and \u00a318bn in December. The third largest amount came in April 2023, when interest payments hit \u00a39.8bn.<br/>In May 2023, debt interest was \u00a37.7bn.<br/>During the last financial year, the government spent \u00a3111bn on debt interest - more than it spent on education. <br/>Some economists fear the government is borrowing too much, at too great a cost.  <br/>Others argue extra borrowing helps the economy grow faster - generating more tax revenue in the long run.<br/>The government's official economic forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), has warned that public debt could soar as the population ages and tax income falls. <br/>In an ageing population, the proportion of people of working age drops, meaning the government takes less in tax while paying out more in pensions. <br/>The OBR says debt could rise to more than 300% of GDP by 2070. <br/>It also says climate change poses a \"significant\" risk to government finances. <br/>This video can not be played<br/>What does a billion pounds look like... and what can it buy?<br/>Responding to the OBR report, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said the government would take \"difficult but responsible\" decisions on the public finances.<br/>He previously blamed the \"twin global emergencies of a pandemic and Putin's war in Ukraine\" for driving up government costs.<br/>The chancellor has set a target of getting underlying debt to fall in five years' time.<br/>Prime Minister Rishi Sunak also made reducing the national debt one of his five key promises.<br/>The deficit is the gap between the government's income and the amount it spends.<br/>When a government spends less than its income, it has what is known as a surplus. <br/>Debt is the total amount of money owed by the government that has built up over years. <br/>It rises when there is a deficit, and falls in those years when there is a surplus.  <br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

That target has become the centrepiece of global efforts to tackle climate change.<br/>Climate scientists have been warning governments for years that they are not cutting their countries' emissions quickly enough to keep within this target. <br/>But it is surprising for someone as senior and well respected as the former head of the UN climate science body the IPCC to be so frank that he believes it will be missed.<br/>Professor Sir Bob Watson is currently Emeritus Professor of the UK's Tyndall Centre for Climate Research - having previously worked at the UN, Nasa, UK's Department of Environment and the US White House - and is perhaps one of the foremost climate scientists in the world.<br/>In the interview aired on Thursday he said: \"I think most people fear that if we give up on the 1.5 [celsius limit] which I do not believe we will achieve, in fact I'm very pessimistic about achieving even 2C, that if we allow the target to become looser and looser, higher and higher, governments will do even less in the future.\"<br/>Although his comments are candid on the state of action on climate change, many of his colleagues will agree with his conclusion that we are on course for a temperature rise of 2.5C or more. Based on current government commitments to cutting greenhouse gas emissions Climate Action Tracker predicts that global temperatures will rise to 2.7C .<br/>The figure is not a direct measure of the world's temperature but an indicator of how much or how little the Earth has warmed or cooled compared to the long-term global average - and even slight changes can have significant impacts. <br/>The UN climate body, the IPCC, has said keeping temperature rises below 1.5C, rather than 2C, would mean:<br/>Prof Sir Bob Watson said that the world is struggling to prevent temperature rises as we are not reducing emissions fast enough. <br/>\"The big issue is we need to reduce greenhouse gases now to even be on the pathway to be close to 1.5C or 2C. We need to reduce current emissions by at least 50% by 2030. The trouble is the emissions are still going up, they are not going down,\" he said.<br/>He told the Today programme that setting targets was not enough and countries needed to back these up with action: \"We need to try and hold governments to start to act sensibly now and reduce emissions, but even governments with a really good target like the United Kingdom don't have the policies in place, don't have the financing in place to reach those goals.\"<br/>In March the UK's watchdog on climate change said the UK had lost its leadership on climate issues. It said Government backing for new oil and coal, airport expansion plans and slow progress on heat pumps showed a lack of urgency across government on the issue.<br/>World likely to warm beyond key 1.5C limit by 2027<br/>What is El Ni\u00f1o and how does it change the weather?<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Total panic.<br/>\"It's hard not to believe that you're a criminal, that you're deserving of this,\" the Australian climate activist says.<br/>Last month, the 25-year-old had her home in Western Australia raided by counter-terrorism police. <br/>Her alleged crime - helping to flood a global fossil fuel giant's office with non-toxic gas.<br/>Stench gas, which smells like rotten eggs, is let off in mines to alert workers of danger. In this case, it was used by protesters to empty the Perth headquarters of Woodside Energy, to highlight the climate crisis.  <br/>Australia's largest oil and gas firm says the protests targeting its brand are \"unlawful\" activities by \"extreme groups\".<br/>But environmental campaigners say disruptive protest is key to their mission. <br/>Meanwhile, lawyers warn that the response to climate activism in Australia has become \"increasingly militarised\".<br/>Ms Sangalli says officers from Western Australia's State Security Investigation Group (SSIG) - whose duties include counter-terrorism - searched her home for hours, looking for evidence of her involvement in the Woodside protest. <br/>Despite facing no formal charges and not being present at the gas evacuation, she was forced to watch as her personal items were seized - including phones and laptops - and a male officer flicked through her diary. <br/>\"That was the most painful part,\" she told the BBC. <br/>\"Violated is a good word for it. You're rendered powerless.\" <br/>The activist has been involved with two climate protest groups - the global Extinction Rebellion, and the more local Disrupt Burrup Hub, which campaigns against fossil fuel projects on the state's Burrup Peninsula. <br/>Both groups follow a \"direct action\" strategy intended to end climate complacency, which means engaging in activities such as infiltrating fossil fuel conferences, blocking rush hour traffic, and superficially defacing artworks. <br/>Several members of the group are now facing criminal charges over the Woodside protest, with the company alleging four of its employees suffered dizziness, breathing difficulties, rashes, and nausea. <br/>\"Woodside condemns unlawful acts that are intended to threaten, harm, intimidate or disrupt our employees,\" the company said. <br/>But Disrupt Burrup maintains their protest stunt was carried out safely and was a necessary action against one of Australia's most powerful polluters.<br/>Its members are challenging the charges in court.<br/>Western Australia is a resource-rich state built on mining revenue, particularly iron ore, oil and gas.<br/>Its industry is concentrated in the Pilbara, a desert area in the state's far north. With an annual output of more than A$100bn (\u00a352bn; $67bn), it powers the national economy and is home to global mining giants, including Rio Tinto and BHP.  <br/>Some of Australia's most polluting projects are based there, including Woodside's North West Shelf gas facility and its Scarborough development - a controversial offshore drilling venture which scientists say will jeopardise the nation's climate targets. <br/>Both projects have sparked fierce debate and renewed accusations that the gas lobby has an outsized influence over state authorities. <br/>Access to ministers, timing of political donations and movement of mining executives into watchdogs, have all been cited as examples - including three former Woodside employees who chaired the advisory board of Australia's offshore oil and gas regulator. <br/>Gerard Mazza has led protests against Woodside's Pilbara projects, due to their emissions and damage to local ancient Aboriginal rock art. <br/>The 31-year-old's home was recently raided by SSIG police for his alleged role in attempting to evacuate Woodside's annual investors meeting in April, also using stench-gas.  <br/>He now faces charges of aggravated burglary, which carry a maximum 20-year sentence. <br/>Mr Mazza argues Western Australia is a \"petrostate\" designed to \"protect fossil fuel companies\" due to the money they bring in. <br/>\"If it was really all about public safety, the state would be cracking down on Woodside executives making obscene wealth by endangering lives and ecosystems. Instead, they're coming after us.\"<br/>The state government has routinely dismissed such claims, denying any influence. In response to the BBC's questions, it said it is \"committed to achieving net zero emissions by 2050\".<br/>But Western Australia's emissions continue to rise, while other states have recorded significant reductions over the past decade.<br/>A dozen raids - including those on Mr Mazza and Ms Sangalli's homes - have been carried out by the state's counter-terrorism police against climate protesters this year. <br/>The SSIG collaborates with federal intelligence agencies on matters of national security and is exempt from Freedom of Information laws, meaning its investigations remain secret. <br/>Lawyers such as Julia Grix says politicians and prosecutors are framing climate protesters as a threat to public safety to justify heavy-handed policing. <br/>The solicitor - who defends environmental activists - says her clients are increasingly being referred to as \"extremists\" in court documents. <br/>\"That sort of language is most commonly applied to organised crime of a very sophisticated kind, which I would associate with bikie (motorcycle) gangs, or terrorism,\" Ms Grix said. <br/>It's a \"demonisation strategy\" used to justify \"extreme measures never intended for regulating protests\", Australian legal scholar Luke McNamara says. <br/>The right to protest has long been defended by Australia's courts. <br/>In 2017, a landmark High Court case ruled that Tasmania's anti-protest laws were unconstitutional. And in 2020, a Queensland state court overturned suspended prison sentences against two activists who had blocked access to the major Adani coal mine. <br/>David Mejia-Canales, a lawyer at the Human Rights Law Centre, an Australian rights group, says those protections are key to a functioning democracy. <br/>\"Protest takes many forms, sometimes disruptive. But that's why it's effective, because it disrupts the everyday to demand attention for a cause,\" he said.<br/>\"As citizens of a democratic society, we should exercise a level of tolerance for disruption if the right to protest is going to have its full value.\"<br/>But Western Australia's emergency services minister, Stephen Dawson, recently argued in parliament that the evacuation of Woodside's offices could be viewed as \"an act of terrorism\" because \"people's health was put at risk by the material released\".<br/>And some of Australia's most prominent leaders - including former Prime Minister Scott Morrison - have called for demonstrations which obstruct critical infrastructure to be \"outlawed\". <br/>\"The right to protest does not mean there is an unlimited licence to disrupt people's lives,\" he said in 2019, labelling environmental campaigners \"anarchists\". <br/>The court cases under way in Western Australia are not taking place in isolation. <br/>They are part of a broader national crackdown which has seen Australian states criminalise disruptive protests through new laws, increased jail terms and penalties. This has sparked public outcry. <br/>In May, after several Extinction Rebellion protests, the South Australia government introduced a A$50,000 maximum fine and three months jail for anyone \"recklessly\" obstructing public spaces, while laws passed in New South Wales last year created a two-year maximum prison sentence for acts disrupting major roads or facilities. <br/>England, Wales and parts of Canada and the US have also adopted similar laws aimed at blocking disruptive climate activism. <br/>In Western Australia, climate protesters say they have been \"disabled\" by intimidating raids, strict bail conditions and orders which give authorities access to their devices and ban them from communicating with peers.<br/>According to Ms Grix, these tools were originally intended to deal with gangs and drug dealers.<br/>\"To apply [that]... to climate defenders, who are protesting about environmental concerns, seems to be a massive overreach,\" she says.<br/>Prof McNamara agrees. <br/>\"What we see in these situations is the police reaching for whatever is at their disposal,\" he told the BBC. <br/>\"Counterterrorism policing units and associated powers were never intended to be used against protesters.\"<br/>In the coming days, several court hearings will determine whether Mr Mazza and some of his peers could face prison. <br/>But the 31-year-old says that while \"climate and culture\" remain under threat, he will \"not be deterred\" from protesting.<br/>Climate activist's jailing ignites row in Australia<br/>How Australia is becoming more unliveable<br/>Is climate change killing Australian wine?<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Cheetahs, declared extinct in 1952 in India, were reintroduced as part of the world's first intercontinental relocation of a large carnivore. They are housed in Kuno national park in the central state of Madhya Pradesh.<br/>So far, eight cheetahs, including three cubs born in March, have died. <br/>Some of the deaths have been caused by unavoidable reasons, such as cardiac failure precipitated by stress or mating injuries. <br/>But several wildlife experts and veterinary doctors have told the BBC that the last two deaths were caused by maggot infestations following skin infections. And they say one of the reasons could be the radio collars that the animals are made to wear for their own protection.<br/>It's a theory the environment and forests ministry has strongly rejected. In an official statement, the ministry insisted that the adult cheetahs all died \"due to natural causes\" and said reports blaming radio collars were \"speculative and lacking in scientific evidence\". The BBC also contacted Rajesh Gopal, chairman of the cheetah project, but he hasn't responded yet. <br/>Wildlife experts, however, say such injuries are not uncommon among other big cats too, especially during India's humid rainy season.<br/>Alok Kumar, former chief conservator of forests in Madhya Pradesh, told the BBC that the deaths among big cats could be due to many reasons but radio collars - although key to their survival - could be a factor too. <br/>\"These collars carry chips that send information about the wearer through satellites and are necessary to monitor the movement of the animal for their safety and protection,\" Mr Kumar said, adding that he \"has seen infections caused by collars even in tigers\".<br/>Yadvendradev Jhala, veteran conservationist and one of the experts who planned and oversaw the translocation project, told the BBC that the wounds may be caused by the animal scratching the area around the collar because of humidity.<br/>\"This is the first monsoon for the cheetahs who have come from the jungles of Africa which are dry zones and they are still trying to acclimatise to Indian monsoon,\" he said.<br/>The cheetahs \"have a very heavy under-fur\" - thick hair under their neck - which absorbs a lot of moisture in very damp weather and that makes it soft and tender and itchy. <br/>\"And when the animal scratches, if the skin breaks, then flies lay eggs there and a maggot infestation happens which leads to a bacterial invasion and causes septicaemia, leading to death,\" he added.<br/>A lot of prestige is attached to the cheetah project in India - Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself travelled to Kuno last September to release the first batch of eight cheetahs from Namibia into the national park. (Another 12 of the big cats were brought in from South Africa earlier this year.) So it's no surprise that every death - and birth - makes headlines.<br/>The death of the cubs from \"malnourishment and dehydration\" had led many to ask why the authorities didn't intervene in time to ensure their survival. Similar questions are being asked now after last week's deaths.<br/>One vet who has seen a video of one of the two bodies said on condition of anonymity that \"it was covered with thousands of maggots from head to toe\".<br/>\"It takes several days for an animal to die from a maggot infestation, so how come no-one noticed?\" he asked. <br/>The last cheetah to die was Suraj, spotted last Friday by a monitoring team \"in a lethargic state\" with \"a fly around its neck\", the Indian Express reported. Three hours later, Suraj was found dead. <br/>A wildlife official said \"initial investigation found the cause of the feline's death to be wounds on the neck and back\". <br/>The paper quoted Madhya Pradesh principal chief conservator of forests JS Chauhan - who has since been removed from his position - as saying that another male cheetah, who had died a few days earlier, had similar injuries. Mr Chauhan said that \"one of the causes could be the satellite collars\".<br/>On Wednesday, reports said at least three other cheetahs were sick with similar wounds, with wildlife experts calling on the authorities to investigate the role of radio collars in the deaths.<br/>Mr Jhala says the only way to deal with the situation is to check all the remaining cheetahs to see if any of them have any lesions.<br/>\"And if they find any, then they have to treat them. The collars, of course, can't be put back on until an animal has fully healed, which means that the cheetahs will have to be brought back into protected enclosures for their safety,\" he adds.<br/>The action plan for the reintroduction of the cheetah in India had anticipated a 50% mortality rate in the first year of the project.<br/>Mr Jhala says it was anticipated that the deaths would be from snaring and poaching, accidents involving vehicles and in conflict with leopards. <br/>\"It's very positive that the anticipated causes haven't happened,\" he said. \"On the other hand, the deaths that have taken place have been a learning experience, a very expensive learning experience.\"<br/>Mr Kumar says that projects like these are expected to have a long gestation period.<br/>\"Cheetah is a new species in our home. It may take five to 10 years to settle them in the Indian subcontinent,\" he said. \"We are taking lessons every day, learning how to manage and protect them.\"<br/>BBC News India is now on YouTube.

These are among the new finds being turned up at the Pompeii Archaeological Park.<br/>Dig anywhere in the ancient city destroyed by Mount Vesuvius in AD79 and you will unearth a treasure - a snapshot of a lost Roman world.<br/>It's extraordinary to think that one-third of the city buried under pumice and ash has yet to be excavated.<br/>\"Much of that will be for future generations,\" says Alessandro Russo, the co-lead archaeologist on the new dig.<br/>\"We have a problem to conserve what we've already found. Future generations may have new ideas, new techniques.\"<br/>The latest work returns to a sector in the park last explored in the late 19th Century. <br/>Back then, archaeologists had opened up the frontage of houses on Via Di Nola, one of Pompeii's main thoroughfares, but hadn't delved far behind. <br/>They had identified a laundry but that was about it.<br/>Now, the diggers are progressively pulling away the volcanic ash and pea-sized stones, known as lapilli, that smothered Pompeii during the two catastrophic days of the Vesuvian eruption.<br/>The dig site is, in effect, a whole city block. It is known as an insula and is some 3,000 sq m (32,000 sq ft) in size.<br/>BBC News has been given exclusive access to the investigation with Lion TV, which is making a three-part series to be aired early next year on the BBC.<br/>\"Every room in every house has its own micro-story in the grander story of Pompeii. I want to uncover those micro-stories,\" says Gennaro Iovino. <br/>The other co-lead archaeologist wants you to imagine that you are entering a delightful atrium - an entrance hall - with a hole in the roof where lion figureheads direct rainwater down onto a fountain, next to a statue. <br/>The builders were clearly doing some repairs at the time of the eruption because the roof tiles are neatly stacked in two piles. But this is not a magnificent villa, like some of the imposing homes found elsewhere in Pompeii. <br/>This building would have been part-commercial because, on turning right, you are confronted by a giant oven, big enough to be producing 100 loaves a day. <br/>Roughly 50 bakeries have already been found in Pompeii. This, however, can't have been a shop because there is no shop front. <br/>It's more likely to have been a wholesaler, distributing bread across town, perhaps to the many fast-food joints for which Pompeii was so famous.<br/>The discovery of a fresco depicting a piece of round flatbread on a silver tray, accompanied by pomegranate, dates, nuts and arbutus fruits, caused a sensation when it was announced to the world in June. <br/>It's not a pizza, though. Tomatoes and mozzarella, two ingredients in the classic Neapolitan recipe, were not available in Italy in the first century AD. <br/>Perhaps it's a piece of focaccia? The pizza thing started as a bit of a joke, says Gennaro. \"I emailed a picture to my boss, saying 'first the oven, now the pizza'.\" <br/>The world just went crazy after that. A cover will soon be built over the fresco to try to protect it from the elements. <br/>The 20,000 visitors who come to Pompeii every day will demand to see the \"ancestor to the pizza\", as some are now describing the fresco subject. <br/>It's easy to forget that Pompeii was a human tragedy. We have little idea how many died. You have to believe most residents left when they saw the horror unfolding at the top of Vesuvius. <br/>Skeletons have been recovered, perhaps 1,300 to 1,500 in total, and the new dig has its own examples: two women and a child of unknown sex. <br/>Looking at where the victims were found, it's obvious that they were trying to take cover, hoping that by hiding under a staircase, they would be safe. <br/>What they hadn't counted on was the roof collapsing from the weight of all the lapilli and ash. The heavy stonework smashed their bodies. <br/>The drama of those momentous days in October AD79 are also revealed on the other side of the atrium in what was once a bedroom. <br/>The bed itself is a charred mass - caused by a fire. It is barely recognisable apart from its broad outline seared into the walls and floor. <br/>If you look closely at the debris, you can see blackened fragments of the textile bedclothes and even the filling from the mattress. <br/>Archaeologists can tell from the position of these carbonised remains that the fire occurred relatively early in the eruption. They speculate that a lamp might have been knocked over in the panic to get out.<br/>\"It would be interesting to understand who were the people that didn't make it,\" wonders park director Gabriel Zuchtriegel. <br/>\"Were they the poor? More women than men? Or maybe people who had property and tried to stay to protect what they had, while others who had nothing just took off and ran.\"<br/>Towards the back of the area so far excavated there is a wall that encloses three rooms. It's here that the removal of lapilli and ash has exposed more astonishing artwork. <br/>In the middle room, covered by a tarpaulin, is yet another elegant fresco. It shows the episode in the myth of Achilles where the legendary hero soldier - with his unfortunate Achilles heel - tried to hide dressed as a woman to avoid fighting in the Trojan War. <br/>In the third room, I pull back another tarp to reveal a magnificent shrine. Two yellow serpents in relief slither up a burgundy background. \"These are good demons,\" says Alessandro. He points to a fresco further down the wall just above an opening to a box of some kind. <br/>\"This room is actually a kitchen. They would have made offerings here to their gods. Foods like fish or fruits. The snake is a connection between the gods and the humans.\"<br/>As the insula is further revealed, scaffolding is being put up around what remains of the buildings to make protective roofing. In the future, the park hopes to erect a high walkway so tourists can see the new treasures that are emerging.<br/>\"People sometimes ask [us], 'What would you like to find? What are you looking for?'\" explains Gabriel. He says such questions are misleading. <br/>\"What we're really looking for is what we don't know. We're always looking for a surprise. It's all emerging evidence, leading us somewhere, but we don't know where that journey goes.\"<br/>Additional reporting by Rebecca Morelle, Alison Francis and Tony Jolliffe.

We are at the stage where promising further action is not enough.<br/>\"The scale of the climate impacts we are seeing make clear that resilience to climate change should be a much greater national priority.\"<br/>The UKCCC noted almost all the measures are re-announcements of existing commitments from other plans like the Environment Act. <br/>Trudy Harrison, minister for climate adaptation, said: \"We are absolutely serious across government. What we have set out today is billions of pounds of investment to protect the most vulnerable communities.\"<br/>She said the government had taken on board the climate change committee's comments.<br/>\"There's always more to do. This is a five-year plan,\" she said.<br/>New proposals in the plan from government include: <br/>As global temperatures continue to rise the risk of extreme events in the UK such as high heat, winter flooding and storm surge increases.<br/>Last year, during the most intense heat wave the country has ever faced, there were 25,000 wildfires from the moorlands of greater Manchester to the gardens of east London. Hospitals struggled to cope - around 3,000 more deaths in the over-65s than usual and 20% of operations were cancelled. <br/>Alongside flooding, overheating is one of the biggest risks the UK population face from climate change. <br/>Dr Chloe Brimicombe, researcher in heatwaves at University Graz,  told the BBC: \"The reason that it's a massive risk is that it causes significant health issues especially for vulnerable groups. It causes health issues like dehydration, heat stress which they might need to go to hospital for.\"<br/>The government wants contractors who build new schools and hospitals to implement cooling measures like shaded windows, green roofs and more open spaces. But there is no new legislation or funding for updates to existing homes to make sure they are protected.<br/>Under a scenario where global temperatures rise by 2C all homes in England and Wales are at risk of overheating according to energy consultants Arup.<br/>In dense urban areas like London, Manchester and Birmingham populations are particularly at risk. <br/>Rezina Chowdhury, Labour deputy leader of Lambeth council in south London told the BBC: \"Our communities feel the effects disproportionately with poorer households... and our residents live in flats without outside space.\"<br/>But she said that there is no secure funding: \"It is like Hunger Games where people are having to fight for pots of money to do the work we should all be doing.\"<br/>Local authorities are being offered advice and information from a new climate advice service to help them tailor their response. <br/>This move has been welcomed by Linda Taylor, environment spokesperson for the Local Government Association, the national body for authorities in England and Wales.<br/>\"But while access to Local Authority Climate Data could provide some good learning and understanding for councils, they crucially need the resources and money to take action on their findings,\" she said. <br/>The UK is not just vulnerable to heat at home but also abroad. The UK only produces 16% of its fruit and 50% of its vegetables domestically, relying on imports, mostly from Europe, to fulfil the shortfall. Therefore any extreme weather events in Europe could effect the supply here. <br/>Earlier this year the UK experienced shortages of cucumber, tomatoes and other popular vegetables after poor weather in Spain, and now the same region is baking under an intense heatwave. which could further damage crops.<br/>The UKCCC recommended in March that the government require, by law, all large food companies to assess the climate risks to their supply chains. <br/>The government did not propose this in the NAP. It said that a new Food Security Strategy would be produced for next year but industry was best placed to deal with the issue. <br/>Flooding and storms are the other major risk the UK currently faces. Memorable events such as Storm Arwen wreaked havoc with UK homes and key infrastructure. In November 2021, it left one million British properties without power and internet supply.<br/>There are no targets in the plan for improving the strength of the communications sector, which was a key ask of the UKCCC in March - but said Ofcom would look at issuing new guidance to companies to prepare for climate change.<br/>\u2018It\u2019s like an oven\u2019: Life in Britain\u2019s hottest areas<br/>UK heat deaths to triple without action on housing<br/>Why is there a shortage of tomatoes in the UK?<br/>UK Committee on Climate Change<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Very hot. And temperatures show no signs of easing.<br/>Nearly a third of Americans - over 113 million people - are under some form of heat advisory, the US National Weather Service said. <br/>Across the US, temperatures are shattering decades-long record highs. In El Paso, Texas, temperatures have soared to above 37C - triple-digits Fahrenheit - for 27 consecutive days, overtaking a record last set in 1994.  <br/>In the UK, the June heat didn't just break all-time records, it smashed them. It was 0.9C hotter than the previous record, set back in 1940. That is a huge margin.<br/>There is a similar story of unprecedented hot weather in North Africa, the Middle East and Asia.<br/>No surprise, then, that the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather forecasts said that globally, June was the hottest on record.<br/>And the heat has not eased. The three hottest days ever recorded were in the past week, according to the EU climate and weather service, Copernicus.<br/>The average world temperature hit 16.89C on Monday 3 July and topped 17C for the first time on 4 July, with an average global temperature of 17.04C. <br/>Provisional figures suggest that was exceeded on 5 July when temperatures reached 17.05C.<br/>These highs are in line with what climate models predicted, says Prof Richard Betts, climate scientist at the Met Office and University of Exeter.<br/>\"We should not be at all surprised with the high global temperatures,\" he says. \"This is all a stark reminder of what we've known for a long time, and we will see ever more extremes until we stop building up more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\"<br/>When we think about how hot it is, we tend to think about the air temperature, because that's what we experience in our daily lives.   <br/>But most of the heat stored near the surface of the Earth is not in the atmosphere, but in the oceans. And we've been seeing some record ocean temperatures this spring and summer.  <br/>The North Atlantic, for example, is currently experiencing the highest surface water temperatures ever recorded.<br/>That marine heatwave has been particularly pronounced around the coasts of the UK, where some areas have experienced temperatures as much as 5C above what you would normally expect for this time of year.<br/>The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has labelled it a Category 4 heatwave. The designation is rarely used outside of the tropics and denotes \"extreme\" heat.<br/>\"Such anomalous temperatures in this part of the North Atlantic are unheard of,\" says Daniela Schmidt, a professor of Earth Sciences at the University of Bristol.<br/>At the same time, an El Ni\u00f1o is developing in the tropical Pacific.  <br/>El Ni\u00f1o is a recurring weather pattern caused when warm waters rise to the surface off the coast of South America and spread across the ocean.<br/>With both the Atlantic and the Pacific experiencing heatwaves, it is perhaps not surprising that global sea surface temperatures for both April and May were the highest ever recorded in Met Office data that goes all the way back to 1850.<br/>If the seas are warmer than usual, you can expect higher air temperatures too, says Tim Lenton, professor of climate change at Exeter University.<br/>Most of the extra heat trapped by the build-up of greenhouse gases has gone into warming the surface ocean, he explains. That extra heat tends to get mixed downwards towards the deeper ocean, but movements in oceans currents - like El Ni\u00f1o - can bring it back to the surface.<br/>\"When that happens, a lot of that heat gets released into the atmosphere,\" says Prof Lenton, \"driving up air temperatures.\"<br/>It's easy to think of this exceptionally hot weather as unusual, but the depressing truth is that climate change means it is now normal to experience record-breaking temperatures.  <br/>Greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase year on year. The rate of growth has slowed slightly, but energy-related CO2 emissions were still up almost 1% last year, according to the International Energy Agency, a global energy watchdog.<br/>And the higher the global temperature, the higher the risk of heatwaves, says Friederike Otto, a climatologist at the Grantham Institute of Climate Change at Imperial College London.<br/>\"These heatwaves are not only more frequent, but also hotter and longer than they would have been without global warming,\" she says.<br/>Experts are already predicting that the developing El Ni\u00f1o is likely to make 2023 the world's hottest year.<br/>They fear it is likely to temporarily push the world past a key 1.5C warming milestone.<br/>And that is just the start. Unless we make dramatic reductions to greenhouse gas emissions, temperatures will continue to rise.<br/>The Met Office said this week that record June temperatures this year were made twice as likely because of man-made climate change. <br/>These rising temperatures are already driving fundamental and almost certainly irreversible changes in ecosystems across the world.<br/>The record June temperatures in the UK helped cause unprecedented deaths of fish in rivers and canals, for example.  <br/>We cannot know what impact the current marine heatwave will have on the UK, cautions Prof Schmidt of the University of Bristol, because we have never seen one this intense before. <br/>\"In other regions, around Australia, in the Mediterranean, entire ecosystems changed, kelp forests disappeared, and seabirds and whales starved,\" she says.<br/>The world is effectively in a race. <br/>It is clear we are speeding towards an ever hotter and more chaotic climate future, but we do have the technologies and tools to cut our emissions.<br/>The question now is whether we can do so rapidly enough to slow the climate juggernaut and keep the impacts of global warming within manageable boundaries.<br/>What do you want to know about these heatwaves?

It is the most powerful fluctuation in the climate system anywhere on Earth.<br/>In June, scientists declared that El Ni\u00f1o conditions were present. This means that additional heat is now welling up to the surface of the Pacific ocean, pushing up the global temperature. <br/>\"The average global surface air temperature reaching 17C for the first time since we have reliable records available is a significant symbolic milestone in our warming world,\" said climate researcher Leon Simons.<br/>\"Now that the warmer phase of El Ni\u00f1o is starting we can expect a lot more daily, monthly and annual records breaking in the next 1.5 years.\"<br/>Monday's record temperature comes as the month of June was also confirmed as the hottest June in the global record. <br/>Average temperatures across the planet were 1.46C above the average in the period between 1850 and 1900.<br/>The impact of high temperatures is also being felt at the world's extremes.

CO2 is released when oil, gas and coal are burned in homes, factories and to power transport. Methane is produced through farming and landfill. <br/>These gases increase global temperatures by trapping the sun's energy.<br/>Meanwhile, rapid deforestation across the world means there are fewer trees to absorb CO2.<br/>Under the 2015 Paris climate agreement, 197 countries agreed to try to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C by 2100. <br/>To achieve this, scientists said that net zero CO2 emissions should be reached by 2050.<br/>However, the UN now wants countries to bring forward their net zero targets by a decade to avoid what it called \"the growing climate disaster\".<br/>Not all emissions can be reduced to zero, so those that remain need to be matched by actively removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. This is known as \"offsetting\".<br/>Natural offsetting methods include planting trees and restoring peatlands.<br/>One industrial method is carbon capture and storage which involves using machinery to remove CO2 from the air and store it, often deep underground. However, the technology is still emerging and remains expensive.<br/>Although offsetting is important, it can only cancel out a small fraction of current greenhouse gas emissions.<br/>So scientists say drastic cuts to fossil fuel use are essential to meet the net zero goal.<br/>To help reach net zero by 2050, the UK has made a series of ambitious pledges including:<br/>The government released an updated net zero strategy in March, but many climate experts criticised the announcement for lacking significant new policies or extra investment. <br/>The UK needs to reduce its emissions by 68% by 2030 compared with 1990 levels, in line with the Paris Agreement - a key step towards net zero by 2050. <br/>But despite the new strategy, the government's independent climate advisers now say they are \"markedly\" less confident than a year ago that the UK will meet the 2050 target. <br/>While the most significant changes need to come from government, individuals will also have to play their part to help reach net zero.<br/>This could include:<br/>Around 140 countries have pledged to reach net zero, covering about 90% of global emissions. However, not all have set a 2050 deadline.<br/>China - currently the biggest producer of CO2 worldwide - aims for \"carbon neutrality\" by 2060. Its plans to cut emissions aren't fully developed, but its renewable energy sector has been growing rapidly.<br/>The US has historically been the biggest carbon emitter, and still emits more than China per head. It has pledged to reach net zero by 2050. In August 2022, it announced a major green investment package called the Inflation Reduction Act, which aims to boost renewables and other clean technologies. <br/>The EU, the third biggest emitter of CO2, also has a 2050 net zero target. In March it announced its own green investment package, called the Net Zero Industry Act.<br/>India and Russia are also key emitters. They have pledged to reach net zero by 2070 and 2060 respectively, but have published few policies to back this up.<br/>There's controversy about how some countries might try to reach net zero.<br/>For instance, a country might record lower emissions if it imported energy-intensive goods from overseas, rather than producing the goods itself. <br/>But in reality, it wouldn't have reduced the total amount of greenhouse gases going into the atmosphere. <br/>There are also schemes that enable rich countries to offset their emissions by paying poorer countries to switch to cleaner fuels. <br/>But some climate scientists worry this could let wealthier nations avoid reducing their fossil fuel usage, by taking advantage of a switch to cleaner fuels in poorer countries which may have happened anyway.<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

But a BBC investigation tracked one video that has been viewed millions of times - and found the company is struggling to stop false climate information from spreading across the platform.<br/>If you searched for \"climate change\" on TikTok in recent months, you might have come across a video featuring Dan Pe\u00f1a, a self-styled \"business success coach\" with thousands of followers on social media.<br/>The video, shot during the 2017 London premiere of a documentary film about Mr Pe\u00f1a, shows a heated exchange between the American businessman and a member of the audience.<br/>Asked what \"the people with the money\" will do about climate change, he replies: \"The financial institutions and the banks know [climate change] is not going to happen.\"<br/>He adds, without providing any credible evidence: \"It's the greatest fraud that has been perpetrated on mankind this century.\" <br/>Contacted by the BBC, Mr Pe\u00f1a stood by these comments, saying climate change was actually a \"historical norm\" over thousands of years and \"not new\".  He questioned whether it was a \"genuine threat\" as well as the effectiveness of measures proposed by climate change activists in the face of growing emissions from China.  <br/>The overwhelming weight of scientific evidence has found that world temperatures are rising because of human activity, leading to rapid climate change and threatening every aspect of human life.<br/>But while Mr Pe\u00f1a's statements conflict with that scientific evidence, this clip appears to have been edited and re-uploaded by other users from different TikTok accounts dozens of times, racking up more than nine million views in the process. <br/>Under new community guidelines unveiled by TikTok last April, content that \"undermines well-established scientific consensus\" on climate change will not be allowed on the platform. <br/>And yet, the clip depicting Mr Pe\u00f1a is far from an isolated occurrence: the BBC identified 365 different videos in English denying the existence of man-made climate change.  <br/>TikTok itself deems climate change denial to be \"harmful misinformation\". Using tools available to any TikTok user, we reported those videos to the platform under that category. We then waited for at least a day to find out whether they would be taken down. <br/>The company did not remove almost 95% of the posts we flagged up - videos that, having been watched almost 30 million times, appeared to be attracting significant attention. <br/>In a statement to the BBC, TikTok said it is working \"to empower informed climate discussions\", and that it is working with fact-checkers to tackle misinformation. <br/>The company also pointed out that, when users search for videos about climate change, they are being shown a link to a United Nations website on the topic. <br/>But the video of Mr Pe\u00f1a demonstrates how \"bad arguments can spread really fast on TikTok\", says Roshan Salgado D'Arcy, a science communicator who uses social media to debunk viral videos that contain false claims about climate change. <br/>\"There are no real checks and balances to make sure that the information is accurate.\"<br/>The problem is not exclusive to English-speaking TikTok either: BBC Monitoring found dozens of other climate change-denying videos in Spanish, Turkish, Arabic, Portuguese, and Russian. <br/>\"As a member of the public on social media, it must be very easy to get the wrong idea about how certain we are about climate change,\" says Dr Doug McNeall, a scientist from the Met Office's Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research.<br/>\"Misinformation can really damage our discussion about what to do about climate change.\" <br/>TikTok is aware of the problem - which is why, to mark Earth month in April, it announced it would begin actively removing content that contradicts basic climate science. <br/>In a blog post published at the time, it listed as examples of rule-breaking content posts \"denying the existence of climate change or the factors that contribute to it\". <br/>But the reach of videos like those featuring Mr Pe\u00f1a raises questions about how successfully this new policy is being enforced. <br/>\"Rules become irrelevant, if they're not applied consistently, accurately and fairly,\" says Jennie King, head of climate research and policy at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a UK counter-extremism think tank.<br/>Ms King said this emboldens people to try \"to game the system even more, because they know they can ultimately act with impunity\". <br/>Paul Scully MP, the minister for technology and the digital economy, told the BBC that the government's proposed Online Safety Bill would guarantee that the responsibility of social media platforms to tackle disinformation was \"taken seriously\".<br/>After we shared the findings of our investigation with TikTok, 65 accounts that had been posting wrong information about climate change in breach of the platform's guidelines were permanently removed.  <br/>The company also removed most of the remaining videos that were still online - including several that featured Dan Pe\u00f1a's 2017 talk.  <br/>However, at the time of writing, several copies of the clip featuring Dan Pe\u00f1a describing climate change as the \"greatest fraud\" can still be found on the app. <br/>At the Met Office, Dr McNeall welcomes TikTok's efforts against misinformation, but he questions whether this is a battle the company can win. <br/>\"As a scientist I'm happy to be challenged,\" he says. <br/>\"Maybe we should focus on promoting good climate science information, rather than just removing the content that we perhaps don't like.\"  <br/>The 'ninjas' fighting climate denial on Twitter<br/>A band of volunteers is keeping climate denial off Wikipedia<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Experts say it will likely make 2024 the world's hottest year. <br/>They fear it will help push the world past a key 1.5C warming milestone.<br/>It will also affect world weather, potentially bringing drought to Australia, more rain to the southern US, and weakening India's monsoon.<br/>The event will likely last until next spring, after which its impacts will recede.<br/>For months, researchers have been increasingly confident that an El Ni\u00f1o event was set to emerge in the Pacific Ocean. <br/>\"It's ramping up now, there have been signs in our predictions for several months, but it's really looking like it will peak at the end of this year in terms of its intensity,\" said Adam Scaife, head of long-range predictions at the UK Met Office.<br/>\"A new record for global temperature next year is definitely plausible. It depends how big the El Ni\u00f1o turns out to be - a big El Ni\u00f1o at the end of this year, gives a high chance that we will have a new record, global temperature in 2024.\"<br/>This natural phenomenon is the most powerful fluctuation in the climate system anywhere on Earth.<br/>The El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation, or ENSO, as it is properly called, has three different phases: Hot, cold or neutral. <br/>The hot phase, called El Ni\u00f1o, occurs every two to seven years and sees warm waters come to the surface off the coast of South America and spread across the ocean pushing significant amounts of heat up into the atmosphere.<br/>Record warm years, including 2016, the world's hottest on record, usually happen the year after a powerful El Ni\u00f1o event.<br/>Weather agencies around the world use different criteria to decide when this hot phase is upon us. <br/>For scientists in the US, their definition requires the ocean to be 0.5C hotter than normal for a month, the atmosphere must be seen to be responding to this heat and there must be evidence the event is persisting.<br/>These conditions were met in the month of May. In a statement, US National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said that \"El Ni\u00f1o conditions are present\".<br/>\"This is a very weak signal. But we believe that we're starting to see these conditions and that they will continue to intensify,\" said Michelle L'Heureux, a scientist with NOAA.<br/>\"Our weekly value is actually 0.8C this past week, which is even stronger.\"<br/>The researchers believe this event has an 84% chance of exceeding moderate strength by the end of this year. <br/>They also say there's a one in four chance of this event exceeding 2C at its peak, which is getting into the territory of a \"super El Ni\u00f1o\".<br/>The impacts of the onset of El Ni\u00f1o will likely lag behind by a few months but will be felt all over the world. <br/>Researchers expect these will include drier weather conditions in Australia and parts of Asia, with potential weakening of the monsoon in India. Southern US states will likely be wetter in the coming winter. El Ni\u00f1o normally strengthens drought conditions in Africa.<br/>If experience is anything to go by, there will be a large human and economic cost to this oncoming weather event. <br/>The strong El Ni\u00f1o in 1997-98 cost over $5 trillion with around 23,000 deaths from storms and floods.<br/>There's also a strong likelihood that this year's version will push 2024 past 2016 as the world's hottest year.<br/>Global temperatures are currently hovering around 1.1C above the average in the period from 1850-1900.<br/>But an El Ni\u00f1o event could add up to 0.2C to that figure, pushing the world into uncharted temperature territory, and close to breaking the symbolic 1.5C guard rail, a key element of the Paris climate agreement.  <br/>Researchers recently said that breaking this limit temporarily was more likely than not in the next few years.<br/>\"We're actually likely to see global mean temperatures that might become more of a regular thing in five to ten year's time, so it does give us that sort of portal on the future.\" said Michelle L'Heureux.<br/>\"And I think that's why it's alarming to some people, because these are our new thresholds.

It takes years, if not decades, for that to come back again,\" explained trustee Howard Inns.  <br/>For countryside ranger Darren Hill, who supported firefighters tackling the blaze here, seeing the aftermath, and knowing more wildfires could be on their way, is hard to take.  <br/>\"To come back and see a site like this, and know I found this species over here and we had smooth snakes over there, it does take its toll,\" he said.<br/>Meanwhile, using a drone with thermal imaging to survey the site for hidden subterranean burns is Matt Oakley, a fire investigations officer for Surrey Fire and Rescue.<br/>He is one of the UK's national wildfire tactical advisors - a group of specialist officers who already have the skills learnt abroad and who will be training units.<br/>He says the kind of techniques he's seen used in hotspots as far-flung as France and South Africa will be vital in the UK in the years to come. <br/>\"Our climate is changing - it's changing beyond recognition,\" he explained. \"What used to be a nine to 12-year cycle, this is every year now. <br/>\"We are heading towards a northern Mediterranean climate in the southeast of England within the next decade and this will be business as usual day in, day out.\"<br/>Many of the wildfire-fighting methods being rolled out across the UK rely on a 'toolbox' of skills, from creating natural firebreaks and reducing the 'fuel-load' of vegetation to setting controlled burns deliberately around wildfires to stop their spread. <br/>Together they would reduce the need for huge amounts of water in a drought and reduce the number of appliances needed on site.<br/>But the Fire Brigades Union says new training and techniques are not enough to tackle the rising challenges of climate change. It says more crews are needed after years of cuts that have seen the loss of thousands of firefighters since 2010.<br/>Matt Wrack, the Fire Brigades Union's general secretary, called for more funding from the government, saying: \"Rising temperatures and the systematic underfunding of the fire and rescue service are a recipe for destruction.\"<br/>The government said it was giving fire and rescue authorities around \u00a32.6bn this year, and each authority was able to decide what it spent it on.<br/>A spokesperson said: \"The Home Office works closely with the National Fire Chiefs Council and England and Wales Wildfire Forum to continue to improve our response to wildfires and mitigate them.\"<br/>Warning of 'very high' wildfire risk for Scotland<br/>Caution urged over countryside fire risks<br/>Fire service warning over disposable barbecues<br/>Highland wildfire could be largest ever in UK<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

It's a hard volcanic rock that is neither rare nor particularly remarkable. <br/>But through a process known as 'enhanced rock weathering' it could help to cool our overheating planet.<br/>UN scientists are now clear that reducing greenhouse gas emissions alone won't be enough to stop dangerous levels of warming. They say there will need to be some carbon dioxide removal - actively taking it out of the atmosphere. <br/>Planting trees is the most natural way of doing this but has its limitations; the CO2 that's captured is released when the wood rots or burns and there are limits to how widely trees can be planted. <br/>Direct Air Capture (DAC), meanwhile, mechanically sucks CO2 out of the atmosphere and stores it underground; it's permanent - but does it make sense to build such an energy intensive process when we're trying to wean ourselves off fossil fuels? <br/>Enhanced rock weathering lies somewhere in between the natural and the man-made. It takes the naturally occurring but very gradual weathering process and turbo-charges it to remove the carbon faster. <br/>I've come to a quarry just across the Firth of Forth from Edinburgh to see Jim, whose enhanced rock weathering company UNDO has just secured \u00a312m of new investment and is looking to scale up operations. <br/>Around us the black hillside is being steadily eaten away, scraped by enormous diggers to make concrete and asphalt for roads. The vibe is more post-nuclear apocalypse than saving the planet.<br/>But the tiny pieces of basalt rock that are left over are prized by Jim's company. They have a useful property - when they weather in the rain they remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.<br/>For millennia volcanic rocks and cliffs have been removing carbon slowly while weathering in the rain. Enhanced rock weathering uses tiny pieces to increase the amount of contact between the rain and rock and hence the amount of weathering and carbon removal. <br/>As a cliff, or piled up in the quarry, the basalt weathers very slowly. To maximise the carbon removal it needs to be spread across a greater area.<br/>And that's where local farmers come in, helping the planet while getting free fertilizer in return. As well as locking away carbon, the basalt has been shown in trials to improve both crop yields and the quality of grazing. <br/>Half an hour's drive from the quarry I watch it being scattered on a field. <br/>It requires no specialist equipment. A trailer is loaded with 20 tonnes of basalt before a tractor drags it up and down, a rotating wheel at the back scattering the tiny rocks. <br/>\"It's free of charge which is quite important to a farmer,\" John Logan tells me with a chuckle as the basalt is put on his field. He'd seen UNDO's trials on a neighbouring farm. <br/>\"It looks like it's going to make the grass better, so that can only be good for the cattle because they're eating better grass.\"<br/>Some experts worry that carbon removal techniques like this might distract people from the more urgent priority of cutting emissions and even be used as justification to continue living our carbon intensive lives.<br/>\"CO2 reduction has to come first,\" Jim tells me as we watch the tractor move up and down guided by GPS, \"but we also need to be developing these technologies that can do removal at scale. And the nice thing about what we're doing with enhanced rock weathering is it's permanent.\"<br/>The maths, it must be said, are daunting. UNDO's scientists calculate that four tonnes of basalt rocks are needed to capture one tonne of CO2. <br/>With a typical Brit's CO2 emissions estimated at about 7 tonnes a year that means each of us needs about thirty tonnes, or one and half trailer loads of basalt to be scattered annually just to break even. <br/>UNDO has plans to rapidly scale up over the next few years and has attracted some serious supporters. Microsoft has agreed to pay for 25,000 tonnes of basalt to be scattered on UK fields. As part of the deal Microsoft will also help audit the project and verify that it is working as intended. <br/>\"The essential chemistry of it makes sense,\" Dr Steve Smith, an expert in carbon removal from Oxford University, told me.   <br/>\"Measuring how much CO2 would be taken out and where that ultimately goes, is one of the key challenges, and there's no standardized system at the moment.\"<br/>Ultimately Dr Smith thinks the idea could end up just a standard part of the way land is farmed. <br/>\"It's something that can be folded into the way we use land at the moment and deliver a carbon removal benefit alongside other benefits in terms of the way we use land for food and crops,\" he says.  <br/>There are still many questions about just how scaleable it is. UNDO's projects uses by-product from the local quarry - but if this is massively expanded the energy and emissions it takes both to grind up the basalt and then transport and scatter it will need to be factored in.  <br/>\"At this point in time, there's no downside, It's a win win for everybody involved.\" Jim Mann tells me. <br/>This year UNDO is planning to spread 185,000 tonnes of basalt and hopes by 2025 to have removed a million tonnes of CO2. It's still a drop in the ocean compared to emissions. In 2022 its thought the world discharged about 37 billion  tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere. <br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Now astronomers may soon be able to watch it happen.<br/>These distortions are happening all the time, all across the Universe.<br/>One of the groups that made the discovery is the European Pulsar Timing Array Consortium (EPTA), led by Prof Michael Kramer of the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy in Bonn. <br/>He told BBC News that the discovery had the potential to change astronomers' ideas about the cosmos forever.<br/>\"It could tell us if Einstein's theory of gravity is wrong; it may tell us about what dark matter and dark energy, the mysterious stuff that makes up the bulk of the Universe, really is; and it could give us a new window into new theories of physics.\"<br/>Further study might give new insights into the role supermassive black holes play in the evolution of all galaxies.<br/>Dr Rebecca Bowler, of Manchester University, told BBC News that researchers believe there to be gigantic black holes at the heart of all galaxies and that that they grow over billions of years. But so far that has all been theoretical.<br/>\"We know supermassive black holes are there, we just don't know how they got there. One possibility is that smaller black holes merge, but there has been little observational evidence for this. <br/>\"But with these new observations we could see such a merger for the first time. And that directly will tell us how the most massive black holes form,\" she said.<br/>The observations were made by studying signals from dead stars called pulsars. These rotate and send out bursts of radio signals at extremely precise intervals. <br/>But researchers, which include astronomers from the Lovell Telescope at Jodrell Bank in Cheshire and from Birmingham University, have found that these signals are reaching Earth ever so slightly faster or slower than they should be. And they say the time distortion is consistent with gravitational waves created by the merger of supermassive black holes across the Universe.<br/>Dr Stanislav Babak from Laboratory APC at CNRS, France, said  gravitational waves carried information about ''some of the best-kept secrets of the Universe\".<br/>The newly found gravitational waves are different to the ones detected to date. Those earlier waves are caused by much smaller, star-sized black holes crashing into each other. <br/>The type described in the latest research are thought to be from black holes that are hundreds of millions of times more massive, spiralling in on each other as they get ever closer.<br/>Their gravitational upheaval is so powerful that it distorts time and space - a process that can continue for billions of years until the supermassive black holes finally merge.<br/>The gravitational waves scientists have discovered previously can be thought of as brief rumbles, whereas the new ones are akin to  a background hum that is around us all the time. <br/>Their next step is to take more readings and combine observations. As further progress is made, another goal is to be able to uncover individual pairs of supermassive black holes - assuming they are the source.<br/>It's possible the gravitational waves could also be caused by other exciting phenomena, such as the very first black holes ever created, or exotic structures called cosmic strings, both of which can be thought of as seeds from which the Universe grew.<br/>Gravity is a constant force in our everyday lives. If you let go of a cup it falls and smashes on the ground each time you do so. But in space gravity does not stay the same. It can change if there is a sudden and catastrophic event - such as the collision of black holes.<br/>The event is so cataclysmic that space and time itself is distorted and ripples are sent across the Universe - as happens when a pebble is dropped in a pond. <br/>In the case of gravitational waves, everything in the Universe - the stars, planets and even us - are the water. Everything gets squeezed and stretched and then squashed and flattened ever so slightly as the ripples pass over us. And just like in a pond, the ripples quickly get smaller and disappear. <br/>Gravitational waves from the merger of star-sized black holes were directly detected for the first time in 2015. Very sensitive laser systems measured the ripples produced in the end moments before the collision.<br/>For the type of waves coming from the spiralling supermassive black holes, the pulsar approach is picking up the ripples produced in the billions of years before the final union. <br/>This is akin to a continuous stream of pebbles being thrown into the pond. And because the mergers are happening all across space, the signal comes across as a cacophony.<br/>The EPTA has combined results with a consortium in India (InPTA) and published their study results in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics. <br/>Three other separate, competing research groups, from North America (NANOGrav), Australia (PPTA) and China (CPTA), have published similar assessments, sparking huge excitement across the physics and astronomy community. <br/>Scientists must first confirm their observations. None of the research groups have data that passes the gold standard of less than one in a million chance of error, which is generally required for conclusive proof - although combined, the various teams' results are certainly compelling. <br/>Follow Pallab on Twitter<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

The dam acted as a flood defence to places downstream, mainly to the south and south-west.<br/>BBC Verify monitored the four canal entrances using satellite imagery, and by 15 June, all had become disconnected as the reservoir water level kept dropping.<br/>Further images reveal the reservoir, which previously held 18 cubic kilometres of water, had dried up significantly.<br/>Shallower parts of the reservoir were exposed first, revealing some of the original shape of the Dnipro River prior to the dam's construction in 1956.<br/>Images show the canals still contain water further away from the reservoir. It is unclear how long it will take for them to run dry.<br/>Before the war, about 5,840 sq km (2,255 sq miles) of cropland on both sides of the Dnipro river could potentially be serviced by the canals, with more than half the area reliant on irrigation systems. <br/>Your device may not support this visualisation<br/>These areas yielded about two million tonnes of grain and oil seeds in 2021, according to the Ukrainian government.<br/>Many areas downstream of the reservoir were initially flooded after the dam was destroyed, but the long-term issue facing food production will be the loss of water supply due to extensive canal systems drying up, according to Inbal Becker-Reshef, program director at NASA Harvest, a consortium researching global food security.<br/>\"[The canals] primarily irrigate summer planted crops\u2026 like corn, soy beans, some sunflower. But they also irrigate some wheat, which is a winter crop, and then a lot of vegetables and fruit like melons,\" she said. <br/>While some crops can be fed by rain alone, a dry canal system can leave farmland vulnerable to drought. This also has consequences for drinking water.<br/>Dr Becker-Reshef said canals can start to fill in with silt if left dry, reducing their effectiveness, and the longer they are left in this condition, the worse they will become.<br/>Martin Griffiths, Emergency Relief Coordinator for the UN, previously told the BBC there would be a \"huge impact on global food security\" as a result of the destruction of the dam, describing the area as \"a breadbasket not only for Ukraine but also for the world\".<br/>Ukraine is a major exporter of sunflower, maize, wheat and barley. The war has caused global supply issues, particularly threatened in Middle Eastern and African countries, which rely heavily on Ukrainian grain.<br/>Rebuilding the dam seems to be one of the only long-term solutions to restore water security to the area.<br/>\"Now the water level has dropped, the water simply does not reach the [canal] systems. To raise it, we need to rebuild the dam,\" according to Mykola Solskyi, Ukraine's Minister of Agrarian Policy and Food.<br/>Experts warn the area is at greater risk of both drought and flooding, because the dam helped regulate extreme highs and lows in water levels.<br/>\"There's now a whole downstream catchment of the river that is not controlled,\" said Jaap Flikweert, a flood and coastal management advisor at engineering consultancy Royal HaskoningDHV. \"In the wetter periods flood waves will just come through.\"<br/>Unless the dam is repaired, or extensive flood defences put in place, Mr Flikweert said some areas may prove unsuitable for settlement because they lie so close to river level.<br/>\"I expect those tens of thousands of people who were evacuated will have to stay away for a while as long as those solutions are not in place. It is difficult to see people coming back to those communities in this situation.\"<br/>Read more about BBC Verify: Explaining the 'how' - the launch of BBC Verify<br/>Dam destruction devastates vast Ukraine farmland<br/>Drinking water crisis after dam breach - Zelensky<br/>iWhat was the Ukraine grain deal?<br/>Harvest<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Could Ronson write one?<br/>\"The pressure was crazy because they were going to start dance rehearsals in two weeks and they wanted this big song that could potentially be a hit,\" he tells the BBC.<br/>What Drakoulias didn't know was that Ronson is a huge fan of Gerwig and her co-writer husband Noah Baumbach. After a quick glance at the script, he agreed to help.<br/>\"They could have probably said, 'We're making a movie about Matchbox cars,' and I'd have been like, 'Cool, if you're doing it, it's gonna be great',\" he laughs.<br/>With the deadline imminent, he got to work with Andrew Wyatt (with whom he won an Oscar for the A Star Is Born hit Shallow) and together, they turned in a big disco number, full of sweeping string lines and funky bass licks. <br/>Gerwig loved it. It was locked in for the film. <br/>And then Ronson faced an even bigger struggle: Taking the instrumental track to an artist and persuading them to sing on it, without being able to make any changes to the song's tempo, feel or structure.<br/>\"It just had the beat and the strings. There was no melody, no lyrics, nothing. All I'd written was the working title 'Tastes Like Barbie' because I thought that sounded kinda cool.\"<br/>His first instinct was to send it to Dua Lipa, whose Future Nostalgia album shared many of the same reference points. <br/>On 31 March, 2022, as Dua got ready for a concert in Seattle, Ronson sent her an Instagram DM, inviting her to \"co-write and star\" on the track.<br/>\"Because Dua has such a voracious intellectual curiosity for art, culture, film, everything I just knew she would she would dig it,\" he explains. <br/>\"She said, 'Yeah, cool,' and she ended up coming to New York and we wrote the song together.\"<br/>Gerwig was so impressed with the result that she asked Ronson to curate the entire soundtrack... and then to score the film as well. <br/>Her pitch was that Barbie's story was a parallel to the Bee Gees in the 1970s. Back then, the British trio were the most popular band in the world and Saturday Night Fever was the biggest-selling album of all time. <br/>Then, in 1979 the \"Disco sucks\" movement culminated in Disco Demolition Night, where a local DJ called on listeners to destroy disco records in a Chicago baseball stadium.<br/>The stunt was ugly, with undertones of racism and homophobia, and the Bee Gees were caught in the crossfire. <br/>\"They were interviewed a couple of weeks later and they were like, 'All we did ever did was just write great pop songs. Why do people hate us so much?'\" says Ronson.<br/>\"Greta saw a parallel with Barbie in some ways. The Barbie character, all she ever wanted to do was make people happy. But she also represents a lot of things that are problematic and really reviled.\"<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Feeling the 'Kenergy' at on Barbie movie pink carpet<br/>Unlike previous films he's worked on, Ronson says Gerwig had a \"very specific idea\" of how the music would complement the action.<br/>\"No offence to the Ghostbusters reboot film, but I remember being one of 11 songs on there that re-interpolated the Ray Parker Jr. theme because there was no directive,\" says Ronson. <br/>\"But with this it's hard to tell which came first - the film or the song.\"<br/>Audiences can judge for themselves when the film opens on Friday. Until then, Ronson talks us through the soundtrack's highlights.<br/>Lizzo's track opens the film, establishing the idyllic, pink-hued world that Barbie inhabits. But the chilled-out vibe is completely at odds with the song's frantic creation.<br/>\"We had two days, and we got nothing on the first one,\" says Ronson. \"I was like, 'Maybe it's not gonna happen'. <br/>\"Then she started freestyling and narrating, in a very tongue-in-cheek way, whatever was happening on the screen, no matter how ridiculous, like, 'Two Barbies, all dolled up and playing chess by the pool'.<br/>\"We just started laughing but then we realised: This is musically good, and this is fun, so we ran with it.<br/>\"I showed it to Greta and she flipped out. At that point, the song ended halfway through the credits because there's a Helen Mirren voiceover that comes in. But Greta was like, 'Tell Lizzo she can keep singing! She can sing at Helen! They can have a dialogue!'\"<br/>That idea never made it to celluloid, but it did pave the way for Lizzo to have another musical number later in the film.<br/>\"There were two things that were keeping me up at night: What are we doing with Aqua? And how do we possibly have the soundtrack without Nicki Minaj on it?\" says Ronson.<br/>These were thorny issues. <br/>Barbie's creator, Mattel, sued Aqua in the 1990s, saying their smash hit Barbie Girl had brought the doll into disrepute. <br/>A judge later dismissed the case (writing in his opinion that: \"The parties are advised to chill\") but Aqua initially said they would not participate in the movie.<br/>Minaj, whose fans are called Barbies or Barbz, was also deemed essential for the soundtrack - but she rejected \"a couple of songs that I didn't love,\" she confessed at the LA premiere. <br/>The turning point came when Ronson invited Ice Spice to flip a sample of Barbie Girl. <br/>\"She's the most exciting new thing in rap,\" says Ronson. \"She's keeping New York alive.\"<br/>Along with her producer, RIOTUSA, she took Aqua singer Lene Nystr\u00f8m's iconic \"life in plastic\" hook and stapled it into a dark, New Jersey House beat. <br/>\"I loved it,\" said Minaj, agreeing to the collaboration.<br/>The only problem was fitting the recording around Ronson's schedule.<br/>\"Ice Spice was supposed to come to my studio at 9pm and, you know, I'm an old guy with a brand new baby,\" he says.<br/>\"I waited till 11pm sharp, then I got into bed - but when I looked at my phone, it said, 'We're on the way'.<br/>\"I literally was in my pyjamas, but I put my clothes back on, rode my bike back to the studio and showed Ice and Riot the film. And the song started from there.\"<br/>Minaj wasn't the only one who wanted to cover Aqua's classic.<br/>\"Barbie Girl is such an important song to Charli XCX,\" says Ronson. \"She's told the story of singing it in a talent show when she was four. And she did a draft of it, but then she wrote the Speed Drive song, and it just elevated the film. <br/>\"We loved it so much that we said, 'Can we keep this?'\"<br/>The British star's contribution is a electrifying jolt of hyperpop that somehow combines elements of Tony Basil's cheerleader anthem Hey Mickey with Robyn's version of Cobrastyle, an underground rap track originally performed by Swedish band Teddybears.<br/>But her version of Barbie Girl has subsequently leaked - with producer AG Cook playing it at one of his recent DJ sets.<br/>Sung from the point-of-view of Barbie's much-maligned boyfriend Ken, this Sam Smith track is a delicious deconstruction of hot, simple himbos. <br/>\"No I'm not gay, bro / But I've been on that lay-low,\" drawls Smith in an uncharacteristically gravelly voice.<br/>\"This comes at a point where you really feel you need to feel the freedom of the Kens,\" says Ronson. <br/>\"Greta showed Sam the scene and they started talking about the feminist mystique and all these very deep texts that I know nothing about. So I just shut my mouth and listened.<br/>\"Soon after, Sam sent me a voice note of this incredible melody, literally just singing a capella, and it leapt off the phone. <br/>\"It's so much fun to see artists take some licence, and do things they might not do on their own records because they're writing in character. Sam's playing the Kens in the verse, then they go into this yearning Sylvester voice in the chorus and it just explodes.\"<br/>...In which Ryan Gosling bares his soul (and his chest) with a show-stopping Broadway number about playing second fiddle.<br/>\"I'm just Ken / Anywhere else, I'd be a 10,\" he sings, before the song explodes into a Hair-style rocker, with guitars by Slash and Wolfgang Van Halen.<br/>Originally intended for an (unnamed) pop star, Gosling lobbied to sing it himself. <br/>He came straight from the set to Ronson's studio, with the producer transposing the track to a lower key, to make it easier to sing.<br/>\"But each time he sang it, I was like, 'He sounds killer, l think we can bump it up,' until we were back in the original key,\" he recalls.<br/>\"I was over the moon because, at first, I was like, 'Okay, maybe the song won't be as good as the demo' but in the end he exceeded the demo. <br/>\"And then when I first saw the film, with him actually acting out the song, I was like, 'Of course!' Because he knew that, at some point, he'd be acting out these lyrics, so he was already doing it in the studio.\"<br/>Eilish's song cuts to the heart of Barbie's predicament: What happens when the world turns against you?<br/>The singer, who's fought her own battles against public perception, said inspiration hit her \"like a tornado\" after watching a rough cut of the film.<br/>Within 24 hours, she sent Ronson a text saying, \"'I wrote something today', with a smiley face, as if it was nothing\", he recalls.<br/>\"The next morning, we got this MP3 and it just floored us. <br/>\"I was like, 'How have they summed up the film so well?' Because by that point. we had Ken's journey but we didn't have Barbie's... <br/>\"Greta likes to call it like the glittery pink heart at the centre of the film. And that's what this song is.\"<br/>'You\u2019ve got to move at the speed of inspiration'<br/>Can Barbie be the new Iron Man?<br/>Feeling the 'Kenergy' on Barbie movie pink carpet.

A film that you don't merely watch, but must reckon with.\"<br/>In a four-star review in the Guardian, Bradshaw said the film \"captures the most agonising of success stories\".<br/>\"This is the big bang, and no one could have made it bigger or more overwhelming than Nolan,\" he wrote. <br/>\"He does this without simply turning it into an action stunt - although this movie, for all its audacity and ambition, never quite solves the problem of its own obtuseness: filling the drama at such length with the torment of genius-functionary Oppenheimer at the expense of showing the Japanese experience and the people of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\"<br/>He described Murphy as \"an eerily close lookalike for Oppenheimer... very good at capturing his sense of solitude and emotional imprisonment\".<br/>Writing in the Times, critic Ed Potton, who also awarded the film four stars, hailed Murphy's performance as \"explosive in a breathtaking movie\".<br/>The Evening Standard's Charlotte Sullivan agreed that the \"dark, immersive epic gives Cillian Murphy the role of his career\".<br/>Speaking ahead of the film's release, the Irish star told journalists the role had taken \"a toll\" on him \"but in a brilliant way\". <br/>\"It was the biggest, most exhilarating challenge,\" he said.<br/>Co-star Matt Damon revealed he had told his wife he would take a break from acting, unless \"Chris Nolan called\". <br/>Nolan is best known for his Dark Knight trilogy, as well as films including Inception, Dunkirk and Tenet.

He said the company was committed to reaching an \"equitable\" agreement that helped the industry move into the future. <br/>But he added: \"We've got a lot of work to do.\"<br/>Netflix has been wrestling with a sharp slowdown in growth since the pandemic, as competition heats up, households grapple with rising costs and it reaches what analysts see as saturation point in some of its biggest markets.<br/>In the first half of last year, it shed roughly 1 million accounts. Though it later more than made up those losses, the declines jolted the company and sent it scrambling to shore up its growth prospects. <br/>Netflix said customers were enticed by new options it has introduced that cost less than a standard subscription.<br/>The company introduced its \"paid sharing\" programme in the UK, US and other major markets in May, charging an extra fee if users want to share passwords with people outside their households.<br/>In the UK, it asks a little less than half of the \u00a310.99 cost of a standard subscription.<br/>The programme is now present in more than 100 countries. <br/>The company also launched a less expensive streaming plan with ads last year and cut prices in dozens of countries in February. <br/>Netflix said few people had cancelled as a result of the password changes and it believed the programme would fuel similar subscriber gains in the months ahead. <br/>It has estimated that more than 100 million households share passwords in breach of its official rules.<br/>\"While we're still in the early stages, we're seeing healthy conversion of borrower households,\" the company said in a quarterly update to investors. \"Now that we've launched paid sharing broadly we have increased confidence in our financial outlook.\"<br/>Paolo Pescatore, analyst at PP Foresight, said the subscriber gains were robust and a \"strong endorsement\" of Netflix's strategy.<br/>But he called the password crackdown a short-term measure, saying the company would need to fine-tune its pricing in the months ahead.<br/>\"The company is still in a far stronger position compared to rivals and remains the benchmark,\" he said, noting that Netflix's streaming plan with advertising is much cheaper than many current offerings from rivals.<br/>Analysts said the company's big library and the scale of its international production may help it in the months ahead, as Hollywood wrestles with the impact of the strikes. <br/>These have already disrupted production schedules for a number of films and series. <br/>\"Of everyone in the entertainment industry, Netflix appears to be the best positioned,\" said Brandon Katz, entertainment industry strategist at Parrot Analytics, which tracks streaming demand, noting that the company still leads its peers, despite strong competition.<br/>Despite the subscriber gains, the $8.18bn (\u00a36.32bn) in revenue Netflix reported disappointed investors, rising just 2.7% from last year. Profits were $1.49bn.  <br/>Netflix said that it has limited its price hikes in recent months, leading to a slowdown in revenue growth that gains from its password crackdown and new advertising were not big enough to offset.  <br/>It said it expected that to change by the end of this year, as advertising revenue increases. <br/>It has stopped offering its least expensive commercial-free plan in the US, UK and Canada in a bid to push price-conscious customers to the ad-funded version. <br/>Membership of its ads plan \"nearly doubled\" from March - though from a \"small base\", the company said.<br/>\"Netflix needs to squeeze as much juice as it can from different avenues, given a recent lack of price increases could suggest that inflation is starting to bite Netflix's ability to crank up its subscription price, as households look to trim their spending,\" said Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.<br/>\"Initial progress seems positive, but we are realms away from knowing for sure if this venture is the cash cow it's been sold as.\"<br/>Shares, which have surged 60% this year amid investor enthusiasm for the company's plans, dipped in after-hours trade. <br/>Ms Lund-Yates said the company had delivered a \"sturdy\" performance and the fall reflected the high expectations for the company.<br/>What happens next as Hollywood grinds to a halt<br/>Hollywood strike could last until end of the year<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Several songs tackle grief and loss.<br/>\"Looked in the mirror / So many people standing there,\" he sings on The Narcissist; while the downbeat opener, The Ballad, finds him sighing: \"I just looked into my life / And all I saw was that you're not coming back.\"<br/>The songs are largely left open to interpretation, but Albarn has hinted that there's a personal angle to the record. <br/>Talking to Germany's Augsburger Allgemeine newspaper, he said the lyrics of Barbaric (\"I want to talk to you about what this break-up has done to me / I have lost the feeling that I thought I'd never lose\") are based on a \"very lonely Christmas\" he recently experienced.<br/>\"The songs are already quite accurate inventories of my life. I'm pretty open here on this album,\" he added.<br/>But when the subject matter gets heavy, there's always a buzzing riff from Coxon, or a leonine bass part from Alex James to lift the mood; and the record is awash with harmonies that highlight the importance of friendship in tough times.<br/>\"That's what makes it Blur, when Graham sings the harmonies,\" said Albarn. \"[It's] the combination of our two voices.\"<br/>The album (which is dedicated to Blur's former bodyguard Darren \"Smoggy\" Evans) is released on Friday, and early reviews have praised the way it embraces the uncertainty of middle age.<br/>\"Albarn was never a stranger to melancholy, but grief permeates many of his lyrics here,\" said Ryan Leas on Stereogum, describing the atmosphere as \"Britpop, weathered by time\".<br/>The lyrics are \"whimsical and weary in equal measure, hinting at friendships and romances that seem to have crumbled, but doing so from a place of isolation,\" wrote the Wall Street Journal's Mark Richardson. \"But Mr Albarn delivers such heavy sentiments with an eye for the poetic and a good dose of wit.\"<br/>The band may be \"older and wiser\", said Nick Reilly in Rolling Stone, but they \"still manage to retain every ounce of the charm and musicality that made them such a brilliant prospect in the first place\".<br/>Allow YouTube content?<br/>This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

It's like, 'Oh, my God, it's a beautiful boy!'\"<br/>Albarn's tour demos formed the basis of the record but, as he told Lamacq, \"nothing was going to proceed unless Graham was into it\".<br/>The guitarist and the singer had a notoriously stormy relationship in Blur's heyday, which culminated in Coxon walking out during sessions for the band's 2003 album Think Tank.<br/>This time, however, he was fully on board. \"I remember listening through the demos and getting a pad out and trying to jot down the chords and thinking, 'There's a lot of chords here,'\" he said. <br/>\"But good chords. Chords you can really get into. There's such a lot of opportunity for emotional things when the chords are that much more deeper.\"<br/>He added that Albarn's musicality was the factor that set the band apart from their Britpop contemporaries. <br/>\"When songs are written on a piano, that's a completely different thing. You're not just playing G and C.<br/>\"I'm not going to [compare] us to another band beginning with 'B' and ending in 'eatles', but they had a lot of stuff on piano, too. They weren't just a rock and roll band.\"<br/>Blur's Wembley gigs took place in front of 180,000 fans a fortnight ago, and the group were suitably overwhelmed by the occasion.<br/>Drummer Dave Rowntree even posted an Instagram video from behind his kit, labelling it: \"My little art-pop band headlining Wembley!\" <br/>\"The weird thing about Wembley was, from the first moment we went on, on Saturday, to the moment we left on Sunday, the place had shrunk. It was like it had become really intimate,\" Albarn told 6 Music.<br/>\"It's the first time I've actually been excited about seeing what the film looks like,\" he added, \"because I just have no idea what it looked like from outside.\"<br/>For fans who couldn't attend the show, Blur also recorded an intimate gig in the BBC's Radio Theatre on Tuesday, mixing new tracks like St Charles Square and The Narcissist with classics including End Of A Century, Girls & Boys and Parklife (with a guest appearance from Phil Daniels).<br/>The concert was broadcast live on BBC Radio 2, and will be shown at 21:25 BST on BBC Two on Saturday as part of a themed \"Blur night\", which will also include a repeat of their 2009 Glastonbury headline set at 22:25 BST.<br/>What prompted the end of Britpop?<br/>Gorillaz always had 'a touch of the apocalypse'<br/>Damon Albarn on life, elephants and gospel<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

(There are gags here that gleefully poke a number of masculine online beehives.)\"<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Feeling the 'Kenergy' at on Barbie movie pink carpet<br/>However, the Daily Mail's Sarah Vine was less keen on the representation of men. She wrote: \"It's a deeply anti-man movie, an extension of all that TikTok feminism that paints any form of masculinity - other than the most anodyne - as toxic and predatory...<br/>\"Every male character is either an idiot, a bigot or a sad, rather pathetic loser. If the roles were reversed, and a male director made a film about how all women were hysterical, neurotic, gold-digging witches, it would be denounced - quite rightly - as deeply offensive and sexist.\"<br/>She concluded: \"It's uneven, disjointed, the plot makes no real sense - and the dead hand of corporate America weighs heavily upon it.\"<br/>The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw also gave a lukewarm review, awarding the film three stars.<br/>He suggested Barbie is \"a good-natured but self-conscious movie\" that is \"occasionally very funny, but sometimes also somehow demure and inhibited, as if the urge to be funny can only be mean and satirical\".<br/>He added: \"This movie is perhaps a giant two-hour commercial for a product, although no more so than The Lego Movie, yet Barbie doesn't go for the comedy jugular anywhere near as gleefully as that.\"<br/>Other critics were far more positive. Rolling Stone's David Fear said Barbie \"may be the most subversive blockbuster of the 21st Century\", while NME's Alex Flood noted the script \"contains unexpected subtlety\".<br/>Barbie received its UK premiere last Wednesday - one of the last major showbiz events to be held before the Hollywood actors' strike was announced by industry union SAG.<br/>Empire's Beth Webb praised Robbie and Gosling's performances as Barbie and Ken in her four-star review.<br/>\"Robbie - who has been dialling it up to 11 since Harley Quinn - is hilarious, but the most consistent scene-stealer is Mr. Blond Fragility,\" she said.<br/>\"Gosling submerges wholeheartedly into Ken's insecure psyche as he moves from Barbie's sidepiece to patriarchal poster boy. Every muscle flex, every hair flick, every guitar strum lands perfectly. There are moments where he will rob you of breath.\"<br/>There was also praise for the film's director from Devan Coggan of Entertainment Weekly, who said: \"Never doubt Gerwig. <br/>\"The Oscar-nominated filmmaker has crafted a fierce, funny, and deeply feminist adventure that dares you to laugh and cry, even if you're made of plastic.\"<br/>Lovia Gyarkye of the Hollywood Reporter struck a more dissenting note, writing: \"However smartly done Gerwig's Barbie is, an ominousness haunts the entire exercise. <br/>\"The director has successfully etched her signature into and drawn deeper themes out of a rigid framework, but the sacrifices to the story are clear. The muddied politics and flat emotional landing of Barbie are signs that the picture ultimately serves a brand.\"<br/>Other reviews had different criticisms, with Deadline's Valerie Complex describing Barbie as \"an imperfect film\". <br/>\"It stumbles somewhat in its handling of its characters of colour. They mostly are used as devices to push the Stereotypical Barbie and Ken narratives forward,\" she said.<br/>\"There is a tight 95-minute movie here, but it's crammed with pointless dance scenes and musical numbers that are just filler and nothing else.\"<br/>Johnny Oleksinski of the New York Post went further, describing Barbie as an \"overwrought disappointment\".<br/>\"The packaging of Barbie is a lot more fun than the tedious toy inside the box,\" he said. \"To almost quote the Aqua song: Life in plastic - not fantastic.\"<br/>The tone of the film was criticised by Time's Stephanie Zacharek, who said: \"It's a movie that's enormously pleased with itself. Barbie never lets us forget how clever it's being, every exhausting minute.\"<br/>Variety's Peter DeBruge concluded: \"It's kind of perfect that Barbie is opening opposite Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer, since Gerwig's girl-power blockbuster offers a neon-pink form of inception all its own, planting positive examples of female potential for future generations. <br/>\"Meanwhile, by showing a sense of humour about the brand's past stumbles, it gives us permission to challenge what Barbie represents - not at all what you'd expect from a feature-length toy commercial.\"<br/>Can Barbie be the new Iron Man?<br/>Feeling the 'Kenergy' on Barbie movie pink carpet.

It won't be created by me.

There have been tests done by asking these sort of blanket questions without gender being in the text prompt and, more often than not, it's reflecting these stereotypes.\"<br/>This extends to racial bias and also ableism, said Irene Fubara-Manuel, a lecturer at the University of Sussex.<br/>While they said they were excited about the possibilities provided by generative art, issues such as racial and gender biases in some images created were hard to overcome.<br/>\"I was trying to dye my hair over the summer, and I was just looking up 'people of colour, blonde locks',\" they said.<br/>\"What I got in response was this regal, I would say, fetishised image of black people. You know, chiselled jaw lines, their skin was iridescent.<br/>\"It's like, there are black people who are that beautiful, but the images that you see commonly in a lot of AI are very, very fetishised representations of people. <br/>\"You would not see people who are plus size, or people who have visible disabilities, for instance.\"<br/>Artists are now calling on regulators in the UK and worldwide to take more action to protect artists and the industry.<br/>Irene said artists were not against AI but, \"the argument is against exploitation\".<br/>\"But I'm hopeful that it will contribute to human creativity in general, just like how the creation of computers added more to creativity. I'm excited for its contribution,\" they said.<br/>Caroline said more regulation of the emerging AI industry in the UK would not \"stifle\" innovation.<br/>\"It makes things safer and that's why we have certain laws,\" she said.<br/>\"That's why right now we have seatbelts and airbags for cars and a lot of rules about them.

The shocking case is now being re-told in the BBC TV drama The Sixth Commandment. How was the killer caught?<br/>Ben Field appeared to be a charming and religious young man who gave sermons in his father's Baptist church.<br/>But under the surface lurked a sinister plot to dupe the vulnerable by manipulating them into fake relationships and then getting them to change their wills.<br/>Field is currently serving a life sentence for the murder of Peter Farquhar in Maids Moreton. He was found not guilty of plotting to kill Mr Farquhar's neighbour Ann Moore-Martin but admitted defrauding her.<br/>Both Peter Farquhar and Ann Moore-Martin were religious, single and without children.<br/>Peter Farquhar retired as Stowe School's head of English in 2004 and was invited to be a guest lecturer at the University of Buckingham, where he met student Field.<br/>During the court case, the jury heard how Mr Farquhar had a wide circle of friends but he was lonely and, as a gay man, he struggled with his sexuality, regarding it as incompatible with his Anglican faith. <br/>In Field, he thought he had found someone to love and grow old with and the pair had undergone a \"betrothal\" ceremony in 2014.<br/>Retired head teacher, Ann Moore-Martin, lived a few doors away from him.<br/>A regular churchgoer, she was Catholic and also had friends aplenty but was very private. She was close to her niece, so much so, they regarded each other as mother and daughter.<br/>Miss Moore-Martin's sister-in-law said she seemed hypnotised by Field, like \"a love-struck teenager\". <br/>Field seduced both Mr Farquhar and Miss Moore-Martin.<br/>They were besotted with him and he used their devotion to get them to change their wills.<br/>At Field's trial in 2019, it was revealed that he had carried out a sustained \"gaslighting\" plot aimed at making Mr Farquhar question his sanity.<br/>He moved things around the house making his victim irritated and confused and also drugged his drinks and food.<br/>Mr Farquhar was tormented by this \"mystery illness\" and saw a number of doctors, but Field told health workers the retired lecturer was \"a frequent faller\" who probably had dementia.<br/>Mr Farquhar changed his will, naming Field as the main beneficiary and giving him a life interest in his house.<br/>Mr Farquhar died in 2015. He was discovered in his living room by his cleaner, a half empty bottle of whisky beside him.<br/>His friends thought he had drunk himself to death - as did the coroner, who certified the cause of death as acute alcohol intoxication. <br/>Field, who had been introduced to Miss Moore-Martin by Mr Farquhar, then took advantage of her loneliness and they developed a sexual relationship.<br/>He gave her a number of items so she would feel closer to him, including a framed picture of him with the words \"I am always with you\" written in capitals beneath his image.<br/>She gave him \u00a34,400 when he lied to her about needing a new car and handed over \u00a327,000 for a dialysis machine when he told her his younger brother was seriously ill with a kidney condition.<br/>Field also wrote messages on her mirror, some of which told her to leave her house to him, in the hope she would believe they were messages from God. <br/>It worked.<br/>In February 2017, Miss Moore-Martin became ill and suffered a seizure. She died in May 2017 of natural causes.<br/>During a hospital stay following the seizure, Miss Moore-Martin confided in her niece about her relationship with Field and the writing on the mirrors. The police became involved and an investigation started.<br/>She reversed her will and changed it back to benefit her family before she died in a care home.<br/>The police established the link between Field, Miss Moore-Martin and Mr Farquhar and 19 months after the latter's death a decision was taken to exhume his body.<br/>A second post-mortem examination established he had consumed less alcohol than had been thought and there were sedatives in his system.<br/>Field was arrested and admitted duping both Mr Farquhar and Miss Moore-Martin into fake relationships as part of a plot to get them to change their wills. But Field denied any involvement in their deaths.<br/>It has been reported that as Field sat in the back of a police van after his arrest, he said: \"I think I will get away with most of it.\"<br/>Oxford Crown Court jurors heard how Mr Farquhar's drinks were spiked with bioethanol and poteen, a high strength Irish alcohol, while his food was laced with drugs.<br/>He recorded in his journal how he was suffering night terrors and hallucinations.<br/>Field admitted drugging Mr Farquhar for no other reason than to \"torment\" him.<br/>Prosecutors said that after Mr Farquhar changed his will three times in two years to benefit Field, he \"had to die\".<br/>The court heard Field \"suffocated him\" when he was too weak to resist and left the half-empty bottle of whisky in Mr Farquhar's room to make it seem he had drunk himself to death.<br/>Jurors also heard that during Miss Moore-Martin's stay in hospital, Field tried to visit her but he was denied access and complained to the police. He admitted he had made the calls to see how much the police knew about him and whether he was in trouble.<br/>Field was convicted of Mr Farquhar's murder on August 2019 after a 10-week trial.<br/>He had previously pleaded guilty to four counts of fraud relating to the fake relationships and defrauding Miss Moore-Martin. He also admitted two counts of burglary.<br/>Field was given a life sentence with a minimum term of 36 years.<br/>Sentencing him, Mr Justice Sweeney said Field was a \"well-practised and able liar\" and a \"dangerous offender\".<br/>Mark Glover, who led the Thames Valley Police investigation into his crimes, summed him up: \"Ben Field is all about Ben Field and nobody else.\" <br/>He said Field was \"unlike any other criminal\" he had encountered.<br/>\"The extent of his planning, deception and cruelty towards his victims is frankly staggering, and I do not believe he has ever shown an ounce of remorse or contrition,\" he said.<br/>\"If he is sorry for anything it is that he got caught.\"<br/>In June 2020, a proceeds of crime hearing ordered Field to pay more than \u00a3146,000 to his victims' families - \u00a3123,111.26 to Mr Farquhar's family and \u00a323,449.76 to the family of Miss Moore-Martin.<br/>He then attempted to have his murder conviction overturned in January 2021.<br/>His barrister, David Jeremy QC, told the Court of Appeal the conviction was \"unsafe\" as the trial judge misdirected the jury.<br/>The appeal was dismissed with a written ruling saying that \"the approach of the judge was correct\".<br/>\"The judge's directions captured the essence of the issue in a clear and admirably succinct manner,\" the ruling said.<br/>In January 2022, Field began a second bid to have his conviction overturned. He challenged the appeal court's earlier decision, with his lawyers arguing that the judgment was flawed.<br/>The appeal was again refused. <br/>The four-part drama written by Sarah Phelps features Timothy Spall as Peter Farquhar and Anne Reid as Ann Moore-Martin.<br/>Ms Phelps told the BBC she had to leave out some of the most \"distressing details\" for the sake of the victims' relatives.<br/>She added that she \"didn't want Ben Field to be the main character\" and instead focused on telling \"Peter and Ann's story\". <br/>\"I wanted to make it clear that their lives really mattered before Ben Field came along,\" she said, and that it was \"important that we understand how these really intelligent people were deceived\".<br/>The four-part drama started on BBC One at 21:00 BST on 17 July and is available to watch on BBC iPlayer.<br/>Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

The incumbent, John Masefield, had died after 37 years in the post.<br/>It was the middle of the so-called \"swinging '60s\" and the idea of a poet laureate seemed archaic to many.<br/>But poetry was increasingly popular, thanks to the work of a new generation of writers, like Allen Ginsberg in the US, and the Liverpool poets in Britain.<br/>Harold Wilson, the prime minister, was in no rush to make a decision. John Hewitt, who was appointments secretary at Number 10, was told to investigate potential candidates.<br/>Other stories from the National Archives:<br/>He approached leading figures in the arts, as well as dons at Oxford and Cambridge. Dame Helen Gardner, Merton Professor of English at Oxford, had some \"fairly caustic\" comments about the \"present quality of poetry\" and the \"lack of any outstanding talent\", the papers reveal. <br/>Auden was excluded because he was an American citizen. John Betjeman was one of the most popular poets. But Dame Helen described him as \"a lightweight, amusing but rather trivial\". He had \"critical views about the establishment\", she said, which were deemed to be not appropriate.<br/>Robert Graves was \"probably the best poet available\", she added, but his \"manner of life must surely rule him out\". Graves had criticised the role and spent most of his time in Majorca.<br/>The popular poet Stevie Smith she dismissed as \"absurd\". She \"wrote 'little girl poetry' about herself mostly.\" Cecil Day-Lewis was \"a possible\" - he produced \"run of the mill poetry but nothing particularly outstanding\".<br/>That view was echoed by the chair of the Poetry Society, Geoffrey Handley-Taylor. He told Hewitt that Graves was \"too peculiar\" and \"too anti-establishment\". Betjeman, he said, \"called himself a poetic hack and there was some truth to this\".<br/>He described Smith as \"unstable\". By contrast Day-Lewis was \"a good administrative poet\" and \"a safe bet\".<br/>As the months passed, more names were put forward. Some nominated themselves. Allen Ginsberg proposed the singer Donovan, just 21, whose work \"Sunshine Superman\" and \"Mellow Yellow\" had topped the charts. In August, Ginsberg sent a hand drawn \"flower card\" to Number 10 with the words \"Donovan for Laureate\".  Officials did not respond.<br/>On September 14, 1967, Hewitt wrote to the prime minister proposing Day-Lewis. The alternative, Betjeman, would be a \"backward-looking choice\", he said. He had been described as \"the songster of tennis lawns and cathedral cloisters\". <br/>Harold Wilson agreed, but he wanted Hewitt to explore the possibility of appointing additional poets laureate for Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales. That was not pursued, and in January 1968, the announcement was made. <br/>But four years later, the search began again, after Day-Lewis died. <br/>Auden was again under consideration, according to newspaper reports, and apparently the bookies' favourite.<br/>Number 10 was warned by Ross McWhirter - of the Guinness Book of Records - that Auden was said to be the author of a \"pornographic\" poem entitled \"The Gobble\", published in an underground magazine. <br/>McWhirter worried that if Auden were selected this could \"bring disgrace upon the appointment\" and this would reflect on the Queen herself. The now-Sir John Hewitt told him Auden wasn't on the shortlist.<br/>This time Philip Larkin was under serious consideration - described by Hewitt as \"a first-rate craftsman\". But the critic Jon Stallworthy warned Larkin disliked public speaking. Officials were advised he was a \"reserved\" man who would not be an ambassador for poetry.<br/>The so-called \"poets' conference\", representing younger writers, suggested Adrian Mitchell and George MacBeth - but they didn't make it into the final selection.<br/>Then Prime Minister Ted Heath, picked Betjeman - who accepted, writing that he was \"honoured and delighted and at the same time humbled\".<br/>In 1984, a new laureate was needed, following Betjeman's death. There is no discussion of merit in the file. <br/>Mrs Thatcher's officials put together a list of names and recommendations. Larkin was the most popular choice, but one unnamed figure objected. <br/>Ted Hughes was picked, even though only two people proposed him - and no explanation was given.<br/>The trial of selecting a new laureate following the death of the previous one is now a thing of the past. Whereas it used to be a lifetime post, since 1999 the appointment has been for a fixed term of 10 years. Current incumbent Simon Armitage's tenure runs until 2029.<br/>Reacting to the newly declassified files, Mark Ford, Professor of English at University College London, said: \"The laureateship is such a peculiar role that finding a suitable candidate is not easy - 1967 was clearly a particularly trying year.\" <br/>Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>Blair was warned of 'appalling' UK attack after 9/11<br/>Blair was urged to back Ukraine's EU dream - records<br/>Poet laureate marks 100 years of the BBC<br/>Simon Armitage to be next Poet Laureate<br/>Zephaniah rules out being poet laureate<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

In fact, she signed up for it.<br/>\"It's a bit like that Black Mirror episode with Salma Hayek,\" Ms Yeo jokes.<br/>She was speaking to the BBC the day after the release of the new series of Charlie Brooker's Netflix show. In the first episode, actress Salma Hayek, playing a fictionalised version of herself, signs away her image to a production company.<br/>The deal allows it to use an artificial intelligence or AI-generated deepfake version of the Hollywood A-lister to \"star\" in their new TV drama. What she says and does in the show is controlled by the computer.<br/>The consequences for Ms Hayek - without spoiling the story - are not good.<br/>Concerns about the impact of AI are partly behind the first Hollywood actors' strike in more than four decades, bringing the US movie and television business to a halt.<br/>It comes after Screen Actors Guild (SAG-AFTRA) failed to reach an agreement in the US for better protections against the misuse of AI for its members.<br/>The actors' union has warned that \"artificial intelligence poses an existential threat to creative professions\" as it prepared to dig in over the issue.<br/>However, Ms Yeo is not worried. She is one of a growing number of celebrities embracing AI-generated advertising.<br/>The new technology is being met with a mixture of excitement and trepidation.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Singapore celeb Jamie Yeo has embraced AI deepfakes<br/>Ms Yeo has just agreed a deal with financial technology firm Hugosave, which allows it to use a digitally manipulated likeness of her to sell their content.<br/>The process is fairly simple. She spends a couple of hours in front of a green screen to capture her face and movements, then a couple more hours in a recording studio to capture her voice.<br/>An AI programme then synchronises the images with the audio to create a digital alter-ego capable of saying practically anything. The results are uncanny.<br/>\"I do understand the concern, but this technology is here to stay,\" she says. \"So even if you don't embrace it because you're scared, there will be other people who will embrace it.\"<br/>Some already have. As part of his deal with PepsiCo, superstar footballer Lionel Messi allowed it to use a deepfake version of himself to advertise Lay's crisps.<br/>Not only can online users create personalised video messages from \"Lionel Messi\", they can get him to say it in English, Spanish, Portuguese and Turkish.<br/>Fellow football superstar David Beckham and Hollywood legend Bruce Willis have also dabbled with deepfake technology - though, unlike Ms Yeo, they have so far stopped short of signing away full image rights.<br/>\"I think deepfakes will just become part of normal practice in the advertising industry over the next few years,\" says Dr Kirk Plangger, a marketing expert at King's College London.<br/>\"It opens the door to all kinds of creative options. They're able to micro-target consumers and are often extremely persuasive.\"<br/>The efficiency of the process also makes it attractive from a commercial point of view.<br/>\"You're not doing that much work for the money you're charging,\" Ms Yeo says.<br/>\"It's also good for the client on a budget because they get so much more content than from a normal shoot. So it works for everyone.\" <br/>The client - in this case Singapore-based Hugosave - agrees. <br/>\"Having this technology available means we can literally produce hundreds of videos in a matter of days. Compare that to the months, if not years, that we'd need if we were filming the content in the traditional way,\" says Braham Djidjelli, Hugosave's co-founder and chief product officer.<br/>\"We're able to leverage the benefit of AI while also retaining the human touch of a trusted local face - in this case Jamie's.\"<br/>But, as analysts such as Dr Plangger point out, there is a \"dark side\" to the technology. <br/>\"It's not something we can put back into the box,\" he says. \"The advertising industry needs to wake up to the risks as well as the possibilities of artificial intelligence. It means stepping back, as a society, and thinking about what is the proper or ethical use of this technology.\"<br/>One of the things Dr Plangger is referring to is a looming \"crisis of trust\", where consumers cannot tell between what is real or fake. This is something already being exploited by vested interests online and can range from synthetically manipulated pornography to misinformation to political messaging.<br/>This week BBC News is focussing on AI, how the technology affects our lives and what impacts it may have in the near future.<br/>But there are also more practical risks for the talent voluntarily signing up to be deepfaked. Currently, there are no clear laws relating to AI to ensure your image is properly protected.<br/>For example, what happens if a brand uses your digital avatar to endorse a product that may damage your image or your alter-ego makes a joke in poor taste?<br/>\"We are in uncharted territory when it comes to AI and deepfake technology,\" says Tng Sheng Rong, an intellectual property lawyer at Rajah and Tann in Singapore. <br/>\"Many, many issues can arise. Who owns the intellectual property? Who do you go to for legal recourse? The truth of the matter is that the existing laws don't provide a robust enough regulatory framework to guard against these issues.\"<br/>That may be the final hurdle for advertisers before they start buying rights to digital versions of Hollywood A-listers, for example.<br/>At this early stage, Ms Yeo says she is very mindful of the risks, but her decision was informed mainly by trust - both in Hugosave and in the way business is done in Singapore.<br/>But ultimately, she says, it is about staying ahead of the curve.<br/>\"If you want to still be in the game, then you've got to learn how to be in it. Because if you don't, you should probably just retire.\"<br/>The Black Mirror plot about AI that worries actors<br/>Students switch to AI to learn languages<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>AI 'godfather' says it won't destroy jobs forever<br/>What is AI and is it dangerous?<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

At least not in Nooriyah's opinion.<br/>She's a 28-year-old DJ who lives in London.

It's this final stage where AI is coming in.<br/>\"To me, the conversation about AI in producing is very overdue,\" she says.<br/>\"There are already at least 10 different software programmes that mix music and could put producers out of jobs\".<br/>She wants to see a better dialogue between those in the music industry and AI developers.<br/>\"I think the danger here is there's work being done without a discussion about what it would mean for the music industry.\"<br/>One solution, she says, is to tax the AI companies.<br/>\"Firstly, let's slow down the release of these AI programmes, and tax the developers, investing that money in putting on training for people who lose their jobs to AI.\" <br/>Phil Kear agrees. He works with the Music Union and is worried AI will put limits put on the amount people are willing to pay for recordings made by human creators. <br/>\"AI music will be cheaper,\" he says. \"And I think that people will be tempted to use it, maybe bars.\"<br/>Although he says, its full influence will only go as far as humans will let it.<br/>\"A lot will be determined by the general public's willingness to accept AI or the quality of the music it can produce.\"<br/>He doesn't think the majority of commercial music will be impacted, but highlights \"background\" music as an area at risk.<br/>\"With music on TV and films, I think the public will be much more willing to accept AI-generated music because there's no personality associated with it,\" he says.<br/>\"Whereas I think in bars and clubs, there's a certain amount of investment.\"<br/>Like many industries, the world of music has already been influenced by advances in technology. <br/>For Nooriyah, this development is the same.<br/>\"Music has evolved rapidly over time.

He soon became intrigued by \"these little rats sprayed everywhere.... and more and more of Banksy's street pieces just started to reveal themselves\".<br/>But as with many Banksy fans, it wasn't just the artwork itself - and its social commentary - that fascinated Peak. He was also drawn in by the artist's mystique, and the huge effort involved in producing graffiti undercover at speed to avoid both being identified and arrested by the police.<br/>\"There's a great line in his latest show which I think is something like: 'Monet had light, Hockney had colour and I've got police response time,'\" Peak says.<br/>Over the years, various news outlets have reported that they know who Banksy is, and in 2017, DJ Goldie referred to Banksy as a man called Rob in an interview.<br/>While rumours abound, his real identity has never been revealed. But have we gone beyond needing to know who he actually is?<br/>Peak says Banksy's anonymity \"lets him keep doing the campaigning stuff he does unfettered\" which, along with loyalty, probably stops the few in the know from letting the cat out of the bag.<br/>\"Being free to act in the way that he does, that's super valuable.\"<br/>In fact, very few people who know Banksy have spoken publicly about him at all.<br/>For the podcast, Peak spent a year getting to know gallerist Steph Warren, who worked with Banksy at his print house Pictures on Walls in Shoreditch in the early Noughties when she was in her early 20s.<br/>Once Peak had gained her trust, Warren opened up to him about her experiences, having declined to sign a non-disclosure agreement when she worked at the print house. She has never talked publicly before.<br/>So what was it like working with Banksy and his crew during those heady early days in a working-class area which would soon go on to become hipsterville?<br/>\"It was exciting,\" Warren tells me.<br/>\"The office was very DIY, you know, very punk. When I started there I was the packing girl and I was licking the stamps to go on the tubes to send the prints out, then carting them down to Old Street post office. It was very exciting because it felt like I could be involved with helping it grow.\"<br/>She then went on to organise the pop-up exhibition and store, Santa's Ghetto, which then became an annual event.<br/>Banksy was furtive to a degree even within the company and, in the podcast, Warren gives the impression that he's something of an observer, an outsider looking in.<br/>\"He was quite reserved,\" she says. \"You could tell that he had a lot going on in his head. <br/>\"And I hate to use the word genius because I wouldn't want to call him a genius! But he's a very clever man. [He had] a lot of philosophies and concepts that I just didn't understand at the time, but through his work, I have been able to learn.\"<br/>Warren says she was asked by Banksy in the office one day to pose for what would become his now famous mural Sweeping It Under the Carpet, which depicted a maid at work. She definitely has a look of Warren. There have also been claims attributed to Banksy that he based it on a hotel maid in Los Angeles.<br/>The stencil, which was said to be a comment on the Western world ignoring global issues, appeared on a wall in north London in 2006.<br/>But behind the scenes, things were beginning to fall apart for Warren as she became addicted to heroin, something she says was part of the art scene for some at the time and that she was introduced to while working there.<br/>\"There are lots of jobs where, to a certain extent, a certain level of alcoholism or substance misuse is accepted,\" Warren says.<br/>In the podcast, she claims Banksy was \"horrified\" when he found out and took her for a walk to talk about it but she denied she was taking the drug when he asked.<br/>Warren says heroin also enabled her to block out the grief she was going through after the death of her BMX biker boyfriend in an accident back in her home town of Hastings, not long before she moved to London.<br/>In the podcast, she explains that she then fell out with Banksy after not being available for the last Banksy concept store, Santa's Ghetto, in London in 2006.<br/>It got out of hand on its first day with hundreds of people fighting to get in, in the hope of buying one of the artist's limited prints. Warren had arranged the morning off, but said Banksy was uncharacteristically \"fuming\" with her because she wasn't there to manage the queue. <br/>In hindsight, she says: \"I should have been there, I wasn't exactly a model employee, I was on heroin.\" <br/>Soon after, Warren and Pictures on Walls parted company. <br/>While she does takes responsibility for her choices, she feels that Pictures on Walls could have offered to put her through a drug rehabilitation programme.<br/>But the drama still wasn't over. <br/>Warren was accused in the press the following year of fraudulently producing Banksy prints and selling them on, something she has always vehemently denied. When she wanted to defend herself publicly, she claims Banksy's PR, Jo Brooks, cautioned her against the move and that they tried to get her to sign  an NDA. Warren says she refused.<br/>Members of the local art fraternity defended her and Pictures on Walls then did their own swift investigation.<br/>They found that there was no evidence of any fraud and Warren was exonerated but as Peak says: \"By that point, of course, the damage had definitely been done.\"<br/>After leaving Pictures on Walls, Warren set up her own gallery, Stella Dore, in the Truman Brewery on Brick Lane. It folded a couple of years later, which Warren says was largely due to the global financial crisis and her addiction. However, she says being a woman in a male-dominated industry, alongside the false accusations, didn't help.<br/>\"As a woman, you're always disadvantaged anyway.

I've been able to build myself back up here.\"<br/>Given her time working with Banksy ended on a somewhat sour note, how does she feel about him now, looking back?<br/>\"I think what he's achieved is phenomenal and I'm just cross with myself because I wish I'd had a better head on my shoulders back then, you know, to really work for him properly. I think that he's a real force for good overall. Even if my personal experience isn't quite that.\"<br/>The Banksy Story will be available on BBC Sounds as a boxset from Monday 17 July.

This government is failing us and failing patients.\"<br/>Its deputy chair, Dr Simon Walsh who is an emergency medicine consultant, told BBC News that going on strike was a difficult decision to reach, knowing that it would affect patients. <br/>\"There's a full emergency service so patients who have emergencies will receive care as they normally would...Of course it's a really difficult step to take industrial action and therefore impact on people who were planning to have elective operations and appointments today.<br/>\"We really see this as a step we need to take to protect the NHS, to stop the erosion of the workforce.\"<br/>Sally Knight, 68 and from Lightwater, is waiting for a hip operation which has been pushed back until September.<br/>She told the BBC she has been treated really well by the NHS in her area, but that delays and disruptions to services were a frustration: \"We locked ourselves away. We did everything we should have done in Covid to protect the NHS and now when I want them, they are letting me down really.<br/>\"Currently, I feel I was going forwards and now I've been knocked back.\"<br/>But Health Secretary Steve Barclay urged the profession to end the dispute.<br/>He said the government had listened to their concerns, by increasing the amount that can be paid directly into pension pots tax-free, as well as accepting the recommendations of the independent pay review body and giving consultants a 6% pay rise this year.<br/>He stressed it was the government's \"final offer\", adding: \"It is now time to put patients first.\"<br/>On the strike days, people should use 999 in life-threatening emergencies, and NHS 111 online for other health concerns. <br/>GP services and pharmacies can also be accessed in the normal way. <br/>Those not told their appointments have been postponed should attend as normal.<br/>The 6% pay increase means basic pay starts at \u00a393,666 - with the most experienced consultants receiving more than \u00a3126,000 a year - but to reach that salary takes, on average, 19 years in the role.<br/>However, the average NHS consultant earns approximately 30% more than their stated salary - about half of this is for working additional hours, with the rest made up of other allowances - including a bonus system known as clinical excellence awards.<br/>They can also be paid additionally for private work - but not all do it. <br/>Yes, but depending on what measure is used the scale of the cut in pay varies.<br/>The BMA uses the RPI measure of inflation, which shows, since 2008, pay has fallen by 27%.<br/>Once changes to tax and pensions over this period are factored in, the shortfall in take-home pay is 35%, the BMA says. <br/>But work by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, using other measures of inflation, shows the fall since 2010 is around 17%. <br/>This drop in pay is greater than most other NHS workers, such as nurses, ambulance staff and estates staff, with lower-paid staff prioritised for the biggest pay rises.<br/>The BMA said it means consultants have seen their pay eroded when compared to professions such as law, accountancy, financial services and engineering.<br/>Unlike the junior doctors' at the start of their dispute, consultants are not asking for full pay restoration in one uplift. <br/>Instead, they want the government to start giving pay rises that at least match inflation.<br/>Consultants plan more industrial action, on 24 and 25 August, unless a pay deal is agreed.<br/>Are you a senior doctor?

What have we learnt over the past six weeks?", "author": "By Jim Reed", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 00:55:47", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:08:32.411289", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/17535/production/_130414559_walledit.jpg", "body": "The first phase of the Covid Inquiry has heard from its final witness.<br/>In total, 69 politicians, civil servants, scientists and other experts have been asked about the UK's planning for a pandemic and the state of the healthcare system when Covid struck.<br/>Baroness Hallett and her team will now write up their findings, with an interim report expected in 2024. <br/>Here are six questions which they might try to answer, based on the past six weeks of evidence and testimony.<br/>The inquiry heard that much of the planning for a pandemic was based on a 2011 document drawn up in case there was an outbreak of a new, more deadly form of influenza. <br/>Former Prime Minister David Cameron said that \"group think\" meant the government did not properly consider the risk of other viruses, with different rates of transmission and other characteristics. <br/>\"This is so important - so many consequences followed from that,\" he said.<br/>Typically, health authorities do not try to contain seasonal flu - instead relying on antiviral drugs and the flu jab, which could be adjusted to tackle a new pandemic form of the virus.<br/>Other witnesses, including Dame Jenny Harries, the chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), appeared to contradict Mr Cameron, describing the government's flu plan as \"actually pretty good\". <br/>Matt Hancock, former health secretary, meanwhile, said the bigger, more damaging mistake was the widespread assumption that Covid could not be stopped or contained when it started to spread. <br/>He said authorities were too narrowly focused on planning for the fallout, such as \"can we buy enough body bags?\".<br/>\"That was completely wrong,\" he added.<br/>Other countries managed more effectively to suppress the initial wave of Covid than the UK, reducing the number of deaths and - in some cases - avoiding strict lockdowns. <br/>Witnesses, including former health secretary and current Chancellor Jeremy Hunt, told the inquiry that the UK did not learn lessons from Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea, which had seen earlier outbreaks of two other coronaviruses - Sars and Mers. <br/>In those countries, faster contact-tracing and quarantine policies were subsequently deployed to promptly isolate cases and clamp down when Covid first emerged.<br/>In the UK, the civil service had previously run a mock-up training day - codenamed Exercise Alice - in 2016, in preparation for a major outbreak of the Mers virus.<br/>But the inquiry heard many of its recommendations, including advice to scale up testing capacity and examine different options for isolation, were not followed through. <br/>This video can not be played<br/>Prof Dame Sally Davies tells the Covid inquiry \"it wasn't just the deaths, it was the way they died\".<br/>Another major theme was the strength - or resilience - of the healthcare system when Covid emerged in 2020. <br/>England's former chief medical officer, Dame Sally Davies, was heavily critical of the state of the NHS at the time of the outbreak, saying it had been \"divested\" - with fewer doctors, nurses, beds and ventilators than similar countries.<br/>Academics Sir Michael Marmot and Clare Bambra produced a report stating that poorer regions and ethnic minority groups were disproportionally affected by a decade of austerity policies, with the UK entering the pandemic with \"depleted\" public services and rising inequality.<br/>Giving his evidence, George Osborne, who was chancellor from 2010 to 2016, said he \"completely rejected\" that description. <br/>\"If we had not had a clear plan to put the public finances on a sustainable path, then Britain might have experienced a financial crisis [and] would not have had the fiscal space to deal with coronavirus when it hit,\" he argued.<br/>From 2018, government departments were being asked to step up planning for a so-called 'no-deal Brexit', under the codename Operation Yellowhammer. <br/>According to documents seen by the inquiry, a number of internal 'workstreams' in the Department of Health related to pandemic planning were therefore paused, or slowed, as staff were moved and other tasks prioritised.<br/>That paused work included plans to better prepare the adult social care sector for a severe influenza pandemic.<br/>The Pandemic Flu Readiness Board, a cross-government body made up of civil servants from across Whitehall, did not meet for a whole year up to November 2019 because their work was \"reprioritised\" to plan for leaving the EU without a trade deal. <br/>Scotland's former first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, told the inquiry that the Scottish government was \"not at all happy\" about having to divert \"time, energy and resources\" in this way. <br/>But Conservative cabinet ministers Michael Gove and Oliver Dowden, both said that no-deal planning had increased staffing, compelled departments to work more closely together and secured supply chains for medical supplies. <br/>Additionally, Matt Hancock claimed that work on a no-deal exit was instrumental in preventing the UK running out of some intensive care drugs at the peak of the first wave of Covid.<br/>The inquiry also heard moving evidence from the families of some of those who lost their lives to Covid.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Bereaved families express their sense of loss in a film shown to the inquiry<br/>Anna-Louise Marsh-Rees's father, Ian, contracted the virus while being treated in hospital in Abergavenny for a gall bladder infection.<br/>Jane Morrison spoke about the loss of her wife, Jacky, who died in hospital in Dundee after being admitted for another unrelated condition - jaundice.<br/>Groups representing bereaved family members said poor infection control was a \"glaring flaw\" in hospital planning. <br/>They also described the handling of funerals - and how they were conducted during the pandemic - as traumatic, with relatives often unable to say a proper goodbye to loved ones. <br/>Witnesses described national lockdowns as the most \"extraordinary\" policy of the pandemic. <br/>The political decisions which led to nationwide lockdowns will be explored in detail during the inquiry's second phase in October. <br/>Already though, we know a strict lockdown - with widespread school and business closures - was never planned for in advance.<br/>Matt Hancock said there was \"no prep for how to do one, no work on how best to lock down with the least damage\". <br/>England's chief medical officer, Sir Chris Whitty, suggested it would have been near impossible for scientific advisers to plan in advance for something so radical without being asked to by a senior politician.<br/>The inquiry team will try to answer why - given it is the government's job to consider these things - the longer term impacts of lockdown were not properly thought through before 2020.<br/>You can follow Jim on twitter and threads.<br/>Covid Inquiry: Were We Prepared<br/>Watch on iPlayer: Jim Reed looks at the key moments from the first part of the Covid inquiry.<br/>Available now on BBC iPlayer (UK only)<br/>Covid inquiry: The UK pandemic in numbers<br/>What is the UK Covid inquiry and how long will it take?<br/>UK Covid-19 Inquiry<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing -

They have called into question the journal's editorial independence.<br/>The 2011 paper is a systematic review conducted by US psychologist, Prof Priscilla Coleman. It concludes that women who've had an abortion have an 81% increased risk of developing mental health problems.<br/>Prof Coleman worked for 20 years as a Professor of Human Development and Family Studies, at Bowling Green State University, in Ohio. Her research appeared in a brief submitted to the US Supreme Court as part of successful efforts to overturn the historic Roe v Wade judgment, which guaranteed a constitutional right to an abortion in the US. <br/>In April, the paper was also cited by a judge in Texas, when concluding one of the two main drugs used for medical abortion in the US, Mifepristone, should have its approval suspended. The case is ongoing.  <br/>When Prof Coleman's paper was first published in 2011, 10 letters were sent to the British Journal of Psychiatry criticising the quality of the research. Two called for its retraction.<br/>\"We don't believe that the results are reliable or credible\", said one signatory, Prof Julia Littell, an expert at Bryn Mawr College. She argued it did not meet best practice standards of the time. <br/>\"I've never called for the retraction of a paper before,\" she has since told the BBC. \"This is a very serious lapse of scientific integrity.\" <br/>A review published three months later in December 2011, co-authored by the Royal College of Psychiatrists, also found that methodological problems brought into question the paper's results and conclusions. <br/>In 2022, with the research influencing women's healthcare in the US, some of the same scientists wrote again to request the work be retracted. <br/>The British Journal of Psychiatry then formed an independent panel, which spent four months assessing the complaints. The panel questioned the methodology used in the research - one concern was the data had been combined in a way that saw women counted multiple times.<br/>Ultimately the panel recommended the paper should be retracted. However, that never happened.<br/>\"Our recommendation basically disappears into the ether,\" panel member and Harvard psychiatrist, Dr Alex Tsai, told the BBC. <br/>\"At some point we receive a letter from the communications director at the Royal College of Psychiatrists saying that the case is closed and the retraction is not going to be implemented.\"<br/>Fellow panel member Dr Aileen O'Brien said intervention by the Royal College was \"concerning\". \"Usually you would have expected that to be an editorial decision,\" she said.<br/>Some panel members have expressed concern that legal threats may have influenced the College's actions. <br/>When the British Journal of Psychiatry told Prof Coleman they wanted to put a notice on her article to raise awareness about a possible problem, her lawyers responded that any such notice would cause \"serious harm and direct damage to her reputation\". <br/>The letter, seen as part of an investigation by Newsnight and the BMJ, said Prof Coleman would take \"any and all legal options available\".<br/>A second legal letter, sent a month later, repeated the threat, if the journal was to retract the paper. Ultimately no notice of concern was placed on the work. <br/>Prof Coleman has started legal action against another journal, Frontiers in Psychology, after it retracted one of her earlier papers. So far those actions have been rejected by a Swiss court. <br/>Dr Tsai said the row risked undermining confidence in the journal's ability to \"police the content that it publishes\", adding: \"[A] journal that does not uphold editorial independence is probably not long for this world.\" <br/>Newsnight approached Prof Coleman for comment. In reply, she supplied details of her career qualifications, as well as material that she said supported her research.<br/>Prof Coleman said she had published 63 peer-reviewed journal articles, with the majority related to the psychology of abortion. Based on this, she often serves as an expert in civil cases involving abortion.  <br/>She said her career had spanned three decades with publications in highly reputable academic journals and that criticism of her work was driven by the political nature of the topic.<br/>A spokesperson for the Royal College of Psychiatrists did not address questions about whether the threat of legal action had influenced its decision. <br/>They said: \"After careful consideration, given the distance in time since the original article was published, the widely available public debate on the paper - including the letters of complaint already available alongside the article online, and the fact that the article has already been subject to a full investigation - it has been decided to reject the request for the article to be retracted.\"<br/>Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Four ways the end of Roe v Wade has changed America<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

It recorded more than 260 consecutive days below 100F (38C). <br/>But the soaring temperatures returned with a vengeance, with little warning or time for people to acclimatise. \"It snuck up on us,\" Mr Schilling said. \"So we've seen people that are feeling dizzy, their hearts are racing, people are passing out people are being really overwhelmed.\"<br/>Meteorologist Trevor Boucher told BBC News one reason the Las Vegas heat feels so relentless is because there is little respite. Instead of heat escaping during the night, Mr Boucher said the ground continues to reflect the heat it absorbed during the day.<br/>\"Temperatures can struggle to fall below 90F (32C) in some cases. And if you don't have access to cooling, then you're stuck in 90 degree temperatures for 24 hours,\" he said. <br/>And those high temperatures affect the vulnerable the most severely. <br/>Patty and Alan Baker are two of several thousand living in Las Vegas without a home.

If her mother had been given an in-person appointment by BPAS, she would still be alive,\" she added.<br/>Stella Creasy MP tweeted decriminalisation was needed in abortion cases and called existing legislation \"archaic\".<br/>\"The relief that this woman can go home to be with her children is tempered by the knowledge there are more cases to come where women in England [are] being prosecuted and investigated,\" the Labour MP said.<br/>Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

She added that many members of her group are \"haunted\" by the idea of going to hospitals and no longer feel they are a safe place.<br/>\"People used to say they're in the right place when they go to hospital. I'm not sure if they would say that any more.\"<br/>She said that after his death he was \"zipped away\", and his belongings put in a Tesco carrier bag.

He and his family spoke exclusively with the BBC. <br/>Mike gets an infusion each month at a clinic in London and says he is \"one of the luckiest people you'll ever meet\".<br/>Mike and his family noticed he was having problems with memory and decision-making, not long before he started on the trial.  <br/>His son, Mark, said it was very hard to watch at the beginning: \"Seeing him struggle with processing information and solving problems was very hard. But I think the decline is reaching a plateau now.\"<br/>Mike, who is from Kent, said: \"I feel more confident every day.\"<br/>Donanemab, made by Eli Lilly, works in the same way as lecanemab - developed by companies Eisai and Biogen - which created headlines around the world when it was proven to slow the disease.<br/>Although extremely promising, these drugs are not risk-free treatments. <br/>Brain swelling was a common side-effect in up to a third of patients in the donanemab trial. For most, this resolved without causing symptoms. However, two volunteers, and possibly a third, died as a result of dangerous swelling in the brain.<br/>Another antibody Alzheimer's drug, called aducanumab, was recently rejected by European regulators over safety concerns and a lack of evidence that it was effective enough for patients. <br/>In the donanemab trial, researchers examined 1,736 people aged 60 to 85 with early-stage Alzheimer's.<br/>Half of them received a monthly infusion of the treatment and the other half were given a dummy drug, also known as a placebo, over 18 months.<br/>The findings show:<br/>Amyloid is just one part of the complex picture of Alzheimer's, and it is unclear if the treatment will continue to make more difference over a longer period, experts caution. <br/>The drug's effects may be modest, but the results provide further confirmation that removing amyloid from the brain may change the course of Alzheimer's, and help people affected by this devastating disease if they're treated at the right time, they say. <br/>Prof Giles Hardingham from the UK Dementia Research Institute said: \"It is terrific to see these results published in full today. <br/>\"We have waited a long time for Alzheimer's treatments, so it's really encouraging to see tangible progress continuing to gather pace in the field.\" <br/>Dr Susan Kohlhaas, from Alzheimer's Research UK, said: \"Today's announcement marks another milestone. <br/>\"Thanks to decades of research, the outlook for dementia and its impact on people and society is finally changing, and we're entering a new era where Alzheimer's disease could become treatable.\"<br/>Speaking to BBC Radio 4's PM programme, former Prime Minister David Cameron said resources should be put towards further research into what he called a \"statin for the brain\". <br/>\"We want a pill that people who have the build-up of these proteins in the brain can take every day or every week in order to clear those proteins out of the brain and therefore reduce your chances of getting a disease that causes dementia,\" he said.<br/>Asked if the government were prepared to invest where needed to roll out new treatments, Mr Cameron said there was a real incentive to do so: \"We're a country of sixty million people, with a million people with dementia, many of them in very expensive residential care settings and so there is a lot of savings to be had from effectively treating people\u2026.I'm hopeful that our system can deliver.\"<br/>Lecanemab costs around $27,500 (\u00a321,000) in the US, where it is licensed. <br/>It is not clear how much donanemab may cost and how long it might take to get approval in the UK, but Alzheimer's experts said having two drugs would help promote competition on price. <br/>The UK's drug's watchdog NICE says it has already started work on its appraisal of donanemab for treating mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia caused by Alzheimer's disease.<br/>\"Our aim is to produce recommendations on its use in the NHS as close as possible to it receiving its UK licence,\" said a spokesperson.<br/>Mike Colley turned 80 in April.

This decision largely centres on three studies suggesting a connection to a type of liver cancer. <br/>However, the \"possibly\" refers only to the strength of scientific evidence. If the evidence was strong, then aspartame would be in a higher category.<br/>Dr Mary Schubauer-Berigan, of the International Agency for Research on Cancer, said the \"evidence was not of sufficiently high quality or convincing enough\" and \"this is really more a call to the research community\" to study the sweetener more. <br/>The cancer classifications frequently lead to misleading headlines. Alcohol and plutonium are in the same category (both are proven to cause cancer), but one is seriously more dangerous than the other. <br/>So a separate body - the World Health Organization and the Food and Agriculture Organization Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives - has the job of working out safe doses.<br/>It analysed the cancer risk as well as other issues such as heart disease and type 2 diabetes, but found \"no sufficient reason\" to alter the advice it has had since 1981.<br/>So the safe limits remain at 40 milligrams per kilogram of your body weight, per day. <br/>These aren't targets, they're the upper safety limits. But as the advice is based on body weight, it is easier for children to get close to the limit.<br/>Dr Branca said it was \"not a good practice\" to have a bottle of sweet fizzy drink on the table at family dinner time, as children risked being set up with a sweet tooth for life. <br/>He also stressed that large reviews of the evidence show sweeteners do not help people lose weight.<br/>So his advice is for everyone to shift to a less sweet diet - cutting both sugar and sweeteners - and for companies to produce foods that are less sweet, but still tasty.<br/>One of the big outstanding research questions is how might aspartame result in cancer (if indeed it does). The WHO reports show that aspartame itself is rapidly broken down in the gut into three other substances - phenylalanine, aspartic acid and methanol.<br/>But these are also the product of digesting a wide variety of other foods that are not linked with cancer. And the researchers concluded that aspartame is not directly making cancerous mutations in people's DNA. Raising levels of inflammation in the body is one possibility. <br/>Frances Hunt-Wood, secretary general of the International Sweeteners Association, said the work had \"once again reaffirmed aspartame's safety\".<br/>She added: \"Aspartame, like all low/no calorie sweeteners, when used as part of a balanced diet, provides consumers with choice to reduce sugar intake, a critical public health objective.\"<br/>There are some people who cannot safely consume aspartame. These are people with an inherited disease called phenylketonuria or PKU, who are born unable to metabolise the phenylalanine that is released as aspartame is broken down. <br/>Follow Jameson Twitter.<br/>Aspartame - is it a possible cause of cancer?<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Ambulance workers, nurses, physiotherapists and porters will also get a one-off sum of at least \u00a31,655. <br/>The prime minister ruled out funding the increases through extra borrowing or increasing taxes. <br/>Mr Sunak said pay awards in the education department would be fully funded, but did not set out how this would be achieved.<br/>Schools minister Nick Gibb promised there would be no cuts in \"front-line services\" in schools or colleges.  <br/>Rising prices have prompted industrial action across much of the public sector, with workers calling for pay rises matching or exceeding the rate of inflation which currently stands at 8.7%. <br/>But with the education unions welcoming the government's offer, parents and pupils could see an end to strikes which have impacted schools across England over the past year. <br/>On Thursday, junior doctors in England began a five day walkout, after their calls for a 35% pay increase were rejected.<br/>The government has been resistant to offering above-inflation pay rises warning it would further fuel inflation. <br/>Responding to Mr Sunak's announcement, Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said: \"By accepting the pay review body recommendations and then not funding them the government is putting its departments between a rock and hard place - they now have to choose between paying workers a half-decent salary or cutting services in already underfunded public services.\"<br/>TUC general secretary Paul Nowak said union members would take \"comfort\" from the fact that the prime minister had accepted the pay review bodies' recommendations. <br/>\"The question will be - is he able to deliver pay rises in a way that won't have a negative impact on services. Our members will have a long look at that - they won't want to see Peter robbed to pay Paul.<br/>Mr Sunak said his offer was \"final\" and further industrial action would not change that decision, stressing: \"There will be no more talks on pay. We will not negotiate again on this year's settlements and no amount of strikes will change our decision.\"<br/>Speaking at the Unite union's policy conference in Brighton, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the pay offers would be \"subject to negotiation\" and he would \"not wade into that\".<br/>He said there was no \"magic wand that could wave away the need for economic stability\", but added: \"If Labour can not break the suffocating hold of low wages we will have failed.\"<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Visa application fees and the immigration health surcharge are going up \"significantly\" to raise money, Rishi Sunak says.<br/>Almost half of public sector workers are covered by pay review bodies, including police and prison officers, the armed forces, doctors, dentists and teachers.<br/>The pay review bodies are made up of economists and experts in human resources, with experience in both the public and private sector, and are appointed by the relevant government department.<br/>Their recommendations are not legally binding, meaning the government can choose to reject or partially ignore the advice, but it is usually accepted.<br/>What do you think about the Prime Minister's announcement on public sector pay?

Wegovy is not yet available in the UK - but the prime minister has said GPs in England may soon start offering it to some patients, as well as specialist weight-management clinics.<br/>Ozempic is for people with diabetes to help control blood sugar as well as weight but contains a lower dose of the same medicine, semaglutide, as Wegovy. And with some people without diabetes buying the pre-filled pens to lose weight, there have been continuing global shortages.<br/>All medicines have potential side effects. For weight-loss drugs, which should be used alongside a healthy diet and exercise, more common ones include:<br/>Depression or thoughts of suicide is listed in the product-information leaflet, which advises users: \"You should pay attention to any mental changes, especially sudden changes in your mood, behaviours, thoughts, or feelings. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have any mental changes that are new, worse, or worry you.\"<br/>Prescribers are also advised to monitor for this. <br/>Manufacturer Novo Nordisk is working with the EMA and says patient safety is a top priority. A representative said: \"GLP-1 receptor agonists have been used to treat type-2 diabetes for more than 15 years and for treatment of obesity for eight years, including Novo Nordisk products such as semaglutide and liraglutide that have been in the UK market since 2018 and 2009 respectively. <br/>\"The safety data collected from large clinical-trial programmes and post-marketing surveillance have not demonstrated a causal association between semaglutide or liraglutide and suicidal and self-harming thoughts. <br/>\"Novo Nordisk is continuously performing surveillance of the data from ongoing clinical trials and real-world use of its products and collaborates closely with the authorities to ensure patient safety and adequate information to healthcare professionals. <br/>\"EMA continuously monitors for safety signals and so does Novo Nordisk. <br/>\"Novo Nordisk remains committed to ensuring patient safety.\"<br/>The UK's drug regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), said it was monitoring the situation.<br/>Dr Alison Cave, MHRA Chief Safety Officer, said: \"As part of our close monitoring, any emerging evidence is routinely considered alongside other sources of information, including suspected adverse drug reactions. We will communicate any new advice to healthcare professionals and patients if appropriate.<br/>\"If you are experiencing suicidal thoughts or thoughts of self-harm, please seek immediate medical assistance.<br/>\"We ask everyone to report any suspected side effects using our Yellow Card scheme website.\"<br/>If you have been affected by any of these issues, visit BBC Action Line, where you can find support.<br/>GPs set to offer weight-loss jab to reduce obesity<br/>Celebrity weight loss jab to be sold by chemists<br/>Are weight-loss injections the answer to obesity?<br/>European Medicines Agency<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

whose daughter Harriet was stillborn at the trust in 2016 - said the commitment to transparency was \"massive\".<br/>\"It's a bit of a shock to the system to be honest,\" Ms Hawkins said.<br/>\"For seven and a half years we have just been fighting to be heard.<br/>\"So for them to say they are going to take an open and honest approach is incredible really.<br/>\"Whether that happens is yet to be seen but it is certainly a step in the right direction.\"<br/>In a statement, the group representing parents said: \"We welcome today's pledge from the trust for a 'new honest and transparent relationship' with a sense of relief and optimism. <br/>\"For too long we have been fighting to be not just heard, but for action to be taken, and for there to be accountability. <br/>\"We deserve to learn who knew what and when, why it was allowed to continue; and how the trust avoided scrutiny for so long.\"<br/>Ms Ockenden's previous review in Shrewsbury and Telford, which also used the \"opt-out\" approach, included more than 95% of affected families. <br/>The Nottingham trust wrote to 1,377 families at the end of November and the end of January.<br/>The letters went to families who had experienced stillbirth, neonatal deaths, brain damage to the baby, harm to mothers or relatives of mothers who died.<br/>But only 360 families responded to these letters.<br/>In total, 28% of white women contacted responded, while for black and Asian women, the figures were 10% and 5% respectively.<br/>In Nottingham, only about 25% of families known to be affected have been included in the review.<br/>Ms Ockenden said: \"As it stands, with our 674 families who have joined the review, I can't say as the chair we have anywhere near a representative sample of the rich diversity that we know exists in Nottingham.<br/>\"There is significantly more work to do.\"<br/>Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on Twitter, or on Instagram.

Still, 5% of all Alzheimer's cases are in people under the age of 65.<br/>A much smaller number of people are affected in their 30s and 40s, usually because of a faulty gene passed down the generations.<br/>The only known risk factor for getting Alzheimer's at a young age is if close relatives also had early onset disease, and there is no known way of preventing it.<br/>The early onset form of the disease follows the same inexorable course as it does in older age - it affects memory, thinking skills and behaviour.<br/>Fiona Phillips mentioned she'd lived with months of brain fog before her diagnosis. <br/>Brain fog does not have a medical definition, but it is often used by people to describe a fuzzy head, poor concentration and struggling to think clearly or quickly.<br/>There is no proven way of stopping yourself from getting dementia, but you can tip the odds in your favour. <br/>Research estimates that one in three cases could be prevented by lifestyle changes, including:<br/>It is not completely clear why doing these things can help protect the brain. <br/>Do these lifestyle factors actually stop the process of dementia in the brain? Or do they prepare the brain for dementia by increasing the connections and flexibility of the brain so that, as neurones start to die, the brain can compensate for longer, and symptoms don't emerge?<br/>You can do everything recommended to try to prevent dementia and still develop it, or do nothing and be untouched by it.<br/>Yes, it can be - but that's not the whole story.<br/>Fiona Phillips has described how Alzheimer's \"decimated\" her family - and having a parent or sibling with Alzheimer's increases your risk of developing the disease. <br/>But having relatives with the disease does not mean you are fated to develop it, and being in a family untouched by Alzheimer's does not mean you will be spared it either.<br/>She is taking part in trials of a drug called miridesap at University College Hospital in London. This involves injections in her stomach every day for a maximum of 12 months.<br/>The aim of the trial is to find out whether the drug, which removes a protein called SAP (serum amyloid P component) from the brain, can stop amyloid plaques from damaging brain cells.<br/>The researchers think this could be part of the process of the development of Alzheimer's disease. <br/>Patients with mild Alzheimer's disease have been recruited to the DESPIAD trial, which also includes tests on brain function.<br/>Yes.

Humans are increasingly encroaching upon their habitats, adding to the risk of new pandemics, so scientists are studying bats for any clues about how to prevent any new outbreaks.<br/>Dusk is the witching hour at Accra Zoo. It is the time that the captive colony of straw-coloured fruit bats begin to stir and the best time they can be tested for different pathogens. <br/>A team of scientists from the University of Ghana's veterinary school is here to analyse the bat droppings, or guano. <br/>They are involved in an international effort to predict the next pandemic and even in the extreme heat of Ghana's rainy season, they dress up in full PPE. They enter the enclosure and spread a white tarpaulin out on the ground.<br/>Lead scientist Dr Richard Suu-ire has studied bats for many years. He explains that PPE is needed \"to protect you from any infection you may pick up within the cage but also to protect the bats from getting anything from us. So it's protection both ways.\"<br/>Much remains a mystery about these animals - the only mammals that fly - and their extraordinary immune systems. Somehow bats can carry many viruses but don't seem to get sick themselves. <br/>Ghana has joined countries like Bangladesh and Australia as part of a global project called Bat OneHealth, which investigates how pathogens are transmitted from one species to another and what can be done to prevent so-called spillover events.<br/>In light of the Covid pandemic, the bat-borne viruses being focused on in this research include coronaviruses.<br/>Warning: This article contains a picture of dead animals which some people may find upsetting<br/>Dr Suu-ire explains that they are testing for paramyxoviruses and coronaviruses in the bats. In humans, these viruses are more familiarly experienced as illnesses such as mumps, measles and respiratory tract infections. <br/>He describes the bats as \"reservoirs\" because they carry the infection without getting sick themselves.<br/>\"So we want to monitor and see what is going on.\"<br/>He says when they worked with the wild bat populations they did not detect Covid-19.<br/>Today, his team is also testing for superbugs in the bat droppings. The scientists have fed the bats pawpaw fruit and, once the bats have defecated on the tarpaulin, they take swabs of the bright orange droppings and store them in test tubes. <br/>The University of Ghana has been at the forefront of this new area of research, with this project being the first of its kind. However, there are still many gaps in scientific understanding. <br/>Ultimately, what they are trying to find out is whether there is any bacteria in the bat faeces which is resistant to antibiotics. <br/>Dr Suu-ire says: \"If there's any resistance we will then find out to which antibiotics they are developing resistance. In future we will try to isolate the resistant genes from these bacteria.\"<br/>This is not the only bat research going on at the University of Ghana. <br/>In the undergrowth of the university's botanical gardens, Dr Kofi Amponsah-Mensah is setting up a high green net, almost as if he is ready for a night-time game of badminton. <br/>These nets allow him to catch some bats temporarily which he then examines, measures and finally releases back into the wild. As an ecologist, he worries about how humans are increasingly encroaching into bat habitats.<br/>He points out that deforestation rates in Ghana are high, with a lot of mining destroying vegetation which is the bats' natural habitat. <br/>\"I think we are just using bats as scapegoats for areas where we have failed as people, because historically we didn't have a lot of these diseases emerging,\" he says.<br/>\"We are the ones encroaching into the bats' [habitat], you know, and messing around with the ecosystem. This obviously leads to more contact and then the likelihood of some of these diseases coming up.\"<br/>Any discussion of how humans interact with bats inevitably leads to the topic of bushmeat.  <br/>All kinds of animals are on sale at a bushmeat market down a disused railway line in central Accra. These markets are a pinch-point where wild animals, like bats, come into contact with people. This creates a risk these scientists want to get ahead of.<br/>It is certainly not a place for the faint-hearted. There are large rodent-type animals called grass cutters with long tails, and dead antelopes with their throats slashed - signs of the various ways in which they were hunted in the wild.<br/>The heat in the market is overwhelming as many of the women who work here are cooking on open stoves. In the corner of one stall, we see what looks like a saucepan lid full of shrivelled, straw-coloured fruit bats. According to Dr Amponsah-Mensah, they have been singed on a fire to remove the hair. <br/>Following the Covid pandemic, some experts have called for the banning of markets like these in case they help spread the viruses. Although Dr Amponsah-Mensah says he would not choose to eat bat himself, he feels conflicted about a total ban.<br/>He says that the trade in bushmeat is something that has been going on for thousands of years and that it's entrenched in people's cultures and histories, with many people preferring to eat bushmeat rather than beef or chicken. <br/>\"The trade is dominated mostly by women and for a lot of them, this is the only trade they know because it's been handed down from their grandparents to their mothers, and now they are in the trade as well,\" he says.<br/>\"So any attempt to ban bushmeat without really thinking about the complexity of the trade will really have serious implications.\" <br/>At the sterile high-security labs at the Noguchi Institute for Medical Research on the University of Ghana's campus, bat droppings from Accra Zoo will be analysed by Associate Professor of Virology Kofi Bonney. <br/>As he punches a secret code into an electronic keypad, he explains that these labs have negative air pressure to prevent any pathogens escaping.<br/>Since the pandemic, Prof Bonney and his team have found themselves busier than ever in the global effort to get ahead of any future virus outbreaks.<br/>Prof Bonney explains the growing relevance of the Bat OneHealth project: \"We should have the environment working together with the animals' sector and the human sector. We must set up systems that will pick up some of these viruses very early so that we can curtail the spread.<br/>\"Otherwise, once a virus inhabits the human system, it keeps circulating and there is a high tendency for the virus to change. As they change, they can develop the ability to become a more severe disease. So the best thing is for us to develop systems that can pick them up early.\"<br/>Experts worry that the frequency of zoonotic spillovers will increase with climate change. Humans and animals will be forced into ever closer contact as they both vie for resources such as water and even shade from the sun. <br/>Bats are already the focus of billions of dollars-worth of research - partly because of their unusual immune systems but also because they can fly such long distances. Understanding them better, as they are trying to do in Ghana, will be crucial to the planet's health.<br/>Bat scientists find new coronavirus evidence<br/>Infectious coronaviruses 'were in bats for decades'<br/>University of Ghana<br/>BatOneHealth<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

But despite the prime minister's pledge there are still many questions.<br/>That answer is yes for recruitment, though with a caveat.  <br/>The plan is funded for the first five years but for 10 years after that there is an assumption that future governments will find the money to keep up with the required growth in training places. <br/>It is hard to believe a new administration would dilute NHS workforce growth and the training of thousands more doctors and nurses. <br/>But, never say never when it comes to public finances.  <br/>Expanding the number of clinical staff to the extent which is envisaged in the plan will eventually have a positive impact for patients - but retention will be a bigger ask. <br/>The plan's policies to improve morale and hang on to staff look a little vague. Recruitment will not achieve much if there is a continued exodus at the same rate as now.<br/>Recruit and retain have long been held up as the required twin-track approach for the NHS. <br/>Health think tanks and charities were queueing up to welcome the plan as it had adopted the policies called for by most experts.  <br/>Then again the enthusiasm must in part have been relief that at long last there was an NHS workforce plan after nothing comparable in the previous two decades. <br/>Modelling of future patient demand seems reasonable and health think tanks were invited to kick the tyres of the numbers. <br/>Productivity assumptions were included. Some of the medical Royal Colleges have noted the plan is ambitious and they want to see more detail.<br/>The idea of medical apprenticeships is radical with staff in other NHS jobs training to be doctors. <br/>But, the precise workings of this scheme will need time to work out.<br/>Pay is certainly the elephant in the room.  <br/>Most large organisations drawing up a workforce plan would have a section on appropriate remuneration to attract and motivate the best staff.  <br/>That is one thing NHS England can't do with its strategy. <br/>NHS pay is the preserve of the government and it is ministers who decide. Most of the NHS pay disputes have been settled but the doctors' campaign is far from over with further strikes planned. <br/>Health unions have long argued that the best way to hold on to staff is to raise wages at a time of acute cost of living pressures.  <br/>Senior management have had to stand on the side-lines of the argument and cope with the consequences of walkouts.<br/>In the short-term - no, when it comes to raising the number of doctors, nurses and other health staff.  <br/>It takes several years to train clinical professionals and the expansion of new places at medical schools and universities won't begin until the autumn of 2024. <br/>Implementation may be slowed if there are not enough experienced doctors and nurses to set aside time to run the training.<br/>Retention initiatives aimed at reducing the number of NHS staff quitting might make a bit of a difference over the next year or so. <br/>But, patients currently frustrated at not getting a GP appointment or are on a long waiting list for an operation probably won't notice.<br/>Planning the training of tens of thousands of health staff right through till beyond 2030 is admirable. <br/>There has been nothing comparable in recent years with only sporadic time-limited initiatives. <br/>But, what will the rest of the NHS look line by then? Will the service have kept up with the increasing burden of sickness linked to an ageing population? <br/>Will the public be willing to keep funding the NHS through taxation? Might payment for some services have been introduced? How much difference will technology and AI make? <br/>There is no long-term plan for investment in buildings and IT - in other words the hospitals and clinics where the new staff will work and the computers they will use. <br/>Perhaps the publication of a multi-year workforce plan will spur politicians to come up with broader strategies for health funding and reform over a decade or more.  <br/>But don't hold your breath.<br/>The NHS backlog: Who are the 7 million?<br/>NHS staff sickness hits record high in England<br/>NHS misses targets to tackle care backlogs<br/>NHS in England facing worst staffing crisis, MPs warn<br/>Ministers set out plan to train and keep more NHS staff<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

with death rates below historical averages. <br/>In the third year, death rates rose in many countries as they opened up again.<br/>Some of the largest rebounds we found were in countries like Germany, New Zealand and Norway, who had fared better in the first two years of the pandemic (and well overall). <br/>Norway had far fewer deaths than Sweden in the first year of the pandemic but over the three years the two countries look more similar. <br/>It is hard to read straight across from Scandinavian countries to the UK, cautions Prof Sridhar, arguing \"we'd never look like either Sweden or Norway\", and describing them as \"healthier, wealthier and more equal\" countries that are very different to the UK.  <br/>It would take many inquiries to tease apart the effect of all the possible reasons behind every nation's pandemic outcomes: preparedness, population health, lockdown timing and severity, social support, vaccine rollout and health care provision and others. <br/>But some argue that there are lessons for the UK that need to be learned even before we think about future pandemics. <br/>The UK's heavy pandemic death toll \"built on a decade of lacklustre performance on life expectancy\" says Veena Raleigh, of the King's Fund, a health think tank.

But vaping's helped millions of people to ditch traditional cigarettes.<br/>It's widely considered less harmful than smoking tobacco - and the UK government endorses vapes as a quitting aid.<br/>But what do you do when you want to take the next step and quit completely?<br/>The main reason vaping gets you hooked is nicotine - the same ingredient that makes smokers crave cigarettes.<br/>It's thought to be pretty harmless on its own, but is powerfully addictive. That's why vaping isn't recommended for non-smokers.<br/>Nicotine creates new receptors in the brain when it enters the body, and you quickly come to associate it with feeling good.<br/>So when you stop getting it you'll feel cravings. These tend to be worse in the first three to four days after your last dose.<br/>According to the NHS, other withdrawal symptoms, like bad moods, are likely in the early stages of quitting.<br/>There's no firm answer to this - it varies for each person - but there are some things we do know.<br/>It's technically possible to go \"cold turkey\" and suddenly stop vaping. But most people find this very difficult.<br/>Experts, such as the National Centre for Smoking Cessation and Training (NCSCT), generally recommend some sort of gradual approach.<br/>One tip for vapers is to reduce the nicotine strength of their e-liquid in two to four-week stages, working down to 0% solutions.<br/>This can be trickier with disposable vapes, which tend to come in higher strengths.<br/>But zero-nicotine versions are available, and the NCSCT says using one alongside your regular vape can help.<br/>Failing that, a temporary switch to a tank-style vape, giving you access to different e-liquids, might be better. <br/>Other reduction strategies include:<br/>Another option is Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) - patches, gum and sprays used instead of a vape.<br/>Nicotine pouches that go between the gum and lip are starting to appear on some shop shelves but these aren't currently recommended by the NHS.<br/>Like smoking, if you've been vaping a long time you're likely to have formed habits around it.<br/>Certain situations or times of day - triggers - will have got you used to reaching for your vape. <br/>This can be hard to snap out of, so it can help to figure out what they are.<br/>It's also a good idea to try and fill this time with something else to distract you, like exercise.<br/>If you are a former smoker, the NCSCT says it's worth keeping a vape on hand for emergencies.<br/>Because, if you do relapse, it's better than reaching for a cigarette.<br/>Follow Newsbeat on Twitter and YouTube.<br/>Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here<br/>High lead and nickel levels found in illegal vapes<br/>Free vapes to be handed out in anti-smoking drive<br/>Vaping - is it a risk-free option?<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Personally, everyone gave their all but the system was not fit for purpose, was it?\"<br/>Mr Hancock replied: \"That's absolutely right.\"<br/>The former health secretary added: \"I bear responsibility for all the things that happened, not only in my department, but also the agencies that reported to me as secretary of state.\"<br/>The inquiry also heard from the former health secretary that medicines for intensive care were \"within hours\" of running out at the peak of the pandemic. <br/>He added that the only reason they did not was because of work done in 2019 in preparation for a no-deal Brexit.<br/>Mr Hancock said he had to overrule initial advice not to quarantine people being brought back from Wuhan early in the pandemic, and that everybody in the Western world missed that lockdowns would be necessary.<br/>He also criticised the World Health Organization (WHO) for giving advice which \"stated that we should not have lockdowns\".<br/>He said it was \"madness\" but he had to \"overrule\" initial advice not to quarantine people coming in from China. <br/>He also blamed the WHO for having \"written into the international health regulations that you shouldn't close borders\".<br/>Because there was \"no such thing\" as mass contact tracing systems as the pandemic took hold, Mr Hancock said the inability to test people in large numbers was \"terrible\".<br/>He also used the word terrible to describe the government having no idea whether care homes had the right protections in place. <br/>He said the government didn't even know how many care home residents there were at the start of the pandemic.<br/>However, he said the responsibility for ensuring the social care sector was prepared for a pandemic fell to local authorities, and he \"didn't have the levers to act\". <br/>The former health secretary was also repeatedly asked about the recommendations from Exercise Cygnus, a three-day test run in October 2016 to find out how prepared the UK was for a influenza pandemic. <br/>It concluded that the UK's plan was not sufficient to \"cope with the extreme demands of a severe pandemic\".<br/>The inquiry has seen evidence that only eight of the 22 recommendations made after that exercise had been fully addressed by the time Covid hit, with work on the other 14, including preparing the social care sector, still ongoing. <br/>He described Exercise Cygnus as \"flawed in its central assumption\" that a pandemic was a disaster that needed to be \"cleaned up\" rather than something that needed to be stopped or contained in the first place. <br/>He said: \"The doctrinal flaw was the biggest by a long way because if we'd had a flu pandemic, we still would have had the problem of no plan in place for lockdown, no prep for how to do one, no work on what, how best to lock down with the least damage.<br/>\"I understand deeply the consequences of lockdown and the negative consequences for many, many people - many of which persist to this day.\"<br/>Mr Hancock said that some of that work on the Exercise Cygnus had been paused because of the need to prepare the country for a no-deal Brexit. <br/>But he said that he was \"not convinced\" that, even if all those recommendations had been addressed, the country would have been in a better place to deal with Covid. <br/>As a result, the UK was \"better prepared in terms of supply chains,\" but the \"overall impact\" was hard to judge.<br/>\"I'm afraid it's impossible to know,\" he added. <br/>When Mr Hancock first arrived at the inquiry, a widow showed him images of her husband, who died from Covid.<br/>Lorelei King, 69, was holding two A4 posters, which she showed to the former health secretary as he stepped out of a black Jaguar.<br/>One poster displayed an image of Mr Hancock with Mrs King's husband, Vincent Marzello, who died in a care home in March 2020, aged 72.<br/>\"You shook my husband's hand for your photo op,\" the photo was captioned. The other picture showed Mr Marzello's coffin.<br/>Mr Hancock didn't respond as he walked in to the building.<br/>Mrs King told journalists: \"Care homes became charnel houses because there was no testing, there was insufficient PPE, but, most disastrously, it's because they discharged people from hospitals without testing them.\"<br/>She called on Mr Hancock to \"tell the truth\" to the inquiry, adding: \"The bereaved families deserve that much.\"<br/>Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>Ex-medical officer close to tears over Covid deaths<br/>What is the UK Covid inquiry and how long will it take?<br/>UK Covid-19 Inquiry<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

and asked for the protocol to be changed.<br/>He added that he didn't feel comfortable that someone \"a long way from front line\" could make such a decision, which would be better made by people closer to the situation on the ground, he added. <br/>Sign up for our UK morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>What is the UK Covid inquiry and how long will it take?<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing -

He is due to give evidence on Thursday along with Sir Patrick Vallance, who was the government's chief scientific adviser during the pandemic.  <br/>At the same hearing, George Osborne said his spending cuts meant the UK was better able to cope with the pandemic. <br/>The former chancellor argued that without austerity Britain would have been \"more exposed\" and rejected claims his approach left the health and social care \"depleted\" ahead of the Covid pandemic. <br/>Last week Sir Michael Marmot, a professor of epidemiology at University College London told the inquiry that the UK had entered the pandemic with \"depleted\" public services. <br/>Asked by inquiry lawyer Kate Blackwell KC if he agreed with the statement, Mr Osborne said: \"Most certainly not, I completely reject that.\"<br/>He accepted more money could have been spent on the NHS, but said as chancellor he had to balance demands for resources from other public services.<br/>\"You can't just say we like public spending to be higher without explaining where you get money from,\" he told the inquiry.<br/>He said the public had elected the Conservatives to government in 2010 and 2015 knowing the party was planning to cut public spending. <br/>During the period, cuts were introduced in welfare spending, school building programs, local government, police, courts and prisons. There was also an overall squeeze on health spending. <br/>Mr Osborne - who was chancellor from 2010 to 2016 - said: \"If we had not done that Britain would have been more exposed, not just to future things like the coronavirus pandemic, but indeed to the fiscal crisis which very rapidly followed in countries across Europe.<br/>\"If we had not had a clear plan to put the public finances on a sustainable path then Britain might have experienced a fiscal crisis, we would not have had the fiscal space to deal with the coronavirus pandemic when it hit.\" <br/>The British Medical Association said Mr Osborne's \"denial\" of a connection between austerity and the impact of the pandemic on the most vulnerable was \"staggering\". <br/>On Monday, the Trades Union Congress (TUC) produced a report which said austerity had led to unsafe staffing in public services leaving the UK \"hugely unprepared\" for Covid. <br/>During the one hour 20 minute question session, Mr Osborne was also asked about the Treasury's planning for potential national lockdown. <br/>He said the department had plans for an outbreak of influenza but added \"given what subsequently happened that was very small scale\".<br/>\"There was no planning done by Treasury - or any western Treasury - for asking the entire population to stay at home for months and months on end.<br/>\"If someone had said to you the UK government should be preparing for a lockdown that might last for months, then I have no doubt the Treasury would have developed schemes it did subsequently develop around the furlough and the Covid loans. <br/>\"Planning could have been done for a furlough scheme in advance - I'm not clear that would have made a better furlough scheme than the one we as a country actually saw.\"<br/>Earlier in the day, Sir Oliver Letwin, a senior minister in David Cameron's government, told the inquiry a rapid turnover of civil service staff hindered the government's ability to plan for pandemics. <br/>He also warned that the UK was \"wildly under-resilient\" and said there should be a minister \"solely devoted\" to the subject.<br/>Labour said the admissions were \"too little, too late\", adding the Conservatives \"cannot be trusted to protect the public from the emergencies of tomorrow\".<br/>Sign up for our UK morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>Ex-PM Cameron admits mistake over pandemic planning<br/>What is the UK Covid inquiry and how long will it take?<br/>Covid inquiry criticises government evidence<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

both epidemiologists - said a coronavirus had already jumped to humans on a significant scale twice in the 21st Century, in the form of severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers).<br/>And it had been \"a reasonable bet\", before 2020, another one might follow, infectious-diseases expert and former professor of international public health Jimmy Whitworth said.<br/>By mid-January 2020, people in the international public-health community had been aware the Covid-19 outbreak had been \"out of the ordinary\", he said.<br/>\"It wasn't going to die away - it was something bigger than that,\" Mr Whitworth said.<br/>And by end of January, people in public health had been very clear it had been \"an impending wave that was coming to UK\".<br/>\"For those of us who had memories of Sars, the parallels were something that gave us shivers\", Mr Whitworth added.<br/>Asked about the dangers of a virus being leaked, deliberately or accidentally, from a laboratory, Cambridge University fellow in emerging infectious diseases Dr Charlotte Hammer said she was aware of four incidents involving the Sars virus. <br/>But when it came to controlling an outbreak once it had started to infect thousands of people, the virus's origins mattered \"very little\".<br/>What is the UK Covid-19 inquiry?<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Bereaved families express their loss, in a film shown to the inquiry<br/>The UK saw one of the worst first waves of Covid in Europe, in spring 2020. <br/>In April and May that year, about 160,000 deaths were registered - 60,000 more than expected, based on the years just before the pandemic. <br/>But by that winter, the UK had been overtaken by many countries in Eastern Europe that had seemed to escape the first wave. <br/>The UK's Office for National Statistics has continued to analyse these figures for Europe and, as of July last year, put the UK  in the middle of the pack. <br/>According to Department of Health figures, 227,321 people across the UK died with Covid recorded on their death certificate.<br/>Covid vaccines have prevented many deaths and serious illness from the virus -

or module - will examine how well prepared the UK was for Covid up to January 2020. <br/>Mr Keith said: \"Even at this stage, before hearing the evidence, it is apparent that we might not have been very well prepared at all.\"<br/>What is the UK Covid inquiry and how long will it take?<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Bereaved families express their loss in a film shown to the inquiry<br/>Chair Baroness Hallett pledged that the inquiry into the handling of the coronavirus pandemic would be the \"thorough investigation\" that the public deserves.<br/>The former High Court judge paid tribute to a \"dignified vigil\" of bereaved family members holding a silent protest outside of the building. <br/>Lady Hallett said there were three key questions to be answered for the \"millions of people who have suffered and continue to suffer\": <br/>This first part of the inquiry will hear from key politicians, civil servants, scientists, unions, health and care organisations, groups representing victims and their relatives and more. <br/>The Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group has criticised the inquiry's timetable and says people have been \"excluded from sharing key evidence\".<br/>They branded the inquiry's Every Story Matters project - where members of the public can share their experience with the inquiry through a website - an \"inadequate\" process because stories will be anonymised and summarised and possibly \"open to bias and interpretation by third parties\".<br/>Addressing critics of the inquiry, Lady Hallett said she hoped they would understand the difficult balance she has had to strike.<br/>\"I am listening to them, their loss will be recognised, they will be able to contribute to the inquiry.\"<br/>Mr Keith, counsel to the inquiry, said UK was \"taken by surprise\" over \"significant aspects\" of the pandemic, including lockdowns. <br/>\"Extraordinary though it may seem, given that it's a word that's forever seared in the nation's consciousness, there was very little debate pre-pandemic of whether a lockdown might prove to be necessary in the event of a runaway virus, let alone how a lockdown could be avoided.<br/>\"Very little thought was given to how, if it proved to be necessary, how something as complex, difficult and damaging as a national lockdown could be put in place at all.<br/>\"Equally, there appears to have been a failure to think through the potentially massive impact on education and on the economy.\"<br/>He said the UK had been preparing for an outbreak more similar to flu, and questioned how well placed and funded the NHS was to cope.<br/>\"No amount of foresight or planning can guarantee that a country will not make mistakes when a disease strikes, but that does not mean that we should not strive to be as ready as we sensibly can be,\" Mr Keith said.<br/>\"No country can be perfectly prepared, but it can certainly be underprepared.\"<br/>Mr Keith highlighted \"shocking\" data showing that Covid mortality was two-and-a-half times higher in some of the most deprived parts of the UK than the richest, with people in some ethnic minority groups or with a disability far more likely to be infected or die of the disease.<br/>To what extent those outcomes could and should have been foreseen and mitigated would be a \"big question\" in module one, he said. <br/>The wider political environment will also be considered including the possible impact of Brexit on emergency planning.<br/>\"Did the attention paid to the risks of a no-deal Brexit - Operation Yellowhammer as it was known - drain resources and capacity that should have been continuing the fight against the next pandemic?\" Mr Keith asked.<br/>\"Or did that generic and operational planning, in fact, lead to people being better trained and well-marshalled, and in fact better prepared to deal with Covid?<br/>\"On the evidence so far... we very much fear that it was the former.\"<br/>The inquiry will also examine if the collapse of the power-sharing agreement in Northern Ireland damaged the ability of authorities to plan and respond to the pandemic. <br/>Mr Keith said it was unlikely we will ever know how Covid started - whether it emerged from a lab leak or from farmed wild animals that were sold in Wuhan. Nor when the first human infection happened, he said. <br/>\"For this inquiry's purposes, this knowledge does not matter.\" <br/>In his opening remarks, Pete Weatherby KC, counsel for the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group, said the \"closest to an overall plan\" to deal with Covid in 2020 was a 2011 document drawn up to protect the UK from an outbreak of influenza. <br/>\"With a pandemic, time is of the essence and lost time is measured in lives,\" he said. <br/>\"The families expect the evidence will show\u2026 little or no ministerial leadership and the chaos of committees which led to poor planning and ultimately a reactive rather than a proactive response to the virus.\" <br/>In response to the Brexit claims, a spokesperson for the prime minister said the government would not be responding to every issue raised in the inquiry.<br/>He added that it would be up to the government to respond at the appropriate stage.  <br/>Lady Hallett has asked to see ex-prime minister Boris Johnson's unredacted WhatsApp messages between him and around 40 politicians and officials, but this is being challenged by his successor, Rishi Sunak.<br/>The Cabinet Office launched a legal challenge against the request, arguing some of the messages were irrelevant. This is thought to be the first time a government has taken legal action against its own public inquiry.<br/>Mr Johnson said he was \"perfectly content\" for the inquiry to have WhatsApp messages sent after May 2021. Earlier messages are not available because his mobile phone was involved in a security breach and has not been used since.<br/>Former Health Secretary Matt Hancock also said he was happy to share his messages, although many of these have already been leaked by the journalist Isabel Oakeshott, who helped Mr Hancock write his book, Pandemic Diaries.<br/>In a statement about the back-and-forth over the messages, Rishi Sunak's spokesperson said it \"is still ongoing\" and will \"obviously... be resolved through the normal process\".<br/>\"Broadly, we continue to provide tens of thousands of pieces of information to the inquiry, 55,000 documents over the past 11 months and we will do so in the spirit of transparency and candour.\"<br/>The UK saw one of the worst first waves of Covid in Europe in spring 2020. <br/>In April and May that year, about 160,000 deaths were registered: 60,000 more than you'd expect based on the years just before the pandemic. <br/>But by that winter the UK had been overtaken by many countries in eastern Europe who had seemed to escape the first wave. <br/>The UK's Office for National Statistics has continued to analyse these figures for Europe and, as of July last year, put the UK  in the middle of the pack. <br/>According to Department of Health figures, 227,321 people died across the UK with Covid recorded on their death certificate.<br/>Covid vaccines have prevented many deaths and serious illness from the virus - more than 151m doses have been given in the UK. <br/>The questions we want the Covid inquiry to answer<br/>What is the UK Covid inquiry and how long will it take?<br/>UK Covid-19 Inquiry<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Now, with the FBI adding its voice, the politics and division behind the hunt for the truth are being laid bare.<br/>There are few scientific debates as divisive and toxic as the question of Covid's origin. <br/>While researching for the upcoming podcast I'm making for the BBC about it, I've heard virologists question the motives and professionalism of colleagues with whom they disagree over two alternative possibilities.<br/>They are whether the virus infected its first human in a Wuhan market, or in a Chinese government-controlled lab. <br/>\"I wouldn't want [him] to be doing that experiment,\" one eminent virologist said dismissively of another who had raised questions about the risks of the Wuhan scientists' work. <br/>Professional relationships have been damaged and friendships lost. Some have simply had enough. <br/>\"Nothing personal, but I'm not prepared to take part in anything that gives air time to the lab leak conspiracy horseshit,\" one virologist said to me when I invited him to take part in our series. <br/>It should be no surprise then that US intelligence agencies and government departments have also struggled to reach a consensus on Covid's origins.<br/>The recent news that the US Department of Energy has changed its intelligence assessment to conclude - apparently with low confidence - that the virus came from a lab, brings the number of agencies supporting that view to two. <br/>It had already been reported that the FBI had come to the same conclusion - with a \"moderate\" level of confidence - and now FBI Director Christopher Wray has spelled out in public that the bureau believes \"a potential lab incident\" was to blame.<br/>Four US intelligence agencies are said to still believe the evidence points to the virus coming from nature, and two remain undecided. <br/>The intelligence assessments are based, of course, on classified information.  The different agencies are part of what's known in the US as the \"intelligence community\", with each one drawing on different expertise and sources of information, from human intelligence to the work of government scientists.<br/>The Department of Energy's Office of Intelligence and Counterintelligence, for example, can call on scientific and technological know-how from the 17 national laboratories that are overseen by the department.<br/>The agencies' work can overlap but it's unclear how much they've collaborated on the question of the origin of Covid.<br/>There were claims during the days of the Trump administration that several researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a national-level research facility known to have been studying and experimenting with coronaviruses, had become sick in November 2019, leading them to seek hospital treatment. <br/>But no details have been released about the sourcing of that intelligence.  <br/>And the US government has said the symptoms were consistent with both Covid-19 and common seasonal illnesses - making it difficult for anyone to independently assess the true relevance of the claim. <br/>In early 2020, the lab-leak theory's association with President Donald Trump led some to treat it as disinformation: a deliberate, even xenophobic attempt to deflect blame for his administration's own handling of the pandemic.  <br/>But there were scientific arguments too - with claims that an examination of the genetic structure of Sars-CoV-2 proved conclusively that it couldn't have come from a lab.  <br/>Later, others would argue that analysis of the early patient data around that Wuhan market where the disease first emerged went even further to prove a natural origin beyond all doubt - and we will hear from some of those scientists in our podcast. <br/>These scientists may wonder whether politics are once again at play in the timing of the comments from the FBI director, a Trump appointee, just as the Republican Party, now in control of the US House of Representatives, begins to turn its attention to the lab-leak once again.<br/>On the other hand, under President Biden the lab-leak theory has been largely freed of its associations with his predecessor.<br/>Which is perhaps why other scientists are increasingly willing to speak out about their concern that the theory may have been too swiftly dismissed. <br/>Professor Larry Gostin, from Georgetown University and an advisor to the World Health Organization \u00a0- although himself favouring a natural origin - does not believe there is yet enough evidence to definitively rule out a lab-leak and thinks it was a mistake to try to do so. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\"Science shouldn't discount the public interest like that,\" he told me. He suggests that Donald Trump, who has indulged in conspiracy theories across a range of other issues, may in fact have been right to question this narrative. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\"I mean, yes, you do have conspiracy theories. But was he, you know, wrong in wanting that information about the lab? No.\"<br/>Some experts hope that Congress may now be able to uncover new information.  <br/>US scientists have collaborated closely with the Wuhan Institute of Virology and there may yet be data held by government agencies or research archives that could prove useful.  <br/>Meanwhile the Chinese government of course pushes back at any and all suggestions that the virus came from China - via a market or a lab.  <br/>My own attempts to examine those possibilities led, at least in part, to my forcible departure from the country, under threat of legal action by the authorities in 2021.  <br/>State media accused me of \"stigmatising China as being the origin of the novel coronavirus\" and of having \"maliciously incited hostility from the international community to China.\" <br/>The question of Covid's origin is likely to remain shrouded in bitterness, acrimony and politics in both Washington and Beijing.<br/>The lack of information is both why President Biden ordered his intelligence agencies in 2021 to use \"every tool\" to look again for answers, and also why they're finding them so hard to come by. <br/>John's podcast on the hunt for the origin of Covid is coming soon on BBC Sounds and BBC Radio 4<br/>Covid origin likely China lab incident - FBI chief<br/>Covid origin studies say evidence points to market<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

I've accepted that advice. It is therefore with great hope that I declare Covid-19 over as a global health emergency,\" Dr Tedros said. <br/>He added that the decision had been considered carefully for some time and made on the basis of careful analysis of data.<br/>But he warned the removal of the highest level of alert did not mean the danger was over and said the emergency status could be reinstated if the situation changed. <br/>\"The worst thing any country can do now is to use this news as a reason to let down its guard, to dismantle the systems it has built, or to send the message to its people that Covid-19 is nothing to worry about,\" he said.<br/>The World Health Organization first declared Covid-19 to be a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) in January 2020. <br/>This signalled the need for coordinated global action to protect people from the new virus. <br/>It will now be up to individual countries to continue to manage Covid in the way they think best.<br/>Vaccines were one of the major turning points in the pandemic. According to the WHO, 13 billion doses have been given, allowing many people to be protected from serious illness and death. <br/>But in many countries vaccines have not reached most of those in need. <br/>More than 765 million confirmed Covid infections have been recorded worldwide.<br/>The US and UK, like many other countries, have already talked about \"living with the virus\" and wound down many of the tests and social mixing rules. <br/>Dr Mike Ryan, from the WHO's health emergencies programme, said the emergency may have ended, but the threat is still there. <br/>\"We fully expect that this virus will continue to transmit and this is the history of pandemics,\" he said.<br/>\"It took decades for the final throes of the pandemic virus of 1918 to disappear. <br/>\"In most cases, pandemics truly end when the next pandemic begins.\"<br/>US to end Covid vaccine air travel requirements<br/>Covid whistleblower returns home to Wuhan after jail<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

The BBC has not seen or independently verified the WhatsApp messages nor the context in which they were sent.<br/>After congratulating the then education secretary Sir Gavin Williamson on delaying A-level exams for a few weeks - a shorter period than some teaching unions called for - Mr Hancock had some choice words. <br/>On 1 October 2020, Mr Hancock messaged Sir Gavin: \"Cracking announcement today. What a bunch of absolute arses the teaching unions are.\"<br/>Sir Gavin replied: \"I know they really really do just hate work.\"<br/>In response, Mr Hancock returned two laughing out loud and a bullseye emoji. <br/>Mr Hancock texted his old boss George Osborne, ex-chancellor and then-Evening Standard editor, on 28 April 2020 to \"call in a favour\" asking for a favourable front page, as he tried to reach his own deadline to reach 100,000 daily Covid tests. <br/>Mr Osborne replied: \"Yes - of course - all you need to do tomorrow is give some exclusive words to the Standard and I'll tell the team to splash it.\"<br/>After replying with a quote, Hancock later writes in capital letters: \"I WANT TO HIT MY TARGET!\"<br/>The editor answered bluntly: \"I gathered.\"  <br/>In another interaction, on 9 November 2020 Mr Hancock asked for an explanation about Mr Osborne calling for Boris Johnson to make testing his number one priority and insisted: \"OK but mass testing is going very well.\"<br/>\"No-one thinks testing is going well, Matt,\" Mr Osborne replied. <br/>Sir Gavin, messaging Mr Hancock, on 10 May 2020 ahead of schools reopening, asked for the health secretary's help in getting personal protective equipment (PPE) for schools \"as a last resort so they can't use it as a reason not to open\". <br/>The education secretary texted: \"All of them will [open] but some will just want to say they can't so they have an excuse to avoid having to teach, what joys!!!\"<br/>Boris Johnson had misgivings about the government's shielding advice in discussions with the chief medical officer Prof Sir Chris Whitty. In August 2020 the then-prime minister suggested that if renewed lockdown restrictions were needed over-65s be offered a choice on shielding.<br/>Mr Johnson, addressing Sir Chris in a WhatsApp group on 9 August, said: \"If you are over 65 your risk of dying from Covid is probably as big as your risk of falling down stairs. And we don't stop older people from using stairs. What do you think?\"      <br/>Sir Chris conceded that he \"would think twice before shielding unless it threatened the NHS\". Chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance replied: \"We haven't found shielding easy or very effective first time round.\"<br/>Only a few days previously, shielding had ended for more than two million clinically vulnerable people in England, Scotland and Wales. Since March 2020 they had been advised to stay at home to avoid contracting Covid. Shielding later returned. <br/>Helen Whately, who was social care minister at the time, travelled 50 miles to a Covid test centre so a relative could be tested in September 2020, according to the Telegraph. There were restricted numbers of home testing kits and the public had to book a slot at a testing centre, where they could swab themselves and it would be sent to a laboratory. <br/>Speaking of the experience on 19 September, she messaged Mr Hancock: \"So my mystery shopping shows the system is definitely working, at least for some.\"<br/>Mr Hancock enthusiastically replied \"for MOST!\", despite UK labs struggling to keep up with demand and people being asked to travel hundreds of miles to get tested. <br/>Mr Hancock clashed with Sir Gavin over whether to close schools ahead of their return January 2021. <br/>In private WhatsApp messages with a special adviser, he said he had to take \"rear guard action\" to ensure schools did not open, while the then-education secretary was battling to keep children in school. <br/>During a meeting on Zoom on 28 December 2020 to decide on the fate of students, Mr Hancock and his special adviser Emma Dean appeared to send each other messages commenting on the call, according to the Telegraph. <br/>Ms Dean said: He's [Sir Gavin] freaking out. You can tell he isn't being wholly rational.\"<br/>Mr Hancock got his way as schools closed days later amid a national lockdown.<br/>In an earlier exchange in September the pair took aim at Sir Gavin following the education secretary being forced to abandon A-level and GCSE students being given grades by algorithm. <br/>Replying to Ms Dean's suggestion Gavin looked awful and questioning if the education secretary was OK, Mr Hancock said: \"He needs a haircut and a holiday somewhere other than Scarborough!\"<br/>During the May 2020 drive to hit the 100,000 tests per day target, trucks full were bought from Amazon.<br/>Mr Hancock was worried the government could look \"flaky\" if it was accused of using them to pad the stats.<br/>But there was jubilation when the target was hit - not least from Gina Coladangelo, the aide with whom Mr Hancock had an affair.<br/>She messaged: \"Drinks cold in fridge at [Department for Health]. Feel free to open them before we are back [beer emoji]\".<br/>But problems continued. Mr Johnson admitted in June he was \"going quietly crackers\" over capacity, asking \"what is wrong with us as a country that we can't fix this?\".<br/>In September, Mr Hancock was advised to avoid an interview with Andrew Neil \"because he could go hard on testing\".<br/>One set of messages shows Boris Johnson getting in a muddle over statistics.<br/>He flagged a Financial Times article stating the global case fatality rate had fallen below 0.04. Mr Johnson wanted to know why the British death rate appeared to be much higher at 4%.<br/>Chief scientific officer Sir Patrick, chief medical officer Sir Chris, aide Dominic Cummings, Cabinet Secretary Simon Case and Mr Hancock all chipped in.<br/>When Mr Vallance eventually pointed out the FT figure is a probability, not a percentage, the PM replied \"Eh\" followed by another message reading simply \"?\".<br/>He offers \"five marks\" to whoever can explain the difference and asks them to \"show working\" - before Mr Cummings assures him it is a \"common confusion\".<br/>In the same exchange, Mr Johnson says he \"knows what I would prefer\" if he was 80 and given a choice between exposure to Covid-19 and \"destroying the economy\".<br/>A collection of more than 100,000 messages sent between former Health Secretary Matt Hancock and other ministers and officials at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic have been obtained by the Telegraph.

The Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) has been studying coronaviruses in bats for over a decade.<br/>The institute is a 40-minute drive from the Huanan wet market where the first cluster of infections emerged.<br/>Those who entertain the theory say it could have leaked from a WIV lab and spread to the wet market. Most argue it would have been an unaltered virus collected from the wild, rather than engineered.<br/>The controversial theory first emerged early on in the pandemic, and was promoted by then-US President Donald Trump. Some even suggested it could have been engineered as a possible biological weapon.<br/>While many in the media and politics dismissed these as conspiracy theories at the time, others called for more consideration of the possibility. The idea has persisted, despite many scientists pointing out there is no evidence to back it up.<br/>A classified US intelligence report - saying three researchers at the Wuhan laboratory were treated in hospital in November 2019, just before the virus began infecting humans in the city - began circulating in US media in 2021.  <br/>But it was reported the Biden administration had shut down a state department investigation, set up by President Trump, into the lab-leak theory.<br/>\"That possibility certainly exists, and I am totally in favour of a full investigation of whether that could have happened,\" Anthony Fauci, President Biden's chief medical adviser, told a US Senate committee hearing in May 2021.<br/>President Biden says he asked for a report on the origins of Covid-19 after taking office in 2021, \"including whether it emerged from human contact with an infected animal or from a laboratory accident\".<br/>In May 2021, Mr Biden ordered intelligence officials to \"redouble\" their efforts on this.<br/>The issue is still hotly contested.<br/>A World Health Organization (WHO) investigation was supposed to get to the bottom of it, but many experts believed it produced more questions than answers.<br/>A team of WHO-appointed scientists flew to Wuhan in early 2021 on a mission to investigate the source of the pandemic. After spending 12 days there, which included a visit to the laboratory, the team concluded the lab-leak theory was \"extremely unlikely\".<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Dr Peter Daszak: \"Our focus needs to shift to those supply chains to the (Huanan Seafood) Market\"<br/>But many have since questioned their findings. <br/>A prominent group of scientists criticised the WHO report for not taking the lab-leak theory seriously enough - it was dismissed in a few pages of a several-hundred-page report.<br/>\"We must take hypotheses about both natural and laboratory spillovers seriously until we have sufficient data,\" the scientists wrote in Science Magazine.<br/>They're not the only experts who called for the laboratory leak to be looked at more closely.<br/>Even the WHO's own director-general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, called for a new investigation, saying: \"All hypotheses remain open and require further study.\"<br/>And Dr Fauci said in 2021 he was \"not convinced\" the virus originated naturally. That was a shift from a year earlier, when he thought it most likely Covid had spread from animals to humans.<br/>China has hit back at suggestions the virus may have escaped from a laboratory by calling it a smear. State media have consistently accused the US government and Western media of spreading rumours about the source of the pandemic.<br/>Responding to Mr Wray's remarks, China's foreign ministry spokesperson accused US intelligence agencies of politicising the investigation into the origins of the virus.<br/>The US intelligence community had a history of \"misdeeds\" involving \"fraud and deception\", Mao Ning told a press briefing. As such, she said, their conclusions regarding the origins of Covid-19 had no credibility.<br/>China has pushed another theory, suggesting the coronavirus may have entered Wuhan in food shipments of frozen meat from elsewhere in China or South-East Asia. <br/>The Chinese government has also pointed to research published by one of its leading virologists into samples collected from bats in a remote, abandoned mine. <br/>Prof Shi Zhengli - often referred to as \"China's Batwoman\" - a researcher at the Wuhan Institute, published a report in 2021 revealing that her team had identified eight coronavirus strains found on bats in the mine in China in 2015. The paper says that coronaviruses from pangolins pose more of an immediate threat to human health than the ones her team found in the mine.<br/>Added to this is an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory long pushed by Chinese propagandists - and repeated by Mao Ning at the foreign ministry briefing on 1 March 2023 - suggesting  the coronavirus was made and leaked from Fort Detrick in Frederick, Maryland, about 80km (50 miles) north of Washington DC.<br/>Once the centre of the US biological weapons programme, Fort Detrick currently houses biomedical labs researching viruses including Ebola and smallpox.<br/>Yes, and it's called the \"natural origin\" theory.<br/>This argues the virus spread naturally from animals, without the involvement of any scientists or laboratories.<br/>Supporters of the natural origin hypothesis say Covid-19 emerged in bats and then jumped to humans, most likely through another animal, or \"intermediary host\".<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Covid-19 and Wuhan: Why don't we know more?<br/>That idea was backed by the WHO report, which said it was \"likely to very likely\" that Covid had made it to humans through an intermediate host.<br/>This hypothesis was widely accepted at the start of the pandemic, but as time has worn on, scientists have not found a virus in either bats or another animal that matches the genetic make-up of Covid-19, leading some to doubt the theory.<br/>Nevertheless, following FBI Director Wray's remarks, many scientists who have studied the virus have stressed there is no new scientific evidence pointing to a lab leak.<br/>A natural origin is still the more likely theory, said Professor David Robertson, head of viral genomics and bioinformatics at the University of Glasgow.<br/>\"There's been an accumulation of evidence (what we know about the viruses biology, the close variants circulating in bats and locations of early human cases) that firmly points to a natural origin centred on the Huanan market in Wuhan city,\" he said.<br/>Prof Alice Hughes from the University of Hong Kong agreed. She said the US Department of Energy's conclusion that the virus was most likely the result of a lab leak in Wuhan \"appears not to be based on new evidence, and remains the weaker of the two main hypothesis of the origin of the virus\". <br/>Given the massive human toll of the pandemic - with the recorded deaths of about 6.9 million people worldwide - most scientists think understanding how and where the virus originated is crucial to prevent it happening again.<br/>If the \"zoonotic\" theory is proved correct, it could affect activities such as farming and wildlife exploitation. In Denmark, fears about the spread of the virus through mink farming led to millions of mink being culled.<br/>But there would also be big implications for scientific research and international trade if theories related to a laboratory leak or frozen food chains were confirmed. <br/>Any confirmation of a leak may also affect how the world views China, which has already been accused of hiding crucial early information about the pandemic, and place further strain on US-China relations.<br/>\"From day one China has been engaged in a massive cover-up,\" Jamie Metzl, a fellow at the Washington-based Atlantic Council who has been pushing for the lab-leak theory to be looked into, told the BBC in 2021<br/>\"We should be demanding the full investigation of all origin hypotheses that's required.\"<br/>But others have cautioned against pointing the finger at China too quickly.<br/>\"We do need to be a bit patient but we also need to be diplomatic. We can't do this without support from China. It needs to be a no-blame environment,\" Prof Dale Fisher, of Singapore's National University Hospital, told the BBC.<br/>China hits back as US revisits Covid lab theory<br/>Covid lab leak in China 'extremely unlikely' - WHO<br/>Wuhan scientist 'welcomes' visit over lab leak claim<br/>Outrage after women paraded naked by mob in India<br/>N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier<br/>Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships<br/>A visual guide to the Women's World Cup<br/>Singapore rocked by rare political scandals<br/>Spain's snap election revives issue of national unity<br/>Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?<br/>Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack<br/>Bounty hunting and cheat chasing - the battle for Kenya\u2019s conscience<br/>The Australian climate protesters cast as extremists<br/>Artist's work copied by AI more times than Picasso<br/>What is killing rare cheetahs in India?<br/>Why syphilis is rising around the world<br/>Sport's strictest dress code finally relents<br/>A long-lost city found in the Americas<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

That figure is three times higher than officially recorded deaths from the disease.<br/>Separate analysis by the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates about 15 million excess deaths due to coronavirus over a similar period.<br/>Nearly every nation in the world is now administering vaccines and publishing rollout data, while at least 157 countries and territories have moved on to booster jabs. <br/>The map below, using figures collated by Our World in Data - a collaboration between Oxford University and an educational charity - shows the total number of doses given per 100 people, mostly first doses.<br/>According to that data, more than 64% of people have been fully vaccinated on every continent apart from Africa, where the figure is about 20%.<br/>\n                        Percent of people fully vaccinated\n                    <br/>\n                            Please upgrade your browser to see the full interactive\n                        <br/>\n                    This information is regularly updated but may not reflect the latest totals or vaccines administered for each location. Total doses may include booster doses in addition to those required for full vaccination. The definition of full vaccination varies by location and vaccine type and is subject to change over time. Full vaccination can refer to a person receiving all required doses of a specific vaccine or sometimes recovery from infection plus one dose of a vaccine. Definitions have not yet been updated to account for booster campaigns to control the spread of new variants. Some locations may reach vaccination rates over 100%, such as Gibraltar, due to population estimates that are lower than the number of people who have now been vaccinated in that place. \n                <br/>\n                    Source: Our World in Data\n                <br/>\n                    Last updated: 5 July 2022, 13:28 BST\n                <br/>Some countries have secured more vaccine doses than their populations need, while other lower-income countries are relying on a global plan known as Covax, which is seeking to ensure everyone in the world has access to a vaccine. <br/>Of those countries that have moved on to booster campaigns, Chile, Uruguay and Singapore have currently vaccinated the highest proportion of people. <br/>Daily global cases fell after a spike in the spring but are now rising again, with the emergence of the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants of the Omicron variant.<br/>Studies suggest that Omicron - which quickly became dominant in numerous countries - is milder than the Delta variant, but far more contagious. The subvariants are even more contagious. <br/>Asia<br/>Asia, which was the centre of the initial outbreak that spread from Wuhan in China in early 2020, shows a mixed picture.<br/>North Korea, which admitted its first Covid infections in May of this year, has now seen 4.75 million symptomatic \"fever cases\" according to the state news agency. <br/>China appears to have recovered from a recent spike which earlier saw thousands of cases reported each day and millions of people placed under lockdown in large cities such as Shanghai. However, a fresh outbreak appears to be under way in eastern Anhui Province.<br/>In Japan, after two years of closure the government reopened its borders to visitors from 98 countries and regions but with strict limitations. <br/>It marked the most significant moment so far in the country's slow relaxation of its Covid-19 entry restrictions.<br/>Europe<br/>Reported daily cases are rising in several European countries, due to the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants. Testing is also now more limited than at previous points in the pandemic.<br/>In the UK, the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show a 32% jump in infections last week. Hospitalisations are also increasing. <br/>North America<br/>The US has recorded 87 million cases and more than a million deaths - the highest figures in the world. <br/>However, daily cases and death counts have now fallen to lower levels than during much of the pandemic. <br/>Latin America<br/>Latin America is seeing some pockets of rising cases, though infections are at low levels among the countries which were hardest hit previously.<br/>Mexico and Guatemala are among countries seeing a rise in June.<br/>Brazil has been the worst-hit country in the region overall, recording more than 32 million cases and 672,000 deaths - the world's second-highest official death toll. <br/>In Peru, there have been over 213,000 deaths and the country has the world's highest number of deaths by population size - more than 657 deaths for every 100,000 people.<br/>Africa<br/>Africa has seen more than 12 million cases and 255,000 deaths - but the true extent of the pandemic across the continent is not known as testing rates are low.<br/>According to the official figures, South Africa has been the worst-hit country with more than 4 million confirmed cases and more than 100,000 deaths. <br/>South Africa was the first country to identify the new Omicron variant and it led to a sharp increase in infections - the fourth wave of infections in the country.<br/>Middle East<br/>Several countries in the Middle East have seen severe outbreaks of the virus since the pandemic began, though levels are currently at their lowest this year.<br/>The official death toll in Iran, the region's worst-hit country, is more than 140,000 and it has seen over seven million confirmed cases. <br/>Neighbouring Iraq has seen 25,000 deaths and in excess of two million confirmed cases.<br/>In January Israel was hit by the Omicron wave seen across the world, but infections have now come down. Its vaccination rollout has been highly successful at minimising the number of hospitalisations and deaths in the country. <br/>Oceania<br/>Early in the pandemic, Australia and New Zealand were widely praised for their response to Covid but both saw an increase in cases at the start of the year. <br/>So far, Australia has seen more than 8 million confirmed cases, with spikes in January and April. It has also recorded more than 10,000 confirmed deaths due to coronavirus.<br/>Daily cases are rising in New Zealand following a fall. So far it recorded 1.3 million cases, but only 1,535 deaths.<br/>In early May the country opened its borders to international visitors for the first time in two years.<br/>Covid-19 was first detected in the city of Wuhan, China, in late 2019 but the outbreak spread quickly across the globe in the first months of 2020.<br/>It was declared a global pandemic by the WHO on 11 March 2020.<br/>A pandemic is when an infectious disease is passing easily from person to person in many parts of the world at the same time. <br/>The data used on this page comes from a variety of sources. It includes figures collated by Johns Hopkins University as well as national governments and health agencies.<br/>When comparing figures from different countries it is important to bear in mind that not all governments are recording coronavirus cases and deaths in the same way. This makes like for like comparisons between countries difficult.<br/>Other factors to consider include: different population sizes, the size of a country's elderly population or whether a particular country has a large amount of its people living in densely-populated areas. In addition, countries may be in different stages of the pandemic.<br/>The map, table and animated bar chart in this page use a different source for the UK from that used by Johns Hopkins University.

The new genetic versions that keep appearing are called variants. <br/>There have been a few major variants already, such as alpha and delta, that have caused massive waves of infection. <br/>The latest ones experts are concerned about - BA.4 and BA.5 - are very closely related to the Omicron variant behind last winter's wave.<br/>They were added to the World Health Organization's monitoring list in March and have also been designated as variants of concern in Europe.<br/>They were spotted circulating in South Africa at the beginning of the year and now appear to be spreading much more quickly than other variants.<br/>Most European countries now have them and they look set to overtake other types of Covid soon. That's already happened in Portugal - BA.5 is now dominant there. <br/>In the US, officials say they are seeing rising numbers of infections caused by the two new subvariants. <br/>Covid infections in the UK are also increasing, driven by BA.4 and BA.5. <br/>Australia has reported cases too.<br/>Experts are unsure how hard countries will be hit.<br/>BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron are not thought to be any more lethal than other types of Covid. <br/>Lots of people have built up some immunity from past infections and vaccination, which is helping to make the disease less risky overall.<br/>But the new subvariants do appear to be spreading more easily.<br/>This is partly because immunity may be waning, but also because of the mutations the virus has undergone. <br/>Many countries have also lifted their Covid restrictions, meaning people are mixing more, which gives the virus more chances to spread.<br/>BA.4 and BA.5 appear to be able to infect people even if they've recently had other types of Omicron. <br/>A wave of new infections could lead to more hospitalisations and some more deaths.<br/>As with other Covid variants, the risk or serious illness remains highest for people who are elderly, or who have significant underlying health conditions. <br/>Although current vaccines are not a perfect fit, they are still the best line of defence. <br/>They have cut the risk of severe illness against the other major Covid variants, including Delta, Alpha, Beta and Gamma. <br/>Doctors say it is vital people get the recommended number of doses to gain maximum protection against existing and emerging variants. <br/>Updated versions of vaccines against Covid variants are already being designed and tested.<br/>Manufacturers could scale up production quickly too, and regulators have already discussed how to fast-track the approval process. <br/>Viruses make carbon copies of themselves to reproduce, but they aren't perfect at it.
