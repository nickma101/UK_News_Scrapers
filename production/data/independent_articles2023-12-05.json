For example, former multi-weight world champion Mayweather retired unbeaten in 2017 with a professional record of 50-0, and he has since fought in five exhibitions.

The build-up to what should be a grand staging of a historic football rivalry has instead been dominated by what England, who are the nominated nation when it comes to Olympics qualification, require at Hampden and whether Scotland will help or hinder the 'Auld Enemy', as well as themselves."}, {"type": "text", "text": "It is a farcical situation, one that does no favours to Scotland ahead of what is perhaps their biggest-ever home fixture against their neighbours, a dilemma everyone saw coming when England and Scotland were placed into the same group of a tournament that directly leads to Olympics qualification. As the nominated nation, it is only England's results that count towards securing a place at Paris next summer, only the Lionesses who can qualify on behalf of Team GB by reaching the Nations League final. With Scotland playing England twice in Group A1, there has been a clear conflict of interest - one that has been sharpened given what is now on the line."}, {"type": "text", "text": "England kept Team GB's hopes alive on Friday night with their dramatic second-half comeback against the Netherlands at Wembley, yet they now require a different type of win. Coming into the final round level on points with the Netherlands but with an inferior goal difference, England must win by three goals more than the Dutch, should they also defeat Belgium. Sarina Wiegman has prepared the Lionesses to attack Scotland from the start and, given England hit 80 goals in 10 games while qualifying for the last World Cup, they are no strangers to racking up a scoreline."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Such a result would be met with scepticism in the Netherlands and Belgium, however. For the Scotland players with Olympics ambitions, their best hope of going to Paris next summer will now be by losing heavily to the Lionesses. 'It's strange,' queried the Netherlands manager Andries Jonker, whose team would miss out should England beat the Dutch to top spot in Group A1. The Netherlands need to win, too, against Belgium, but they are now at the mercy of Scottish professionalism, or, at the very least, whether a centuries-old desire to deny England at all cost remains as strong."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Wiegman, who will take charge of Team GB should they qualify, was unequivocal as she insisted Scotland would be taking the game seriously. For Scotland, the chance to beat England cannot be dismissed, particularly at Hampden. This is meant to be a rivalry and the tireless energy and fight of Chelsea midfielder Erin Cuthbert, who has more at stake than anyone in the team given she would go to Paris with Team GB, is likely to set an example that her teammates will have to follow. But if it seems disrespectful to even suggest that Scotland would roll over for England, they have not been helped by the decision to tie Olympics qualification to the inaugural season of the Women's Nations League. Allowing two parts of Team GB to be placed in the same group is a further mistake that will need to be rectified in future years."}, {"type": "text", "text": "After all, if there is an argument that certain Lionesses could benefit by not having another major tournament in 2024 - there are eight players who have played in three successive tournaments, at the 2021 Olympics, 2022 Euros and 2023 World Cup - the same cannot be said for Scotland. The Olympics tournament, which in women's football retains significant prestige, represents an opportunity for those Scottish players who did not qualify for the previous World Cup or European Championships."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Or maybe not. If Scotland want to add fuel to the fire, many would point to the fact that at the previous Games 19 of the 22 players selected for Team GB were English; Scotland only had two players selected by Hege Riise for Tokyo, the co-captain Kim Little, who has since retired from international duty, and Caroline Weir, who is out due to a season-ending ACL injury.Should Team GB qualify, the majority of Wiegman's squad would likely be made up of those she already knows from the Lionesses. It raises the question over how 'GB' Team GB would actually be."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Such long-standing tensions over national identity obviously frame the football rivalry staged in Glasgow, as Scotland build towards their big Hampden night. It is unfortunate, perhaps, that the visit of the European champions and World Cup finalists comes on what is set to be a freezing December evening - the temperature is unlikely to help ticket sales and while the Lionesses played in front of over 70,000 on Friday, the crowd at Hampden will show that Scotland remain a few years behind England when it comes to the growth of women's football. "}, {"type": "text", "text": "Scotland are feeling the effects of England's progress, however, following the transformational impact of the Lionesses not only hosting but winning the Euros on home soil. Attendances in Scotland's top-flight, which remains semi-professional, are rising but are still some way off those set in the Women's Super League. But for Scotland, beating the Lionesses could be the moment that they deliver their own inspirational night. The twist in the tail is that, with Olympics qualification on the line, it would come at a cost to not just England.

Since its release in 2013, the crime-and-car-theft game has sold nearly 200 million copies worldwide. Critical acclaim has been just as fulsome: the game's vast, explorable open world was hailed as a high point for video game design. But the feverish wait for a sequel has stretched to over a decade. With GTA VI only now finally unveiled by game studio Rockstar via a stunning trailer, we can expect months upon months of manic anticipation, from advertisers and fans alike."}, {"type": "text", "text": "For all GTA's shiny accolades, though, controversy has always tailed the franchise like a smut-seeking missile. The original GTA weathered claims that its low-resolution criminal violence would corrupt impressionable youths (an outrage that was in fact masterminded by publicist and child sex offender Max Clifford in a successful effort to drum up sales). Whether it was racial conflict (GTA: Vice City), explicit sex (GTA: San Andreas), or torture and drunk driving (GTA IV), each subsequent release seemed to usher in a new wave of opprobrium. To be clear: much of the backlash surrounding GTA has been tantamount to moral panic. Studies have refuted the idea that playing violent video games has any correlation with violent or antisocial behaviour. But that doesn't mean the franchise, and players, shouldn't take a long, hard look at themselves before the release of GTA VI."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Part of the appeal of GTA - the core selling point, in fact - is the idea of freedom. Yes, there is a long and involved storyline, but the game's fundamental hook lies in the ability to navigate the city at your own whims. Fancy speeding over a cliff? Sure. Stealing a car? Go for it. Getting in a shootout with police? Fill your law-flouting boots. The problem is, the possibilities do not end there. Some other things your character can do on GTA V, at the player's own volition: proposition and murder a sex worker; attempt to access a website for child pornography (and get caught in a police sting); carry out a mass shooting."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Now, this might not mean anything. It's not an endorsement of real-life violence; cherubic teenagers aren't being turned onto a life of crime because of it. But the fact that the game can be used in this way obviously raises contravenes the boundaries of sensitivity and good taste."}, {"type": "text", "text": "GTA has always fancied itself as a satire - a kind of wonky mirror warping the sexism, violence and capitalist excess of contemporary US culture into crude, cartoonish extremity. It is a satire - just not a very incisive one. And because this is a game that places you in the shoes of a gun-toting, murderous criminal, the lampoon never truly shakes off the ring of affirmation. It's a matter of having one's cake and eating it - or in this instance, having one's cake and violently terrorising the erotic dancer who was concealed inside. If the franchise is to truly evolve with GTA 6, the satire has to show some keener insight, and seek to do more than just scandalise and hyperbolise."}, {"type": "text", "text": "If we are to scrutinise GTA as a work of art - entertainment first and foremost, but art nonetheless - then the ethics of allowing players to simulate depraved behaviours can't be dismissed out of hand. It's part of the text. If, while watching The Godfather, you were always given the option to insert a bonus scene in which Michael Corleone walks into a McDonalds and starts hurling machetes at service staff, it's fair to say that the film's reputation would be somewhat different. Just because GTA does not reward or necessitate evil actions does not mean that it should escape scrutiny for allowing players to participate in it. GTA has always danced around in the very coarsest recesses of the human psyche.

Like Augustus Gloop, fatness is equated with gluttony for the purpose of a creaky, unfunny punchline. Hugh Grant doing a little song and dance fared very well for Paddington 2, and here he has the bonus of being daubed in orange for the role of an Oompa-Loompa. But the characters bring with them all the same problems: the conflicted feelings within the dwarfism community and its colonialist implications, which the film only partially smoothes over with a retrofitted backstory.

And maybe even his. The trick is to look beyond the word 'funeral' and just insist that when there's been a death, people should come together in any setting or context. I think this happens more than we think."}, {"type": "text", "text": "A number of people might be celebrating the slow death of the funeral, given how insanely expensive they have become. Despite talk of government action in the sector, such as mandating funeral directors to display a set price menu, the cost of dying has in fact gone up in recent years - by 3.8 per cent since 2021. End-of-life legal service FreeWill found that four in 10 people go into debt when contributing to the funeral of a significant friend or relative. The average cost of what's seen as a 'traditional' funeral - burial, memorial, wake, flowers, catering and other fees - currently stands at GBP 9,200.

It's as though they have a stranglehold on mortality the way the mafia used to have a stranglehold on Las Vegas. We forget how much has changed. Take the quietly radical sight of a pop star (Elton John) singing a pop song ('Candle in the Wind') at a funeral for a royal (Princess Diana) in 1997. Twenty years on, funerals can be bent to the will of the bereaved much further, especially in terms of music.

I think the same thing has been slowly happening in death, too. The wake - very much the 'all back to mine' part of modern mourning, given its synonymy with boozing, sandwiches and more boozing - is becoming the epicentre of how most of us communally grieve. It's where we process death in the exclusive company of those who loved the deceased and draw from that an ability to contextualise their death. The wake, as well as the increasingly common concept of holding what are known as 'celebrations of life', have become two very popular ways to mark someone's passing in an upbeat manner, away from the perceived gloom of death and funerals."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Another trend that threatens to grow in the next few years is 'grief tech': where a full suite of AI tools analyses a deceased person's audio, visual and written archive to create, say, a robo-mum who might video message you every week from beyond the grave and continue to shred your self-esteem like a samurai using a cheese grater. The fact that William Shatner is a poster boy for such tech (he's taping hours of himself against green screen for the company StoryFile) makes this all seem reassuringly doomed to fail, but perhaps the broader question is why are we so keen to evade death at all - either in the extremes of AI immortality or, more commonly, in eschewing the concept of the funeral because it's, you know, a bit 'deathy'."}, {"type": "text", "text": "This is where I have a rare pang of sympathy for organised religion. Christianity, for example, dictates that a funeral is downbeat and solemn because, as well as being a celebration, they are also slightly urgent opportunities to pray for the eternal salvation of the deceased. Or, in the words of the Theos report, 'many of us experience bereavement without direct exposure to death'. I once heard a clergyman make the excellently catty remark on the radio that a non-religious funeral was akin to 'an office leaving party'."}, {"type": "text", "text": "But what I think this attitude misses is that while a wake may superficially appear to be upbeat and convivial compared to a formal funeral, millimetres below the surface everyone present is experiencing an oceanically deep consideration of death.

Instead of interacting with a god or a deity, interacting with strangers about the loss you're feeling is as moving a moment as they come.
