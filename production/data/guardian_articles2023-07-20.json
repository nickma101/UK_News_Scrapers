They are trying to bring this back, and spice up the second half of the stage. The gap falls to 37sec. (I know, it\u2019s Lotto-Dstny, not Lotto-Density.) 82km to go: The gap is falling! The break is on the second climb of the route, a cat-four at C\u00f4te de Boissieu. The gap is down to 43sec. Maybe it will go out again after the climb? We shall see. A road sign pointing to Turin! I was there in March. Underrated city. Try the farinata. The Lac du Bourget. 86km to go: Steve Cummings, in the Ineos Grenadiers car, has just given Adam Blythe, on the Eurosport motorbike, an ice cream. The gap 54sec. Here\u2019s a Cummings Tour de France win from the archive: 87km to go: Impey has some interesting thoughts on Thomas de Gendt, the Belgian breakaway specialist. He says riders in the peloton wondered how he always managed to stay away in breakaways, but that things changed when he revealed his secrets. He doesn\u2019t actually explain what those secrets were \u2026 The gap continues to hover at around 1min. 88km to go: These stages are all part of the Tour de France\u2019s rich tapestry, if you ask me. They simply can\u2019t be flat-out all day, every day. From a British perspective, there would be a lot more intrigue if Mark Cavendish was still in the game, and he was still aiming for the record. 89km to go: The gap between today\u2019s three-man break and peloton is 58sec. 91km to go: Carlton Kirby has had his lunch, and is back on the Eurosport microphone. Daryl Impey reminisces on his two days in the yellow jersey, 10 years ago: \u201cTo be able to have done that in my career, it\u2019s amazing,\u201d he says. \u201cEvery time I\u2019ve gone back to the Tour, I thought, how was I able to do that? I didn\u2019t sleep in the jersey, but I definitely had it close to my bed.\u201d 93km to go: Nothing is happening. Well, not in terms of the race situation. And that suits so many riders and teams just fine. The finish today will be flat-out, and no doubt it\u2019ll be exciting, but for now it is all the same. The three-man break continues to work up front. Asgreen has a drink. Abrahamsen takes a bottle from his team car, that pulls up alongside. Actually, the gap falls to 52sec. 96km to go: I was going to mention earlier that there are clearly issues with the current anti-doping regime. While I should stress that this is not intended as a reflection on any particular rider or team, here is James, on email, with some of the ongoing concerns: \u201cSome of the issues with the bio passport are as follows. \u201cDo they take measurements often enough? I mean, do they send sample collecters to a remote hotel on Mount Teide in Tenerife? And if they do, would the riders be warned in advance by \u2018spotters\u2019 at the airport and could they mask the skewed values in some way? Let\u2019s also not forget that riders can miss two surprise tests without facing sanction. \u201cWhy were some athletes that we now know were doping not flagged by the Biopassport? (In a similar vein (ha!) to plenty of riders that we know were doped to the gills never failing a \u2018traditional\u2019 test. \u201cWhy were some riders reinstated after appeals by their national federations to the UCI / WADA, despite the latter being satisfied of their guilt? \u201cHow faithfully is this enforced? I mean, the independent expert that the UCI used to assess profiles resigned in protest when the UCI refused to sanction \u2018a certain Texan\u2019 for suspicious values. Can we be confident they would take action if a lucrative star rider had strange values? The sport has never been more vulnerable to scandal. A top rider testing positive now would do incredible damage to what has become a global industry worth billions. \u201cHow well does it work for riders who might have illnesses of use medications that affect their blood measurements? Are there riders who are effectively impossible to monitor?\u201d Coffee-clutching, bleary-eyed Australian sports fans are embracing the immortal words of Jon Bon Jovi this month: \u201cYou can sleep when you\u2019re dead.\u201d That\u2019s because July is delivering an RSL-sized sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord of northern hemisphere sport. While the Women\u2019s World Cup may be time zone-friendly for Australians for the first time ever, there\u2019s still men\u2019s and women\u2019s cricket, including the remaining Ashes series; the Open Championship in the United Kingdom and Tour de France and Le Tour Femmes in western Europe; and Formula One, where Australian Daniel Ricciardo is back behind the wheel. And it\u2019s all happening past most people\u2019s bed times, prompting many to choose between sleep and sporting stimulation. 101km to go: Asgreen is the Denmark\u2019s current individual time trial champion. FACT. He won it last month, in Aalborg. Do we have any readers in Aalborg? Get in touch by email or Twitter Meanwhile, here are Lotto Dstny, celebrating having a rider in the break. \u201cWho else,\u201d indeed. 105km to go: Notably, the temperature stated on the Tour de France website for the front of the race is 29.9C. Unusual to see something that\u2019s not in the 30s, these days. (Of course, as you know, the actual temperature on the road will be more than that.) 107km: I told you Moeen Ali was good enough to bat at No 3 for England, didn\u2019t I?* *I didn\u2019t 108km to go: Alpecin-Deceuninck lead the way at the front of the peloton. The gap, still, refuses to budge from around one minute. 111km to go: I should have told you that Abrahamsen \u201cwon\u201d the categorised climb at C\u00f4te de Chamb\u00e9ry-le-Haut. Not that it really matters. 113km to go: Not an awful lot happening, in truth. The gap is just over a minute. The three breakaway riders \u2013 Kasper Asgreen (Soudal\u2013Quick-Step), Jonas Abrahamsen (Uno-X Pro Cycling Team) and Victor Campanaerts (Lotto\u2013Dstny) \u2013 continue to work hard up front. There are some lovely TV pictures from the helicopter. Which is something. 118km to go: \u201cI heard a take the other day that if riders were doping, it would happen months ago during training,\u201d emails Tyler. \u201cNo longer are the days of blood bags in team cars. So makes you wonder whether the testing after races is just a mild inconvenience to the dehydrated riders after races.\u201d Sure, but that in theory is where the blood passport comes in. Tracking an athlete\u2019s blood values consistently over a long period of time, rather than just at races, should show if there has been anything untoward away from competition. But again, that is in theory. The scandal surrounding a certain British team showed that up until relatively recently, injecting Kenacort (Triamcinolone) out of competition was permitted under anti-doping regulations. Which was madness, in hindsight, considering its potency as a performance enhancer. 119km to go: Mathieu Van der Poel had a chat with Eurosport before the stage: \u201cI think for us it\u2019s difficult to predict \u2026 our biggest chance is to win today with Jasper. Tomorrow will be even more for a breakaway \u2026 but I hope the guys [peloton] will feel the stage from yesterday. We will see. \u201cHe [Philipsen] is tired as well. But everybody is. I was really suffering yesterday on the last climb \u2026 but he\u2019s a typical sprinter. He\u2019ll feel good again towards the end [of the stage].\u201d 122km to go: Daryl Impey, a former yellow jersey wearer, is guesting on commentary for Eurosport and he says there are plenty in the peloton are desperate for an easy (or easier) day and that is determining the shape of the race. Hard to argue. \u201cEverybody in this peloton is thinking about Paris,\u201d he adds. 123km to go: Some welcome shade for the riders on this first climb. A tree-lined road winds its way up the C\u00f4te de Chamb\u00e9ry-le-Haut. 125km to go: \u201cLike all cycling fans I have been digesting the past two stages,\u201d emails Barry. \u201cThe domination of Jonas Vingegaard was so complete it has thrown up suspicions. Looking at the comments on the Guardian and elsewhere shows people wondering the same thing \u2026 Unfortunately the past scandals mean whoever is in yellow gets this, of course \u2026 \u201cSo I guess my question is \u2013 will cycling ever get away from its dodgy past?\u201d I think the answer is no, it will never completely escape the past \u2013 but an amount of scepticism is surely both healthy and understandable in view of the history. Vingegaard is being tested left, right and centre and clearly there is no problem there. The cynicism is a shame, in one sense, but I would be more worried if no one was asking the question. 127km to go: The gap is down to exactly one minute, yet again. 128km to go: The first categorised climb of the day, at C\u00f4te de Chamb\u00e9ry-le-Haut, is coming up after another 6km of racing. Jonas Vingegaard had a chat with Eurosport before the stage start and is asked if this is the form of his life: \u201cI would say I\u2019ve never been better in my life. Obviously, I\u2019m super-happy about it.\u201d Of his preparation, he says: \u201cIt all starts in the early months \u2026 there you have to be \u2026 don\u2019t have weeks when you cannot train. I had a really good winter. No injuries or sickness. You come to the first altitude camp in May, already in good shape, then you start building towards the Tour.\u201d And finally a word for Tadej Pogacar: \u201cI have a lot of respect for Tadej \u2026 in my opinion he\u2019s the best rider in the world \u2026 I only have good things to say about Tadej, he\u2019s a really nice person as well.\u201d 133km to go: Just looking at the \u201cfinal\u201d, as cycling people call it. When the race hits Bourg-en-Bresse and approached the finish, there is a sharp left-hander, then a sweeping right-hander, and there is a little uphill kick to the finish. 135km to go: The gap is 1min 11sec. Here\u2019s a screenshot of the gentlemen at roadside, thanks to a screenshot by Felix Lowe on Twitter: 138km to go: Team DSM, Alpecin-Deceuninck and Jayco-AlUla are the teams visible at the front of the race, working to control the gap to the break. I think it\u2019s entirely possible that we see this race come back together sooner than expected. On Eurosport, we hear one of the Ineos Grenadiers sports directors on the radio, reminding their riders to keep hydrated, because it\u2019s hot. Not exactly fascinating insight, it must be said, but in fairness the team radio idea is in credit after yesterday and the Pogacar drama. 140km to go: The gap is holding at around a minute. As I type, it\u2019s 1min 06sec. At the Women\u2019s World Cup, hosts Australia have just beaten Ireland 1-0: Elsewhere, England are trying to Bazball the hell out of Australia at Old Trafford: Golf is occurring on the first day of the Open at Royal Liverpool: County cricket is occurring at various locations around the UK: 147km to go: Jonas Vingegaard, who leads the overall race by seven and a half minutes, has a chat with his compatriot, Mads Pedersen. Pedersen won stage eight, thanks to a fantastically powerful, long sprint finish, that was overshadowed by Mark Cavendish\u2019s traumatic exit from the race: 149km to go: Indeed, it looks like the breakaway riders are taking it relatively easy up front, knowing that the peloton have no interest in catching them. Dan Lloyd, one of the Eurosport commentators, describes Asgreen and Campanaerts as \u201cabsolute machines\u201d, in terms of their power, which is right. 150km to go: William Fotheringham, in our pre-race preview, wrote this of today\u2019s stage, which is spot on: \u201cA long flat run out of the Alps offers respite after the mountains. On paper this is a bunch sprint, but that depends on which sprinters have survived and what state their teammates are in. Last year the Belgian Jasper Philipsen was the pick of the sprinters in the second half of the Tour; if he and his teammate Van der Poel are in form, look no further.\u201d (I always find it interesting to read the pre-race previews in the final week \u2026 often interesting historical documents.) 152km to go: What appears to be a real-life French Dad\u2019s Army is pictured at the roadside applauding the riders past. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how active they are \u2026 but we salute them anyway,\u201d quips Kirby. The gap is exactly 1min. 154km to go: The average speed thus far today is 44.5 km/h, which is obviously crazily fast for mere mortals, but comfortable for these highly trained athletes riding in a bunch. The three breakaway riders \u2013 Kasper Asgreen (Soudal\u2013Quick-Step), Jonas Abrahamsen (Uno-X Pro Cycling Team) and Victor Campanaerts (Lotto\u2013Dstny) \u2013 will obviously be toiling a lot harder than the riders back in the bunch. Again, it\u2019s worth remembering how fiendishly hard yesterday\u2019s stage was, if anyone is disappointed at the lack of action so far today. It\u2019s hardly surprising that we are seeing a ceasefire, for want of a better word. 158km to go: Maybe the riders up front have eased up a bit, secretly hoping the peloton will catch them? I don\u2019t know, but we have to find a bit of intrigue from somewhere. 159km to go: Now, Eurosport\u2019s Kirby reckons that Adam Blythe has \u201cironed his sunglasses overnight. I\u2019ve never seen such flat lenses. \u201cThis is going to take quite a while,\u201d Kirby adds, for the 100 or so miles that now lie ahead. 159km to go: Jasper Philipsen has dropped back to the team cars. He\u2019s having a drink, resplendent in green jersey, and riding a green bike. 161km to go: Interestingly, the gap between breakaway and peloton has fallen to around a minute. You would have thought these three riders would be given a bit more rope, given the length of the stage. Mind you, at the back of the peloton, it\u2019s all looking very relaxed. There is little or no motivation to do anything other than let those three brave lads up front do most of the work. Richard Plugge, one of the Jumbo-Visma team managers, talks to Eurosport about Wout van Aert\u2019s departure: \u201cWe said when the moment is there, when the doctors says now is the moment, we have to make the decision [for Van Aert] to leave. \u201cFor us it\u2019s normal. It\u2019s really important to be with your family, with your wife, with your kid \u2026 he\u2019s a family man, we are a family, I have kids myself \u2026 you want to be in the most important moments in life with your family. We agreed on it without any discussion. \u201cHe tried for a stage victory [earlier in the race]. Unfortunately it didn\u2019t work out. He\u2019s a great team player. Yesterday was the biggest goal for us in this Tour de France, and he waited for that moment \u2026 that shows what a big guy he is, what a guy for the team, how strong he is.\u201d Can he, Plugge, taste overall victory in this Tour? \u201cI\u2019ll be really happy in Paris on Sunday. Yesterday was a good step. Today is another day \u2026 we have to be sharp from the start.\u201d 165km to go: On commentary, Carlton Kirby has been reduced to remembering a pizzeria that he once ate at with Sean Kelly. 167km to go: The gap has fallen slightly to 1min 16sec. What or where is Malopolska, where Abrahamsen won that stage? Let Wiki explain: \u201cLesser Poland, often known by its Polish name Ma\u0142opolska, is a historical region situated in southern and south-eastern Poland. Its capital and largest city is Krak\u00f3w. Throughout centuries, Lesser Poland developed a separate culture featuring diverse architecture, folk costumes, dances, cuisine, traditions and a rare Lesser Polish dialect. The region is rich in historical landmarks, monuments, castles, natural scenery and UNESCO World Heritage Sites.\u201d 168km to go: The top result showing on Jonas Abrahamsen\u2019s page on ProCyclingStats is a stage win at the Tour of Malopolska in 2020. But hey, a win is a win, yeah? 172km to go: The gap between break and peloton is hovering, pretty steadily, at around 1min 30sec. 174km to go: Jasper Philipsen (Alpecin\u2013Deceuninck) is pictured riding along having a bite to eat. Couldn\u2019t he have had something on the bus? Meanwhile, breakaway rider Victor Campanaerts has also scored some big wins in his time. He won a Giro stage in 2021: He also broke the Hour Record in 2019: 175km to go: I won the Tour of Flanders in 2019, at least in the sense that I completed the full-length sportive, which was about 215km. Anyone else out there done it? 177km to go: Asgreen, as you know, is a powerhouse of a rider and has won some big one-day races. Namely the Tour of Flanders (2021), E3 Harelbeke (2021) and Kuurne-Brussels-Kuurne (2020) 178km to go: All three riders in this break are over three hours behind the race leader, Jonas Vingegaard, in the general classification. So there is no question of them being a threat \u2026 180km to go: Carlton Kirby, on Eurosport commentary, suggests that some riders who were told to get in the break have missed it accidentally-on-purpose. No doubt there is some truth in that. 181km to go: The three-man breakaway has 43sec. That appears to be that. It\u2019s hardly surprising that after one of the hardest climbing stages in years, much of the peloton would like an easy day. There was definitely some road-blocking going on a couple of minutes ago when these three got away \u2026 183km to go: Kasper Asgreen (Soudal\u2013Quick-Step), Jonas Abrahamsen (Uno-X Pro Cycling Team) and Victor Campanaerts (Lotto\u2013Dstny) are up front. They have a lead of 18sec and the peloton behind looks happy to let them go. Most of them, anyway \u2026 as Sean Kelly says on commentary, a three-man break is perfect for the sprinters\u2019 teams, as it\u2019s so much easier to control than a larger group. Asgreen and Campanaerts are very powerful though, having said that. Boom. Attacks from the start, as expected. \u201cWith the yellow jersey practically sealed for Vingegaard, Pog\u2019s only hope to win it back would be if Vingegaard had to withdraw,\u201d emails Ben. \u201cHas a team ever gone full Dick Dastardly and tried to force a rider to crash out? Not quite the same, but a few years back I seem to remember Movistar putting the hammer down after a crash in the peloton which was met with justifiable condemnation.\u201d Just 1km to go now in the neutralised start. The peloton is massed behind the race director\u2019s car. Van de Poel is visible up front, plus Ciccone in his polka-dot outfit. Mathieu van der Poel (Alpecin\u2013Deceuninck), of course, is another rider who may put his hand up for a sprint win today. \u201cI\u2019ll be keeping my eye out,\u201d Fred Wright (Bahrain Victorious) tells Eurosport of a possible breakaway. \u201cYou never know \u2026 I\u2019m hoping there will be lots of people who don\u2019t want it to be a sprint. You kind of know in the \u201cneutral\u201d what the situation is. On stage 12, that was one of the most tense \u201cneutrals\u201d I\u2019ve ever been in.\u201d Jeremy Whittle reports from France on the scepticism swirling around Jonas Vingegaard\u2019s dominance, both in the time trial and yesterday\u2019s Queen stage: \u201cThe knives are out, or at least unsheathed, for Jonas Vingegaard at the Tour de France, but then it doesn\u2019t take much to trigger scepticism towards the wearer of the yellow jersey. It is always there, simmering away, even though 25 years have passed since the crippling Festina affair of 1998, and it is more than a decade since Lance Armstrong confessed his doping sins to Oprah Winfrey. Now Vingegaard, like so many before him, is having to recite the same mantra: trust me, I work hard, I sacrifice so much; believe me, I am not taking anything.\u201d I\u2019m not sure how long this neutralised section is in total, but the graphic on screen just said they still have 7km to ride before the official start. Jasper Philipsen is well ahead in the points classification: He leads with 323 points, Mads Pedersen is second with 186 points. There are 20 points on offer for winning the intermediate sprint, at Saint-Rambert-en-Bugey, and 50 for the stage winner. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen the final, so we know what to expect,\u201d Jasper Philipsen tells Eurosport. He\u2019s aiming for a fifth stage win this afternoon. Does he have any weaknesses in a sprint? \u201cWe\u2019ll see. Everything can happen in a bunch sprint.\u201d Bryan Coquard, Danny van Poppel, Alexander Kristoff, Luka Mezgec and Mads Pedersen are among the fast men remaining \u2013 along with Jasper Philipsen, of course \u2013 following yesterday\u2019s insanely hard stage that featured over 5,000m of climbing. A bit of politics now, from Antony on email: \u201cBonjour. Labour is imminent, Let\u2019s hope so Wout, let\u2019s hope so. Get a good indication later tonight.\u201d The official page for abandonments, stage-by-stage, can be found here. Phil Bauhaus packed it in yesterday, Caleb Ewan is gone, so is Fabio Jakobsen, and of course Mark Cavendish. Top five in GC before stage 18: Jonas Vingegaard (Jumbo-Visma) 68hr 05min 26sec Tadej Pogacar (UAE Team Emirates) +7min 35sec Adam Yates (UAE Team Emirates) +10min 45sec Carlos Rodr\u00edguez (Ineos) +12min 01sec Simon Yates (Jayco-AlUla) +12min 19sec This is cool. Ben O\u2019Connor congratulating his teammate, Felix Gall, on his victory in the \u2018Queen\u2019 stage of the Tour de France yesterday. \u201cYou\u2019re a champion!\u201d Can\u2019t beat a bit of true team spirit, can you? The full interview is well worth a watch, wherever you usually get your Tour de France interviews. Don\u2019t forget: You can email me with your thoughts on the race, or tweet me here There are two category-four climbs on today\u2019s route. The question is, will it be a textbook day for a game but ultimately doomed breakaway to be reeled in by the sprinters\u2019 teams, or will we see something far more chaotic and exciting? There are plenty of tired legs in the peloton and no doubt many riders will fancy a \u201cday off\u201d. But this is the Tour de France, right? \u201cLabour is imminent,\u201d Van Aert explains in this video on social media released by Jumbo-Visma. Van Aert\u2019s wife, Sarah, is due to give birth to their second child. Reflecting on the race, Van Aert said: \u201cI started the Tour hoping to make it to Paris. I often had the legs to win the stage, but it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d The Jumbo-Visma rider Wout van Aert has left the Tour de France to be with his wife Sarah, who is set to give birth to their second child, the team said on Thursday. The Belgian\u2019s absence is not expected to impact teammate and race leader Jonas Vingegaard, who is on course for a second consecutive title after his rival Tadej Pogacar lost time following a crash in Wednesday\u2019s stage 17. \u201cIn consultation with the team, we have decided that my place is now at home,\u201d he said, adding that the family\u2019s doctor had informed him his wife was expected to go into labour soon. I always thought that I would go home when my wife indicated that she needed me. That time has come.\u201d (Reuters) \u201cI\u2019m gone. I\u2019m dead.\u201d Four words already committed to Tour de France legend. Speaking on the team radio yesterday, Tadej Pogacar conceded defeat in his battle with Jonas Vingegaard, cracking on the Col de la Loze on Stage 17 a day after his rival\u2019s spectacular victory in the race\u2019s solitary time trial. The Slovenian\u2019s GC hopes do indeed look buried: just 48 hours ago the expectation had been for one of the closest-ever Tours de France but after two devastating days in the Alps, the Dane now leads the overall race by a mammoth 7min 35sec. Thankfully it is not, of course, as final as death for Pogacar and UAE Team Emirates: he can always come back next year and have another go, and indeed try for a stage win before the end of this race. Today\u2019s long trip from Mo\u00fbtiers to Bourg-en-Bresse, meanwhile, brings to mind the ghost of Mark Cavendish: long since departed from this race with a broken collarbone having come tantalisingly close to breaking Eddy Merckx\u2019s 34 career stage victories in the Tour. All things being equal Jasper Philipsen will make it five wins at this race later today: perhaps Cavendish will be watching and wondering whether to take the option of another year with Astana-Qazaqstan, and another crack at that record. For the sprinters remaining yet to record a win \u2013 that is, all of them bar Mads Pedersen \u2013 it is a precious chance to justify their selection for the world\u2019s biggest bike race.

What crazy hell kinda Test cricket is this? 32nd over: England 177-2 (Crawley 98, Root 18) Crawley rides his luck into the nineties, carving Starc high over the slips for four. Giddy up! Ricky Ponting, whose micro-analysis is extraordinarily good, had just suggested a fly slip for Crawley. The next ball is wide again, a bit fuller \u2013 and Crawley leathers it to the extra-cover boundary. That\u2019s a magnificent shot! A single takes England\u2019s ersatz Slats to within two of a first Ashes century. Starc could be struggling. He stretches his right leg between deliveries, grimacing slightly, though he\u2019s able to finish the over. If he\u2019s injured Australia will be in abundant bog. \u201cI think Bazball would have been great for Robin Smith and Devon Malcolm,\u201d says Ben Dunn. \u201cNot so much for Boycott or Atherton. Botham would have loved it. Phil Tufnell too.\u201d The Judge would have loved it. He played by far his best cricket when people pumped his tyres up, to use one of his favourite phrases, and when he concentrated on scoring runs rather than surviving. I think Athers would have loved it as well. There was a spell, at the start of 1995, when he started expanding his game; I think he hit Curtly Ambrose over extra cover for six during that ODI century at Lord\u2019s. But his back, and his teams lack of spine, started to wear him down again. I suspect there are very few human beings, never mind cricketers, who wouldn\u2019t enjoy working under Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum. 31st over: England 168-2 (Crawley 89, Root 18) To the surprise of nobody who has done their data homework, Pat Cummins replaces Josh Hazlewood. Joe Root\u2019s head-to-head average against Cummins is actually lower than David Warner\u2019s against Stuart Broad. Cummins has bounced Root out a couple of times in the last two Tests, so it\u2019s no surprise to see him set a field for short-pitched bowling. Root takes it on, swivel-pulling round the corner for four with superb placement. That leads to a change of approach \u2013 in come slip and gully \u2013 but not of tempo. Root square drives exquisitely for four more. He has raced to 18 from 13 balls, and England have scored 78 off the last 10 overs. I say! 30th over: England 157-2 (Crawley 88, Root 9) Thanks Geoff, hello everyone. Mitchell Starc continues to England\u2019s Michael Slater tribute act, a tall chap by the name of Zak Crawley. His strokeplay is a mix of the sublime and the vaguely ridiculous. He gets another streaky boundary, inside-edging past off stump, and then misses a lusty slap outside off stump. Lucky or not, he is scoring at a time-saving rate: 88 from 86 balls, including 62 off the last 40. That is the drinks break, and time to catch your breath. From Old Trafford, it\u2019s time for me to wave you off for the day, and hand you over to the warm embrace of Rob Smyth. 29th over: England 151-2 (Crawley 83, Root 8) Two midwickets come in for Crawley. So Hazlewood is going to target his pads? He\u2019s been strong through the leg side today. And he remains so, finding a gap despite that field for two, then standing up and pulling a not very short ball for four! Between the two mids. Then steps across and plays an outrageous shot! Angled in at the stumps, but Crawley has come a Smith-like distance across, then played with a Pietersen-like flamingo flourish, but striking the ball through fine leg off the full face for four. He\u2019s playing what might be an Ashes-shaping innings here. The Australians are uneasy, a long conference before the fourth ball of the over. Eventually Hazlewood pitches up and Crawley drives three through cover! He\u2019s taken 13 from the over and he\u2019s on to 83. 28th over: England 138-2 (Crawley 70, Root 8) The former skipper comes to the middle, having a wonderful summer already, and he carries it on right away! First ball, picks the length, short-arm pull shot just behind square, timed along the carpet for four! Then to end the over, when he sees some width, he steers it fine through deep third for the same result. That is next-level timing. Oh! That dropped catch has cost Australia exactly one run. New over, different bowler, same shot, same fielding position, different fielder. Moeen gets more of it, hits it flatter, and Khawaja takes a hell of a snare while diving to his right and falling to the ground. 27th over: England 130-1 (Crawley 70, Moeen 54) Hazlewood back on, the Head experiment has been short lived. Crawley keeps picking up twos, does it three times in a row, the last of them from an outside edge. Eventually gets Moeen back on strike, and\u2026 he\u2019s dropped! Moeen is put down by Australia\u2019s captain. Straightforward chance. They\u2019ve got three in the deep for the short ball but Moeen loops it to the closer midwicket fielder, and Cummins moving across is hit on the wrist rather than the palms and spills it. 26th over: England 122-1 (Crawley 63, Moeen 53) Starc comes on for Cummins, and immediately there\u2019s more streak for Crawley, another edge past his leg stump! Must have been four or five of those in his innings? Cleaner contact for Moeen, a nice flick through midwicket for two. Australia\u2019s lead is down to 195. 25th over: England 119-1 (Crawley 62, Moeen 51) The milestone men! Moeen at No3 for this Test was, says Vic Marks on TMS, \u201crather more in hope than expectation. But it has worked, and that\u2019s rather wonderful.\u201d It is. The fifty comes thanks to a full toss lumped over mid on\u2019s head, then two more runs chipped in the air past Cummins again in that position. 24th over: England 111-1 (Crawley 61, Moeen 44) Hundred partnership as Crawley equals his top score for the series with a single to deep point. Cummins goes short at Moeen, with three out on the leg side and one out at deep backward point, but Moeen leaves alone five in a row. That\u2019s better! A late no-ball at the end of the over, he gets a sixth ball to face, and pulls a single. 23rd over: England 108-1 (Crawley 60, Moeen 43) No frontline spinner for Australia, so Travis head gets the ball. Bowling in his knitted vest and his shades. But it\u2019s Crawley stitching him up immediately: reverse sweep first ball for four, then a hit over midwicket for six! Booming cut shot goes to the cover sweeper for one. England supporters have been waiting a long time for Crawley to deliver. I would suggest that scores this series of 61, 48, 33, 44 and now 60 not out means that he has done. 22nd over: England 97-1 (Crawley 49, Moeen 43) This is a serious partnership now, it\u2019s 81 runs. Bigger than any that Australia managed yesterday. Not without some luck, and there\u2019s some more! Inside edge from Crawley for four. The ball misses off stump by an inch, and misses being caught by another inch. Carey is full length on the dive to his left \u2013 did that flick the webbing of the glove? Crawley adds a couple more, gets off strike, then Cummins takes the edge and it falls short of slip, Moeen Ali the lucky one this time. Cummins can\u2019t take a trick. 21st over: England 90-1 (Crawley 42, Moeen 43) They do go shorter when Green bowls to Moeen, but the batter handles it fine, twice knocking the ball away for a run. The slips come back for Crawley, and he races back to get two runs off his pads. 20th over: England 84-1 (Crawley 38, Moeen 41) England\u2019s new/old No3 keeps scoring behind point, a couple, then a single. They haven\u2019t bounced him as much as you might have expected. 19th over: England 81-1 (Crawley 38, Moeen 38) Beaten again, Crawley, but that ball from Green is far enough back of a length that it\u2019s not very close to the edge. Not so the next time, when Crawley throws the bat and slashes it over gully for four! Green might have caught that, but Green is bowling, and Khawaja in his place is about a foot shorter. Mitchell Marsh there would be a better bet, no? With luck still his way, Crawley revels in it by belting four down the ground! The next ball hits his pad as he leaves, the Australians appeal but it\u2019s high and probably missing off stump on line. 18th over: England 73-1 (Crawley 30, Moeen 38) Another scorcher from Moeen! His cover driving has always been the highlight of his play, and it\u2019s been the highlight of this innings. Such easy placement facing Cummins, who isn\u2019t happy about it, and comes around the wicket to bounce Moeen. But a couple of balls later he\u2019s able to get off strike towards point. That gives Crawley a chance for another drive, again uncontrolled, off the edge towards deep third where Head fields. The next ball is an inside edge into pad. Yet Crawley remains. 17th over: England 64-1 (Crawley 27, Moeen 33) Green starts after lunch, and the England batters have picked off the singles well today, kept the runs going. Moeen lays into a cut shot but only gets one for it. Lunch has ticked by. Let\u2019s resume. \u201cAs an Irishman, I will cede the Aussies a win against our heroic gals in green \u2013 indeed, they can have the World Cup itself, as long as England win these Ashes. Confusing isn\u2019t it?\u201d Deeply, Dean Kinsella. Can\u2019t tell you how many ways I\u2019ve got in trouble for missteps on the finer points of social and national distinction in this particular group of islands. They wouldn\u2019t need a big lead, but getting 50-100 in front would be hugely helpful. All that\u2019s very much theoretical as yet. And they had a crowd of 75,000 at Stadium Australia in Sydney for that match. Awesome. Women\u2019s sport these days is such a buzz. This is a dynamite penalty kick, too. In the meantime, Australia got past Ireland in their football World Cup opener \u2013 just. Thrown out of whack by losing Sam Kerr so late in the piece, but a Steph Catley penalty was enough. \u201cOn the subject of pre-Jerusalem wickets, Root himself was bowled before Jerusalem was finished on day 2 at Headingley in the last Test,\u201d writes John Culkin. \u201cBoy, we could use a big score from Joe today, but meanwhile, what a pleasure it is to see Mo out there...\u201d Looks like a Joe Root kind of surface, and a Joe Root kind of day. Sun beaming down here at Old Trafford. So far, so good for England. They would have been annoyed at the extra 17 runs added for the last wicket thanks to the no ball decision against Woakes that was marginal, but they\u2019ve come out and scored quickly with the bat, got that deficit down to the mid 200s, and they can reset for the middle session from here. The Moeen move has just about broken even, strange as that sounds, given that expectations weren\u2019t high \u2013 anything he can add after lunch will be a bonus. Australia need to find a foothold. 16th over: England 61-1 (Crawley 26, Moeen 31) Finally Crawley middles one of those lavish drives, out through the covers. Then tries to yank a pull shot from a length outside off stump, slamming it into his own thigh instead. That\u2019s how Crawley plays for lunch. Good bouncer from Cummins in response, past the ear as the batter ducks. And that\u2019s lunch. We\u2019ve had two Guys, now we have two Withingtons. This is the John variety. \u201cWhile trying to keep up on weak signals in the Austrian Alps I was reminded yesterday of a conversation with my often quoted brother. It struck me halfway through the 2nd test that we might be seeing Jimmy for the last time. One of the big problems for England has been the quick and regular runs scored by Head and Marsh and that perhaps Sam Curran should be brought in ahead of Jimmy to prise one or both out. Fire with fire, sword with sword etc. I think Sam\u2019s white-ball nouse could be decisive. Plus he can bat a bit with lower middle orders being crucial in every Test so far. With another frugal but fruitless performance from Anderson perhaps it\u2019s time \u2026 if a test match too late?\u201d Jimmy gets another innings to make his case, and having a bowler who keeps the runs down must have an influence on the wickets that others take. 15th over: England 53-1 (Crawley 22, Moeen 31) A sharp bouncer for Moeen to dodge from Green, then another play and miss for Crawley outside the off stump. Not sure why they only have two slips and a gully for him, and why they don\u2019t consistently bowl that line. He\u2019s promising to nick, and most of the runs he\u2019s making are into the leg side. 14th over: England 53-1 (Crawley 20, Moeen 29) There\u2019s the milestone for Moeen, he goes past 3000 Test runs to go with his 200 wickets. Becomes the 16th player to do it. And does it in true Moeen style, slicing Cummins over the top of Green at gully. Four more next ball, laced through cover, and another run on the back cut. The pinch-hitting No3 trick is working so far. 13th over: England 44-1 (Crawley 20, Moeen 20) Cameron Green into the attack, and for a few minutes he has what he wants. In-ducker, at pace, smashes Crawley on the pad in front of middle and leg. Umpire Wilson gives it out, but the review shows it missing leg stump by a couple of millimetres. Green light, Zak. Proceed. 12th over: England 43-1 (Crawley 20, Moeen 19) Pat Cummins into the fray, replacing Hazlewood from the Anderson End. Gets the ball to do a bit immediately, including one that cuts back savagely towards Crawley, and one nicked past the leg stump. There\u2019s another cover drive piled straight into Labuschagne\u2019s hands, on the bounce, and another massive swishing drive to a ball that is miles too short for the shot, missing by a distance. Crawley has been all over the shop, to be honest, but he\u2019s still scoring. 11th over: England 41-1 (Crawley 19, Moeen 18) Again, down the leg side from Starc in his sixth over. Crawley doesn\u2019t catch up with it. Smacks a cover drive, but straight at the field. In between all that, three singles. Guy Hornsby is our second Guy of the day. \u201cMorning Geoff, as they say in golf (yes, golf) this day feels like \u2018moving day\u2019. Given the weather forecast, this Test may be as little and 2 and a half days long, or at a push, 4. So England have to go big, but risk by going big(ger) and fast(er) we could fall in a heap. But given we need to win this, I am actually on board as Stokes won\u2019t want to tie the series 2-2. The series deserves better than that. Loved your and Jonathan Liew\u2019s pieces. Smith is still a staggering batter, but seems slightly adrift, and Green now suffering in comparison to Mitch, who looks a much better bet right now. I know England are obsessed with all-rounders, but are Australia pinning too much of their hopes to Green\u2019s expected success? He\u2019s still so young.\u201d Golf? Ridiculous sport. Hitting balls with sticks. It\u2019ll never catch on. 10th over: England 38-1 (Crawley 17, Moeen 17) A little momentum into this Moeen Ali innings! Hits the non-striker\u2019s stumps first with a drive. Then he gets the line to glance Hazlewood for four, before resting on the front foot and driving superbly on the up through cover to the rope! Picturesque. 9th over: England 30-1 (Crawley 17, Moeen 9) Whooshka, goes Crawley, booming the bat at a length that is absolutely not there to drive. Starc\u2019s scrambled seam takes the ball away from the bat and so nearly an edge. Goes in at the hip and Crawley gets two extras off the body to fine leg. He finishes the over as he started, another huge drive that again is a rollie paper away from giving up an edge to the keeper. Starc is left rolling his eyes. 8th over: England 26-1 (Crawley 17, Moeen 8) Edged by Crawley and safe! Goes to Warner on the half-volley at first slip. Surprising lack of carry from this surface, where the next ball from Hazlewood flies through to Carey. Really takes off, from a length, left alone. Parry, thrust, as Crawley times the pants off the next ball through midwicket for four! Deep square leg out there, beaten on the dive into the ropes. 7th over: England 20-1 (Crawley 12, Moeen 7) Sizzling delivery from Starc, squares up Crawley and just beats him outside off stump. Perfect line, movement back in to the right-hander. Crawley finds a single next ball, leaving Moeen to face the music. The latter does well enough. \u201cWas Jimmy\u2019s Cummins wicket the first \u2018pre-Jerusalem\u2019 wicket in history?\u201d asks Ben Warren. I wouldn\u2019t think so \u2013 they sing the song second ball of the day, and there must have been first-ball dismissals before. I remember Joe Root at Adelaide Oval in 2017 was caught behind off Hazlewood before Jersualem had finished. That might have been second or third ball of the morning. 6th over: England 18-1 (Crawley 11, Moeen 6) Crawley is doing well, again clips a single first ball of the over. Moeen blocks a single to cover. Crawley finds another to the leg side. 5th over: England 15-1 (Crawley 9, Moeen 5) Crawley turns over the strike. Starc has three slips and a gully, backward point, mid off, mid on, deep backward square, fine leg. Over the wicket to Moeen Ali\u2026 who nicks him for four! Past Green in the gully, which is a feat in itself. Well wide of him in the end. Gets better contact and no runs afterwards, driving it square to point where Travis Head is stationed. \u201cAs well as registering on the Valuable Runs Index, Nasser on Sky was suggesting that the extended Starc-Hazelwood stand was also featuring on the Valuable Time Index, in view of the weekend weather forecast,\u201d writes Brian Withington. \u201cIt certainly made an indelible entry on my Keep Your Foot Behind the Bloody Line Index (other versions are available).\u201d 4th over: England 10-1 (Crawley 8, Moeen 1) Trying to work out how to approach his innings, Moeen plays Test-style in this over against Hazlewood, defending the ball as best he can, only looking to score once when he clips to midwicket and can\u2019t beat the field. 3rd over: England 10-1 (Crawley 8, Moeen 1) One attacking left-hander replaces another, Moeen Ali in for Duckett. Chest height down the leg side, Moeen plays at it but doesn\u2019t get close to it. Defends the line on off stump well, but has a huge swish at nothing when he gets width. Finds his first run to fine leg. Australia 0-0 with Ireland at half time in the World Cup football. There he goes, there he goes again. Ben Duckett never leaves the ball, so the left-hander plays a defensive push at a ball outside off stump from a left-armer, over the wicket, that is swinging further away from him. Just no need to play that ball, even though it has nice shape on it. Takes a feather through to Carey. 2nd over: England 9-0 (Crawley 8, Duckett 1) Cummins making himself first change, Hazlewood to take the new ball from the James Anderson End. Duckett chops into the ground and has to kick the ball away from his stumps as it rolls back. Gets a run fifth ball, Crawley flicks two more. 1st over: England 6-0 (Crawley 6, Duckett 0) Four first ball of the innings! Crawley likes that. This time it\u2019s not a smash through cover, it\u2019s a glove past the wicketkeeper. No mind. He glances two runs to follow. Starc corrects his line with a very good delivery that goes close to Crawley\u2019s off stump. Left-arm, over the wicket, landing it in the channel for the latter half of the over, Crawley going after one with an angled bat and getting a bottom edge into the ground. Change of innings is done, brace yerself. Perplexing question from Tone White. \u201cI must know, is Stu Broad the Ryan Gosling of cricket?\u201d In as much as he started out in the 2000s with roles of serious pathos but has latterly graduated to masterful comic performances while seeming to have the time of his life? Yes. The Test Match Special overseas link is now here, for those who like listening to the BBC but don\u2019t like finding links on BBC websites. There we are, the last partnership adds a useful 18 runs after Pat Cummins was out first ball of the day. England will get into their batting work under bright sunshine wanting to make something north of Australia\u2019s score by stumps. That will be a challenge, but it\u2019s quite an Englandy sort of challenge. Gosh, there are some pessimists in this joint. Guy Simpson: \u201cIs it just me, or does anyone else have the terrible presentiment that VAR has just cost England the Ashes? That the extra runs added by the 10th wicket will prove too many and that England will fall just short? Just horrible.\u201d As soon as the wicket falls, \u201cI take it back! Well done, Woakesy!\u201d You could still be right, Guy. Tests have been decided by fewer than 16 runs\u2026 Now Chris Woakes has his first five-wicket Ashes haul. Gets Hazlewood second time around, this time the edge to third slip where Ben Duckett reaches above his head to take a catch that most slippers would have held near their midriff. 90th over: Australia 317-9 (Starc 36, Hazlewood 4) Ok, now we crank up the gears. Mark Wood is on to bowl, and Starc doesn\u2019t want Hazlewood to face him. Starc ducks a bouncer, plays the ribcage ball well, and declines a single when he hits out to cover. Two balls to come in the over, everyone goes back to the fence except a gully and the wicketkeeper. Starc still doesn\u2019t want the run. One ball to come, and England leave almost everyone back. Wood bowls a good bumper around an off stump line and Starc leaves it alone. 89th over: Australia 317-9 (Starc 36, Hazlewood 4) There\u2019s an addition to Hazlewood\u2019s score, throwing the bat at Woakes and getting three through cover. Starc knocks a single to the leg side. Hazlewood defends well enough, gets out of the way when he can. 88th over: Australia 313-9 (Starc 35, Hazlewood 1) We\u2019re deep into the Useful Runs Index\u2122, as Starc steers four runs past gully, then opens his stance and belts two runs back past Anderson in the air. Can\u2019t rotate the strike though so Hazlewood will face Woakes. Hazlewood\u2019s batting has dipped at Test level after he did some competent work in his early years. 87th over: Australia 307-9 (Starc 29, Hazlewood 1) Boundary for Starc! Gets back and pulls Woakes behind square. The replay on that no ball is extremely tight. The foot isn\u2019t obviously over the line, but perhaps there is nothing clearly behind it. Starc adds another single to cover, Hazlewood does him proud for the last two balls. 86th over: Australia 302-9 (Starc 24, Hazlewood 1) Anderson to Starc, who sweats on most of the over before pushing a single to cover. Hazlewood plays and misses the one ball he faces. Jono Haylen is curating his playlist. \u201cIf the timeline of this series was \u2018Hamilton\u2019 the musical we are now at the part where all of the upbeat songs and the feeling of just \u2018how good is it to be here\u2019 is over. We\u2019ve had bubbles during intermission, enjoyed Thomas Jefferson\u2019s upbeat homecoming and witnessed Alexander Hamilton own him during two rap battles. \u201dNow, Hamilton\u2019s brilliant run of wins is over and things start to get heavy. Each decision and action is much more serious than bragging rights after a cabinet meeting and breaking out into song to celebrate. The Reynolds Pamphlet has just been released. From here on I\u2019m sure people will be feeling their Ashes dreams are going to burn and that the final couple of bullets are close to being fired. What team today will not waste their shot?\u201d 85th over: Australia 301-9 (Starc 23, Hazlewood 1) Chris Woakes has his first five-wicket bag against Australia\u2026 and then he doesn\u2019t. Has Hazlewood edging to Crawley at second slip, but Woakes has overstepped! Starc has already sprinted off the ground by the time the third umpire sends word, so he has to turn and run all the way back to the non-striker\u2019s end. Has only got to face one ball so far today. Hazlewood gets in behind the line for the rest of the over. No, I don\u2019t have the TMS overseas link. The BBC haven\u2019t posted it yet. 84th over: Australia 300-9 (Starc 23, Hazlewood 1) The left-handed Hazlewood comes out. Wears a short ball on the body. Reaches outside off stump and steers a run past gully. Ali Martin next to me observes that James Anderson has broken James Anderson\u2019s record for the most wickets for England. What was 688 becomes 689. Jimmy Anderson gets in the book! With a wicket first ball of the day, no less. Regulation sort of delivery, Cummins doesn\u2019t have his timing sorted yet, pushes at it too early and hits it low to cover for a comfortable catch. On the players come\u2026 Of course, you can email me or whoever else is on the OBO at any given point, using the contact details in the sidebar, or top of page on your phone. Tane Aikman has written in. \u201cYou going to be splitting your attention between Manchester and Sydney Geoff? Big blow for the Matildas, with Sam Kerr out. On my side of the Tasman it\u2019s been a great night, with the Football Ferns upsetting Norway for their first ever World Cup win. Now more Ashes fun to watch. Sport. It\u2019s bloody good.\u201d Devastating about Sam Kerr, the worst possible timing. Last training session! Finally, Barney Ronay switched modes from Wimbledon to look at how England\u2019s embrace of the new is all about embracing the old. \u201cFor a few moments England\u2019s wicketkeeper just sat there like a very happy life-sized gingerbread man, emitting an extended roar of triumph.\u201d I have been watching Steve Smith for a very long time, and yesterday was a strange day within an observable pattern of strange days. \u201cInstead Smith heaved at it, a circular dragging movement like he was halfway down the Amazon and trying to sling a large python over the side of a small boat.\u201d And there\u2019s the Final Word Daily podcast as usual from stumps last night. Jonathan Liew had some fun writing about Australia\u2019s two all-rounders. \u201cThe Ashes are afoot, England are rampant and the only thing standing in their way is just under four metres of prime Perth flesh.\u201d Simon also has the lines from Broad\u2019s press conference last night. Then there\u2019s Simon Burnton\u2019s diary. Catching up? Start with Ali Martin and the match report. Greetings, comrades. Day one is done, day two is new. On into the future we go together. It was one of those days of back and forth yesterday: England win the toss and bowl, make early inroads, Australia pull it back, gain the upper hand at times, formed a partnership for almost every wicket, which England then found a way to break. Both teams would consider themselves to be in a reasonable position, with Australia about to pass 300 and having a couple of wickets left with which to do so. Once England get to bat, which might be very shortly, they will want to score at a fast rate, which will also give Australia opportunities to knock over players. This is all with an eye to forecast rain on the weekend. The idea is to get as much of this match as possible done with in the next two days.

Here is where each case against Trump stands: Classified documents case in Florida Status: Trump pleaded not guilty; trial scheduled for August Charges: 31 counts of willful retention of national defense information under the Espionage Act, conspiracy to obstruct justice and false statements and representations, among others Hush-money case in New York Status: Trump pleaded not guilty; trial forthcoming Charges: 34 felony charges of falsifying business records January 6 case in Washington Status: Subpoenas issued by grand jury Potential charges against Trump: Obstruction of an official proceeding, conspiracy to defraud the government and incitement of an insurrection 2020 election meddling case in Georgia Status: Grand jury report finished; charging decisions expected this summer Potential charges against Trump: Election code violations E Jean Carroll lawsuits in New York Status: First lawsuit going to trial; second lawsuit on appeal Allegations against Trump: Defamation and sexual abuse Read the full story here. Donald Trump has said he has until midnight tonight to testify before the federal grand jury deciding whether to indict him over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Targets of criminal investigations rarely speak to grand juries, as they are usually advised by their attorneys to not take up invitations to meet with the grand jury because any statements provided in that setting could be used to help build a case against them in the event that they\u2019re charged. Trump has not exercised that right in the two other criminal cases in which he\u2019s been charged, Politico\u2019s Kyle Cheney writes. Recent witnesses who have appeared before the grand jury investigating Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the 2020 election were reportedly asked about the former president\u2019s state of mind surrounding the January 6 insurrection. Federal prosecutors asked multiple former senior Trump White House officials to speak to Trump\u2019s mindset in the days and weeks after losing the 2020 election, leading up to 6 January, according to a New York Times report. Witnesses including Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, were asked if he had privately acknowledged that he had lost the election, it said. Kushner is understood to have said that it was his impression that Trump truly believed the election was stolen. The line of questioning suggested prosecutors were trying to determine if Trump acted with corrupt intent as he sought to remain in power, the paper said. A federal grand jury investigating Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the 2020 election will hear testimony from an aide who was with the former president for much of the day on 6 January 2021, according to multiple reports. William Russell, a former White House aide who now works for Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, is scheduled to testify before he grand jury convened by special counsel Jack Smith, both CNN and NBC reported. Russell, who has previously testified before the grand jury, served in the Trump White House as a special assistant to the president and deputy director of advance, before moving to Florida to work as an aid to Trump after he left office. Multiple former senior Trump White House officials have testified before the grand jury in the special counsel\u2019s investigation into the January 6 insurrection. Among those who have testified are Trump\u2019s son-in-law and former White House senior adviser, Jared Kushner, and former top Trump aide, Hope Hicks. In April, Mike Pence testified for seven hours behind closed doors, meaning the details of what he told the prosecutors in the case remain uncertain. What the potential charges means for Trump is unclear. Prosecutors have been examining various instances of Trump pressuring officials like his former vice-president Mike Pence, but Trump\u2019s efforts to obstruct the transfer of power could also be construed as conspiring to defraud voters more generally. The other two statutes, meanwhile, suggest a core part of the case against Trump is focused on the so-called fake electors scheme and the former president\u2019s efforts to use the fake slates in a conspiracy to stop the congressional certification of Joe Biden\u2019s election win on 6 January 2021. The target letter did not cite any seditious conspiracy, incitement of insurrection or deprivation of rights under color of law \u2013 other areas for which legal experts have suggested Trump could have legal risk. Last year, the House select committee that investigated the Capitol attack concluded that Trump committed multiple crimes in an attempt to reverse his 2020 defeat to Joe Biden, including conspiracy to defraud the United States and obstruction of an official proceeding. The committee issued symbolic criminal referrals to the justice department, although at that point the justice department had since stepped up its criminal investigation with the addition of new prosecutors in spring 2022 before they were folded into the special counsel\u2019s office. House investigators also concluded that there was evidence for prosecutors to charge Trump with conspiracy to defraud and obstruction of an official proceeding. They also issued referrals for incitement of insurrection, which was not listed in the target letter. Should prosecutors charge Trump in the federal January 6 investigation, the case could go to trial much more quickly than the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case \u2013 before the 2024 election \u2013 because pre-trial proceedings would not be delayed by rules governing national security materials. Federal prosecutors investigating Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the 2020 election results have evidence to charge the former president with three crimes, including section 241 of the US legal code that makes it unlawful to conspire to violate civil rights, two people familiar with the matter said. The potential charges detailed in a target letter sent to Trump by prosecutors from the office of special counsel Jack Smith, who also charged Trump with retaining classified documents last month, was the clearest signal of an imminent indictment. Prosecutors appear to have evidence to charge Trump with obstruction of an official proceeding and conspiracy to defraud the United States based on the target letter, two statutes that the House select committee examining the January 6 Capitol attack issued criminal referrals for last year. The target letter to Trump identified a previously unconsidered third charge, the sources said. That is section 241 of title 18 of the US code, which makes it unlawful to conspire to threaten or intimidate a person in the \u201cfree exercise\u201d of any right or privilege under the \u201cConstitution or laws of the United States\u201d. The statute, enacted to protect the civil rights of Black voters targeted by white supremacy groups after the US civil war, is unusual because it is typically used by prosecutors in law enforcement misconduct and hate crime prosecutions, though its use has expanded in recent years. Donald Trump has until Thursday midnight to respond to special counsel Jack Smith and tell his office whether he will appear before a grand jury in the justice department\u2019s investigation into efforts to overturn the 2020 election results. A letter sent to Trump by prosecutors from Smith\u2019s office on Sunday identified the former president as a \u201ctarget\u201d in the probe into the January 6 insurrection, Trump posted to his Truth Social website on Tuesday. He wrote: Deranged Jack Smith, the prosecutor with Joe Biden\u2019s DOJ, sent a letter \u2026 stating that I am a TARGET of the January 6th Grand Jury investigation, and giving me a very short 4 days to report to the Grand Jury, which almost always means an Arrest and an Indictment. People who receive target letters from federal authorities are usually advised by their attorneys to not take up invitations to meet with the grand jury because any statements provided in that setting could be used to help build a case against them in the event that they\u2019re charged. Good morning, US politics blog readers. The former president, Donald Trump, has quietly added a criminal defense attorney to his legal team as he faces a potential indictment in the justice department\u2019s investigation into the January 6 insurrection. Attorney John Lauro, who has also represented Trump attorneys Christina Bobb and Alina Habba, is joining Trump\u2019s legal team alongside Todd Blanche, according to sources, CNN reported late on Wednesday. Lauro will be solely focused on special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s investigation into Trump\u2019s efforts to remain in office following his 2020 election defeat to Joe Biden, including the deadly 6 January 2021 riot in which his supporters overran the Capitol building in Washington DC. Federal prosecutors have evidence to charge the former president with three crimes, including section 241 of the US legal code that makes it unlawful to conspire to violate civil rights, the Guardian reported last night, citing two people familiar with the matter. Trump faces being charged with obstruction of an official proceeding and conspiracy to defraud the United States, two statutes that the House select committee examining the January 6 Capitol attack issued criminal referrals for last year. The target letter also identified a previously unconsidered third charge, the sources said. That is section 241 of title 18 of the US code, which makes it unlawful to conspire to threaten or intimidate a person in the \u201cfree exercise\u201d of any right or privilege under the \u201cConstitution or laws of the United States\u201d. The potential charges detailed in a target letter sent to Trump by prosecutors from Smith\u2019s office, who also charged Trump with retaining classified documents last month, was the clearest signal of an imminent indictment.

You\u2019ll have seen the US Open champ hacking his way down 14 (below). Two blows to extricate his ball from difficulty, only to find himself in more rough down the opposite side of the hole. But as Rory McIlroy and the rest of the field found to their cost in LA, Clark doesn\u2019t lie down. He got up and down to limit the damage to bogey, then immediately bounced back with birdie at 15. Another birdie at the last, and that\u2019s a 68. He\u2019ll be extremely pleased with that after a quiet start \u2013 nine straight pars going out \u2013 and that\u2019s one step towards adding the Open to his US Open title. Should he win this week, he\u2019d join a super-select group of players to have won both championships in the same calendar year, alongside Bobby Jones, Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Lee Trevino, Tom Watson and Tiger Woods. Now that is a top table. Thanks James \u2026 and that\u2019s one hell of a back nine by Tommy Fleetwood. Four birdies to come home in 32. Tell you who will be equally as pleased with their performance along the closing stretch, and that\u2019s Brooks Koepka. He was looking out of sorts after bogeys at 8 and 10, but birdies at 11, 12 and 15 see him sign for an opening round of 70. Two putts, including a five-footer, see the local favourite home in 32. Six birdies on the card, a solitary blemish at the sixth. He is your joint-leader at -5 alongside amateur Christo Lamprecht. With that, I\u2019ll leave you in Scott\u2019s far more capable hands. Enjoy the rest of the day. -5: Lamprecht -a- (F), Fleetwood (F) -3: Cink (F) -2: Jordan (F), Spieth (F) \u2013 ha! \u2013 Clark (17), Kim (16), Rozner (12), Langasque (9) A bit of a struggle for Fleetwood up 18. From the left rough, he carves up to the right rough on the corner of the fairway, still the best part of 210 yards away. He does well to then find the back edge, from where two putts will see him in for a 66. On the 18th, Fleetwood again goes left off the tee, finding a spot in the rough. And speaking of the long stuff \u2026 Wyndham Clark (-2) may have had to play one of the day\u2019s shortest shots \u2026 Antoine Rozner is the latest to make his way to -3, a birdie three on the 11th. US pair Brooks Koepka and Patrick Cantlay are both -1 through 17, while Bryson DeChambeau is +4, steadying the ship after a sketchy front nine. To the 17th for Tommy Fleetwood and co. We mentioned it a bit earlier and should add that it\u2019s currently playing as the ninth hardest hole on the course, a stroke average of 3.12 for its 126 yards. A reminder too that said number is slightly misleading given the grievous rise from tee to pin. Anyway, Fleetwood isn\u2019t having anything to do with the flag, finding the back left edge and leaving himself a mighty putt. He does well from range, lagging up and gladly knocking in. He remains -5 with one hole to play. \u201cSilly, stupid question, but how can a golf course have a course record when the pin positions move daily, changing its difficulty?\u201d asks Andy Flintoff (not that one). It\u2019s not really either of those, Andy, but there\u2019s not really a better option out there \u2026 I think? Tommy Fleetwood goes to -5, a tie for the lead! He did well to find the green from the left rough on 16, a good 25 feet or so away from the pin with his approach and then made no mistake with the flat stick again, finding the cup for a third birdie on the spin. Meanwhile, up on the 18th, Jordan Spieth finds a fairway bunker off the tee and ends up having to come out sideways. He misses the green long and left, getting flirty with the stands, and is unable to get up and down. A frustrating finishing 6 and he\u2019s back to -2 \u2026 three behind our joint-leaders. Another player on the back-to-back birdie trail is Romain Langasque of France, with a two at the sixth taking him to -2. \u201cI just thought I\u2019d say the course set-up is almost perfect,\u201d emails David Thomson with regards to Hoylake. \u201cA great test with a mix of risk reward with relatively straightforward holes, but then again there\u2019s nothing straightforward about an Open links. Makes a great contrast with the hairy monstrosity that was the US Open set-up last month. The US PGA seems to have this thing about rough and bunkers to the extent that it protected greenside bunkers with a fringe which made the bunkers pointless. It also forgets that the ball is round and it rolls \u2013 or should that be releases? \u2013 especially when it\u2019s not hit or aimed very well the fringe prevented natural roll-offs as penalties. Crazy. \u201cI must say though I\u2019ve mixed feelings about the 17th it stands out a wee bit crazy golf in amongst the excellent others. It will be good to see it in a hooly with rain but I think it might have been better placed earlier in the round to test the golfers\u2019 recovery abilities towards the finish. But anyway things look good for the week. Lamprecht played well, hope he can keep it going.\u201d Another birdie for Tommy Fleetwood, then, doing the business on the par-five 15th. He takes second place on his own. Next up is the 466-yard 16th, another brute of a hole. He tugs his tee shot down the left and finds the rough. -5: Lamprecht -a- (F) -4 Fleetwood (15) -3: Cink (F), Spieth (17), Siem (10) -2: Jordan (F), Scott (15), Clark (13), Rozner (9) Royal Liverpool member Matthew Jordan, who got the ball rolling all the way back at 6.35am, has been talking about his day and an impressive round of 69. Remember, though, he is the course record-holder, having been around in here in just 62 shots. Speaking to PA, Jordan said: Amazing. I\u2019m kind of running out of words to describe it. It was crazy, mental, loud \u2013 everything that I could have wished for. I\u2019m certainly trying to think of a better experience than that, and I don\u2019t think I can.\u201d The first to fall foul of the 17th was Lucas Herbert, who arrived on the tee box as the early leader at three under but ended the hole at even par after an ugly six. Having missed the green long and left from the tee, he then chipped through the green to the right sand, duffed his first bunker shot into the bank, chipped out to 18ft and two-putted. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be the only one to run up a big number,\u201d sighed Herbert after signing for even-par 71. \u201cOur group all missed the green. It\u2019s not easy. When there\u2019s no wind, it\u2019s a gap wedge and you can make a two pretty easily, but that wind gets going and you can\u2019t really feel it too much on the enclosed tee. It becomes a really tricky shot. \u201cI had sort of one foot in the bunker, one foot out,\u201d Herbert continued. \u201cIt didn\u2019t come out the way I wanted and it rolled back in. Felt like there was about 5,000 professional golfers sitting around us in the stands watching it.\u201d Tucked up somewhere around the 17th hole today \u2013 which Jordan Spieth has just safely negotiated with a par three \u2013 is our very own Michael Butler. \u201cAbsolutely deadly,\u201d he calls it. And if you need a bit more info about the new hole, here you go. \u201cPerhaps a little unkind to detail the struggles of those having a bad day,\u201d writes Dean Kinsella. \u201cGod knows, we\u2019ve all had \u2018em.\u201d Some of us more than others, unfortunately, Dean. Hello there \u2026 moving up to -3 and joint-second is Tommy Fleetwood, joining Jordan Spieth after a birdie on the par-four 14th. It\u2019s been playing at 4.31 today so that\u2019s a real bonus for the Englishman, whose approach from the left-side of the fairway ended up around 10ft from the pin and he duly rolled in the putt. Currently bringing up the field is Jazz Janewattananond, who is in with an 81 or +10. He reached the turn in 39 but things went further south, ending with a double on the 18th. That\u2019s three worse than Ryan Fox, while there\u2019s currently a quarter of players stuck on +6, including Rasmus Hojgaard of Denmark, who is just through the 6th. A quadruple-bogey 8 on the 3rd has done most of the damage there. Good afternoon, good morning, good evening wherever you are. Thanks to Scott, who will be back later to helm this good ship home. A brief update on Scottie Scheffler: he\u2019s parred the 13th and remains on level par, five back on our shock early leader, Christo Lamprecht. But you can add another name to the group on -3: Jordan Spieth. Scottie Scheffler yips another short putt. The only surprise being he misses to the right. He walks off the 12th green with the hangdog look of a man who knows this is untenable if he wants to lift the Claret Jug this week. He\u2019s back to level par. And I\u2019m off to lift a mug of hot tea, so I\u2019ll leave you in the company of James Dart. See you later. Marcel Siem bounces straight back from a bogey on 6 with birdie at 7. He punches the air in delight, along a huge swinging arc, the sort of celebration you normally see on the back nine on Sunday, not on the front nine on Thursday. Don\u2019t be using all of that energy up too soon, Marcel. But he\u2019s -3, so you can understand the sentiment. Meanwhile back-to-back birdies for the US Open champ (and real deal) Wyndham Clark at 10 and 11, and suddenly he\u2019s in the mix at -2. He\u2019s alongside Tommy Fleetwood, who having turned in 34 has since birdied 11, and Jordan Spieth, who follows birdie at 11 with another at 15. That\u2019s a fine response by the 2017 winner to that double at 8, his tee shot on that hole being the only serious mistake he\u2019s made all day. And birdie for 2012\u2019s nearly man Adam Scott at 12. This is some leaderboard already! -5: Lamprecht -a- (F) -3: Cink (F), Siem (7) -2: Jordan (F), Spieth (15), Fleetwood (12), Scott (12), Clark (11), Kim (10), Rozner (7) The Cameron Smith Entertainment Rollercoaster continues to whistle around Hoylake at breakneck speed. Having hit the turn in 34, after those back-to-back bogeys and that outrageous scramble on 9, he\u2019s bogeyed 10 and now flayed his drive into deep oomska to the left of 11. He thrashes a 9-iron through the waist-high grass and sends his ball into another swale. Time for some more wedge-based escapology, perhaps? He\u2019s currently level par and who knows which direction he\u2019ll be heading in next. Meanwhile it\u2019s a par on 18 for the 2009 champion Stewart Cink, and an excellent blemish-free round of 68. Two no-nonsense putts for the 6ft 8in South African amateur Christo Lamprecht on 18. That\u2019s his seventh birdie of the day, and he\u2019s signing for a sensational five-under opening round of 66. That\u2019s the second-lowest first round by an amateur in Open history, behind Tom Lewis\u2019s 65 at Sandwich in 2011 and ahead of Jordan Niebrugge\u2019s 67 at St Andrews in 2015. It ties for the second-lowest amateur total in any round, matching the 66s of Frank Stranahan (Troon 1950), Tiger Woods (Lytham 1996), Justin Rose (Birkdale 1998) and Paul Dunne (St Andrews 2015). And there\u2019s more! Lamprecht, who plays college golf in the US, is here because he won the Amateur Championship last month, becoming only the third player out of Georgia Tech to do so. One of the other two? The legendary Bobby Jones, who won his Amateur Championship in 1930 as part of his famous Grand Slam season \u2026 that also included winning the Open at Hoylake. No further comment, other than to remind you all that dreaming is free. -5: Lamprecht -a- (F) -3: Cink (17) -2: Jordan (F), Kim (8), Hojgaard(7), Siem (8), Rozner (5) The veteran Marcel Siem is enjoying a late career renaissance. The 43-year-old German\u2019s triumph at this year\u2019s Indian Open was his first on the DP World Tour since 2014, and he\u2019s since finished tied for second at the European Open and tied for 10th at the Made in Himmerland. He finished 15th at last year\u2019s Open, too, and is out of the blocks quickly today. Birdies at 1, 4 and 5 \u2013 the latter so nearly an eagle \u2013 and he joins Stewart Cink in second spot at -3. Cameron Smith is also fearless. The reigning champion pulls his tee shot at the par-three 9th down a swale to the left of the green, and he\u2019s left with a tricky chip. But he clips it crisply from 65 feet to 18 inches, and in goes the par saver. He\u2019s an absolute magician. Meanwhile up on 18, Christo Lamprecht lashes his second over the flag to 47 feet. The new Amateur Champion will have a long look at eagle for an opening round of 65. On Sky Sports, the former PGA champ Rich Beem says he\u2019ll be surprised if Lamprecht doesn\u2019t turn professional very soon, and parlay his talent into spending money. Christo Lamprecht is fearless. He smashes his tee shot at 18 down the right-hand side of the fairway, worried not a jot about the out-of-bounds line mere yards away. Ah the certainties of youth. He\u2019s now got the ideal line into the green. Birdie here for 66 wouldn\u2019t match the lowest first round by an amateur in the Open \u2013 that\u2019s 65 by Tom Lewis at Sandwich in 2011 \u2013 but it would beat the second-lowest on record, a 67 shot by Jordan Niebrugge at St Andrews in 2015. Patrick Reed, having dropped a stroke at 17, pars the last and signs for an opening round of 70. He walks off in a slightly disappointed fashion, his last putt having stopped half-a-dimple short of dropping. Cameron Smith meanwhile backs up his birdie at 7 with another at 8, the reward for knocking his approach pin high to six feet. The defending champion moves back into red figures. The leader Christo Lamprecht pays the price for that wayward drive down 16. Bogey, but it doesn\u2019t rattle him too much, and he finds the centre of the green at the terrifying short par-three 17th. That\u2019s all you can ask, all anyone wants. Two putts to remain one clear of the 2009 champ. He nearly drains the 30-footer he\u2019s left with, but the ball stops stubbornly on the lip, and must be tapped in for the par. -4: Lamprecht -a- (17) -3: Cink (15) -2: Jordan (F), Pieters (17), Kim (6), Hojgaard (5), Siem (4), Bland (4) Tommy Fleetwood is going along nicely. Birdies at 5 and 7 sandwich bogey at 6, and he\u2019s -1. Cameron Smith is also in Entertainment Mode, following up bogey at 6 by rolling in a confident 20-footer at 7. The bounce-back birdie brings the defending champ back to level par. But on 8, it\u2019s a first bogey of the week for world number one Scottie Scheffler, who coquettishly hitches up a leg of the old metaphorical trousers to reveal that very real Achilles heel: a short putt pulled left. That exactly the problem that put paid to his Scottish Open bid. He\u2019s -1. Jordan Spieth moves back into the red after playing 11 pretty much perfectly. A drive crashed down the right-hand side of the fairway, and an iron screwed to six feet. In goes the birdie putt, and he\u2019s -1 again. Meanwhile it\u2019s back-to-back birdies for 2017 Players champion Kim Si-woo, at 4 and now 5, and he joins the group at -2. But that doesn\u2019t give him a share of second, because Stewart Cink birdies 15, and is now just two behind the leader at -3. Time to turn another page of the fairytale. Christo Lamprecht finds greenside rough at the par-five 15th in two, then gently wedges to four feet. He nearly misses the short birdie putt, but it drops, and the big amateur reclaims sole ownership of the lead. But he sends his tee shot at 16 into a spot of bother down the right, and with Thomas Pieters further up the hole making double bogey \u2013 the result of being forced to chip out sideways from a fairway bunker - it would appear that we\u2019re now reading this fairytale at flick-book speed. Look at this! -5: Lamprecht -a- (15) -2: Jordan (F), Reed (16), Pieters (16), Cink (14), Straka (11), Scheffler (7), Kim (5), Siem (4), Bland (3) Thomas Pieters joins Christo Lamprecht in the lead! He drains a 30-footer across the par-five 15th for eagle. The 31-year old Belgian has never delivered at the Open, but he\u2019s got high finishes at the Masters and the PGA on his CV, albeit back in 2017 and 2018 respectively. Time to build on that early-career promise? Pieters, by the way, is six feet and five inches tall, which means the combined height of the leading duo (Lamprecht is 6ft 8in) crashes through the 13-feet barrier by a whole inch. An Open record? It can\u2019t be far off, can it? -4: Pieters (15), Lamprecht -a- (14) Lucas Herbert isn\u2019t the only one loudly crashing down the standings. Jordan Spieth sends his tee shot at 8 into a Native Area, with predictable consequences. He runs up a double-bogey six, and like Herbert before him, finds himself back at level par. Lucas Herbert takes two to get out of the bunker on 17. Two more putts and that\u2019s a triple-bogey six. Whatever you think about its brazenly punitive design, this hole is going to make for appointment viewing on Sunday. Herbert slips to level par, and now Christo Lamprecht stands alone in the lead \u2026 which is now two strokes, because he bumps in a delicate wedge from 50 yards for birdie at 14! What a story this is turning into. -4: Lamprecht -a- (13) -2: Jordan (F), Reed (14), Pieters (14), Cink (13), Scheffler (5) Big bother for the co-leader Lucas Herbert at the controversial new par-three 17th. The hole is only playing at 126 yards today, but the green is a proper upturned saucer. Miss the flat portion at your peril. That\u2019s what Herbert does, pulling his tee shot to the left, then whistling a clumsy chip up and across the green, down a swale on the other side, and into a deep bunker. He\u2019s got an awkward lie, and he\u2019ll do well not to run up a big number here. He could become the week\u2019s first big casualty of this hellishly tricky hole; if he does, he won\u2019t be the last. The local hero Matthew Jordan creams a perfect drive down the left-hand side of the 18th fairway \u2013 there\u2019s out of bounds to the right \u2013 but sends his second into thick rough. No matter: he wedges wisely into the heart of the green, and settles for a two-putt par. The crowd erupts as he signs for a magnificent opening round of 69. Stewart Cink may be nicely placed at -2, but a few other veteran former winners are struggling. While the 50-year-old trucks on, the following trail in his wake: Darren Clarke and Ernie Els are +2 through 13 and 9 respectively; Louis Oosthuizen, who had gone out in 34, doubled 10 before dropping further strokes at 11 and 12 to slip to +3; Henrik Stenson is also +3, through 11; and Padraig Harrington, who still harbours hopes of playing his way into Europe\u2019s Ryder Cup team, drops four strokes in three holes between 4 and 6, and plummets to +4. Much better news to report for those reading down under: Lucas Herbert eagles 15 to bring a little professionalism to the top of the leaderboard! The 27-year-old Aussie, who finished in a tie for 15th at St Andrews last year, joins Christo Lamprecht at -3. Meanwhile an ominous rumble from behind, as the tee-to-green maestro Scottie Scheffler makes his second birdie of the day, at 4. If he gets his occasionally misbehaving putter going this week, the rest of the field may as well pack up and go home. He\u2019s first in pretty much every metric, bar the flat stick: the world number one is only ranked 130th on tour! Strange game, golf. -3: Herbert (15), Lamprecht -a- (12) -2: Jordan (17), Reed (13), Cink (11), Spieth (7), Scheffler (4) Cameron Smith looked confident when opening his defence with that birdie. But since then he\u2019s been a tad wayward. A tee shot wide right at 2. He makes par. But he goes wide left with his tee shot at 3, and this time it costs him. His second disappears down a swale to the left of the green, then a heavy-handed chip trundles off the other side. He nearly drains a putt up the bank for an outrageous save, but the ball shaves the lip and he drops back to level par. Christo Lamprecht will be used to dizzy heights: he stands at 6ft 8ins after all. But there are dizzy heights, and dizzy heights, and leading the Open is something else. He makes his first mis-step of the day, dropping a stroke at 11. He remains one clear, but there\u2019s now a pack on his shoulder, with local boy Matthew Jordan and 2018 Masters winner Patrick Reed joining Stewart Cink in second after birdies at 16 and 12 respectively. -3: Lamprecht -a- (11) -2: Jordan (16), Reed (12), Cink (10) You\u2019ll have spotted the 2015 nearly man Jason Day sneaking onto our leaderboard. He\u2019s just carded back-to-back birdies at 4 and 5. He\u2019s going round with Jordan Spieth, and the par-five 5th has ignited the 2017 champ\u2019s round; birdie moves him into red figures after a steady start. No mean feat, either: of the 62 players currently out on the course, only 16 are under par. The 22-year-old South African amateur Christo Lamprecht keeps on keepin\u2019 on! He birdies 10 to move to -4 and increase his lead to two shots! Seeing you ask, because we\u2019re all thinking about it, the lowest opening round by an amateur at the Open was the 65 shot by Tom Lewis at Sandwich in 2011. And while we\u2019re at it, two of the three amateurs to win the Open have done so at Hoylake: the aforementioned Bobby Jones in 1930, and Harold Hilton in 1897. Frank Stranahan came second here in 1947, too. But let\u2019s not get too far ahead of ourselves. Give it another hour at least. -4: Lamprecht -a- (10) -2: Cink (9), Day (5) Rickie Fowler pays the price for his errant opening drive. He sends his second into a pot bunker to the right of the green, takes two to get out, and ends up with an opening bogey. Magnificent birdie for his partner Shane Lowry, though, as the 2019 winner strokes in a gentle right-to-left curler from 15 feet. Par for Bob MacIntyre. A couple of big birdies to report. The defending champion Cameron Smith parlays his fine opening tee shot into a fuss-free birdie, arrowing his approach to ten feet and rolling in the putt. Meanwhile a crowd-teaser up on 2, where the world number one Scottie Scheffler tickles a 25-footer towards the hole. The ball stops momentarily on the lip before toppling in. Two of the tournament favourites waste no time in moving into red figures. You know you\u2019re popular when you get a louder cheer than Rickie Fowler. Everyone loves Rickie, and he receives a huge ovation before sending his opening drive into the rough down the right. But then Robert MacIntyre steps up. Scotland hasn\u2019t produced a Champion Golfer of the Year since Paul Lawrie broke Jean van de Velde\u2019s heart at Carnoustie in 1999, and the 26-year-old from Oban is the old country\u2019s best bet for a long while. The roar he\u2019s given is deafening, fuelled by sympathy for that near miss at the Scottish Open last weekend, no doubt. What a 3-wood into 18 he hit \u2026 but all for nowt. But it\u2019ll have given him confidence, and he splits the fairway with a booming drive. An excitable crescendo follows the ball down the track. The 2019 champion Shane Lowry isn\u2019t short of fans either, and he finds the fairway too. Could you get a more fan-friendly three-ball? Scottie Scheffler powers his second into 1 to set up a birdie chance from 12 feet. But he seriously underhits the putt and looks disappointed as he tidies up for par. Tommy Fleetwood is much happier with his four, after flying his approach over the back, from where he gets up and down. Adam Scott makes it three pars out of three from the group. \u201cThese are the days us golf nerds live for,\u201d begins Steve Pye, speaking for us all. \u201cThere\u2019s something special about the first day of the Open \u2013 and the second, third and fourth days \u2013 although I\u2019m not sure my wife shares my enthusiasm. As I watched the first tee shot at 6.35am she looked at me and said: \u2018Why is there golf on our television at this time of day?\u2019 My tip is Rickie Fowler, which means everyone else should avoid him. The last time I backed a winner was Harrington in 2007, ironically picked by my wife. After I collected the winnings we went for a curry, and I said to her that I had no idea she had heard of Padraig Harrington. \u2018It all sinks in eventually,\u2019 she sighed.\u201d Cameron Smith begins his defence of the title. He\u2019s not messing around, either. Looking as calm as you\u2019d expect, the easy-going Aussie creams his opening drive down the middle. He\u2019s followed there by partners Xander Schauffele and the new US Open champion Wyndham Clark. What\u2019s been the problem, everyone? Meanwhile the 2009 dreamwrecker champion Stewart Cink birdies 5 and 7 to move into second spot on this early leaderboard. -3: Lamprecht -a- (8) -2: Cink (7) -1: Jordan (13), Herbert (12), Pieters (9), Oosthuizen (8), Burns (4), Cantlay (1) Neither Brooks Kopeka nor Patrick Cantlay can find the 1st green from their positions wide left of the fairway. The former sends his second to the right, short-siding himself behind a bunker, and ends up with an opening bogey; the latter however makes an outrageous birdie, having sent his second down a swale to the right, before whistling an undulating putt up, down and up onto the green, then in. Had it not been bang on line, it would still have been travelling today. And people say he\u2019s slow. He\u2019s -1. A huge roar at the 1st as another local lad, Tommy Fleetwood, takes to the tee. But before he can hit, the world number one Scottie Scheffler has a crack. He receives a warm ovation as well, the Open gallery recognising game as it always does. Scheffler becomes the latest to tug his opening shot into the rough down the left \u2026 then Fleetwood and the third member of a stellar group, Adam Scott, follow him in. Nobody wants to find either of the bunkers down the right of the fairway, that much is clear. The 2011 Masters champion Charl Schwartzel earlier illustrated exactly why: he found one of them and ended up with a double-bogey six. Brooks Koepka and Patrick Cantlay take turns to send their opening drives over the startled heads of the spectators lining the left-hand side of the 1st fairway. Those tee shots are beyond wild, though there shouldn\u2019t be too much danger over there, the grass already flattened by all the human traffic. Still, there haven\u2019t been too many opening tee shots bothering the fairway this morning. The strategically placed bunkers messing with everyone\u2019s head. Meanwhile the leader Christo Lamprecht is this close to making yet another birdie, this time at 7, but his swinging 15-foot putt stops a dimple short. He remains at -3. \u2026 the 22-year-old South African amateur Christo Lamprecht! Playing in his first Open, as reward for winning the Amateur Championship last month, he\u2019s birdied 3, 5 and 6 to hit the top of the famous yellow leaderboard. And here\u2019s a funny thing: Lamprecht studies at Georgia Tech, as did the legendary Bobby Jones, one of only two other men from the Georgia Institute of Technology to win the Amateur Championship. Jones won the Amateur as part of his famous 1930 Grand Slam season \u2026 that also included winning the Open at Hoylake. Blimey. Here, what if \u2026 no, it\u2019s not even 10am on Thursday morning, we can\u2019t start thinking like this. -3: Lamprecht -a- (6) -1: Jordan (11), Herbert (10), Larrazabal (9), Reed (8), Pieters (7), Oosthuizen (6), Cink (5) Another salvage job from the sand here. It\u2019s made by Matthew Jordan at 11, who finds himself right up against the steep face of a greenside bunker. The situation looks almost impossible, but he opens his wedge and swings as hard as he can, launching the ball almost completely vertically to escape in one sensational swipe. He can only land 30 feet from the flag, but that\u2019s still some result from where he was. A bogey, but that could have been so much worse. The local lad slips to -1 and out of the lead, which is now held by \u2026 Jordan Spieth can\u2019t make his birdie putt on 1, but an opening par will always suffice at the Open. As for his playing partners, Jason Day pars as well, but it\u2019s a dropped shot for Matt Fitzpatrick, although walking off, he won\u2019t be too upset, as it could have been worse: having hit a weak wedge into a bunker, he did extremely well to get up and down to limit the damage. From one Jordan to another \u2026 here comes the ever-entertaining Mr Spieth. The 2017 champion sends his opening tee shot into the rough down the right. That\u2019s not ideal, but then Matt Fitzpatrick trumps it by pulling over the heads of the punters lining the left-hand side of the fairway. A nervy one from the slightly out-of-sorts 2022 US Open champ. He gets a break, a relatively decent lie near a dust track, but sends his next one into rough wide right of the green, where he\u2019ll be short-sided and with a bunker to navigate as well. Spieth however responds by guiding his second into the heart of the green, and he\u2019ll have a look at birdie from 15 feet or so. Jordan\u2019s birdie at 2 was the first of the week. The first eagle of the week has been made by Pablo Larrazabal. The 40-year-old Spaniard rakes a 35-foot right-to-left curler across the par-five 5th, and that\u2019s why you see him tucked in behind the leader at -1. Larrazabal\u2019s best finish at the Open, and indeed any major, is a tie for 30th at Sandwich in 2011, so a sustained challenge is unlikely \u2026 but then again he\u2019s won twice on the DP World Tour in the last four months, at the Korea Championship and the KLM Open, so you can understand why he\u2019s currently striding the links in the confident style. The first shot of the 151st Open was hit by Matthew Jordan. The 27-year-old from Hoylake has been a member at his local club since he was seven, so knows the place pretty well. Still, taking the first shot at the oldest major makes things a bit different, not least because the 1st is the 17th for the members in the course\u2019s everyday configuration. He had half of Liverpool looking on from the gallery, as well, or at least that\u2019s what it felt like. So you couldn\u2019t blame him for tugging his tee shot nervously into the thick rough down the left. But he gathered himself, advancing his ball into a greenside bunker, from where he got up and down for par. And now, having made several big putts along the way, he\u2019s reached the turn in 33 strokes, birdies at 2, 5 and 8 more than compensating for a single dropped stroke at 6. The local hero leads the Open! Not bad for someone who has only played in it once before, last year at St Andrews, where he missed the cut. Now look! -2: Jordan (9) -1: Fox (7), Larrazabal (6), Ballester Barrio -a- (5), Lamprecht -a- (4), J Smith (1) Welcome to our coverage of the 151st Open Championship at Royal Liverpool, where so many questions will be answered over the next four days. Will Cameron Smith become the first player to retain the Claret Jug since Padraig Harrington in 2008? Will Rory McIlroy repeat his 2014 win here, thus ending his subsequent nine-year major drought? Will Rickie Fowler, runner-up behind Rory that year, crown his 2023 return to prominence with that long-awaited maiden major? Will a surprise champion emerge from the pack as Wyndham Clark did at the US Open last month? (Tom Kim? Bob MacIntyre? Why not?) Will this year\u2019s Masters champion Jon Rahm, PGA winner Brooks Koepka, or world number one Scottie Scheffler lift their first Claret Jug? Will comparatively out-of-sorts former champion golfers Collin Morikawa, Shane Lowry or Jordan Spieth suddenly click and land their second title? Will Viktor Hovland, out in the final pairing on Sunday at last year\u2019s Open and this year\u2019s PGA, finally get over the line in a major? Will Tommy Fleetwood, links expert and another Open nearly-man, seal the deal at last? Will the in-form Tyrrell Hatton finally enter the winner\u2019s circle? Or copter a club out into the Dee Estuary in a glorious fit of pique? Or will Xand\u2026 but we could be here all day, couldn\u2019t we. In fact, we will be here all day, but that time will surely be better spent on action as opposed to preambulatory yakking. So without further ado, let\u2019s mosey on out there. Hoylake ahoy!

Ukraine\u2019s military claimed to shoot down five cruise missiles and 13 attack drones out of 19 cruise missiles and 19 drones launched by Russia in total. Suspilne reported that in Mykolaiv a three-storey building was struck, and residential buildings and about 15 garages were damaged in the city. 19 victims are known, with two of them hospitalised, including a child. In Odesa, due to the attack four people were injured and a security guard was killed. An administrative building was destroyed, and houses were damaged by the blast wave. Warehouses were hit in the region. Odesa\u2019s governor has reported that the Chinese consulate in the city was damaged. Another person was killed in an attack in Kharkiv region. Ukraine\u2019s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy offered condolences to the victims, saying \u201cOdesa. Mykolaiv. Russian terrorists continue their attempts to destroy the life of our country. But the evil state has no missiles that are more powerful than our will to save lives, support each other and win.\u201d After the attacks, Ukrainian presidential adviser Andriy Yermak made another appeal for tougher sanctions against Russia and more air defence supplies for Ukraine, tweeting: \u201cWe must unite against Russian evil. Russia\u2019s economy should suffer a devastating sanctions blow, the military-industrial complex should be limited in its ability to produce weapons, and Ukraine should receive more weapons for defence of the sky and offensive actions.\u201d A teenage girl has died in a Ukrainian drone attack on north-west Crimea, the Moscow-back governor of the occupied peninsula has said. Authorities in Crimea, which Russia unilaterally annexed from Ukraine in 2014, have declared a municipal state of emergency in the area. Russia likely made the decision to quit the Black Sea grain deal \u201csome time ago because it decided that the deal was no longer serving its interests\u201d, the UK\u2019s Ministry of Defence has said in its latest intelligence update on the war. Russia is responsible for a major global food supply crisis, the European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said on Thursday, some days after the Kremlin announced it would suspend an agreement for Ukrainian grain exports through the Black Sea. Grain prices have jumped after Russia\u2019s attacks on Ukrainian ports. On Wednesday Ukrainian officials said Russian strikes had destroyed 60,000 tonnes of grain awaiting export. Germany is working with allies to ensure that Ukrainian grain is not left to rot in silos, and will intensify work on getting the grain out by rail, foreign minister Annalena Baerbock said on Thursday. Ukraine will receive a $1.5bn (\u00a31.17bn) loan from the World Bank guaranteed by the government of Japan, Ukrainian prime minister Denys Shmyhal said on Thursday. The US warned that Russia may attack civilian ships on the Black Sea and then blame Ukrainian forces. Russia says all ships travelling to Ukrainian ports on Black Sea will be considered carriers of military equipment from Thursday. Russia\u2019s defence ministry said it would \u201cflag countries of such ships \u2026 considered parties to the Ukrainian conflict\u201d. The ministry did not say what actions it might take. Ukraine\u2019s ministry of defence has reciprocated, warning that \u201call vessels heading in the waters of the Black Sea in the direction of seaports of the Russian Federation and Ukrainian seaports located on the territory of Ukraine temporarily occupied by Russia may be considered by Ukraine\u201d as carrying military cargo. Yevgeny Balitsky, head of the Russian-imposed administration of the occupied Zaporizhzhia region of Ukraine has described the situation on the frontline there as \u201cstabilized\u201d, claiming \u201cthe enemy is not taking active actions. Our command understands that this lull is just an attempt by the enemy to recuperate after significant losses of equipment and manpower.\u201d The Belarus Red Cross has sparked international outrage after its chief told Belarusian state television that the organisation is actively involved in bringing Ukrainian children from Russian-occupied areas to Belarus. Both Ukraine and the Belarusian opposition have labelled the transfers unlawful deportations, and there have been calls for international war crimes charges for the authoritarian Belarus leader, similar to the charges against Russian president Vladimir Putin. Russian media sources are reporting that Russian President Vladimir Putin will address the Brics summit in South Africa remotely on 23 August. Earlier this week it was announced that by \u201cmutual consent\u201d between South Africa and Russia, Putin would not travel to the summit, as South Africa might be obliged to act on the ICC warrant for the Russian leader\u2019s arrest. Britain has added individuals and groups with links to Russia\u2019s Wagner group and operating in Central African Republic and Mali to its sanctions list. Britain named Vitalii Viktorovitch Perfilev as head of the Wagner group in the CAR and said he would be subject to an asset freeze and travel ban. Russia said on Thursday it was imposing restrictions on British diplomats, requiring them to give five days\u2019 notice of any plans to travel beyond a 120-km (75-mile) radius, due to what it called London\u2019s \u201chostile actions\u201d. British diplomats, with the exception of the ambassador and three other senior diplomats, will be required to send notification of any plans to travel beyond the 120-km (75-mile) \u201cfree movement zone\u201d at least five working days ahead. The lawfulness of the UK sanctions regime set up in the wake of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine will face its biggest legal test, when a Soviet-era oligarch and ally of Roman Abramovich seeks a court order to release his assets, which include two private jets. The case being brought by Eugene Shvidler, a billionaire oil businessman, follows similar challenges by oligarchs now entering the courts in Europe where a separate but similar sanction regime operates. Shvidler\u2019s request for the release of his assets is the first case to reach the UK high court involving an individual. A number of other cases are waiting to be heard if he succeeds. A video has appeared purporting to show the Wagner mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin addressing his fighters in Belarus and calling the Russian war effort in Ukraine a \u201cdisgrace\u201d, in the first footage of the Russian warlord to emerge since his mutiny last month. In it, Prigozhin says Wagner will no longer fight in Ukraine and will head to Africa. \u201cWhat is happening at the front [in Ukraine] now is a disgrace in which we do not need to participate,\u201d he said. \u201c[We will] wait for the moment when we can prove ourselves in full.\u201d An Australian photographer has spoken of her pain and upset at what she has described as the unauthorised use of an image of her daughter as the basis for a pro-Russia mural on a bombed-out building in Mariupol. Helen Whittle said she was \u201cvery saddened\u201d by the way her daughter\u2019s portrait had been used by Italian street artist Ciro Cerullo."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b22307", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/jul/20/russia-ukraine-war-live-updates-deaths-reported-mykolaiv-strikes-missiles-odesa-targeted", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Russia-Ukraine war live: Moscow restricts British diplomats\u2019 movements over support for Ukraine", "lead": "Kremlin says it will require five days\u2019 notice of any plans to travel beyond a 120-km (75-mile) radius", "author": "Mattha Busby (now); Martin Belam and Helen Livingstone (earlier)", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 14:02:58", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.229406", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/b0fba707c70f848f2558ff8710f267f4c0e482b8/562_41_5697_3419/500.jpg", "body": "Ukraine will receive a $1.5bn (\u00a31.17bn) loan from the World Bank guaranteed by the government of Japan, Reuters reports the Ukrainian prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, said on Thursday. Both Russia and Ukraine have now declared that they will treat vessels in the Black Sea as carrying military cargo, which would make them potential strike targets. Ukraine\u2019s ministry of defence issued this statement on Thursday afternoon, saying: The Russian Federation has once again brutally violated the universal right to free navigation for the whole world and is deliberately undermining food security, condemning millions of people to starvation. By openly threatening civilian ships transporting food from Ukrainian ports, launching missile attacks and drone attacks on civilian infrastructure in peaceful cities, deliberately creating a military threat on trade routes, the Kremlin has turned the Black Sea into a danger zone, primarily for Russian ships and ships heading in the waters of the Black Sea in the direction of seaports of the Russian Federation and Ukrainian seaports located on the territory of Ukraine temporarily occupied by Russia. The responsibility for all risks lies entirely with the Russian leadership. The fate of the cruiser \u201cMoskva\u201d proves that the defence forces of Ukraine have the necessary means to repel Russian aggression at sea. The ministry of defence of Ukraine warns that from 00:00 on 21 July, 2023, all vessels heading in the waters of the Black Sea in the direction of seaports of the Russian Federation and Ukrainian seaports located on the territory of Ukraine temporarily occupied by Russia may be considered by Ukraine as such carrying military cargo with all the associated risks. The wording of the final paragraph precisely echoes that of the earlier statement from Russia\u2019s ministry of defence, which came after Russian withdrew from the Black Sea grain initiative and then launched three consecutive nights of attacks on the port cities of Odesa and Mykolaiv which had been part of the deal. In its statement, the Russian defence ministry said: In connection with the termination of the Black Sea initiative and the curtailment of the maritime humanitarian corridor, from 00.00 Moscow time on 20 July 2023, all ships proceeding to Ukrainian ports in the Black Sea waters will be considered as potential carriers of military cargo. Accordingly, the flag countries of such ships will be considered involved in the Ukrainian conflict on the side of the Kyiv regime. A number of sea areas in the north-western and south-eastern parts of the international waters of the Black Sea have been declared temporarily dangerous for navigation. Relevant information warnings about the withdrawal of safety guarantees for seafarers have been issued in the prescribed manner. Russia said on Thursday it was imposing restrictions on British diplomats, requiring them to give five days\u2019 notice of any plans to travel beyond a 120km (75-mile) radius, due to what it called London\u2019s \u201chostile actions\u201d. Britain\u2019s charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires in Russia was summoned to the foreign ministry in Moscow to be scolded for what Moscow said was support for the \u201cterrorist actions\u201d of Ukraine and for obstruction of Russian diplomacy in Britain. \u201cThe British side was also informed of the decision to introduce a notification procedure for the movement of employees of British diplomatic missions on the territory of our country as a response to London\u2019s hostile actions,\u201d Reuters reports the ministry said. British diplomats, with the exception of the ambassador and three other senior diplomats, will be required to send notification of any plans to travel beyond the 120km (75-mile) \u201cfree movement zone\u201d at least five working days ahead. \u201cSuch a document should contain information about the timing, purpose, type of trip, planned business contacts, accompanying persons, type of transport, places of visit and accommodation, as well as the route of the trip,\u201d the ministry said. Russia has lifted restrictions on cargo vessels moving through the Kerch strait between the Azov and Black seas, three industry sources told Reuters on Thursday. One of the sources said navigation was open during daylight hours only. The movement of cargo vessels through the Kerch strait was suspended by Russian authorities on 16 July following drone attacks on the Crimean port of Sevastopol. Russia unilaterally occupied and annexed Crimea in 2014. A peer in the UK House of Lords has suggested that Russia could be offered the prospect of Nato membership in exchange for its withdrawal from Ukraine. The journalist, broadcaster and prominent Sikh Indarjit Singh told the House of Lords that offering Nato membership would damage Russian president Vladimir Putin\u2019s strongman persona and help bring world peace, PA reports. The independent crossbench peer said: Mr Putin likes to depict himself as a strongman defending Mother Russia against the perceived threat from the Nato alliance. It would totally destroy Putin\u2019s credibility and help end the suffering of the Ukrainian people and further the cause of world peace if the west were to openly offer Russia the bait of membership of Nato in return for its total withdrawal from Ukraine. Foreign Office minister Tariq Ahmad responded: \u201cI\u2019m sure Lord Singh is well intentioned but I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t agree with this proposition \u2026 There can be someone who can stop this war \u2013 that is Mr Putin and he can stop it right now.\u201d Singh said in October: If we were to say that we will disband Nato it might just give Putin the escape route he so desperately requires? If that does not work, it will at least show the Russian people what sort of person Putin is. Ukraine\u2019s foreign ministry has condemned a warning by Russia that any ships travelling to Ukrainian Black Sea ports will be seen as possibly carrying military cargoes. \u201cThe ministry of foreign affairs of Ukraine strongly condemns any threats to use force against civilian ships, regardless of their flag,\u201d it said. It came as Ukraine\u2019s defence ministry said it would consider all ships travelling to Russian ports and Ukrainian ports on the Black Sea occupied by Moscow as potential carriers of military cargo from 21 July, Reuters reports. The ministry said the Ukrainian armed forces had the means to repel what it called Russian aggression at sea. Ukraine\u2019s deputy economy minister held talks with China\u2019s vice-commerce minister in Beijing today in the first high-level visit by a Ukraine government official to the country since 2019. A source told Reuters that a meeting between Ukraine\u2019s Taras Kachka and China\u2019s Ling Ji took place in Beijing. It came around the time that China\u2019s consulate general building in Odesa was damaged in a Russian attack on the city late last night Kyiv time. China has a \u201cno limits\u201d partnership with Moscow. But Ling said China was willing to work with Ukraine to develop mutually beneficial bilateral economic and trade cooperation between the two countries, according to a Chinese commerce ministry account of the meeting. Kachka, according to the Chinese commerce ministry, said: The Ukrainian side will step up efforts to protect the safety of Chinese-funded enterprises in Ukraine. We are willing to work together with China to promote the healthy and sustainable development of economic and trade relations between the two countries.\u201d The meeting came on a day of high diplomacy in Beijing. Veteran US diplomat Henry Kissinger also met with Xi Jinping in Beijing\u2019s park-like Diaoyutai State Guesthouse, with Chinese senior diplomat Wang Yi also in attendance, the Associated Press reports. Russia\u2019s defence ministry has characterised its overnight attacks in the Black Sea ports of Odesa and Mykolaiv as \u201cretaliatory strikes\u201d. Moscow had promised retaliation for an attack on Monday with seaborne drones that damaged the bridge linking Crimea, seized from Ukraine in 2014, with southern Russia. The attack coincided with Moscow\u2019s decision not to extend the grain deal after accusing the west of failing to honour a parallel memorandum intended to facilitate Russia\u2019s agricultural and fertiliser exports. Since then, Russia has directed nightly bombardments at Ukraine\u2019s port facilities and fuel and grain stores, Reuters reports. The defence ministry said: [It had] continued to deliver retaliatory strikes with high-precision sea and air-based weapons at workshops and storage sites for unmanned boats in the regions of Odesa and Chornomorsk. In the area of the city of Mykolaiv, fuel infrastructure facilities and ammunition depots of the armed forces of Ukraine were destroyed. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has sent his condolences to the families of the two people who were killed in Russian attacks on Odesa and Mykolaiv overnight. Russian terrorists continue their attempts to destroy the life of our country. Unfortunately, there are wounded and dead... My condolences to the families and friends! But the evil state has no missiles that are more powerful than our will to save lives, support each other and win. I thank everyone who defends our cities, our people, our sky! I am grateful to all our warriors, rescuers, doctors, local authorities, volunteers... to everyone involved in eliminating the consequences of Russian terror! There are conflicting reports over how many people were killed, though reports so far have not exceeded two. At least 27 were also injured in Russia\u2019s overnight attacks, which targeted Odesa and Mykolaiv for a third successive night. The UK Foreign Office has announced sanctions against 13 individuals and businesses linked to the actions of the Wagner group in Mali, Sudan and the Central African Republic. Wagner\u2019s leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, who led a mutiny against Moscow last month, has already had sanctions place on him by Britain, along with several of his key commanders, for their part in Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Andrew Mitchell, minister for development and Africa, said: The Wagner group is committing atrocities in Ukraine, as well as acting with impunity in countries like Mali, Central African Republic and Sudan. Wherever Wagner operates, it has a catastrophic effect on communities, worsens existing conflicts and damages the reputations of countries that host them. Instructors from the mercenary group Wagner have begun training the ex-Soviet country\u2019s special forces, nearly a month after an aborted rebellion in Russia, officials in Belarus have said. Wagner fighters and their leader were due to move to Belarus as part of a deal to defuse their revolt, AFP reports. \u201cOver the course of a week, special forces units and representatives of the company will practise combat tasks at the Brestsky training ground,\u201d the Belarusian defence ministry said. Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko offered Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin refuge in Belarus and said his army would benefit from the combat experience of Wagner commanders. Last night, a video emerged purporting to show Prigozhin addressing his fighters in Belarus, in what was the first footage of the mercenary chief since the aborted rebellion. He was seen telling his troops they will spend some time in Belarus training its military to help \u201cmake the Belarusian army the second strongest army in the world\u201d before deploying to Africa. The Polish defence ministry said it would strengthen security at the border following the arrival of Wagner mercenaries in Belarus. The Kremlin today said it was \u201cconcerned\u201d by the move, pointing to Warsaw\u2019s \u201chostile attitude\u201d towards both Belarus and Russia. The EU has said it has decided to prolong its sanctions against Russia by six months, until the end of January, over the country\u2019s military aggression against Ukraine. The Council of the EU said: These sanctions, first introduced in 2014 in response to Russia\u2019s actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine, were significantly expanded since February 2022, in response to Russia\u2019s unprovoked and unjustified military aggression against Ukraine. The Washington Post reports that Ukraine has begun firing cluster munitions that were controversially provided by the US. Russian forces on the frontlines of the invasion in south-eastern Ukraine have come under attack from the indiscriminate weapons that can remain unexploded. The UN has said Russia has used the widely prohibited weapons in populated areas of Ukraine at least 24 times since the beginning of hostilities. Col Oleksandr Bakulin told the BBC earlier this week that the weapons were necessary to \u201cinflict maximum damage on enemy infantry\u201d. A Ukrainian official told the Washington Post that they have been fired at entrenched Russian positions. Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, commander of the Ukrainian army\u2019s ground forces, appears confident that Bakhmut, which sits about 55 miles north of Donetsk, can be retaken. In an interview with the BBC, he explained the strategic importance of the city: Bakhmut is the centre of concentration of the main directions and roads. Well, for example, a road from Debaltsevo, a road from Seversk, a road from Gorlovka, a road from Konstantinovka and a road from Slavyansk go through Bakhmut. That is, this is the centre where all these paths converge. Literally three kilometres beyond Bakhmut, the next city of Chasov Yar begins. And here it is very important for us to stop the enemy in Bakhmut, which is located in the lowland there. He said yesterday that Ukraine was preparing to fire cluster bombs, a controversial and widely banned indiscriminate form of munitions, at Russia\u2019s \u201cfragile\u201d defences within days. Kyrgyzstan has denied helping its ally Moscow circumvent sanctions imposed over its invasion of Ukraine but did not rule out the involvement of private companies. The Washington Post reported on Tuesday that US officials were particularly concerned about the role played by Kyrgyzstan in Russian schemes to evade sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine, and to acquire hi-tech items such as Chinese drones, according to Reuters. The newspaper stated that the Biden administration is preparing new economic measures to pressure the country to halt sanctions busting. \u201cWe would regret it if among the many dozens of countries seeing a much greater trade volume of the banned supplies, some people in Washington decided to pick on Kyrgyzstan,\u201d said the Kyrgyz official who spoke on condition of anonymity. \u201cKyrgyzstan is a free market economy with very limited government resources. We cannot be reasonably expected to police every entrepreneur and approve every transaction.\u201d The official added that \u201cneither the Kyrgyz state itself nor any state structures and companies are involved in the violation of the regime of compliance with sanctions imposed by the United States and Western countries on Russia\u201d. The Kremlin said yesterday that Kyrgyzstan was a close partner that benefited from integration with Russia. \u201cWe intend to further develop bilateral relations with Kyrgyzstan, which we value very highly, as well as all formats of our joint integration,\u201d spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said. China\u2019s ambassador to the US, Xie Feng, has told a security forum in Colorado, on the issue of the Ukraine war, that Beijing respects countries\u2019 sovereignty and territorial integrity but also acknowledges \u201clegitimate and reasonable security concerns\u201d. As noted below, China says it is neutral in the conflict, but in practice has shown Russia support by organising frequent state visits and joint military drills with Moscow. In a rare public address in Prague, the head of MI6 accused China of being \u201cabsolutely complicit\u201d in Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. My colleague Helen Davidson reports that the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, and Vladimir Putin signed a \u201cno limits\u201d partnership between their countries shortly before the Russian invasion. After the war began, China refused to publicly censure or discourage Russia, and senior officials often expressed direct support. The intervention by Sir Richard Moore, who has been chief of the British Secret Intelligence Service since 2020, came as veteran US diplomat Henry Kissinger met today with Xi in Beijing\u2019s park-like Diaoyutai State Guesthouse, with Chinese senior diplomat Wang Yi also in attendance, the Associated Press reports. \u201cThe US policy toward China requires the diplomatic wisdom like that of Kissinger and political courage like Nixon\u2019s,\u201d Wang said, according to the foreign ministry. The ministry said the two sides also discussed the war in Ukraine, as well as artificial intelligence and other economic issues. Wang told Kissinger that it was \u201cimpossible\u201d to transform, encircle or contain China. Kissinger also held talks with the defence minister, Li Shangfu, who is barred from visiting the US over arms sales he oversaw with Russia. It\u2019s Mattha Busby here, taking over the blog from Martin Belam. I\u2019m on Twitter here or email mattha.busby@theguardian.com Ukrainian sources have confirmed that two people have been killed and at least 27 injured in Russia\u2019s overnight attacks, which have targeted Odesa and Mykolaiv for a third successive night. Ukraine\u2019s military claimed to shoot down five cruise missiles and 13 attack drones out of 19 cruise missiles and 19 drones launched by Russia in total. Suspilne reported that in Mykolaiv a three-storey building was struck, and residential buildings and about 15 garages were damaged in the city. 19 victims are known, with two of them hospitalised, including a child. In Odesa, due to the attack four people were injured and a security guard was killed. An administrative building was destroyed, and houses were damaged by the blast wave. Warehouses were hit in the region. Odesa\u2019s governor has reported that the Chinese consulate in the city was damaged. Another person was killed in an attack in Kharkiv region. Ukraine\u2019s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy offered condolences to the victims, saying \u201cOdesa. Mykolaiv. Russian terrorists continue their attempts to destroy the life of our country. But the evil state has no missiles that are more powerful than our will to save lives, support each other and win.\u201d After the attacks, Ukrainian presidential adviser Andriy Yermak made another appeal for tougher sanctions against Russia and more air defence supplies for Ukraine, tweeting: \u201cWe must unite against Russian evil. Russia\u2019s economy should suffer a devastating sanctions blow, the military-industrial complex should be limited in its ability to produce weapons, and Ukraine should receive more weapons for defence of the sky and offensive actions.\u201d A teenage girl has died in a Ukrainian drone attack on north-west Crimea, the Moscow-back governor of the occupied peninsula has said. Authorities in Crimea, which Russia unilaterally annexed from Ukraine in 2014, have declared a municipal state of emergency in the area. Russia likely made the decision to quit the Black Sea grain deal \u201csome time ago because it decided that the deal was no longer serving its interests\u201d, the UK\u2019s Ministry of Defence has said in its latest intelligence update on the war. Russia is responsible for a major global food supply crisis, the European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said on Thursday, some days after the Kremlin announced it would suspend an agreement for Ukrainian grain exports through the Black Sea. Grain prices have jumped after Russia\u2019s attacks on Ukrainian ports. On Wednesday Ukrainian officials said Russian strikes had destroyed 60,000 tonnes of grain awaiting export. Germany is working with allies to ensure that Ukrainian grain is not left to rot in silos, and will intensify work on getting the grain out by rail, foreign minister Annalena Baerbock said on Thursday. The US warned that Russia may attack civilian ships on the Black Sea and then blame Ukrainian forces. Russia says all ships travelling to Ukrainian ports on Black Sea will be considered carriers of military equipment from Thursday. Russia\u2019s defence ministry said it would \u201cflag countries of such ships \u2026 considered parties to the Ukrainian conflict\u201d. The ministry did not say what actions it might take. Yevgeny Balitsky, head of the Russian-imposed administration of the occupied Zaporizhzhia region of Ukraine has described the situation on the frontline there as \u201cstabilized\u201d, claiming \u201cthe enemy is not taking active actions. Our command understands that this lull is just an attempt by the enemy to recuperate after significant losses of equipment and manpower.\u201d The Belarus Red Cross has sparked international outrage after its chief told Belarusian state television that the organisation is actively involved in bringing Ukrainian children from Russian-occupied areas to Belarus. Both Ukraine and the Belarusian opposition have labelled the transfers unlawful deportations, and there have been calls for international war crimes charges for the authoritarian Belarus leader, similar to the charges against Russian president Vladimir Putin. Russian media sources are reporting that Russian president Vladimir Putin will address the Brics summit in South Africa remotely on 23 August. Earlier this week it was announced that by \u201cmutual consent\u201d between South Africa and Russia, Putin would not travel to the summit, as South Africa might be obliged to act on the ICC warrant for the Russian leader\u2019s arrest. Britain has added individuals and groups with links to Russia\u2019s Wagner group and operating in Central African Republic and Mali to its sanctions list. Britain named Vitalii Viktorovitch Perfilev as head of the Wagner group in the CAR and said he would be subject to an asset freeze and travel ban. Russia\u2019s foreign ministry has summoned the British interim charge d\u2019affaires in Moscow. Odesa\u2019s governor has reported that the Chinese consulate in the city was damaged in the overnight strike by Russia. On Telegram, Oleh Kiper posted: As a result of the Russian night attack, the building of the consulate general of the People\u2019s Republic of China in Odesa was damaged. The aggressor deliberately hits the port infrastructure. Administrative and residential buildings, as well as the consulate of the People\u2019s Republic of China, were damaged. This suggests that the enemy does not pay attention to anything. Britain has added individuals and groups with links to Russia\u2019s Wagner group and operating in Central African Republic and Mali to its sanctions list. Reuters reports that in its statement on Thursday, Britain named Vitalii Viktorovitch Perfilev as head of the Wagner group in the CAR and said he would be subject to an asset freeze and travel ban. Reuters also reports that Russia\u2019s foreign ministry has summoned the British interim charge d\u2019affaires in Moscow. More details soon \u2026 Ukrainian sources have confirmed that two people have been killed and at least 27 injured in Russia\u2019s overnight attacks, which have targeted Odesa and Mykolaiv for a third successive night. Nineteen people were wounded in the city of Mykolaiv, and a security guard was killed and at least eight others were hurt in Odesa, including a child. Ukraine claims it shot down five missiles and 13 drones after Russia launched 19 of each. Reuters reports one of the people was killed in Russian shelling in the north-eastern region of Kharkiv, regional authorities said. Earlier this week Moscow said the attacks on Ukrainian port cities on Tuesday were meant as retaliation for blasts on a bridge used to transport Russian military supplies, which it blamed on Kyiv. Ukraine\u2019s president has used his social media channels to comment on the overnight attacks on Ukraine. On his Telegram channel, Volodymyr Zelenskiy wrote: Odesa. Mykolaiv. Russian terrorists continue their attempts to destroy the life of our country. Unfortunately, there are wounded and dead. My condolences to the families and friends. But the evil state has no missiles that are more powerful than our will to save lives, support each other and win. I thank everyone who defends our cities, our people, our sky. I am grateful to all our warriors, rescuers, doctors, local authorities, volunteers \u2026 to everyone involved in eliminating the consequences of Russian terror. I am grateful to the port workers who do their best to preserve our infrastructure. To the builders and repair teams who help people restore normal living conditions. Together we will make it through this terrible time. And we will withstand the attacks of Russian evil. Germany is working with allies to ensure that Ukrainian grain is not left to rot in silos after Russia pulled out of an export deal, and will intensify work on getting the grain out by rail, the foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said on Thursday. Speaking on the sidelines of a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels, Baerbock accused Russia of blackmail and trying to use the grain as a weapon at the expense of the world\u2019s poorest. \u201cHundreds of thousands of people, not to say millions, urgently need the grain from Ukraine, which is why we are working with all our international partners so that the grain in Ukraine does not rot in silos in the next few weeks, but reaches the people of the world who urgently need it,\u201d Reuters reports Baerbock said. Russian media sources are reporting that the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, will address the Brics summit in South Africa remotely on 23 August. Earlier this week it was announced that by \u201cmutual consent\u201d between South Africa and Russia, Putin would not travel to the summit, as South Africa could be obliged to act on the ICC warrant for the Russian leader\u2019s arrest. Yevgeny Balitsky, head of the Russian-imposed administration of the occupied Zaporizhzhia region of Ukraine, has posted on Telegram about the status of the frontline in the region, which Russia partially occupies. He wrote: The situation has stabilized \u2026 the enemy is not taking active actions. However, our command understands that this lull is just an attempt by the enemy to recuperate after significant losses of equipment and manpower. The message was accompanied by an image that purports to be from Vasylivka. Balitsky claimed: Evidence of [Ukrainian armed forces\u2019] difficulty and anger was yesterday\u2019s chaotic shelling of peaceful Vasylivka by artillery pieces \u2013 three shells of cannon artillery, aiming at civilian infrastructure. The House of Culture was destroyed, residential buildings, roads were damaged, a gas pipe was broken, the glazing of apartments in an apartment building was damaged by a shock wave. One woman born in 1954 was injured, she received medical assistance, her life and health are not in danger. The claims have not been independently verified. Russia announced it would annex Zaporizhzhia in September 2022. Here are a couple more images from Mykolaiv, which Russia struck overnight. Authorities in Crimea, which Russia unilaterally annexed from Ukraine in 2014, have declared a municipal state of emergency in the area where a drone struck earlier. [See 4.25 BST] Suspilne, Ukraine\u2019s state broadcaster, offers this round-up of overnight news from Ukraine. It reports: At night, the Russian Federation launched over Ukraine seven Onyx cruise missiles, four Kh-22 cruise missiles, three Kalibr cruise missiles, five Iskander-K cruise missiles and 19 Shahed drones. Air defence forces shot down two Kalibrs, three Iskanders and 13 drones. In Mykolaiv, they hit a three-storey building, part of the building was destroyed, and they continue to clear the debris there. Residential buildings and about 15 garages were damaged in the city. Currently, 19 victims are known, two of them are hospitalised, including a child. In Odesa, due to a rocket attack, four people were injured, one more person may be under the rubble, mayor Trukhanov said. In the city, the administrative building was destroyed, and houses were damaged by the blast wave. Warehouses were hit in the region. In Sumy, a drone hit the building of a children\u2019s camp on the outskirts of the city, an injured woman was treated on the spot. In Chernihiv region drones hit residential buildings, the number of victims is being specified. Kherson and Dnipropetrovsk regions were also under fire at night. Residential buildings and an infrastructure object were damaged. There are no casualties. The claims have not been independently verified. Russia is responsible for a major global food supply crisis, the European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said on Thursday, some days after the Kremlin announced it would suspend an agreement for Ukrainian grain exports through the Black Sea. \u201cWhat we already know is that this is going to create a big and huge food crisis in the world,\u201d Reuters reports Borrell told journalists before heading into a EU foreign ministers\u2019 meeting. Borrell also accused Russia of deliberately attacking grain storage facilities in the southern port city of Odesa, which he said would further deepen the food crisis. The Ukrainian presidential adviser Andriy Yermak has made another appeal for tougher sanctions against Russia and more air defence supplies for Ukraine, tweeting: We must unite against Russian evil. Russia\u2019s economy should suffer a devastating sanctions blow, the military-industrial complex should be limited in its ability to produce weapons, and Ukraine should receive more weapons for defence of the sky and offensive actions. Here is a reminder that earlier the Russian ministry of defence said that it would now be treating all ships heading to Ukrainian ports as potential carriers of military cargo. In a statement, the ministry said: In connection with the termination of the Black Sea initiative and the curtailment of the maritime humanitarian corridor, from midnight Moscow time on 20 July 2023, all ships proceeding to Ukrainian ports in the Black Sea waters will be considered as potential carriers of military cargo. Accordingly, the flag countries of such ships will be considered involved in the Ukrainian conflict on the side of the Kyiv regime. A number of sea areas in the north-western and south-eastern parts of the international waters of the Black Sea have been declared temporarily dangerous for navigation. Relevant information warnings about the withdrawal of safety guarantees for seafarers have been issued in the prescribed manner. Police in Odesa have announced some road closures as they deal with the consequences of the overnight attack on the city, Suspilne reports. This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog in London. You can contact me at martin.belam@theguardian.com. The wires have sent through some pictures from Mykolaiv, where the governor said earlier that 18 people had been injured in Russian missile strikes overnight. Ukraine\u2019s military shot down five cruise missiles and 13 attack drones launched by Russian forces overnight at the southern Mykolaiv and Odesa regions, Reuters has reported citing Kyiv\u2019s air force. It said Russia fired 19 cruise missiles and 19 drones in total, but did not specify exactly where the others struck. Later today the lawfulness of the UK sanctions regime set up in the wake of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine will face its biggest legal test, when a Soviet-era oligarch and ally of Roman Abramovich seeks a court order to release his assets, which include two private jets. The case being brought by Eugene Shvidler, a billionaire oil businessman, follows similar challenges by oligarchs now entering the courts in Europe where a separate but similar sanction regime operates. At stake is billions of pounds worth of assets, some of which the west wants to siphon off to help fund Ukraine\u2019s reconstruction. Shvidler\u2019s request for the release of his assets is the first case to reach the UK high court involving an individual. A number of other cases are waiting to be heard if he succeeds. Russia likely made the decision to quit the Black Sea grain deal \u201csome time ago because it decided that the deal was no longer serving its interests\u201d, the UK\u2019s Ministry of Defence has said in its latest intelligence update on the war. Russia has masked this with disinformation, claiming its withdrawal is instead due to concerns that civilian ships are at risk from Ukrainian mines and that Ukraine was making military use of the grain corridor without providing evidence for these claims. It added that Russia\u2019s Black Sea fleet (BSF) would now likely take a more active role in disrupting any trade that continues. However BSF blockade operations will be at risk from Ukrainian uncrewed surface vehicles and coastal defence cruise missiles. The Belarus Red Cross has sparked international outrage after its chief told Belarusian state television that the organisation is actively involved in bringing Ukrainian children from Russian-occupied areas to Belarus. A report that aired on Wednesday on Belarus state TV showed Dzmitry Shautsou, the head of the Belarus Red Cross, visiting the Russian-occupied Ukrainian city of Lysychansk in the Luhansk region. In the footage, he says the organisation was actively involved in bringing Ukrainian children to Belarus for \u201chealth improvement\u201d purposes. \u201cThe Belarus Red Cross has taken \u2013 and is taking, and will be taking \u2013 an active part in it,\u201d Shautsou said. Both Ukraine and the Belarusian opposition have labelled the transfers unlawful deportations, and there have been calls for Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko to be charged with international war crimes over them, like Russian president Vladimir Putin. Russia launched a series of missile and drone attacks on port and grain infrastruture in southern Ukraine on Wednesday in a likely bid to \u201cfurther emphasize Russia\u2019s objections to the renewal of the Black Sea grain deal and hinder Ukraine\u2019s ability to export grain,\u201d the Institute for the Study of War has written in its latest analysis. The US-based thinktank writes: Spokesperson of the Ukrainian southern operational command Captain of the First Rank Nataliya Humenyuk stated that the Russian July 19 strikes \u201chappened virtually simultaneously,\u201d and that Russian forces likely attempted to overwhelm the Ukrainian air defense systems. Ukrainian Air Forces spokesperson Colonel Yuriy Ihnat stated that this attack was the most intense missile and drone attack on Odesa Oblast since the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022. The wires have sent through a series of images from the village of New York (yes that\u2019s correct), near the frontlines in Ukraine\u2019s eastern Donetsk region, by photographer Genya Savilov. Grain prices have jumped after Russia\u2019s attacks on Ukrainian ports, which follow its decision to pull out of a year-long deal that allowed Kyiv to export grain to world markets via its Black Sea ports. On Wednesday Ukrainian officials said Russian strikes had destroyed 60,000 tonnes of grain awaiting export. Reuters reports: Chicago wheat futures rose 1.6% to hit a three-week high on Thursday, buoyed up by growing expectations that an attack on Ukrainian ports after Russia\u2019s withdrawal from a Black Sea export deal will have longer-term impact on global supplies. Corn gained more than 1%, while soya beans were little changed on forecasts of hot and dry weather in the US midwest. \u201cRussia\u2019s overnight attack on infrastructures at the port of Odesa will have served to remind participants and observers as to the risks involved in maintaining Black Sea trade flows without a guarantee of safety,\u201d BMI Research, a unit of Fitch Group, said in a note. The most-active wheat contract on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) added 1.6% to $7.39-1/4 a bushel, as of 0203 GMT, after climbing more than 8% on Wednesday. The market hit its highest since 27 June at $7.39-3/4 a bushel. Corn rose 1.1% to $5.59-1/4 a bushel and soya beans were unmoved at $14.08-3/4 a bushel. The \u201cterrorists\u2019 attack on Odesa\u201d shows that Russia is not just targeting Ukraine but also other countries, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his daily evening address late Wednesday. \u201cAbout a million tons of food is stored in the ports that were attacked today. This is the volume that should have been delivered to consumer countries in Africa and Asia long ago,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone is affected by this Russian terror.\u201d This third night of Russian attacks targeting southern coastal cities comes as the US warned that Russia may attack civilian ships on the Black Sea and then blame Ukrainian forces. \u201cThe Russian military may expand their targeting of Ukrainian grain facilities to include attacks against civilian shipping,\u201d national security council spokesperson Adam Hodge told AFP on Wednesday. He said the allegation was based on newly declassified intelligence. The warning came hours after Moscow said it would consider all ships sailing on the Black Sea to Ukrainian ports as potential military targets. The Kremlin pulled out of an international deal allowing safe passage of massive Ukrainian grain exports across the Black Sea to world markets earlier this week. Read the full story: A total of 18 people have been wounded in the strikes on Mykolaiv, the governor Vitaliy Kim has said. Nine were taken to hospital, including five children. Two people were rescued from the rubble, he said on Telegram. \u201cIt is a miracle they were saved,\u201d he said. He gave no further information on the deaths he had reported earlier. A teenage girl has died in a Ukrainian drone attack on north-west Crimea, the Moscow-back governor of the occupied peninsula has said. \u201cAs a result of an enemy UAV [drone] strike on one of the settlements in the north-west of Crimea, four administrative buildings were damaged. [Emergency] services are on site,\u201d Sergei Aksyonov said in a Telegram post. Deaths have been reported in Mykolaiv after Russia launched strikes on the southern port city, the Ukrainian military and the local governor have said. The city centre was hit in the attack and a garage and three-storey residential building were set on fire, governor Vitaliy Kim said on Telegram. Nine people were wounded, including five children, Kim said, later adding \u201cthere are also dead\u201d. Two people were also hospitalised after strikes on Odesa, the military said. The Black Sea port has already endured two nights of Russian bombardment after Moscow said it was pulling out a deal that allowed Ukrainian grain to be exported via Ukraine\u2019s Black Sea ports. Earlier the military had warned that both cities were being targeted by Kh-22 anti-ship missiles. Hello and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the war in Ukraine with me, Helen Livingstone. An unconfirmed number of people have been killed and nine injured, including five children, in a Russian missile strike on the southern port city of Mykolaiv, the Ukrainian military has said. In a series of Telegram posts, the military warned the city was being targeted by Kh-22 anti-ship missiles and later said a garage and a three-storey building in the city centre had been hit. It also said Odesa, which has already endured two nights of strikes, was being targeted and reported \u201cstrong explosions\u201d. Two people were in hospital. The bombardments come after Russia said its decision to withdraw from a year-long deal that allowed Ukrainian grain to be exported via Black Sea ports was final. In other developments: Russia says all ships travelling to Ukrainian ports on Black Sea will be considered carriers of military equipment from Thursday, days after quitting the Black Sea grain deal. Russia\u2019s defence ministry said it would \u201cflag countries of such ships \u2026 considered parties to the Ukrainian conflict\u201d. The ministry did not say what actions it might take. US officials have information indicating Russia has laid additional sea mines in the approaches to Ukrainian ports, said Adam Hodge, White House national security council spokesperson. \u201cWe believe that this is a coordinated effort to justify any attacks against civilian ships in the Black Sea and lay blame on Ukraine for these attacks,\u201d he said. The developments came after the Black Sea port Odesa endured a second \u201chellish night\u201d of attacks, with Russia targeting grain facilities and port infrastructure. The strikes were an effort to stop Ukrainian grain reaching world markets, said Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. A video has appeared purporting to show the Wagner mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin addressing his fighters in Belarus and calling the Russian war effort in Ukraine a \u201cdisgrace\u201d, in the first footage of the Russian warlord to emerge since his mutiny last month. In it, Prigozhin says Wagner will no longer fight in Ukraine and will head to Africa. \u201cWhat is happening at the front [in Ukraine] now is a disgrace in which we do not need to participate,\u201d he said. \u201c[We will] wait for the moment when we can prove ourselves in full.\u201d Vladimir Putin will attend a Brics summit in South Africa next month via video conference amid speculation that he could be detained under an international criminal court warrant for his arrest for war crimes in Ukraine if he appeared in person. South Africa is an ICC member, meaning they would have been obliged to arrest Putin if he entered the country. The Belarus Red Cross has sparked international outrage after its chief told Belarusian state television that the organisation is actively involved in bringing Ukrainian children from Russian-occupied areas to Belarus. \u201cThe Belarus Red Cross has taken \u2013 and is taking, and will be taking \u2013 an active part in it, [the deportations]\u201d Dzmitry Shautsou told state-run Belarus 1 TV channel. Talks being mediated by Saudi Arabia and Turkey on the repatriation of Ukrainian thousands of children taken to Russia since Moscow\u2019s invasion have been under way since at least April, a source with knowledge of the discussions said on Wednesday according to Reuters. The source expressed doubt that a deal would be reached because it would depend on the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. \u201cFor him to give (the children) back would mean that he agrees that he\u2019s a war criminal,\u201d the source said. The US has announced $1.3bn in additional security assistance for Ukraine. The package is set to include air defence capabilities and munitions. \u201cThis announcement represents the beginning of a contracting process to provide additional priority capabilities to Ukraine,\u201d the Pentagon said in a statement on Wednesday. EU foreign ministers are expected to discuss a proposal on Thursday to spend up to \u20ac20bn ($22.4bn) on weapons, ammunition and other military aid for Ukraine over four years. The proposal is part of an effort to put the bloc\u2019s support for Kyiv on a longer-term footing. A fire broke out at the military training grounds in the Kirovske district on the Crimean Peninsula, the Moscow-backed governor of Crimea said on Wednesday. The fire forced the closure of the nearby Tavrida highway and the evacuation of 2,000 people, Sergei Aksyonov said on Telegram. Messaging channels linked to Russian security services and Ukrainian media said an ammunition depot was on fire at the base after a Ukrainian overnight air attack. The Wagner group\u2019s mutiny attempt in June showed Putin was under pressure, the head of Britain\u2019s MI6 foreign spy service, Richard Moore, said in a rare public address. Moore said he was optimistic about the Ukrainian counteroffensive appealed to Russians appalled by the war in Ukraine to spy for Britain. \u201cOur door is always open \u2026 Their secrets will be safe with us.\u201d The lawfulness of the UK sanctions regime set up in the wake of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine will face its biggest legal test on Thursday when a Soviet-era oligarch and ally of Roman Abramovich seeks a court order to release his assets. At stake in the case brought by Eugene Shvidler, a billionaire oil businessman, is billions of pounds worth of assets, some of which the west wants to siphon off to help fund Ukraine\u2019s reconstruction. An Australian photographer has spoken of her pain and upset at what she has described as the unauthorised use of an image of her daughter as the basis for a pro-Russia mural on a bombed-out building in Mariupol. Helen Whittle said she was \u201cvery saddened\u201d by the way her daughter\u2019s portrait had been used by Italian street artist Ciro Cerullo."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b22308", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/jul/20/byelections-conservatives-labour-rishi-sunak-keir-starmer-uk-politics-latest-news", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Voters head to polls in three byelections seen as test of Rishi Sunak\u2019s premiership \u2013 UK politics live", "lead": "Voters are picking new MPs in the constituencies of Somerton and Frome, Uxbridge and South Ruislip, and Selby and Ainsty", "author": "Nicola Slawson (now) and Alexandra Topping (earlier)", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 13:57:57", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.229426", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/8482653e147a41c90322685e1bb98b20e637b901/22_471_3932_2361/500.jpg", "body": "The government\u2019s sweeping and controversial asylum reforms have become law as the number of people crossing the Channel in small boats topped 14,000 for the year so far, PA news reports. The illegal migration bill has become an Act of Parliament after being given royal assent, deputy speaker Sir Roger Gale announced in the Commons on Thursday afternoon. It comes as Channel crossings for the year to date reached a provisional total of 14,071, after 297 people were recorded making the journey on Wednesday. The total number of migrant crossings for 2023 so far is still lower than the more than 15,000 arrivals recorded this time last year. Crossings continued on Thursday amid calm weather conditions at sea. Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng received about \u00a3400 in severance pay for every day they were in office, according to government accounts published on Thursday. The former prime minister and former chancellor each received more than \u00a316,000 on leaving their jobs after just a few weeks, the Treasury\u2019s annual report shows, while Tom Scholar, the department\u2019s most senior civil servant, received \u00a3457,000 after being sacked by Truss. The figures are contained in a series of annual reports from across government, which also show that Boris Johnson was given a payout of \u00a318,660 after quitting as prime minister. Truss and her allies saw Scholar, who was sacked on her first day in office, as representative of orthodox Treasury thinking, which they were determined to overhaul as part of their plan to bring in much lower UK tax rates. Meanwhile the Department for Transport\u2019s accounts show that Grant Shapps received \u00a316,876 after quitting as transport secretary in September, even though he returned to government as home secretary six weeks later. He is now energy secretary. Rishi Sunak, however, who spent just over three months out of government between quitting as chancellor and becoming prime minister, handed back his payout of the same amount. Labour criticised Johnson and Truss for taking their payments after resigning, the former after a series of ethics scandals and the latter amid economic turmoil created by her government\u2019s fiscal policies. UK mortgage rates rocketed after the Truss government\u2019s mini-budget last September, and have not returned to the same level since. Angela Rayner, Labour\u2019s deputy leader, said: After the mess they left our country in, they should be hanging their heads in embarrassment, not walking away with an enormous payoff. At a time when people up and down the country are struggling to pay their mortgages and put food on the table, it shows a staggering lack of shame for Johnson and Truss to accept this money, but is exactly what we\u2019ve come to expect from a bunch of Tories who only care about themselves. Read more here: The ongoing Stormont stalemate is \u201ctotally unsustainable\u201d, the Sinn F\u00e9in vice-president, Michelle O\u2019Neill, has said. This from PA Media: Following a meeting with the Northern Ireland secretary, Chris Heaton-Harris, at Hillsborough Castle, the Sinn F\u00e9in vice-president, Michelle O\u2019Neil, said engagement would continue, but stressed it had to be meaningful and lead to the restoration of the devolved power-sharing institutions. Heaton-Harris is concluding a round of talks with party leaders in the latest attempt to break the Stormont stalemate. The assembly has been in flux for more than a year amid DUP protest action over the Northern Ireland protocol. The Windsor framework was agreed by the EU and UK earlier this year as a way to reduce red tape on trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. But the DUP has insisted it will not return to Stormont until the UK government provides further legislative assurances around Northern Ireland\u2019s place within the UK internal market. Senior civil servants have been left running Stormont departments and having to make substantial cuts following a budget set by Heaton-Harris. After the meeting, O\u2019Neill said the British and Irish governments had to do more to bring Stormont back. She said: We have just had our meeting with the secretary of state and we have made it very clear to him that the current position is totally unsustainable, this vacuum isn\u2019t good enough, all it is serving is to punish the public. O\u2019Neill added: Whilst people within the DUP take themselves off on summer holidays, workers and families are left struggling and worrying about how they are going to deal with the cost-of-living issues. We have impressed upon the secretary of state that both himself, the British government and the Irish government must do more; this position just isn\u2019t tenable. We need to see action, the public rightly expect that everybody will work together. We have heard from the secretary of state that they intend to be engaged over the summer, but there is a difference between engagement, and engagement which is actually meaningful and leads to a restoration of the executive. Heaton-Harris met earlier this week with the DUP, Alliance party and the SDLP in London. The DUP leader, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, said after his meeting on Wednesday the \u201cball is in the government\u2019s court\u201d with regards to action which would see the restoration of the Stormont power-sharing arrangements. Donaldson said there had so far been a \u201clack of meaningful action\u201d from Westminster in addressing his concerns over post-Brexit trading arrangements. Heaton-Harris has been pressing the parties on their plans for a costed programme for government for any incoming executive. Rishi Sunak has criticised the European Union\u2019s \u201cregrettable choice of words\u201d after it appeared to have endorsed the name Argentina uses for the Falkland Islands. A diplomatic row erupted after the EU referred to the islands as \u201cIslas Malvinas\u201d in a declaration jointly signed with Argentina and other Latin American countries, PA Media reports. Downing Street said any suggestion that the EU would recognise Argentina\u2019s claims on the Falklands would have been \u201centirely unacceptable\u201d, as it welcomed a subsequent clarification that EU countries have not in fact changed their position on their status. The initial statement, published on Tuesday after a summit between EU nations and the Celac bloc of Latin American and Caribbean states, said: Regarding the question of sovereignty over the Islas Malvinas / Falkland Islands, the European Union took note of Celac\u2019s historical position based on the importance of dialogue and respect for international law in the peaceful solution of disputes. British diplomats reportedly complained about the wording, which Argentina\u2019s president, Alberto Fernandez, appeared to hail on Twitter as support for his country\u2019s long-standing \u201cclaim to sovereignty\u201d over the Falklands. In a statement, the EU foreign affairs spokesman, Peter Stano, said: The EU member states have not changed their views and positions concerning the Falklands/Islas Malvinas. The EU is not in a situation to express any position on the Falklands/Islas Malvinas, as there is not any council discussion on this matter. Sunak\u2019s official spokesman told reporters on Thursday: The prime minister\u2019s view is that it would have been entirely unacceptable for the EU to question the Falkland Islanders\u2019 right to decide their own future. To be clear, the Falkland Islands are British, that was the choice of the islanders themselves. The EU has rightly now clarified that their position on the Falklands has not changed after their regrettable choice of words. And just as a reminder, in the 2013 referendum, 99.8% of islanders voted to be part of the UK family. It\u2019s a position supported by international law and the UN charter which is binding on all UN members. And we will continue to defend the Falklands\u2019 right to self-determination in all international forums and have called on the EU to respect the democratic rights of the Falkland Islands. He added: The concern is any suggestion that EU states would recognise Argentina\u2019s claims on the Falklands, which they have now clarified is incorrect. The islands were the subject of a war in 1982 which killed 255 British service personnel, three islanders and 649 Argentinian personnel. Lobbying rules will be toughened up across Whitehall in a long-awaited response by ministers to issues raised by the Greensill scandal, the Guardian has learned. Government departments will be forced to release more information about meetings with lobbyists and extend current requirements for disclosure to phone and video calls, sources say. Private emails, as well as WhatsApps and texts on personal phones that are used to discuss government business, will also now need to be declared, and senior civil servants will have to comply with the new rules. The changes come nearly two years after a major report was published following the Greensill lobbying scandal, involving a multinational supply chain finance firm, the former prime minister David Cameron, serving ministers and top officials. Nineteen reforms were proposed by Nigel Boardman, a corporate lawyer who was commissioned by the government to conduct an independent investigation and published his findings in August 2021. In its response, the government will commit to improving the quality of departments\u2019 transparency disclosures, which cover meetings, gifts and hospitality, and are meant to guard against any perception of improper or secretive lobbying. Declarations will be aimed to be published monthly instead of quarterly under the plans to be announced later this week. Read the full story here: The controversial sacking of a top Treasury civil servant, Sir Tom Scholar, cost the government \u00a3457,000 in compensation, PA Media reports. The department\u2019s annual accounts reveal Scholar, who was dismissed as permanent secretary when Liz Truss came to power in September 2022, received a \u00a3335,000 severance payment along with \u00a3122,000 in annual leave adjustments, payment in lieu of notice and other payments. The accounts also show the extent of severance payments made to ministers in the wake of last year\u2019s mass resignations. Among those to receive severance payments was Chris Pincher, who resigned as deputy chief whip in June 2022 over allegations he groped two men at the Carlton Club. Pincher received \u00a37,920 in severance. The former prime ministers Truss and Boris Johnson received \u00a318,660 each after resigning, while the former chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng received \u00a316,876. The education secretary, Gillian Keegan, has confirmed that the controversial guidance to schools on trans pupils will now be delayed. Rishi Sunak had promised the guidance would be published before the end of the school year but it has been beset by ministerial in-fighting and legal wrangles. Keegan did not give any hint of when the guidance would now appear. In a written statement, Keegan said: It is vital that the guidance we publish gives clarity for schools and colleges and reassurance for parents. So, we have made the decision to allow more time \u2013 to speak to teachers, parents, lawyers and other stakeholders \u2013 in order to ensure this guidance meets the high expectations that these groups rightly have for it. The Law Society has said the illegal migration bill, expected to be given royal assent today, will be unworkable. Lubna Shuja, the president of the independent body for solicitors in England and Wales, said: We have been clear from the start that this legislation threatens to undermine the rule of law and access to justice. Whilst the act will soon come into force on paper, it will be unworkable in practice because it doesn\u2019t provide solutions to the asylum backlog, and there isn\u2019t capacity in the legal aid sector to provide the immigration advice needed. The Rwanda removal agreement has been ruled unlawful and is subject to an appeal in the supreme court. Even if that appeal proves successful, there are no other removal agreements in place. Rwanda alone would not be able to accept anywhere near the number of people who will be scheduled for \u2018removal\u2019. A growing number of people will be left in limbo as they cannot be removed, and they cannot claim asylum. The cost to the taxpayer will continue to increase as the individuals left in limbo are housed in various accommodation indefinitely. Ministers will lay out their final year of legislation at King Charles\u2019 first king\u2019s speech in November, the government has confirmed. Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the House of Commons, said on Thursday the king\u2019s speech will take place on 7 November, in what is likely to be the last such speech before a general election. The event will not only give the government a final chance to set the legislative agenda before that election but will also give the king his first chance to attend a state opening of parliament as monarch. Nigel Farage has praised a \u201cswift\u201d intervention by government ministers after reports that new laws could be drawn up to stop banks closing customers\u2019 accounts because they disagree with their political views. The former Ukip leader said MPs were \u201cbeginning to realise that this system is coming for them as well\u201d after his bank accounts were closed by Coutts, he says because his views \u201cdid not align with\u201d its values. Ministers are considering legislation to protect free speech by threatening banks with losing their licences if they blacklist people with controversial views, according to the Times. Farage said it was \u201cone of the swiftest interventions I\u2019ve seen by government for many, many years\u201d, and suggested it was a problem that had been \u201cbuilding up for years and years and years\u201d. He told PA media: Every MP will know of constituents, small businessmen and women, who\u2019ve literally been shut down by their banks with no reason given whatsoever. I also think that because of the politically exposed persons (PEP) rule, I think they\u2019re beginning to realise that this system is coming for them as well. Those designated a PEP are typically political representatives and their family members, whose accounts can be treated with extra due diligence by financial institutions. Farage claimed there was \u201ca real sense of anger\u201d among the public, who bailed out banks during the 2008 financial crisis, that now such banks could \u201ctreat us with contempt\u201d. The closure of Farage\u2019s accounts sparked outrage among senior Tory MPs, who have put pressure on Coutts and its owner, NatWest. The prime minister, Rishi Sunak, intervened in the row on Wednesday to say it was \u201cwrong\u201d and that \u201cno one should be barred from using basic services for their political views\u201d. Read more here: A senior Conservative MP has apologised and deleted a video in which he praised the Taliban and credited them with improving safety in Afghanistan. Tobias Ellwood said he was \u201csorry for my poor communication\u201d after his actions outraged fellow Tory MPs and military veterans, and an attempt was launched to challenge his role as chair of the Commons defence select committee. In a tweet and accompanying video, Ellwood described Afghanistan as a \u201ccountry transformed\u201d and talked up the group that seized power in August 2021, claiming \u201csecurity has vastly improved, corruption is down and the opium trade has all but disappeared\u201d. Following the backlash, Ellwood said: The last couple of days have probably been the most miserable as a member of parliament. I got it wrong. He called the row a Twitter \u201cstorm\u201d and said he stood by criticisms in the video about Britain\u2019s lack of engagement with Afghanistan\u2019s new leadership since the chaotic exit of western countries\u2019 armed forces from Kabul nearly two years ago. But Ellwood used a TV interview to repeatedly apologise, and said the video \u201ccould have been much better done\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s important to put your hand up and acknowledge errors, however well intentioned,\u201d the Bournemouth East MP and former army captain told TalkTV. Read the full story here: The Rail, Maritime and Transport union general secretary, Mick Lynch, has accused the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, of a \u201cdilution of traditional Labour positions\u201d and \u201ctaking the side of the Conservatives\u201d over the two-child benefit cap. Lynch told Sky News on Thursday: It\u2019s not just our members, we\u2019d like him to show that he supports the trade unions, that he supports working people who are struggling, and we think some of the stuff that we\u2019re hearing is a dilution of traditional Labour positions and even the positions that he himself adopted when he was elected as leader. So the stuff about the two-child cap is not really good enough; it\u2019s taking the side of the Conservatives, it\u2019s taking the side of austerity. Lynch said Starmer needs to show that he is a progressive Labour politician and that if he wants to win working-class votes and wants the support of the trade unions, then \u201che might want to start saying things that we can agree with\u201d. He continued: I\u2019m hoping that we\u2019ll get a new deal for workers, the repeal of many of these anti-trade union laws that restrict our rights and our freedoms, and that he shows that in terms of funding public services like education, health, care for our elders and addressing the housing crisis that we\u2019ve got in this country that he can do something positive in favour of working people. If he does that then more people will support him, if he doesn\u2019t then some people might conclude \u2026 they may as well have the Tories because there\u2019s not much difference between them. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true. I think it\u2019s in our interest to get rid of this government, but he\u2019s got to show some distinction and some distinguishing policies that set him out as different and as a radical person pushing for change. Staff working for MPs need better HR access and a more supportive culture in parliament, but the system through which they are directly employed by members does not need to change, a report by a committee of MPs has concluded. The speaker\u2019s conference on the employment conditions of members\u2019 staff, chaired by Lindsay Hoyle, the Commons speaker, was set up last year after a wave of stories about sexual harassment and bullying in parliament. There was particular concern that staff working directly for MPs, as opposed to those centrally employed by parliament, were vulnerable because the HR practices and working culture were directly set by the MP, who was also their employer. Before the inquiry, Hoyle called for a change to this system, suggesting the idea of setting up an outside employer, meaning staff would have independent input into their careers and concerns. But the report, produced by a cross-party group of 16 MPs, led by Hoyle, said the problems faced by staff were \u201cnot inherently related to the identity of the employer\u201d, and that changing the employer would be expensive, time consuming, and \u201cultimately a blunt instrument\u201d. They said: We conclude that the nature of the work of an MP, and the close working arrangements and personal loyalty between members and their staff mean that members should continue to be the employers of their staff. The report, which will be debated in the Commons before it is implemented, sets out other proposals, including universal access to professional HR, and reforms to the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, which has a significant role in the contracts and salaries of MPs\u2019 staff. More widely, the MPs said, there was a need for \u201ca culture which recognises and values the work that [MPs\u2019 staff] do and makes these staff feel part of the wider parliamentary community\u201d. Rishi Sunak told MPs at a meeting of the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers on the eve of the polls on Wednesday night that they faced a \u201ctough battle\u201d in what were seen as safe seats for his party. The prime minister told them that governing parties rarely win byelections but urged the MPs to unite in the face of any defeat as he pledged to \u201cthrow everything\u201d at winning the next general election, PA Media reports. Labour hopes to snatch Uxbridge and South Ruislip, which was Boris Johnson\u2019s seat until he quit, and Selby and Ainsty - vacated by his ally Nigel Adams\u2019 resignation. The Liberal Democrats are eyeing victory in the contest in Somerton and Frome that was triggered by David Warburton quitting after admitting cocaine use amid allegations of sexual harassment. Losses for the Tories in all of the seats would be the first time in 55 years that a government has been defeated in three byelections on the same day. On Wednesday evening, Sunak was understood to have told his MPs: In the coming months, I am going to set out more of what I would do if I had a full term. I was recently described as a full-spectrum, modern Conservative and you are going to see that in the programme I lay out. Sunak pledged to show the public \u201cwho is really on their side\u201d, adding: \u201cAnd that is what will propel us to victory.\u201d Sunak told the meeting. When we come back in September we have a choice to make, all of us. Do we come together and throw everything at winning the next election or not? I\u2019ve made my choice, I\u2019m all in with you to win. I promise you we can do this but we can only do it together as one team. The Tory backbencher Jonathan Gullis told reporters outside the meeting that the problem is \u201capathetic Conservative voters\u201d rather than the public\u2019s support for the Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer. He said Sunak told them \u201cwhat we already know, which is it\u2019s going to be a tough battle\u201d in the byelections. Tory MPs at the meeting said he did not address suggestions that he could spring a Cabinet reshuffle on Friday in an attempt to reset his premiership. During a visit to Warwickshire, Sunak told reporters asking whether he would shake up his top team that \u201cyou would never expect me to comment on things like that\u201d \u2013 in what was clearly not a denial. He welcomed a fall in the rate of inflation as proof his government\u2019s plans were working. The prime minister\u2019s press secretary acknowledged it would be tough for the Tories to hold the three seats on Thursday. She said: Byelections, for incumbent governments, are very difficult, that is the nature of them. The election that the Conservative party is most focused on is the general election. Polls have opened in three parliamentary seats where byelections are being held, with Rishi Sunak braced for an electoral test of his premiership. The Conservative-held constituencies are being targeted by Labour and the Liberal Democrats, who hope to overturn large majorities and send Tory MPs off into the summer recess nervous about their own political futures come the general election. Voters have been able to cast their ballots from 7am in the south-western Tory stronghold of Somerton and Frome, Boris Johnson\u2019s old seat in the west London suburbs Uxbridge and South Ruislip, as well as Selby and Ainsty in North Yorkshire. Sunak was privately downcast on Wednesday afternoon about the his party\u2019s electoral prospects, in part given the nature of why the contests were triggered. Johnson stood down to avoid being suspended from parliament over a report that found he misled MPs over Partygate. Nigel Adams quit after being passed over for a peerage. And David Warbuton, an MP in Somerset since 2015, quit after being investigated over claims of harassment and drug use. On top of the circumstances of the byelections being called, Sunak\u2019s party is also polling poorly, nationally. At a behind-closed-doors meeting of Tory backbenchers on the eve of the byelections, MPs said Sunak appeared to acknowledge the results would be \u201ctough\u201d. If the Conservatives are trounced, Sunak could become the first prime minister since Harold Wilson in 1968 to lose three byelections in a single day. I will be looking after the politics blog today.

Donald Trump faces serious charges in New York and Florida over a hush-money scheme during the 2016 election and his alleged mishandling of classified documents. As Trump prepares for those cases to go to trial, the former president is simultaneously reeling from a verdict that found him liable for sexual abuse and defamation toward writer E Jean Carroll. A New York jury awarded Carroll, who accused Trump of assaulting her in 1996, $5m in damages. And more criminal charges could be on the way for Trump in Georgia and Washington DC. Here is where each case against Trump stands: Classified documents case in Florida Status: Trump pleaded not guilty; trial scheduled for August Key figures: Charges: 31 counts of willful retention of national defense information under the Espionage Act, conspiracy to obstruct justice and false statements and representations, among others Summary: In the weeks before he left the White House in January 2021, Trump and his aides allegedly packed up hundreds of classified documents with his personal belongings and transported those documents to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Federal officials repeatedly tried to recover the classified materials, but prosecutors say Trump intentionally withheld dozens of documents from investigators and misled them as they attempted to locate the missing files. In May 2021, the National Archives sent a letter to Trump\u2019s lawyers asking them to return all presidential records, after officials realized that several important documents were missing. In January 2022, Trump\u2019s aides transferred 15 boxes of records to the National Archives. Some were marked as classified national security information, prompting a referral to the Department of Justice. In May 2022, a grand jury convened by the Department of Justice issued a subpoena to Trump, requiring him to return all remaining classified documents. In August 2022, a federal judge approved a search warrant for Mar-a-Lago amid concerns that additional classified documents remained in Trump\u2019s possession. FBI agents carried out the search days later, and they recovered more than 100 documents with classified markings. In November 2022, shortly after Trump announced his re-election campaign, the attorney general, Merrick Garland, appointed Jack Smith as special counsel to oversee both the documents case and the federal investigation into Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. In June, Smith indicted Trump on 37 federal counts, including 31 violations of the Espionage Act. Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges, and was released on bail. Judge Aileen Cannon set a trial start date of 14 August, in line with Smith\u2019s request for a \u201cspeedy trial\u201d. That date is widely expected to be pushed back. Smith has since requested an 11 December start date for the trial, while Trump\u2019s team have asked the judge to postpone the trial indefinitely. In July, Trump\u2019s valet and co-defendant in the documents case, Walt Nauta, pleaded not guilty to five criminal charges. Hush-money case in New York Status: Trump pleaded not guilty; trial forthcoming Key figures: Charges: 34 felony charges of falsifying business records Summary: The case involves a hush-money scheme during the 2016 presidential election. Trump\u2019s former lawyer Michael Cohen paid $130,000 to the adult film star Stormy Daniels to quash her story about having an extramarital affair with the former president. Trump has denied the affair took place. Prosecutors accuse the former president of illegally reimbursing Cohen for the hush-money payment by falsely classifying the transaction, executed by the Trump Organization, as legal expenses. In January 2018, the Wall Street Journal reported that Cohen arranged a payment of $130,000 to Daniels a month before the 2016 election to prevent her from speaking publicly about the alleged affair with Trump. In August 2018, Cohen pleaded guilty to federal charges of bank fraud, tax fraud and campaign finance violations in New York. Cohen claimed that Trump arranged the payment to Daniels, but the then-president was not charged. In July 2021, the Trump Organization and its longtime chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, were indicted on tax fraud charges. In August 2022, Weisselberg pleaded guilty to 15 charges, and he agreed to testify against the Trump Organization as part of his deal with prosecutors. In December 2022, the Trump Organization was found guilty on all counts of criminal tax fraud and falsification of business records. In January, the office of the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin Bragg, began presenting evidence to a grand jury on Trump\u2019s role in the hush-money scheme. In March, Bragg\u2019s office indicted Trump on 34 felony charges of falsifying business records. In April, Trump pleaded not guilty to all counts, and he was released from custody on his own recognizance. His next court date in the case is set for 4 December. January 6 case in Washington Status: Subpoenas issued by grand jury Key figures: Potential charges against Trump: Obstruction of an official proceeding, conspiracy to defraud the government and incitement of an insurrection Summary: On 6 January 2021, a group of Trump\u2019s supporters staged a violent attack on the US Capitol in an effort to disrupt the congressional certification of Joe Biden\u2019s victory in the 2020 election. A bipartisan Senate report later concluded that seven people died in connection to the insurrection. The House impeached Trump for inciting the insurrection, but the former president was acquitted by the Senate. He now faces potential criminal charges over his role in the attack. In June 2021, the House of Representatives voted to create a select committee to investigate the causes and consequences of the January 6 attack. In May 2022, a grand jury investigating the January 6 attack issued a subpoena to the National Archives requesting all White House documents given to the House select committee, indicating that federal prosecutors were following similar lines of inquiry. In November 2022, shortly after Trump announced his re-election campaign, the attorney general, Merrick Garland, appointed Jack Smith as special counsel to oversee both the federal investigation into Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election and the classified documents case. In December 2022, the House select committee voted unanimously to refer Trump to the Department of Justice for potential criminal charges over his role in the attack. The suggested charges include obstructing an official proceeding, conspiring to defraud the government and inciting or assisting an insurrection. The grand jury has continued to issue subpoenas and hear witness testimony in recent weeks. Jared Kushner, Trump\u2019s son-in-law and former White House adviser, testified before the panel in June, the New York Times reported. Trump said on Truth Social on 18 July that he received a letter informing him that he is a target in Smith\u2019s investigation into efforts to overturn the 2020 election. According to the Guardian\u2019s reporting, Smith\u2019s letter cited three potential charges against Trump, including conspiracy to violate civil rights and obstruction of an official proceeding. 2020 election meddling case in Georgia Status: Grand jury report finished; charging decisions expected this summer Key figures: Potential charges against Trump: Election code violations Summary: As part of his frantic efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, Trump infamously instructed the Georgia secretary of state, Republican Brad Raffensperger, to \u201cfind\u201d enough votes to rob Joe Biden of his win in the battleground state. The Fulton county district attorney, Fani Willis, has been investigating Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn Biden\u2019s victory in Georgia for more than two years. In May 2022, a special purpose grand jury was seated to hear evidence in the case. In August 2022, prosecutors informed Rudy Giuliani, one of Trump\u2019s former lawyers, that he was a target of the grand jury\u2019s investigation. In January, the grand jury finished its final report after hearing from 75 witnesses, and a judge recommended that the panel be dissolved. Willis suggested at the time that decisions of charges in the case were \u201cimminent\u201d, but no such announcement has yet been made. In February, portions of the grand jury report were made public, although a judge ruled the entirety of the report would remain secret. The publicly released portions revealed that the grand jury suspected multiple witnesses may have lied and committed perjury, but they did not shed light on whether Trump will face criminal charges. In late February, the forewoman of the grand jury revealed the panel had recommended that multiple people be indicted for interfering with the election. The names of those people were not disclosed, but the forewoman told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution: \u201cYou\u2019re not going to be shocked.\u201d In April, Willis said she expected to announce charging decisions this summer. According to two people with knowledge of the matter, Willis has signalled to her team that charging decisions may come starting the final week of July. In May, a court filing showed that half of the so-called fake electors who sought to declare Trump the winner of Georgia had accepted immunity deals from prosecutors. E Jean Carroll lawsuits in New York Status: First lawsuit going to trial; second lawsuit on appeal Key figures: Allegations against Trump: Defamation and sexual abuse Summary: The case centers on allegations by writer E Jean Carroll that Trump sexually assaulted her at a department store in 1996. Trump has denied the allegations while repeatedly attacking Carroll\u2019s character, and his actions are now at the center of two civil lawsuits. In June 2019, Carroll published an excerpt of her memoir, in which she accused Trump of sexually assaulting her in a dressing room at the Bergdorf Goodman department store in Manhattan. Trump quickly issued a statement denying the accusation, claiming he had never met Carroll. In November 2019, Carroll filed a defamation lawsuit against Trump, accusing him of having \u201csmeared her integrity, honesty and dignity\u201d. The case was repeatedly delayed amid legal wrangling over whether the federal government was allowed to step in to represent Trump in the case because he was a government official. A judge eventually rejected that effort, ruling the justice department could not fill Trump\u2019s shoes in the case because he was not acting in his official capacity as a government official when he made the defamatory comments about Carroll. In November 2022, on the same day that the Adult Survivors Act went into effect in New York, Carroll filed a second lawsuit against Trump accusing him of defamation and sexual battery. The Adult Survivors Act gave victims of sexual violence over the age of 18 a one-year window to file civil lawsuits against their alleged abusers, despite the statute of limitations. In March, a judge denied Carroll\u2019s request to consolidate the two lawsuits into one. Instead, the first lawsuit was put on pause as the second lawsuit moved forward. In April, the trial for Carroll\u2019s second lawsuit began. Carroll testified to the New York jury that Trump forcibly pulled down her tights in the department store dressing room, and the experience left her unable to explore romantic relationships. She also claimed that she was fired from her job as an advice columnist for Elle Magazine, where she worked for 26 years, because of Trump\u2019s defamatory comments. In May, the jury found Trump liable for sexual abuse and defamation, although the former president was not found liable for rape. The jury awarded Carroll about $5m in damages, but because it was a civil case, Trump did not face criminal charges in connection to the judgment. Trump has filed an appeal in the case. In June, a federal judge ruled that the original defamation lawsuit, in which Carroll is seeking damages of $10m, could move forward. A trial date has been set for January 2024."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b2230a", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2023/jul/20/county-cricket-gloucestershire-v-glamorgan-essex-v-kent-and-more-live", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "County cricket: Gloucestershire v Glamorgan, Essex v Kent, and more \u2013 live", "lead": "Keep up to date with all the matches around the county grounds", "author": "Tanya Aldred at Cheltenham College", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 13:53:26", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.229464", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/436ff758785f13f97eac2eccaf0a927a8739260c/0_270_4079_2449/500.jpg", "body": "Look out of the window absentmindedly for a minute or two and another fistful of wickets have fallen at Oakham school. Worcs now 145-9 \u2013 the lead 213. At Chelmsford, the roller is going up and down, up and down the covers, and the umpires are out taking another look. It has stopped raining but it looks pretty damp and I\u2019ve made the mistake of sitting in the pool at the back of my chair. Raining now at Edgbaston too, where Warwicks are 43-2, Yates and Davies removed by Bailey and Williams. I fancy Lancs for this if they can hold off the rain long enough. An email on poor old Nick Browne, who was forced out of Essex\u2019s game against Kent with concussion after being hit on the helmet last night. The author will remain anonymous as he apparently got too much ribbing last time he was mentioned on CCLive. Surely respect and praise would be the usual response, no? \u201cHe\u2019s having a v mixed week. He was in the Essex second team on Monday for their game v Surrey at Billericay. \u201cBut he only made six and the (4 day) match had to be abandoned on the opening day because of a dangerous pitch. Not much use if you\u2019re trying to find some form.\u201d Essex are currently 238-4, a lead of 31 over Kent, Critchley and Walter have so far put on 68 for the fifth wicket. SAC was earlier lbw for 87. Durham incidentally whooshing out of trouble, 45-2. Quite wet under my brolly here on the balcony, where play has paused with Glamorgan 120-1. Meanwhile at Headingley, Lyth and Bean are springing along, Yorks 32-0 from eight overs; and Worcestershire 115-6 in their second innings in the shoot-out at Oakham school. Worcestershire\u2019s lead an already impregnable 183. This was Leicestershire\u2019s Wiaan Mulder yesterday on the pitch. \u201cIt was an eventful day, a terrible day in terms of what the wicket produced. Nearly 20 wickets in one day is not great. It moved around all day. It wasn\u2019t really a fair contest between bat and ball and I don\u2019t think it is going to get a lot better, maybe a bit quicker. \u201cBut it has been under the covers for the last four days because there has been a lot of rain, which is not ideal when you are trying to prepare a wicket for a first-class game for the first time in 16 years.\u201d And the rain decides to fall properly, covers on, stands evacuated at Cheltenham. But what is afoot at Derby? Two wickets in an over for Conners has left Durham is a slump:17-2 following Derby\u2019s 443. A dirty black dog of a cloud has settled over Cheltenham, sending down fine raindrops which have not \u2013 yet \u2013 sent the players off. Ul Hassan out just after lunch, lbw to Zafar for 30.

Twenty-two have fallen by ten to lunch, Worcs 75-3 in their second innings, a lead of 143. A good recovery by Sussex at Headingley, led by 73 from Hudson-Prentice and47 from McAndrew. A couple of wickets for Moriarty. Sussex 216 all out. And Glamorgan 98 without loss, just before lunch, here at Cheltenham. Alas, no double ton for Guest, but a supreme 197 in Derbyshire\u2019s 443. Four wickets for Borthwick, three for Raine. Assume Durham will now race to 500 in double-quick time. Brooke Guest approaches 200\u2026. but Debyshire are nine down\u2026 In Division One: Sir Alastair Cook is still in at Chelmsford, 81 not out, where Essex are 150-2. His partner is one of your friendly substitutes, Dan Lawrence (18) At Lord\u2019s, Jamie Smith was Tom Helm\u2019s fourth wicket, for 138. The attacking mantle has passed to Jordan Clark, 69 not out. Surrey 378-6. Northants are 67-2, chasing Somerset\u2019s 351. Both wickets to Matt Henry. Notts and Hants looking to wrap things up rapidly at Trent Bridge, Notts all out for a round 100 \u2013 Holland 4-19, Abbas 3-34. And Hants already 12-1 in their second innings with a lead of 78. Finally, Warwickshire are 11-1 after Lancashire were dismissed for 327. A century for Balderson. Meanwhile at Cheltenham, a diving drop at backward point from Tom Price saves David Lloyd. I would tell you what he\u2019s on but the scoreboard is also suffering from technical hiccups. Lloyd has now reached his first fifty of the year. Ooof ! A hooking Lloyd is hit on the helmet, quite a nasty blow sending the neck guard flying off. He looks briefly dazed, but will carry on, and gets a short ball straight away from van Meekeren. Lancs now 312-9 but it has been quite some rescue act from 91-5. A memorable knock, 225 balls, nine fours. Well played! \u201cMorning Tanya,\u201d Hello Romeo! \u201dIt looks like the player who scored his career-best first-class score was Arthur Milton, the last man to play both cricket and football for England. Gloucestershire v Sussex, 14th August 1965. Milton scored 170 and Gloucs won the game.\u201d That\u2019s the one! Thank you so, so much. And here he is in his black and white glory. To the enquiring squark of seagulls and background murmurs, Glamorgan have eased their way to 19-0 here at Cheltenham. Right, let\u2019s go round the grounds. Good luck! An early question. Morning Drew Moore! \u201cWith the news that Robin Das is replacing Nick Browne due to concussion, is he likely to be the first player to be subbed out of a game (for Dan Lawrence) and then effectively subbed back in?\u201d Here, under parasols on the balcony of the college pavilion, we\u2019re going for yes! If the hive mind disagrees, just shout Apologies, the Cheltenham bandwidth is not huge so it is taking a while to send entries. Will try to resolve this. Made it just in time for the start, thanks to a lovely chap called Mike who saved me from my sense of direction. Mike has been coming to watch cricket for decades at Cheltenham and his most memorable day here was the morning he went for an interview and found out he had got a job at Smiths industries, and then cycled to Cheltenham to watch \u2013 and this is where I fall down as I\u2019ve already forgotten his name but it was in the sixties - get his highest first-class score. Time wheeled to sepia at Chelmsford, with Alastair Cook unbeaten on 64 at stumps on a good day for Essex. Kent, who had chosen to bat on a greenish pitch and with frowning skies, were dismissed by tea, with Sam Cook and Jamie Porter pocketing three wickets each. Surrey\u2019s Jamie Smith gambolled to an unbeaten 120, his second century of the season, in the London derby against Middlesex at Lord\u2019s, backed up by 79 from Rory Burns who has suffered a forlorn summer with the bat. Lancashire were rescued from the indignity of 150 for seven by an unbeaten partnership of 145 between George Balderson (94) and Tom Bailey (a career-best 75) on the Edgbaston pitch which hosted the Blast final. A career-best 145 from Derbyshire\u2019s wicket-keeper Brooke Guest frustrated Division Two leaders Durham. Guest\u2019s carefree hundred came after Durham won the toss and bowled, but the overhead conditions were trumped by a true pitch, especially once the sun peeled up the blackout blind. There were two wickets for Matthew Potts, Scott Borthwick and Ben Raine. Haider Ali had time to thrash Matt Parkinson for six before suffering a brain fade and being stumped after attempting a run when an lbw appeal against him was turned down. In the race to 1,000 runs, Leus du Plooy needed just 21 but was out for two. Another candidate for the race, James Rew, was caught 26 runs short of the magic four figures. Somerset were all out for 351, after Northamptonshire\u2019s Jack White grabbed five for 77. Carnage at Oakham school where 18 wickets fell, nine Worcestershire batters between lunch and tea after they\u2019d finished a sensible morning 74 for one. But Leicestershire\u2019s innings proved even more fragile, collapsing to 88 for eight. Fifteen wickets too at Trent Bridge, where Nottinghamshire rattled through Hampshire, only to come unstuck themselves, 87 for five at stumps, still trailing by 79. At a rainy Headingley, Yorkshire took six quick Sussex wickets.

The Communities Secretary launched a public inquiry into proposals to flatten the 1929 art deco building and replace it with a much larger 10-storey retail and office block last year after the plans had received support from local authorities. Today, the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said Gove disagreed with the recommendation from inspectors to approve the plans and had \u201cdecided to refuse permission\u201d. Stuart Machin, the boss of M&amp;S, accused Gove of \u201cplaying to the gallery\u201d with the decision which he said was a \u201cshort-sighted act of self-sabotage\u201d the effects of which would be \u201cfelt far beyond the West End\u201d. It is particularly galling given there are currently 17 approved and proceeding demolitions in Westminster and four on Oxford Street alone making it unfathomable why M&amp;S\u2019s proposal to redevelop an aged and labyrinthian site that has been twice deined listed status has been singled out for refusal. The row over the shop on London\u2019s Oxford Street has become a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre in the battle over the shape of redevelopments and the fate of Britain\u2019s high streets. In June last year Gove, secretary of state for levelling up, housing and communities, ordered a public inquiry into the plan to demolish and rebuild the retailer\u2019s flagship store on the most famous of Britain\u2019s high streets. Back to global wheat prices, which have ticked slightly lower, after yesterday\u2019s sharp rise of nearly 9%. Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets ad Hargreaves Lansdown, said: Just as painful food inflation was beginning to ease, Russian attacks on grain storage facilities in Ukraine risk causing another spike in costs of staple ingredients. Wheat futures have jumped after missiles were fired at infrastructure, following Moscow\u2019s decision to leave the Black Sea Grain deal. Hopes that a fast deal to revive the pact could materialise are dissipating, with Russia\u2019s position appearing more intractable after it said that any ships heading Ukrainian ports will be considered carriers of military cargo and attacked. Although its highly disappointing for Western shoppers, dealing with prices increases at the tills, this move is treacherous for countries grappling with severe drought, particularly in the horn of Africa, where millions of people are at risk of acute food insecurity and famine. Cutting off Europe\u2019s breadbasket region yet again could hardly come at a worst time as unusually hot weather has descended. The escalating crisis is coinciding with a severe dry spell in key growing regions in the United States, which is leading to lower expectations of yields for the ongoing harvest, with US wheat stocks for 2023/24 projected to come in at a 16 year low. This highly unwelcome collision of factors has pushed up US wheat futures prices by more than 13% since Tuesday, adding to concerns that food prices will remain very sticky. She has also looked at petrol and oil prices: Despite the uncertainty about where grocery bills head next, relief at the UK\u2019s headline inflation number is still reverberating around markets. Falls in the price of fuel were the biggest driver of the fast move downwards in the rate of consumer price rises and that trend does not look like it\u2019ll be reversed significantly any time soon. Oil prices have steadied around $79 a barrel amid expectations of lower demand in China, as investors still waiting for more detail about what further economic stimulus from Chinese authorities will look like. The expectation that levers will be pulled to boost domestic demand across the world\u2019s second largest economy has helped push up commodity stocks, which are among the biggest gainers on the FTSE 100. The Bank of England risks triggering a recession in the UK by raising interest rates too far in an attempt to bring inflation down, the central bank\u2019s former governor Mervyn King has warned. King said in an interview with the Bloomberg podcast \u201cMerryn Talks Money\u201d that the central bank has been ignoring signals from money supply data, which had pointed to higher inflation before the Bank acted. The comments add to concerns about the impact that the Bank\u2019s most aggressive series of rate rises in three decades, to 5%, is having on the economy. Money supply economists correctly predicted the sky-high inflation (which has now fallen back to 7.9% but is still way above the Bank\u2019s 2% target) \u2013 and are now warning that a collapse in the data could point to recession. King said in the interview: The risk is that having ignored money when inflation was rising, they\u2019re now ignoring money when inflation is actually about to fall. What we could see, therefore, is a mistake in both directions over a period of three or four years. If they carry on for the next six months or so, tightening monetary policy, it could well be that they generate both a recession as well as a sharp fall in inflation.\u201d After rocketing in 2020 and early 2021, money supply growth in the UK has slumped and was flat in May, the latest available data. For monetarists, growth and inflation are a function of the quantity of money in circulation and its velocity \u2014 the number of times it changes hands. Even so, the Bank hiked its base rate by half a percentage point to 5% last month after signs that price and wage pressures are proving much stickier than expected. Data yesterday showed that inflation, as measured by the consumer prices index, is finally slowing, to 7.9% in June from 8.7% in May. On that subject, the maker of Mr Kipling cakes, Oxo cubes and Bisto gravy granules has said it believes recent food cost inflation has peaked, and it is not planning any more price rises for its food products for the rest of the year. The news came as owner Premier Foods reported a 21% increase in sales in the first quarter of the financial year, compared with a year earlier. The grocery sector has been under pressure in recent months, with food producers facing a surge in cost of ingredients and retailers trying to keep prices low to attract customers. Sales of branded products were nearly 18% higher in the 13 weeks to 1 July, while the London-listed company said it had further grown its market share during the past quarter. High food inflation in the UK has not been driven by weak competition between supermarkets, an initial review into grocery pricing from the competition watchdog has found. However, the Competition and Markets Authority also said rules on pricing should be tightened and that retailers must do their bit to help shoppers compare prices easily. The CMA will now look at competition for 10 product areas including milk, bread and baby formula, or across the wider supply chain, to ensure supermarkets pass on savings to customers as cost inflation eases. So far, it has found: Evidence to date indicates high food price inflation has not been driven by weak retail competition, but competitive pressure is important as input prices fall Next phase of CMA probe will examine competition and prices across the supply chain for the product categories identified Rules on unit pricing should be tightened and retailers must comply to help shoppers compare prices easily On the last point, the watchdog voiced some concerns \u2013 for example, different measurements are being used for similar types of products, making it hard for consumers to compare deals on a like-for-like basis. So for instance, tea bags being priced per 100 grams for some products and others being unit priced per each tea bag. Or sometimes it\u2019s hard to read the pricing information because the text is too small or the shelf edge labels are hidden. Over the past couple of months, the watchdog has assessed how retail competition is working in the UK grocery sector, particularly between supermarkets such as Asda, Morrisons, Sainsbury\u2019s and Tesco as well as discounters, including Aldi and Lidl. It said: Not everyone is able to benefit fully from strong competition, particularly those who cannot travel to large stores or shop online, and therefore may rely on higher-priced convenience stores. Now that some input costs are starting to fall, there are some signs that grocery retailers are planning to start rebuilding their profit margins. The CMA will monitor this carefully in the months ahead, to ensure that people benefit from competitive prices as input costs fall. Nigel Farage has praised the government following reports that ministers are considering passing new laws that would prevent banks shutting customers\u2019 accounts because they disagree with their political views. The former Ukip leader said MPs are \u201cbeginning to realise that this system is coming for them as well\u201d after his bank accounts were closed by Coutts because his views \u201cdid not align with\u201d its values. Under plans to protect free speech, banks could lose their licences if they blacklist people with controversial views, The Times reported. Speaking to the PA news agency, Farage said: Well done, the government. This is one of the swiftest interventions I\u2019ve seen by government for many, many years. And hat\u2019s because this problem of the way banks have been behaving has been building up for years and years and years. Every MP will know of constituents, small businessmen and women who\u2019ve literally been shut down by their banks with no reason given whatsoever. I also think that because of the politically exposed persons (PEPs) rule, I think they\u2019re beginning to realise that this system is coming for them as well. He claimed there is \u201ca real sense of anger\u201d among the public, after taxpayers bailed out banks during the 2008 financial crisis, that they \u201ccan now treat us with contempt\u201d. The closure of his accounts sparked outrage among senior Tory MPs, who have piled pressure on Coutts and its owner NatWest. Rishi Sunak said \u201cthis is wrong\u201d and that \u201cno one should be barred from using basic services for their political views\u201d. The Treasury is expected to announce plans as soon as next week to extend the notice time given to customers to close their accounts from one month to three months, The Times said. Banks will also have to explain why they are closing an account, and customers will be able to appeal against the decision. Farage said he was \u201creally angry\u201d that several members of his family have been refused bank accounts or had them closed. Angela Knight, former head of the British Bankers\u2019 Association, said the politically exposed persons (PEPs) rule is a \u201cgrey area\u201d that is \u201cworthy of discussion\u201d as she criticised Coutts\u2019 move. Veteran journalist Andrew Neil said Coutts \u201cacted like a kind of political politburo rather than a bank\u201d. He added: If banks want to act as political parties and have political criteria, they should publish what their political criteria is before you can have their bank account. They should also make themselves accountable to the public. Mortgage rates in the UK have fallen back after yesterday\u2019s sharp slowdown in inflation to 7.9%, which raised hopes that the Bank of England may not need to raise interest rates as high as feared. The average two-year fixed residential mortgage rate has declined to 6.79% today from 6.81% yesterday, while the average five-year fix is now at 6.31%, down from 6.33, according to data provider Moneyfacts. At the same time, some savings rates have increased. The average one-year fixed savings rate rose to 5.14% from 5.13% while the average rate on an easy access savings account is unchanged at 2.62%. Inflation slowed more than expected to 7.9% in June from 8.7% in May because of a sharp drop in petrol prices. While this is still far above the Bank\u2019s 2% target, financial markets are no longer betting that interest rates will rise above 6%. However, UK inflation remains the highest among the G7 group of advanced economies. Our banking correspondent Kalyeena Makortoff has done a handy explainer on the UK rules on access to banking. Everyone has a right to a basic account but banks can deny customers additional services. And our columnist Nils Pratley says Nigel Farage has a point \u2013 Coutts should explain itself. Nigel Farage has taken aim at Alison Rose, the chief executive of NatWest, which owns Coutts. Angela Knight, the former chief executive of the British Bankers\u2019 Association, said she found it \u201cuncomfortable\u201d to see a bank close someone\u2019s account because of their political views, referring to Coutts bank\u2019s decision to shut Nigel Farage\u2019s account. She said it is a \u201cgrey area\u201d that needs to be addressed. Coutts, an exclusive private lender that caters for royals and the super-rich, terminated its relationship with Farage earlier this year. Yesterday, the Brexit campaigner and former UK Independence party leader released internal documents obtained from the bank, which stated it was concerned about his \u201cxenophobic, chauvinistic and racist views\u201d and believed maintaining his accounts posed a risk to the bank\u2019s reputation. Speaking on BBC radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Knight said: We have long operated in this country, under a regime which I will define as: \u2018I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it,\u2019 and I do find it somewhat uncomfortable to see a situation arise where because of somebody\u2019s legitimate views, even though you may not agree with them, somehow has resulted in a service being withdrawn and they\u2019re not being told about it. I mean, suppose a bank really does disagree with somebody\u2019s behaviour, they should at least tell them. In this instance, what seems to have happened is that nothing was really fed in any way to the individual concerned. We have freedom of speech in this country. So it is a bit of a grey area, and I do think it it is worthy of discussion and I think it\u2019s something that has been coming for some time. Her comments come after the City regulator said it had contacted the owner of Coutts bank amid a growing row over its decision to close Farage\u2019s accounts, but told MPs that while lenders cannot discriminate against customers, it is ultimately up to firms to decide who to do business with. The journalist and broadcaster Andrew Neil, chairman of The Spectator and presenter of The Andrew Neil Show on Channel 4, has described Coutts\u2019 decision as a \u201cnew form of McCarthyism\u201d. He said on BBC radio: The bank acted like a kind of political Politburo rather than a bank, and they\u2019ve got themselves into this terrible mess now, and the law will be changed as a result. As a result, the banks will not be able to discriminate against customers on political grounds. The rising price of wheat threatens to push food prices up again. Global grain prices had eased in recent months, but food inflation has stayed high in the UK and elsewhere. Many products are made from wheat, including flour and breakfast cereal. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Wheat prices have jumped on global markets after Russia this week pulled out of an agreement that guaranteed safe passage for ships carrying grain through the Black Sea. Russia has carried out heavy air strikes on Ukraine\u2019s grain stores and port infrastructure in the Black Sea port of Odesa. Russia\u2019s Ministry of Defence warned that all ships in the Black Sea heading to Ukrainian ports would be considered potential carriers of military cargo from today. President Vladmir Putin said he would return to the grain deal if his demands are met, which include improving exports of Russia\u2019s grain and fertiliser, and reconnecting Russia\u2019s agricultural bank to a global payments system. The Black Sea deal was brokered by the UN and Turkey in July last year amid a global food crisis exacerbated by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in February last year, which sent wheat prices sharply higher. Both countries are among the world\u2019s top grain exporters. Wheat prices rose more than 8% yesterday, the biggest daily rise since 2012, while corn prices climbed more than 5%. Wheat futures traded in Chicago rose a further 1% today. In Britain, a fresh wave of rail strikes has begun over job security and pay, with up to 20,000 RMT workers at 14 train companies joining picket lines all over the country today. They will strike for 24 hours today and again on Saturday, just as the summer holidays start and many families head off on their breaks. There will also be strikes on the London Underground next week, in 10 days of transport disruption.

The archbishops of Canterbury and York have hired Prof Alexis Jay after weeks of turmoil within the C of E over its safeguarding processes, involving sackings, resignations and a furious revolt at the church\u2019s governing body, the General Synod, earlier this month. The archbishops are banking on Jay\u2019s status and reputation on safeguarding issues to stabilise the volatile mood and give confidence to abuse survivors, many of whom say they cannot trust the church. On the announcement of her appointment, Jay said: \u201cWhen I was chair of the IICSA, I heard at first-hand of the devastating effects of abuse within the C of E, and of the failures, often repeated, to prevent it from occurring. \u201cI was very clear in my recommendations that safeguarding in the church would require genuine independence in order to be fully effective. \u201cI have been just as clear with the archbishop of Canterbury and with the archbishop of York that this programme of work must be entirely independent of the church too for it to succeed. \u201cI would like to assure everyone that I mean what I say. My team will not include anyone employed by the church, nor will we hold meetings or conduct any business on church premises. I have explained that if I detect any attempt to interfere with or to hinder my work, I will withdraw from this programme of work immediately. \u201cI also wish to make clear that my work will be fair, impartial, objective and rigorous.\u201d Jay has been appointed to develop a model of fully independent safeguarding within the C of E \u2013 one of the main recommendations of IICSA, which published its findings on the Anglican church in 2020. Her proposals will be presented to the Archbishops\u2019 Council, the C of E\u2019s executive body, by the end of the year and will be made public. In a statement, Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, and Stephen Cottrell, the archbishop of York, said Jay had agreed to take on \u201cthis vital role to ensure we move quickly towards objective, independent, credible and resilient oversight of safeguarding in the C of E\u201d. The work would be \u201cfully external and independent; we welcome the scrutiny and challenge that rightly comes with that\u201d. The archbishops said they were committed to getting independent oversight of safeguarding \u201cback on track\u201d, and would continue to reflect on recent events. At a meeting of the synod earlier this month, Cottrell said there was a \u201ccrisis of safeguarding\u201d within the C of E after its executive disbanded an independent body on abuse. The archbishop said: \u201cWe recognise things have gone wrong \u2026 This is a watershed moment for us. We can\u2019t get this wrong again.\u201d Two of the three members of the independent safeguarding board (ISB), which was set up in January 2022 with a brief to pave the way for a system of fully independent safeguarding in the C of E, were sacked in June after refusing to meet a new chair of the board appointed by the Archbishops\u2019 Council. Critics said the new chair, Meg Munn, was not independent because she worked for the C of E. Amid uproar at the synod, members forced the suspension of formal proceedings to allow the two sacked members to address the meeting in York. Munn resigned all her safeguarding roles with the C of E last week, saying Welby had undermined her."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b2230d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/20/search-for-california-otter-841", "primaryCategory": "environment", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018Highly unusual\u2019: the surfboard-swiping sea otter eluding California authorities", "lead": "The state\u2019s wildlife department is concerned the friendly fur-covered swimmer has become too acclimated to humans", "author": "Aben\u00e9 Clayton in Los Angeles", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 13:00:14", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.229520", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/4547f0ae9d2e5600496d3b38c715e0c1bf399a4b/0_56_4752_2851/500.jpg", "body": "A five-year-old sea otter who gained notoriety for commandeering surfboards has continued her reign as a viral sensation as she\u2019s managed to avoid multiple efforts to capture her. For days, staff with California\u2019s department of fish and wildlife (CDFW) and the Monterey Bay aquarium have attempted to catch otter 841 \u2013 but she has given them the slip each time. The mammal\u2019s actions have delighted online commenters who have cheered her on as she jumps on and off CDFW boards and avoids the nets that staff try to lure her into. But experts emphasize that 841 must be caught for her own wellbeing and safety because she\u2019s been exhibiting worrying behavior for a sea otter in the wild. \u201cIt\u2019s highly unusual behavior,\u201d said Kevin Connor, a spokesperson for the Monterey Bay aquarium. \u201cThere are about 3,000 southern sea otters in Central California. This is the only incident taking place right now.\u201d The aquatic mammal rose to prominence for her unusual interactions with surfers. She\u2019s been photographed and filmed atop boards that she\u2019s seized from riders and most recently has been spotted eluding the CDFW\u2019s nets. Photographer Mark Woodward, who goes by Native Santa Cruz on social media, and environmental studies professor Dustin Mulvaney have been sharing 841\u2019s latest exploits through photos posted to social media. Otter 841\u2019s online fans describe her as a creature taking ownership of her watery home and avoiding capture because deep down she knows that captivity awaits her. Her antics have even inspired T-shirts and tote bags depicting 841 flying her knubby middle finger. Connor with the Monterey Bay aquarium, known for its work with otters, says that he is not surprised by 841\u2019s growing cult following nor the fact that people are rooting for her to remain wild and free. Still, he cautions against projecting human values and motivations on to 841, because the behaviors she\u2019s exhibiting are potentially dangerous for her and the humans she meets. \u201cThe appeal that otters have is that they are incredibly cute to human eyes \u2013 it\u2019s a superpower they have,\u201d Connor said. \u201cWe equate them to our pets and you just wanna hug them. But they are wild animals that bite through shellfish with their mouths.\u201d Sea otters are naturally wary of humans and will usually move away from them, but in 841\u2019s case, she\u2019s been swimming right up to people. Experts warn that this behavior is a sign that she has formed a positive association with humans, something that her caretakers have been trying to prevent since she was a pup. Otter 841\u2019s mother, known as 723, was taught how to survive in the wild by older otters who were a part of the Monterey Bay aquarium\u2019s surrogacy program. In 2017, she was released into open waters but was recaptured the following year after the aquarium received reports that she was approaching kayaks. Aquarium staff learned that people were feeding her squid and bait fish, which led to a positive association with humans and a reliance on them for food. Once 723 was brought to the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC), her caretakers realized she was pregnant with the now infamous pup. Otter 723 gave birth to 841 at the university and, since her birth, UCSC staff worked to make sure she could survive in the wild and would not be dependent on nor friendly with humans. In 2020, 841 was released into Moss Landing, a popular surfing and nature-watching area on the coast of Monterey county. For the first year she lived as a normal otter does: distrustful of humans and regularly on the hunt for shellfish. But in September 2022, after reports that she was approaching people, the US fish and wildlife service tried to undo 841\u2019s positive association with humans through a process called hazing, but that has not deterred the mischievous critter. \u201cWith her mom there was clear evidence that 723 was being fed; we don\u2019t have that clear evidence this time,\u201d Connor said. Catching 841 could take weeks, according to the US fish and wildlife service, which is working with the CDFW and the Monterey Bay aquarium to nab the animal. Otters are quick and nimble in the water, making them tough to catch. If water conditions prevent crews from getting 841 or if she stops her behavior, the capture effort will be suspended or called off entirely, the US fish and wildlife service said. If she is caught, 841 will undergo a medical examination before she\u2019s permanently housed in a zoo or aquarium, where she will become an \u201cambassador for her species\u201d that teaches the public about otter history and the important role they play in the aquatic ecosystem, Connor said."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b2230e", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/20/new-mexico-camp-hope-las-cruces-unhoused-extreme-heat", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018Nothing feels like enough\u2019: surviving the heat in a New Mexico homeless encampment", "lead": "NEW MEXICO HEAT - how the residents of Camp Hope, a self-governing, transitional living encampment in Las Cruces, NM are handling the heat.<br>How residents at transitional living cope with New Mexico\u2019s heat: <br>", "author": "Cecilia Nowell in Las Cruces", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 13:00:14", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.229543", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/9c5b13c95e9d8d15fb06241da22b47e6f415fc8c/0_367_5500_3300/500.jpg", "body": "It\u2019s unusually quiet at the entrance to Camp Hope when the temperature hits 102F (38.8C) on a sizzling Monday afternoon this week. Fewer than a dozen of the usual 50 residents at this sanctioned homeless encampment in Las Cruces, New Mexico, are milling about. Those that are around are hosing themselves off with water until their clothes are soaked through, resting in front of fans plugged into long extension cords, or sheltering in the shade that wooden structures offer. The temperature is predicted to rise to 106F (41C) come afternoon, so the majority of residents have opted to go elsewhere: seeking out air conditioning on city buses and in public cooling centers. As a record-breaking heat wave sweeps across the south-west, more than 100 million Americans are living under heat alerts. While parts of neighboring Texas tie for the hottest place in the world and Phoenix records 19-straight days of temperatures above 110F (43.3C), New Mexico is facing high temperatures compounded by the late arrival of the state\u2019s typical monsoon season. Located in the heart of the Chihuahuan desert, just 40 miles from the US-Mexico border, Las Cruces is no stranger to 100F (37.7C) days. But, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, New Mexico\u2019s average summer temperature has increased 3.6 degrees since 1983. The extreme conditions are disproportionately affecting the state\u2019s homeless population, which has grown by 48% this year, according to a report by the state\u2019s legislative finance committee, to a total of about 4,000 people across the state. Since 2017, the report states, rents have risen by 70% in New Mexico while wages have only increased 15%, and the supply of affordable rental units has declined by 50% since 2020. Homeless people are particularly vulnerable to the negative effects of heat not only because they lack consistent access to air conditioned shelter, but also because any health conditions they\u2019re already dealing with \u2013 like mental illness, cancer or substance use \u2013 can be exacerbated by heat. With access to resources, the residents of Camp Hope are slightly more equipped to deal with the staggering heat than people living on the streets, said Lizz Coyle, Camp Hope\u2019s outreach coordinator. The camp was founded in 2011 when members of Las Cruces\u2019s unhoused community came together with the city council to establish a sanctioned encampment. Today, Camp Hope is located on land that the Mesilla Valley Community of Hope rents from the city. The site is also home to a food bank, soup kitchen and health clinic. The camp itself consists of an open air kitchen, bathrooms, a few shaded community spaces, an ice machine and dozens of tent pads \u2013 about half of which are covered by three-sided wooden structures that offer some shade and protection from the elements. Along with occasional access to the air-conditioned building, Camp Hope is able to provide its residents with ice, running water, 24/7 showers, electricity and shade. \u201cBut of course, nothing feels like enough because the heat\u2019s miserable. I\u2019ve got several clients who are distressed because their health is suffering in the heat,\u201d Coyle said. On Monday afternoon, several of the camp\u2019s residents were among more than 30 people forming a line snaking around the edge of the Mesilla Valley community of Hope\u2019s office. Some of them were trying to access services that the non-profit provides to the unhoused population in Las Cruces \u2013 others were just hoping to spend a few minutes in the air conditioned interior. Although Camp Hope is better suited for the heat, its residents and staff stress that it\u2019s no substitute for housing. \u201cThe majority of people who live here try not to stay here during the day,\u201d said Jeremiah, a 24-year-old, former resident who asked only to be identified by his first name because of the stigma associated with homelessness. It\u2019s too hot in camp, he said. Instead, residents try to spend the hottest hours of the day on the city\u2019s free buses, in public libraries or city-sponsored \u201ccooling centers\u201d, or even at parks where grass and shade make for lower outdoor temperatures. But sometimes those public spaces can be hostile to unhoused visitors. One of the camp\u2019s residents, a 66-year-old man who asked only to be identified by the nickname \u201cDennis\u201d because he fears pushback from city officials, said he used to ride the city buses until drivers started kicking him off for bringing his dog with him. Dennis has stage 4 cirrhosis of the liver and has struggled to find ways to keep himself healthy and cool while also caring for his pet dog. \u201cAn apartment would help,\u201d he said. On hot summer days, a greenhouse effect can raise the temperature in residents\u2019 tents to above 140F (60C). \u201cLast week it was so hot in the nighttime that some people actually took down their tents and decided to sleep out in the open,\u201d said Coyle, the outreach coordinator. Heat deaths are a real concern this time of year. When members of the camp\u2019s safety team make their rounds each day, Coyle added, they\u2019ll often check tents to make sure everyone\u2019s still alive. \u201cHeat is the silent killer,\u201d said Kristie L Ebi, a professor of global health at the University of Washington. \u201cIt\u2019s not dramatic in the sense of a flood, for example, or a storm surge. But our body operates within a fairly narrow temperature range.\u201d A variety of factors \u2013 like aging, pregnancy and certain medications, including beta blockers and psychotropic drugs \u2013 can make people more vulnerable to heat, she added. There are several ways to cool off without the aid of air conditioning, according to a 2021 series on heat and health published in the Lancet, including by dowsing oneself in water, staying hydrated, and using fans or evaporative coolers. At Camp Hope, residents regularly employ all of those practices: sipping ice water while sitting under a misting system donated by a former resident, designing their own evaporative coolers out of a fan and a frozen juice jug, and dowsing their clothes and hair in water. Every Tuesday, residents come together for a community gathering called the great conversation, where Coyle says many share their tips for surviving the summer heat. Although the city of Las Cruces has taken significant steps to protect its residents from the heat \u2013 including by opening 12 cooling centers \u2013 Coyle said that the biggest step the city could take to protect unhoused residents would be to get them into housing, either by lowering background checks for Section 8 or building more affordable units. \u201cNearly all heat related deaths are preventable,\u201d said Ebi, who adds that there\u2019s strong academic research on how to prevent heat-related illness and mortality. \u201cThis is not inevitable. This is a result of not having access to the services that are needed.\u201d \u201cI would say that no matter what we do, no matter how many cooling stations we put up,\u201d said Coyle, \u201chousing is the thing.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b2230f", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jul/20/rishi-sunak-criticises-eu-for-calling-falkland-islands-islas-malvinas", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Rishi Sunak criticises EU for calling Falkland Islands \u2018Islas Malvinas\u2019", "lead": "Prime minister says choice of words \u2018regrettable\u2019 as Brussels insists it has not changed its stance on disputed islands", "author": "Ben Quinn Political correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 12:58:59", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.229561", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/7a9e36fe48a74aef7f4944e4cd9ae8580b5cf7a8/162_0_2636_1582/500.jpg", "body": "Rishi Sunak has criticised the EU for its \u201cregrettable choice of words\u201d after it appeared to endorse the name that Argentina uses for the Falklands. Downing Street was reacting after EU leaders attending a summit in Brussels supported an Argentinian-backed declaration that used the name Islas Malvinas alongside Falkland Islands. UK diplomats have been asking the EU to \u201cclarify\u201d its position while Buenos Aires hailed a \u201cdiplomatic triumph\u201d after the declaration was agreed at a meeting of EU leaders with counterparts from the Celac bloc of Latin America and the Caribbean on Tuesday. A spokesperson for the European External Action Service \u2013 the EU\u2019s diplomatic service \u2013 subsequently said the bloc had not changed its views on the disputed archipelago as there had been no mandate from the council of member states. Sunak\u2019s official spokesperson said: \u201cThe prime minister\u2019s view is that it would have been entirely unacceptable for the EU to question the Falkland islanders\u2019 right to decide their own future. \u201cTo be clear, the Falkland Islands are British, that was the choice of the islanders themselves. The EU has rightly now clarified that their position on the Falklands has not changed after their regrettable choice of words.\u201d The spokesperson added that 99.8% of islanders who took part in a 2013 referendum had voted to retain the Falklands\u2019 status as an overseas territory of the United Kingdom. Part of the declaration of the EU-Celac summit stated: \u201cRegarding the question of sovereignty over the Islas Malvinas/Falkland Islands, the European Union took note of Celac\u2019s historical position based on the importance of dialogue and respect for international law in the peaceful solution of disputes.\u201d Santiago Cafiero, Argentina\u2019s foreign minister, said on Wednesday that his government hoped to \u201cfurther expand dialogue\u201d with the EU on the question of the islands \u201coff the back of this declaration\u201d. He added: \u201cThis joint declaration constitutes a further call from the international community for the UK to agree to meet its obligation to resume sovereignty negotiations with Argentina.\u201d Britain\u2019s foreign secretary, James Cleverly, had asked the EU to keep the Falklands out of the declaration, the Financial Times reported. UK government sources on Thursday pointed out that coverage in the Argentinian media had noted that the EU had insisted its position on the Falklands had not changed. On Twitter, Cafiero criticised the coverage in his country\u2019s largest selling newspaper, Clar\u00edn, describing it as a lie and insisting that Argentinian diplomacy had achieved a \u201cforceful\u201d triumph which incorporated the issue into a bi-regional declaration."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b22310", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/20/protesters-angered-by-quran-burning-storm-swedens-embassy-in-baghdad", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Iraq expels Swedish ambassador after desecration of Qur\u2019an in Stockholm", "lead": "Prime minister also recalls charge d\u2019affaires from Sweden as protesters storm Swedish embassy in Baghdad", "author": "Associated Press in Baghdad", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 12:58:44", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.229580", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/59ec842f8830a5045b8bc982042140039b2c3fea/0_0_3876_2325/500.jpg", "body": "Iraq\u2019s prime minister has ordered the expulsion of the Swedish ambassador from Iraq and the withdrawal of the Iraqi charge d\u2019affaires from Sweden on Thursday after a man desecrated of a copy of the Qur\u2019an in Stockholm. The diplomatic blowup came hours after protesters angered by the planned burning of a copy of the Qur\u2019an stormed the Swedish embassy in Baghdad, breaking into the compound and lighting a small fire. The Swedish embassy announced it had closed to visitors. The prime minister, Shia al-Sudani said Iraqi authorities would prosecute the arsonists and refer \u201cnegligent security officials\u201d for investigation. An Iraqi asylum seeker who burned a copy of the Qur\u2019an in a demonstration last month kicked and stood on the book but this time did not burn it during his protest at the Iraqi embassy in Stockholm on Thursday as Swedish police stood by. Videos posted online from Baghdad showed demonstrators at the Swedish diplomatic post waving flags and signs bearing images of the influential Iraqi Shia cleric and political leader Muqtada al-Sadr. The videos showed dozens of men climbing over a fence at the complex, with the sound of them trying to break down a front door. Another showed what appeared to be a small fire being set. Other footage showed men inside what appeared to be a room at the embassy, an alarm audible in the background. Some protesters later performed predawn prayers outside the embassy. As dawn broke, police and other security officials gathered at the embassy as small plumes of smoke still rose. Firefighters tried to douse the flames from the ladder of a fire truck. Some demonstrators still stood at the site, holding placards showing Sadr\u2019s face, apparently left alone by police. The Swedish foreign ministry said in a statement that \u201cour embassy staff are in safety,\u201d without elaborating. \u201cWe condemn all attacks on diplomats and staff from international organisations,\u201d the ministry said. \u201cAttacks on embassies and diplomats constitute a serious violation of the Vienna convention. Iraqi authorities have the responsibility to protect diplomatic missions and diplomatic staff.\u201d The Swedish foreign minister, Tobias Billstr\u00f6m, called the attacks \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d. Prior to Iraq saying it would withdraw its charge d\u2019affaires in Stockholm, Billstr\u00f6m said the foreign ministry would be summoning him, and he criticised Iraqi authorities for \u201cseriously failing\u201d in their responsibility to protect the embassy and its personnel. Iraq\u2019s foreign ministry issued a statement condemning the Baghdad attack without explaining how it allowed the breach to happen or identifying who carried out the assault. \u201cThe Iraqi government has instructed the competent security authorities to conduct an urgent investigation and take the necessary security measures in order to uncover the circumstances of the incident and identify the perpetrators of this act and hold them accountable according to the law,\u201d the ministry said. Iraqi police did not immediately acknowledge the attack. In Sweden, the right to hold public demonstrations is protected by the constitution. Blasphemy laws were abandoned in the 1970s. Police generally give permission based on whether they believe a public gathering can be held without major disruptions or risks to public safety. For Muslims, the burning of the Qur\u2019an represents a blasphemous desecration of their religion\u2019s holy text. Qur\u2019an burnings in the past have sparked protests across the Muslim world, some turning violent. In Afghanistan, the Taliban have suspended all the activities of Swedish organisations in the country in response to the recent Qur\u2019an burning. Last month an Iraqi Christian immigrant burned a copy of the Qur\u2019an outside a Stockholm mosque during the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha, triggering widespread condemnation in the Islamic world. According to Swedish news agency TT, the same man was one of those who planned to burn the Qur\u2019an on Thursday. A similar protest by a far-right activist outside Turkey\u2019s embassy earlier this year complicated Sweden\u2019s efforts to convince Turkey to let it join Nato."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b22311", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/20/powerball-winning-ticket-jackpot-sold-california", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Powerball winning ticket for $1.08bn jackpot sold in California", "lead": "Prize is sixth largest ever in US but identity of player who bought ticket at Las Palmitas Mini Market in Los Angeles as yet unknown", "author": "Guardian staff and agencies", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 12:58:21", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.229599", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/d69ae29672f2d64b0eb7080fb5f1b1fc2a411565/0_136_4088_2454/500.jpg", "body": "A winning ticket has been sold in California for the Powerball jackpot worth an estimated $1.08bn, the sixth largest in American lottery history and the third largest ever for that game in particular.

The California Lottery said on Twitter that the winning ticket was sold in Los Angeles at Las Palmitas Mini Market. Final ticket sales pushed the jackpot beyond its earlier estimate of $1bn to $1.08bn at the time of the drawing, moving it from the seventh largest to the sixth largest US lottery jackpot ever won. The winner can choose either the total jackpot paid out in yearly increments or a $558.1m, one-time lump sum before taxes. Lottery winners typically choose the one-time lump sum. The game\u2019s abysmal odds of 1 in 292.2 million are designed to build big prizes that draw more players. The largest Powerball jackpot was $2.04bn. That jackpot was won in November by a player from the Los Angeles-area. The prize winner, Edwin Castro, went with the one-time lump sum payment, pocketing him more than $997.6m. Lottery winnings are subject to federal taxes. But California is one of just eight states that do not tax lottery winnings. California law requires the identity of Wednesday\u2019s Powerball winner to be disclosed, though that had not happened as of Thursday morning. Before Wednesday\u2019s drawing, the last time someone had won the Powerball jackpot was 19 April for a top prize of nearly $253m. Since then, no one had won the grand prize.

The first thing on the to-do list for Martin Seidenberg as head of International Distributions Services (IDS) will be finding a new Royal Mail chief executive, two months after Simon Thompson said he would step down after two-year battle with the postal workers\u2019 union. The former head of GLS, an Amsterdam-based parcel delivery company owned by IDS since 2020, does not technically replace Thompson, but the role he is now taking on was created after a reorganisation of executive jobs. Seidenberg, 50, joined GLS in 2015 after spending 15 years at Deutsche Post DHL, and has been a member of the IDS board since April 2021. He will be paid a base salary of \u00a3700,000 a year from August, when he starts the job, and will move to the UK. He enters the fray at a challenging time for the logistics giant as Royal Mail made a \u00a31bn loss in the last financial year that was blamed on strike action and poor productivity. The dire performance led IDS to report a loss of \u00a3748m for the year to 26 March, compared with a profit of \u00a3577m for the same period a year earlier. Seidenberg must now appoint chief executives for GLS and Royal Mail. Thompson officially steps down in October, having taken up the post in early 2021. His reign has been defined by an acrimonious battle with the Communication Workers Union (CWU), and difficult appearances before MPs who accused him of \u201cincompetence or cluelessness\u201d. Workers earlier this month accepted a pay deal that could help draw a line under the pay dispute, but Seidenberg will still have to mend relationships with the CWU, and regain the trust of postal staff. Royal Mail\u2019s total revenue fell by 4% in the first quarter and it delivered 10% fewer parcels and 8% fewer letters in the period. GLS had revenue growth of 7.4%. IDS said the government and Ofcom needed to take \u201curgent action\u201d to change its service obligation as letter volumes have fallen 30% since pre-pandemic. The company has long argued the universal service obligation requiring it to provide a \u201cone price goes anywhere\u201d postal service to any address in the UK six days a week is not financially sustainable. The government prevented Royal Mail from stopping delivering post on Saturdays in June this year. Royal Mail\u2019s chair, Keith Williams, said: \u201cUnder Martin\u2019s leadership, GLS has grown to nearly 40% of group revenue and it continuously delivered significant profit to the group. \u201cWith Royal Mail entering a new phase of its transformation after the ballot on the agreement with the CWU, and GLS on a positive trajectory, we can move both companies forward under Martin\u2019s leadership to deliver change, growth and value across the group.\u201d Seidenberg said it was \u201ca privilege to be appointed to lead IDS and ensure that both Royal Mail and GLS reach their full potential\u201d. He added: \u201cWith Royal Mail\u2019s brand, unrivalled scale and postmen and women connecting every household and business in the country, we have plenty of opportunity ahead of us. \u201cBut we must seize it. By enabling Royal Mail to best serve our customers\u2019 evolving demands, we can deliver benefits for customers, employees and shareholders alike.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b22313", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jul/20/sovereign-review-cj-sansom-historical-doorstopper-comes-home-to-york", "primaryCategory": "stage", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Sovereign review \u2013 CJ Sansom\u2019s historical doorstopper comes home to York", "lead": "Large-scale community play casts Henry VIII putting an end to the city\u2019s beloved Mystery Plays as a clever framing device in Mike Kenny\u2019s adaptation", "author": "Catherine Love", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 12:45:52", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.229636", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/2a6ef0750cea71758b690ea113bca5c733179a1b/0_135_3000_1800/500.jpg", "body": "There\u2019s more than one kind of mystery at play in this adaptation of CJ Sansom\u2019s historical crime novel. The scene opens not on Matthew Shardlake, Sansom\u2019s lawyer-detective protagonist, but on a centuries-old local theatrical tradition: the York Mystery Plays, performed on wagons by city guildswomen. Until, that is, Henry VIII arrives, putting an end to this much-loved ritual. It\u2019s an ingenious framing device from adapter Mike Kenny. Immediately, he connects this present-day outdoor community production to the city\u2019s long history of theatre by and for the people. He also conjures up a chorus in the form of the thwarted guildswomen. They guide us through the rest of the drama, narrating offstage plot points, concealing key events to keep us in suspense and adding a collective female voice to what could otherwise be a male-dominated story. Sovereign is an apt choice for the latest in York Theatre Royal\u2019s long list of large-scale community plays. Sansom\u2019s story is set mostly in York, as Shardlake and his assistant Jack Barak (played as a believable duo by Fergus Rattigan and Sam Thorpe-Spinks, the only two professional actors) undertake work for Henry VIII\u2019s Progress to the North. But soon a mysterious death alerts them to signs of conspiracy. This is all staged against the striking backdrop of King\u2019s Manor, one of the key locations in the book. Dawn Allsopp\u2019s set design works sensitively with this outdoor site, transporting us back in time. Meanwhile, the epic sweep of Sansom\u2019s doorstopper provides plenty of roles for the large cast. There are some particularly impressive turns from Livvy Potter as royal servant Tamasin Reedbourne, Joe Hopper as jailor Fulke Radwinter and Maurice Crichton as the imposing Sir William Maleverer. The numbers involved also allow for a rare sense of scale, creating bustling street scenes and grand processions. It\u2019s a lot of bodies to choreograph, something that co-directors Juliet Forster, Mingyu Lin and John R Wilkinson do skilfully. There are some moments where the narrative sags or the stage pictures lose focus. But overall, Sovereign makes for a fitting celebration of York\u2019s people and its long theatrical history.

A couple of spills at the end but she managed to quickly pounce on them. 5 Steph Catley Stepped up to take the captain\u2019s armband and stepped up again to take the penalty that settled the Matildas\u2019 nerves and earned them the win. A solid night for the skipper and alongside Katrina Gorry was one of Australia\u2019s best. 7 Alanna Kennedy Solid without being spectacular, but deserves credit for managing to keep a clean sheet especially as Ireland threw everything in the final minutes. Resilient performance. 6 Clare Hunt Centre-back combined well with Kennedy and benefited from having the more experienced defender beside her in the face of Ireland\u2019s physicality. Did well to hold her nerve. 6 Ellie Carpenter Trademark lung-busting runs down the left were nowhere to be seen, with Katie McCabe shutting her down. Showed good composure when called on in defence, but her distribution wasn\u2019t up to her high standards. 5 Cortnee Vine Showed glimpses of understanding with Steph Catley down the left, but struggled to deal with the physicality of Heather Payne. The winger was eventually replaced by Emily Van Egmond with 15 minutes left on the clock. 5 Kyra Cooney-Cross Tough first half and notably came close to being punished by an Ireland goal for losing the ball in midfield. Struggled to provide service to Foord and Fowler. 5 Katrina Gorry Uncompromising determination, particularly in the first half. Held the midfield together, rushed back in defence and had plenty of drive going forward \u2013 one of the few Matildas\u2019 players who did. A player-of-the-match performance. 7 Hayley Raso Did not give an inch in immense battle with Ireland captain Katie McCabe. The midfielder had the best chance of the first half with a header that flew just wide, then won the decisive penalty at the start of the second half. 6 Caitlin Foord Without Sam Kerr, it was left to Foord to lead the attack. She was the only Matildas player who managed to find any real space in the final third, but missed an opportunity to put her side further ahead in the second half. 6 Mary Fowler Given the unenviable task of replacing Sam Kerr, Fowler struggled to find her way into the final third and misplaced a few too many passes.

There was nothing she could do to keep Catley\u2019s penalty out. 5 Megan Connolly Distribution was careless at times, but she was formidable in defence in the first half alongside Louise Quinn. 6 Louise Quinn An immense first half in particular by the centre-back. Read the game expertly and effectively shut out the Matildas\u2019 threats with her hustling defence. 7 Niamh Fahey Solid in defence, even outpacing Vine on a handful of occasions. Lived up to Ireland\u2019s physical reputation. 6 Katie McCabe Lived up to the hype, getting stuck in physically \u2013 mainly at Raso\u2019s expense, and absolutely dogged in defence. 6 Ruesha Littlejohn Largely inconspicuous, but did well to allow O\u2019Sullivan to pull the attacking strings in midfield for Ireland by shielding the defence. 5 Denise O\u2019Sullivan Presence in the midfield was crucial, read the play well and was the link between defence and attack. 6 Heather Payne Dropped back into Ireland\u2019s defence and battled away, just as she is known to do. She got the better of Vine on the wing. 6 Marissa Sheva Didn\u2019t see much of the ball in the first half and at the start of the second shoved Raso to the ground to concede a penalty. Replaced by Lucy Quinn in the 63rd minute. 5 Kyra Carusa Outmuscled off the ball in the first half, but grew into the match and battled alongside McCabe. 5 Sinead Farrelly Didn\u2019t manage to get herself into the game much, eventually replaced by Abbie Larkin in the 73rd minute. 5 Subs Abbie Larkin (for Farrelly 63) 5.

In a high court case that experts say could lead to a precedent for oligarchs seeking to free themselves of sanctions, lawyers for Shvidler, who is reportedly worth \u00a31.3bn, are seeking to have his designation for sanctions declared unlawful and quashed, as well as pursuing restitution of his costs. They are challenging the Foreign Office\u2019s decision to sanction the USSR-born businessman, questioning whether the \u201chardship\u201d he is facing as a result is proportionate and alleging that he has been discriminated against. They claimed the sanctions constituted unlawful interference with his rights under the European convention on human rights. Shvidler is under sanctions on the basis of his relationship with Abramovich, who the government says obtains benefit from supporting the Kremlin, and because of his previous role as a non-executive director at steel firm Evraz, which the government says is of strategic significance to Russia. In an argument presented to the court on Thursday, Shvidler\u2019s lawyers said the effect of the sanctions had been to \u201cdestroy his ability to deal with his assets and conduct his business, to disrupt his life and the lives of his family, to deprive employees of their livelihoods and to shatter his reputation\u201d. This included his children being forced to leave the UK schools they were attending, Mr Justice Garnham was told. Lord Anderson, acting for Shvidler, also highlighted \u201ccolourful, untruthful and offensive\u201d statements made by government ministers including the then transport secretary, Grant Shapps, and then foreign secretary, Liz Truss, who said individuals who were under sanctions were \u201ccomplicit in the murder of innocent civilians\u201d. The sanctions and their effect, the lawyers claimed, were not proportionate because Shvidler had no influence over Vladimir Putin or the actions of the Russian state, yet had been used as a \u201cposter boy\u201d for sanctions by the UK government. Shvidler was also a British citizen, unlike the majority of other individuals subject to sanctions, meaning restrictions applied worldwide and were thus unusually onerous, his lawyers told the hearing. They claimed he was being subjected to \u201coppressive treatment\u201d by the British government. The proportionality of sanctions was particularly important, his lawyers argued, because the government\u2019s scope for applying sanctions was so wide that it should have given greater consideration to their effects. Shvidler, who appeared live by video link from his home in the US, where he also holds citizenship, also claimed he had been discriminated against in relation to his role at Evraz. The UK government claimed Evraz, which produces steel, was of strategic significance to the Russian government. The argument is a key plank of its rationale for placing sanctions on people who worked for, or owned a stake in, the company. But other Evraz executives with no Russian links had not faced sanctions, Shvidler\u2019s lawyers said, nor had executives at oil and gas companies with sizeable and lucrative interests in Russia, such as BP and Shell. Shvidler played down his links to Abramovich, saying that while the pair were longtime business associates, the Foreign Office was wrong to conclude that he derived financial benefit from the relationship. Abramovich was put under sanctions two weeks before Shvidler, with the Foreign Office citing the former Chelsea owner\u2019s alleged closeness to the Kremlin. He has not contested the sanctions. The ties between the Shvidler and Abramovich, in particular their respective interests in Evraz, were among the initial reasons that the former was targeted, resulting in his two jets being impounded. His request for the Foreign Office to review the sanctions had been refused, his lawyers said. They added that the government had subsequently narrowed its reasons for sanctioning both men, withdrawing the accusation that Abramovich was involved in \u201cdestabilising\u201d Ukraine and instead saying he derived \u201cbenefit\u201d from supporting the Kremlin. However, the Foreign Office will say, according to a skeleton argument, that it carried out a \u201cdetailed and conscientious\u201d review of the proportionality of the sanctions. It argues that it is reasonable to conclude that imposing sanctions on Shvidler would lead him to put pressure on Abramovich, who enjoys a good relationship with Putin and could use his influence to persuade the Russian president to end the war in Ukraine. Imposing sanctions on individuals close to Putin would also provide a disincentive to associate with him in future, government lawyers said. They acknowledged that Shvidler had made public statements opposing the war but said the sanctions would incentivise him to take private action to lobby against it. The government lawyers added that Shvidler and others would also be disincentivised from working in or investing in sectors of strategic and economic benefit to Russia. Contesting the allegation of discrimination, the government said it did not place sanctions only on Evraz directors of Russian ethnicity but on those who were also associated with Abramovich. The case continues."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b22317", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/20/lioness-believed-to-be-on-loose-in-berlin", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Lioness believed to be on loose in Berlin", "lead": "People urged to stay inside as officials track down \u2018dangerous animal\u2019 in south-west of capital", "author": "Philip Oltermann in Berlin", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 12:36:13", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.229717", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/e872cb17a1e5f6131a258ef4fc69ae01057915d9/228_1696_2691_1615/500.jpg", "body": "Residents on the south-western outskirts of Berlin are being urged to stay indoors after overnight sightings of a \u201cloose, dangerous animal\u201d, suspected to be an escaped lioness. Brandenburg police advised people living in the districts of Kleinmachnow, Stahnsdorf and Teltow on the borders of the German capital to refrain from walking in the woods and to keep pets or farm animals indoors on Thursday. Nurseries were allowed to open but were urged to avoid letting children play outdoors. Authorities are using helicopters, drones and thermal imaging cameras to track down the big cat, which police believed was resting in a wooded area. A veterinarian and two armed hunters were on site and under orders to either stun or shoot dead the animal, officials in the district of Potsdam-Mittelmark said. \u201cAround midnight we received a notification that we couldn\u2019t believe,\u201d the Brandenburg police spokesperson Daniel Kiep told the broadcaster rbb. \u201cTwo passersby spotted an animal chasing after another.

Reports of a sighting in the Zehlendorf district, inside Berlin\u2019s borders, had turned out to be a false lead. Fire services in Brandenburg said the large animal was \u201cpresumably a lioness\u201d. However, the director of a circus in the Teltow area told local media he was not aware of any lions being held in circuses or private zoos in the area and said the animal could be a misidentified Caucasian shepherd dog. \u201cIf it\u2019s a lion I\u2019ll eat a broom,\u201d Michel Rogall told Tagesspiegel newspaper. Police said they had not been informed of any lion escape in the area. \u201cNeither an animal park, a zoo nor a circus is missing such an animal,\u201d a spokesperson said.

The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities confirmed that Michael Gove, the secretary of state, disagreed with the recommendation from inspectors to approve the plans and had \u201cdecided to refuse permission\u201d. Stuart Machin, the boss of M&amp;S, said the decision left it with \u201cno choice but to review its future position\u201d on the UK\u2019s premier high street after almost a century \u201con the whim of one man\u201d. Machin accused Gove of \u201cplaying to the gallery\u201d with the decision, which he said was a \u201cshortsighted act of self-sabotage\u201d the effects of which would be \u201cfelt far beyond the West End\u201d. He insisted that a retrofit for the building was \u201cnot an option \u2013 despite us reviewing sixteen different options\u201d and accused Gove of \u201cchoking off growth and denying Oxford Street thousands of new quality jobs.\u201d \u201cIt is particularly galling given there are currently 17 approved and proceeding demolitions in Westminster and four on Oxford Street alone making it unfathomable why M&amp;S\u2019s proposal to redevelop an aged and labyrinthian site that has been twice denied listed status has been singled out for refusal.\u201d Gove said he had refused permission partly because it would \u201cfail to support the transition to a low carbon future, and would overall fail to encourage the reuse of existing resources, including the conversion of existing buildings\u201d. In a written decision, posted online, Gove said he was not convinced that M&amp;S and its architects had thoroughly explored the alternatives to demolition of the existing buildings and that the public benefits of the new development did not \u201coutweigh the harm to the significance of a number of designated heritage assets\u201d including the nearby Selfridges department store. Gove did not agree with the planning inspector\u2019s assessment that refusing the development would lead to substantial harm to the viability of Oxford Street and the surrounding area. In his report, published alongside Gove\u2019s decision, planning inspector David Nicholson, who oversaw a two-week inquiry into the M&amp;S scheme last autumn, recommended the project should go ahead partly because any decision that made closure and partial vacancy of the site more likely \u201cwould intensify the concerns for the vitality and viability of Oxford Street\u201d. He concluded that if the scheme was not given approval then \u201csooner or later, the M&amp;S store will close and will not be replaced by comparable retail concerns\u201d. While Gove said there would be some negative impact from the decision, he said \u201cthe extent of any such harm would be limited\u201d. Henrietta Billings, director of SAVE Britain\u2019s Heritage which has campaigned against M&amp;S\u2019s plan, said: \u201cThis is a hugely important decision that rightly challenges the way we continually and needlessly knock down and rebuild important buildings across our towns and cities. \u201cRepurposing and converting buildings we cherish and saving thousands of tonnes of C02 in the process is a no brainer. This is a massive positive step and we salute the secretary of state.\u201d The row over the fate of the Oxford Street store has become a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre in the battle over the shape of redevelopments and the fate of Britain\u2019s high streets. In June 2022, Gove ordered a public inquiry into the plan to demolish and rebuild the store. The decision comes amid a struggle to fill empty shops and two other department stores on Oxford Street \u2013 the former House of Fraser and Debenhams, which have closed down and are in the process of redevelopment, if not complete rebuilding. Cllr Geoff Barraclough, from Westminster city council, the local authority, said it was right that the case for redeveloping the store should be \u201ctested robustly\u201d and its position \u201cis to encourage landowners to refurbish buildings, not demolish them\u201d. \u201cClearly this is a disappointing day for M&amp;S but we hope they return with a revised scheme which meets the new tests presented by the climate emergency,\u201d he said. There has been a shift in sentiment towards refurbishing existing buildings rather than demolishing them, amid growing awareness of the carbon footprint and climate impact of such schemes. Campaigners argued the M&amp;S project would have released 40,000 tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere. The retailer had said its planned development would use 25% less energy than the existing site \u2013 benefits designers Pilbrow + Partners argue will last a century \u2013 with a maximum carbon payback of 17 years and potentially less than 10. That argument won over Westminster council\u2019s planning authorities, while the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, opted not to intervene over the M&amp;S application, considering it in line with the capital\u2019s planning strategy."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b22319", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/20/judge-rejects-challenge-to-surrey-hills-oil-and-gas-exploration-plans", "primaryCategory": "environment", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Judge rejects challenge to Surrey Hills oil and gas exploration plans", "lead": "Campaigners lose judicial review of decision to approve plan by UK Oil &amp; Gas to drill on agricultural land", "author": "Damien Gayle", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 12:34:52", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.229756", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/597f756868ef06e41413b493f0e3fef02aabc2b8/0_182_5444_3267/500.jpg", "body": "Fossil fuel prospectors have cleared another hurdle on their path to drill for oil and gas near an area of outstanding natural beauty (AONB) in the Surrey Hills after campaigners lost a judicial review of the plan.

But in a ruling handed down on Thursday, Mrs Justice Steyn said the decision to allow drilling in Dunsfold was \u201cnot sufficiently similar to trigger application of the consistency principle\u201d. Steyn also dismissed an argument that the decision to approve the plan failed to give enough weight to conserving and enhancing landscape and scenic beauty in AONBs. \u201cThe fact that harm is to the AONB increases the weight to be attributed to it,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the harm to the AONB from a temporary development such as this clearly can, in principle, attract moderate weight in the overall planning balance.\u201d Last year the government gave UK Oil &amp; Gas the green light to spend three years drilling for oil on agricultural grazing land near Dunsfold. The picturesque village, which dates back to Norman times, sits on the Weald basin, a topographical region stretching across south-east England that is estimated to contain hundreds of thousands of tonnes of oil. The development will involve building an exploratory borehole and a sidetrack borehole, an access track and works to widen nearby roads. Sarah Godwin, the director of Protect Dunsfold, which brought the judicial review proceedings together with the local council, said they were \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d and would consider an appeal. \u201cIt seems incredible that within the current context of extreme weather conditions throughout the northern hemisphere, planning policy still supports such speculative and unnecessary onshore oil and gas exploration,\u201d she said.

Australia made hard work of it, but even without Sam Kerr it was a night to remember, the Matildas launching their World Cup campaign with a hard fought victory on home soil in front of 75,000 spectators. I\u2019ll leave you with Kieran\u2019s match report, but stay tuned for plenty more reaction and analysis over the coming days. The next match in Group B is tomorrow when Nigeria take on Canada in icy cold Melbourne. Australia are back in action this time next week against the Super Falcons in Brisbane. Don\u2019t forget, there is a mountain of World Cup coverage just a couple of clicks away, not just on Australia and the other contenders, but all the stories that matter. Stand-in skipper Steph Catley has had a few words with the host broadcaster. I think it\u2019s been a long build up to this game and there has obviously been a lot of anticipation, a lot of anxiety. That\u2019s natural. I think you could see that in moments. We were nervy and probably didn\u2019t play as calmly as we normally do and Ireland were fantastic. They put us under pressure, played their corners really well and fair play to them. There were nervy moments we will look to clean up further in the tournament. On hearing Sam Kerr would miss the match through injury: Heartbreak to be honest. It is one of the most difficult things you can go through as a team, one day out from the biggest tournament in our lives, probably the best player in the tournament going down. Other teams are probably frothing \u2013 it is great for them. We got a lot of relief from the way she reacted and we put ourselves out there tonight and made sure we got the win for her. On slotting home the winning penalty: Yeah, it was a big moment. I\u2019ve been practising a lot, and I do like taking set pieces, so I take it like a set piece, take a breath, hit it where I want to hit it and luckily it went in. On the scale of the night and the remainder of the tournament: I think it\u2019s been the longest four years in my life building up to that game. The fact we got the win, got a clean sheet and battled hard in situations that are really difficult. I think they are one of the best teams in they are one of the best teams in the world at set pieces. They have fantastic aerial threats and deliveries. If we handle threats like that well throughout the tournament, we stand in good stead. Here\u2019s how Kieran Pender saw things from inside Stadium Australia. No Kerr, no worries. That was the message from the Matildas on Thursday evening, with a historic win over Ireland in the host\u2019s opening match of the Women\u2019s World Cup. Gustavsson will be thrilled with yet another clean sheet \u2013 Australia\u2019s third in a row and seventh in nine matches. Clare Hunt continues to excel at the highest level, Alanna Kennedy has slotted seamlessly back into the centre of defence from injury, and Mackenzie Arnold exudes confidence in goal. There can be no questioning the commitment further up the park either with Gorry and Cooney-Cross thundering into challenges all night and the likes of Raso and Carpenter refusing to shirk a physical challenge. That was a fierce battle between two committed teams. Ireland showed great discipline for 45 minutes, and then gave all they had in the final 20 to rescue a result after falling behind. Australia had the upper hand for most of the night, but created very little in the absence of Sam Kerr. In the first half they looked unable to change their game plan when Ireland denied them the space they crave, and then they were forced to hang on nervously at the death. Australia\u2019s home World Cup campaign is up and running\u2026 just. 90+6 mins: Oh! Was that Ireland\u2019s opportunity? Payne plays the ball down the right and it somehow evades three Australian defenders. Larkin pounces, puts the cross over but McCabe can\u2019t shift her feet quick enough and eventually can only force Arnold into a half-hearted save. 90+5 mins: Ireland are leaving bodies upfield in these closing stages, hurling the ball forward in a bid to win a positive ricochet. None are forthcoming and Australia are almost home. 90+3 mins: Another corner, easily dealt with this time, but Ireland refuse to accept defeat. First to everything in midfield the ball breaks to Larkin but her effort is wide and Arnold can milk the clock before the resumption of play. 90+1 mins: The free-kick from Connolly clips the wall and whistles behind for a corner. That was close! The corner is whipped across and Arnold for the second time tonight has to punch clear from her line with the ball curling towards goal! Ireland pressing hard late on. 89 mins: Ooooh, decent opportunity for Ireland here. The ball was bouncing around in midfield, an Irish boot got to it first, stabbing it towards the penalty area, where Hunt is too eager to climb over Atkinson, sending the forward to the turf. The result is a very very dangerous free-kick opportunity. 88 mins: Australia now have five at the back, one of whom is Carpenter, who continues to bomb down the right flank, hoping to dovetail with Raso. Nothing comes of it this time, but over on the Irish right Larkin shows a nice turn of pace to get down the outside and whip over a cross, but the composed Arnold is unflustered and plucks the ball out of the sky. 87 mins: Quinn easily heads clear Catley\u2019s delivery but Raso recycles possession well and dinks over a cross that\u2019s a fraction too high for Foord. Atkinson comes on for Carusa as Pauw tries to rescue a result at the death. 85 mins: Gorry, probably the player of the match, steps up in midfield to win the ball cleanly. She looks for Raso but the winger is caught by a stray finger and the Matildas settle for the free-kick. 83 mins: McCabe\u2019s first effort is headed clear. The second is more dangerous, but again Australia\u2019s rearguard is well marshalled. Hunt and Kennedy have looked very strong. Gustavsson makes another defensive change with Mary Fowler making for veteran Claie Polkinghorne. 82 mins: Play is increasingly stretched now with both midfields AWOL. Australia again probe on the edge of the box but can\u2019t fashion a clear opportunity. A couple of toe-poked interceptions later and Ireland have a corner at the other end. 81 mins: Australia almost seal it! Fowler links well with Raso on halfway who frees Foord down the right. IT\u2019s all very similar to the goal against France but the pullback this time is to Gorry, and her effort is blocked. 79 mins: Arnold does superbly on her line to catch the in-swinging corner above a coconut shy of heads and under immense pressure. She suffers a knock for her troubles, which allows Gustavsson a chance to send some messages out to his troops. 78 mins: It\u2019s still all Ireland. O\u2019Sullivan with a dangerous cross form the right towards Larkin that Carpenter sends out for yet another corner. 75 mins: Another corner to Ireland, their third in quick succession. Ol\u00e9s ring around the ground as McCabe curls one over with her left foot. Arnold can\u2019t get out to punch, but Australia manage to clear. They don\u2019t deal with the recycled phase though and when the ball eventually works its way back into the penalty area the Matildas look nervy at the back, desperate to keep their upper limbs out of the way of the bouncing ball with the Brazilian referee studying the scene with intent. 74 mins: The cross towards the penalty spot is flicked clear but only as far as O\u2019Sullivan. From the edge of the box the Irish No 10 can\u2019t get enough purchase on her volley and the shot floats wide. Gustavsson, sensing the change in the pattern of play sacrifices Vine for Van Egmond to stiffen up the Australian midfield. 73 mins: It\u2019s taken Ireland those couple of substitutions and a few minutes of readjustment, but they\u2019re coming at Australia now. That same intensity in the tackle remains but now there are more bodies in front of the ball to capitalise on turnovers. From broken field a nice break down the left forces Gorry into conceding a corner. 71 mins: McCabe takes it with her left foot and almost curls it directly into the net! That was a vicious delivery and Arnold does well to get a fist to the effort with the tall frame of Quinn providing a leaping obstacle. Good goalkeeping. 69 mins: For the first time all night the game is stretched with Ireland coming out of their shell and Australia relishing the opportunity to run into space. The Matildas link passes but an isolate Vine turns into trouble and Ireland head down the other end quickly. Catley does well in defence but Quinn still earns a rare corner. 68 mins: Catley\u2019s delivery is perfect for Foord to glance on at the near post, but there\u2019s nobody to stick home the opportunity at the back stick. 67 mins: Ireland try to work through the lines out of defence but there\u2019s no fluency. Gorry pounces o the indecision and drives towards goal, letting fire from the edge of the box, but her effort is deflected wide for a corner. 65 mins: There\u2019s not a lot happening in either box as Australia slowly assert themselves. Ireland have adjusted their structure, shifting to a 4-4-2, but they\u2019re yet to gather any momentum. 62 mins: Australia are now dominating possession, and the goal advantage means there isn\u2019t the desperation of the first half to get the ball forward quickly. Pauw finally turns to her bench. Farrelly and Sheva are replaced by Larkin and Quinn. Will they make the difference? 60 mins: Fowler concedes a turnover trying to knit play together. It offers Ireland the opportunity to break but they don\u2019t have numbers in attack and Australia are soon back on the ball. The Matildas work it down the right before Hunt lofts a cross over that Payne fails to deal with. Foord stands Payne up and works the ball back to Gorry who unleashes a horrendous wayward effort. Ireland have to shake things up soon. 58 mins: Speaking of playing nicely into hands, Arnold floats off her line to pluck out a deep free-kick with superb composure. She\u2019s had very little to do tonight but that demonstrates her form and concentration. 57 mins: Ireland are trying to rouse themselves but they have simply not been set-up to break Australia down. It\u2019s going to take a major re-jig, which of course will invite the Matildas to hit them on the break \u2013 which will play nicely into Tony Gustavsson\u2019s hands. 55 mins: The battle of the night over on the Irish left continues with McCabe hustled to the ground by the smirking Gorry, Raso coming over to play bodyguard. The resulting free-kick is swung over but easily dealt with by the Australian defence. 54 mins: Fowler almost makes it two! Australia press quickly from the restart and the ball breaks to the Manchester City star on the edge of the box but her left-footed effort flies over. 53 mins: You don\u2019t save those. Superb spot-kick. Catley is immediately swamped by all her teammates. The relief is palpable. Captain for the night Steph Catley sends Stadium Australia wild, belting a left-footed penalty high into the left corner. The Matildas are noticeably more patient in possession this half, and after Fowler\u2019s earlier skill, Australia look to keep the ball moving in the middle third until Cooney-Cross spots the darting Raso, who is bundled over in the box by Sheva. Stonewall penalty. 49 mins: The second half has yet to settle as Ireland resume their energetic pressing and diligent positional play. Australia need more from Mary Fowler to unpick this defence \u2013 and right on cue \u2013 she shows lovely control in the No 10 role and slides a ball through for the onrushing Vine. The Sydney speedster gets into the box but is bundled out of possession. 48 mins: The delivery is deep and arcing, but Australia flick it clear. There\u2019s another stoppage soon afterwards though as Australia even the ledger on the feisty McCabe. 47 mins: No changes at half-time, and Ireland will be happy with how the second period has begun, earning an early free-kick on the right in decent crossing range. 46 mins: The second-half is under way. Will we see a winner in Sydney? The teams are back out for the second half. The host broadcaster lingers over a disappointed-looking Sam Kerr wrapped up in a massive puffer jacket. If you\u2019ve just joined us, Australia\u2019s star has done a calf and will be out until at least the third group game. Time for a brew.

It takes less than a minute but makes a huge difference. Support the Guardian A full-blooded first-half ends goalless. Ireland are proving very awkward for a Sam Kerr-less Australia. 45+6 mins: Much better from Australia with the fullbacks pushing much wider, allowing Gorry space to run into in midfield, through the lines. Foord takes over, but she\u2019s crowded out in the box. Gorry then has a pop from distance that will pad both hers and Brosnan\u2019s stats. 45+5 mins: Australia are being allowed all the time on the ball they like in their defensive third, but as soon as they try to move the ball downfield Ireland snap into action. The Matildas look short of creativity. 45+4 mins: The crowd sighs as Vine passes a long way back from her attacking position on the left wing, but she had nowhere else to go with Ireland so disciplined in defence. 45+2 mins: Ireland win the ball in midfield but O\u2019Sullivan has nobody in front of her and is soon swamped by gold jerseys. 45 mins: This time the Matildas retain possession in midfield, probing first through Carpenter, then with Raso, but again Ireland time their moments to step out of defence and interrupt the flow of play to perfection. That said, McCabe then flies in recklessly at Gorry and is lucky to escape without a booking. 44 mins: Ireland\u2019s structure has been spot on. Australia go through another phase of feeding the two midfield screeners, only for Gorry and Cooney-Cross to send the ball backwards for a defender to pump it long. At which point, an Irish defender reads the play and intercepts. 42 mins: Raso and Vine try to muscle their way through the Irish defence but when the ball is in broken play Ireland\u2019s players are the hungrier. O\u2019Sullivan does superbly to control the tempo as the visitors look to work their way out of defence, but then she receives the first yellow card of the night for a late challenge as Australia brought bodies to the fight. 40 mins: Foord again shows her vision in the final third but her tempting ball across the penalty area has nobody to honour it. A Kerr, a Kerr, my kingdom for a Kerr! 38 mins: Now it\u2019s Australia\u2019s turn to grimace as Raso goes down after a clash of knees with McCabe. The Australian is no stranger to serious injuries. Thankfully this one looks just like a knock. 37 mins: The delay allows both coaches the opportunity to pass on some instructions to their players. McCabe has a few fingers on her left hand taped up, but she seems happy enough to continue. Nails, that one. 35 mins: Lovely skill in midfield form Cooney-Cross, then Foord does even better on the edge of the box to fashion half a yard of space, but her shot is blocked off the boot. She gets another chance soon afterwards but her snapshot on the left side of the penalty area is dragged harmlessly wide. Meanwhile, McCabe is down holding her left wrist. She landed heavily lunging to clear the ball away from Carpenter. Not good news for Ireland. 33 mins: Along with that McCabe challenge there has been no shortage of physicality in this half. There have been plenty of sliding challenges, shoulder-to-shoulder battles, and off-the-ball scrapping. Ireland will be delighted to have engineered such an outcome. 32 mins: Catley\u2019s delivery is menacing. Brosnan comes out to punch, doesn\u2019t get much purchase, but as the mass of bodies adjusts to the bouncing ball it\u2019s a green boot hacking it clear. 31 mins: McCabe flies in hard on Raso and leaves a few stud marks on the Australia\u2019s foot. the Matildas can load up with a set-piece on the right. 29 mins: Cooney-Cross and Gorry are repeatedly accepting the ball from Australia\u2019s back four, looking up, only to have to turn on their heels and conservatively retain possession. It\u2019s no surprise when Gorry is robbed in the forward press and Ireland can pour forward on the counter. Kennedy does well to repel the first effort, then Arnold is called into action to palm away a cross that risked leaking in at the far post. Eventually an offside flag brings the hosts some respite. 27 mins: Catley\u2019s left-footed inswinger teases the six-yard line but is headed behind bravely by an Irish defender. The second effort is even more dangerous and finds the forehead of the beribboned Raso six-yards out \u2013 but she nods wide. The first decent opportunity of the evening goes begging. 26 mins: The crowd is muted and the Matildas look a bit puzzled. Ireland are sticking to their task to the letter. They now have a corner to defend though with Raso winning a 50-50 on the right. 24 mins: Mary Fowler\u2019s technical skill in midfield threatens to be that Plan B, but after beating one green-jerseyed opponent she runs out of room. Australia recycle and overhit the long ball to Vine. Plenty for Tony Gustavsson to ponder. 23 mins: Kennedy is allowed to ping an early switch of play out of defence to Raso on the right, but she can\u2019t find the underlapping Carpenter and the move breaks down. This is a good example of the challenges of Australia\u2019s high-octane low-percentage game. When a team like Ireland cuts off the space they need a radical plan B. 22 mins: Ireland are enjoying a tidy spell. After a foul in midfield they probe down the right, but there\u2019s little penetration. 21 mins: Ireland again deal with the set-piece, but Australia recycle possession well on the edge of the box, until Cooney-Cross is caught in possession. Ireland sniff an opportunity and fire a beautiful arcing ball in behind the Australian defence for Carusa, but Gorry does superbly to snuff out the danger. Ireland get another look soon afterwards but Carpenter is alert to the cutback from the byline. 19 mins: Carusa tries her best to hold the ball up on the left wing but she doesn\u2019t have the support and Australia break at speed. The early ball into the inside left challenge from Arsenal\u2019s Catley to clubmate Foord does the trick. The latter dshows some neat footwork to twist into the box and earn a corner. 18 mins: Cooney-Cross swings the ball over from the left and Hunt arrives at the far post but without balance glances a header wide. 17 mins: Ireland\u2019s first entry into the box tonight should be cleared easily but it takes a few goes by the Matildas defence. Soon afterwards Australia smuggle the ball down the left channel and enjoy a fortunate ricochet to earn a corner. 15 mins: Ireland enjoy a decent spell of possession, recycling the ball all the way from their right wing, back through their defence, and out onto the left flank, all while Carusa was down nursing an injury. The move falls down when Raso runs full pelt into McCabe, conceding a free-kick. 13 mins: Gorry and Fowler link well in midfield, but they\u2019re desperate for the early ball over the top, and on this occasion from Cooney-Cross it\u2019s too hot for Raso to Handle. 12 mins: Australia have been unable to execute those long early direct balls with Ireland defending so deep. Consequently gold defenders are seeing plenty of possession, so far reluctant to carry the ball into the space in front of them and force the Irish out of their shape. 10 mins: Australia are struggling to control the ball in midfield and set the tempo. Ireland are matching the Matildas in the engine room, and defending deep to avoid being caught on the break. It\u2019s worked well so far, allowing them to ease their way into the contest. 8 mins: Textbook give and go one-two between Carpenter and Raso on the right. Both are so fast and strong they are a formidable combination. The Lyon fullback\u2019s cross is cleared at the near post and the second effort allows Ireland to clear. The Irish seize the opportunity to string some passes together, but they\u2019re mainly sideways, until\u2026 another throw-in. 7 mins: Most of the play so far has been in the vicinity of players with whitewash on their boots. Lots of throw-ins. the latest to Ireland courtesy of a robust sliding challenge from the industrious Gorry. Speaking of whom: \u201cThe broadcaster in Sweden just had a piece on how Katrina Gorry enjoys playing for Vittsj\u00f6 in the Swedish Damallsvenskan. The interview focuses on how four pensioners help out as nannies during trainings and games. It gives an interesting perspective on being a professional footballer far from the headlines created by Henderson and Ronaldo.\u201d Lovely stuff from H\u00e5kan Burden on the emails in Gothenburg. 6 mins: Gorry\u2019s nearpost delivery is headed clear and Ireland scrap hard to ensure the second and third balls do not return to the box. 5 mins: Vine again showing her blistering pace to time her run in behind on the left and control a raking pass in the channel. Ireland do well to get bodies over to cover, but they soon concede a corner. 4 mins: Lovely play form Gorry in midfield, interchanging passes with Raso then jinking her way into space. She feeds Vine on the left with a switch of play but the Sydney FC forward\u2019s cross is easily blocked. 3 mins: The Irish fans may be outnumbered but they are in full voice. Ole, ole, ole, ole, is followed by an audible rendition of The Fields of Athenry. 2 mins: Australia immediately on the front foot, probing first down the left, then allowing the back four plenty of touches of the ball to acclimatise to the occasion. The Matildas are structured as expected with Fowler tucking in behind Foord. Australia\u2019s World Cup campaign on home soil is under way\u2026 As kick-off approaches, players stand around the centre circle to observe a moment\u2019s silence for victims of today\u2019s shooting in Auckland. Final shout out to readers tuning in from Sydney, Amman, and even Proxima Centauri. Barry Foley, your hopes for an Irish win are lucky to make the cut. Kick-off is imminent. Let\u2019s hope we\u2019re in for a match worthy of the occasion. Advance Australia Fair receives a much louder rendition, with most of the 70,000+ crowd joining in. The Matildas are in gold jerseys tonight, green shorts, white socks. Everything is in place. Ireland\u2019s players drape their arms around each other\u2019s shoulders for the national anthem. The underdogs will be in traditional green this evening, with white shorts and green socks. The teams are about to come back out on to the pitch. Here are some warm up snaps from earlier. Out stride the two teams on to the Stadium Australia turf. A moment each of the 22 players will remember for the rest of their lives. Tonight\u2019s officials are all from South America. Brazilian Edina Alves Batista is the referee, with compatriots Neuza Back and Leila Moreira da Cruz running the line. Fourth official Mar\u00eda Carvajal is from Chile, and the VAR is Daiane Muniz dos Santos from Brazil. Are you lot winding me up now? \u201cI\u2019m watching from mostly cloudy Reykjav\u00edk, where it\u2019s 12 degrees and mostly windy. Behind the screen I\u2019m watching there\u2019s a rose bush which is as buzzing with bees as I am buzzing with excitement. Also, I\u2019m buzzing from the third cup of coffee of the morning. Best wishes.\u201d Best wishes to you too, K\u00e1ri Tulinius. In news that will not surprise Sydney commuters, reports are coming through of long delays for fans making their way to Stadium Australia by rail. Stick a pin in Thailand on the map of liveblog readers, thanks to Andrew Wright. \u201cJust watched the opening game here in Bangkok as the monsoon rains came down. Great work by New Zealand! Hoping Mary Fowler can step up and score a few - should be good seeing her play further forward and more centrally. Along with Raso, Vine and Foord, that\u2019s still a very incisive forward line with pace on the flanks too.\u201d It\u2019s clear Australia are going to attack at pace down the flanks and get the ball forward as quickly as possible. However, without Kerr in the box to target there\u2019s the risk of a lack of potency in front of goal \u2013 especially in the air. Is it even football without David Squires? We\u2019ve had readers getting in touch from Ireland, the US, and now Lebanon. \u201cI\u2019m watching live from my place in Beirut where it\u2019s heading towards 30\u2019C,\u201d emails Miriam Adams-Schimminger. \u201cI\u2019ve taken the day off from my thesis and I\u2019m confident that the mighty Matildas can do us proud.\u201d The Kerr news comes as a huge shock, barely an hour out from the opening match. But the shock is compounded because yesterday evening, at the pre-match press conference, it was business as usual from Kerr and coach Tony Gustavsson. Neither said a word about Kerr\u2019s injury, which we now know was suffered on Wednesday morning at the team\u2019s final pre-match training session. Kerr seemed confident, upbeat, excited - no hint that she might not play in the opening matches of a home World Cup. But here we are - the Matildas Kerr-less ahead of the biggest match in their history. A mild and sunny winter\u2019s day has given way to a cool dry evening in Sydney. A northerly breeze may keep the corner flags active, but it shouldn\u2019t interfere with play. HarryofOz is here, so everything feels right with the world. \u201cWhat a fantastic start to the World Cup. A terrific and fully deserved win for New Zealand. And what amazing scenes at the end, is that not the reason that we all follow sport? Just to see moments of joy and scenes like that. Saddened of course to now hear the Sam Kerr will miss the first two matches, but hopefully we can overcome that. Come on you Matildas. Make the night even better.\u201d \u201cAs an Irishman, I am very excited about today\u2019s match v Australia,\u201d emails Niall O\u2019Keefe. \u201cThe match is at 11 am here and many young Irish girls here will have, what I call, their \u2018Italia 90\u2019 moment. That was the first World Cup Ireland qualified for and we did OK, losing to hosts Italy in the quarter-finals! Naturally, I feel empathy for Sam Kerr. Top player and person and we are lucky she is out. I predict an Irish win. In the 1994 World Cup in the USA, 90% of the crowd who witnessed Ireland beating Italy in New Jersey, was in green. Irish folks have a knack at getting tickets. My bold prediction is half the crowd at kick off will be in green! COYGIG. Come on you girls in green.\u201d The parallels are easy to draw between the World Cup debuts of the Irish men and women. Vera Pauw feels it too, channelling Jack Charlton in her press conference a few days ago, urging her charges to \u201cgive it a lash\u201d. If this experience is anything like Italia 90, Irish fans are in for a treat. Speaking of Julie Dolan, here she is in conversation with our own Jack Snape outside the ground a short while ago. The journey to nights like tonight has been long and full of sacrifices, driven by the passion of individuals like Julie Dolan. \u201cGreeting from pitch dark California,\u201d emails Mary Waltz. It\u2019s 2am Mary, I hope you have a good barista. \u201cGutted for Kerr, and the Aussies. I decided to set my alarm so I could see the best striker in the women\u2019s game and the first thing I read is she is injured. This is the drama of the World Cup. It will be fascinating to see how the home side responds to this blow.\u201d It sure will. The solitary goal against France last week came without her on the pitch, so the alternatives are there. But it\u2019s the intangibles \u2013 the leadership, the confidence she exudes, the fear she generates in her opponents \u2013 that Australia will miss the most. Here\u2019s the full story of Sam Kerr\u2019s absence from Australia\u2019s opening two matches. Vera Pauw sticks with the XI that started their farewell friendly with France in Dublin recently. Arsenal star Katie McCabe has the honour of captaining Ireland on their World Cup debut, and her battle on the left flank with Real Madrid flyer Hayley Raso will be one to watch. Ireland: (5-4-1) Brosnan (GK), Payne, Quinn, Fahey, Connolly, McCabe \u00a9 / Littlejohn, O\u2019Sullivan, Farrelly, Carusa / Sheva. Tony Gustavsson\u2019s starting XI features ten of the same faces that defeated France in Melbourne last week. Of course, the one change could not be more significant, with Sam Kerr replaced by Mary Fowler. Without Kerr leading the line it will force a reshuffle of the forward line with Caitlin Foord likely to start as an out-and-out striker with Fowler tucking in behind. Australia: (4-4-2) Arnold (GK), Carpenter, Hunt, Kennedy, Catley / Raso, Cooney-Cross, Gorry, Vine / Fowler, Foord. KP has also cast his eye on Ireland\u2019s preparations in Brisbane. Pauw\u2019s Republic of Ireland side make their Women\u2019s World Cup debut on Thursday. As if that moment was not significant enough, Ireland\u2019s opponents are co-hosts Australia, in the Matildas\u2019 opening match of their first home World Cup. The Irish players will walk out to a record-breaking crowd at Stadium Australia, with most of the 81,500 fans anticipating a home victory. But Pauw and her players have other ideas. In their last training session in camp at Football Queensland\u2019s headquarters, before the team travel to Sydney to begin final preparations, the Irish are plotting what would be an almighty upset. Kieran Pender is our man with the Matildas, and he set the scene from the Australian camp in Sydney \u2013 before the bombshell news about Sam Kerr was public\u2026 In the search of the intangible, last week the Matildas backroom staff brought Cathy Freeman into camp. The Sydney 2000 Olympics sensation knows all too well how to succeed with the weight of a nation\u2019s expectations on her shoulders, and agreed to meet with the Matildas to share her wisdom. \u201cIt\u2019s just a crazy, wild ride,\u201d Freeman told the players. \u201cYou\u2019re writing your names in history, ladies.\u201d Matildas captain and star striker Sam Kerr has been ruled out of the opening matches of the 2023 Women\u2019s World Cup due to injury. Barely an hour before Australia\u2019s campaign began at Stadium Australia on Thursday, Football Australia announced on social media that Kerr would be unavailable due to a calf injury picked up on Wednesday. \u201cSam will be unavailable for the next two matches with the Matildas Medical Team to re-assess her following our second group stage match,\u201d the team tweeted. Manchester City striker Mary Fowler was picked in the starting eleven in Kerr\u2019s place. Kerr fronted at press conference on Wednesday evening and gave no indication that anything was amiss. Kerr added in a post on Instagram: \u201cUnfortunately I sustained a calf injury yesterday in training. I wanted to share this with everyone so there is no distraction from us doing what we came here to achieve. Of course I would have loved to have been out there tonight but I can\u2019t wait to be apart of this amazing journey which starts now.\u201d Straight in with some breaking news, and it is the doomsday scenario for Australia. Captain, goalscorer, and driving force Sam Kerr will not play tonight, or on matchday two after picking up a calf injury. More to follow. Hello everybody and welcome to live coverage of Australia v Republic of Ireland from Sydney\u2019s Stadium Australia. Kick-off in this World Cup Group B opener is 8pm. It is the biggest moment in the history of football in Australia, at the start of a month that could see such a statement superseded many times over. It is a moment Australia has been building towards since 2019 and the start of the host nation bidding process. During that period the women\u2019s national team has continued its inexorable surge in popularity. The Matildas are now in the conversation for Australia\u2019s team and star players like Sam Kerr have blossomed into household names. Kerr has claims to being the greatest female footballer on the planet, and the majority of her teammates play for the best clubs in the most demanding leagues. The Matildas may have proven themselves adept at PR and brand partnerships, but high performance is a prerequisite. For a period after the appointment of coach Tony Gustavsson in 2020 that wasn\u2019t the case. But the Swede\u2019s long-term plans appear to be coming together with perfect timing. Victories this year over England and France are testament to the potential of Australia being more than just gracious hosts. Ranked tenth in the world by FIFA, on current form they warrant a nudge up the ladder, then throw in home comforts and passionate support over the next few weeks and the profile of a genuine contender emerges. By contrast, Ireland\u2019s ambitions are more limited. Drawn in a group alongside the tournament hosts, as well as Olympic gold medallists Canada, getting to the knockout stage will be a minor miracle. But, on debut, there will be much to take away from the World Cup experience nonetheless, not least the thrill of an opening night full house in the stadium that hosted the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games. I\u2019ll be back with team news and insights from the two camps shortly.

The Swedish energy giant Vattenfall said it would stop work on the multibillion-pound Norfolk Boreas windfarm, designed to power the equivalent of 1.5m British homes, because it was no longer profitable. The state-owned company said costs had climbed by 40% due to a rise in global gas prices which have fed through to the cost of manufacturing, putting \u201csignificant pressure on all new offshore wind projects\u201d. \u201cIt simply doesn\u2019t make sense to continue this project,\u201d said Anna Borg, Vattenfall\u2019s chief executive. \u201cHigher inflation and capital costs are affecting the entire energy sector, but the geopolitical situation has made offshore wind and its supply chain particularly vulnerable.\u201d Vattenfall won a government contract to build the Norfolk Boreas project last year after bidding a record low price of \u00a337.35 per megawatt hour (MWh) for the electricity generated. Borg said it was \u201cso obvious to everyone that the situation has changed dramatically since last year\u201d, meaning the price would now need to be \u201csignificantly higher\u201d to make financial sense. According to its latest results, the decision to stop work has cost the company 5.5bn Swedish krona (\u00a3415m) but Borg said the move was \u201cprudent\u201d given the impact of costs on the project\u2019s future profitability. \u201cThe market framework is simply not reflecting the market situation,\u201d Borg said. \u201cSomething needs to happen. It\u2019s important to understand that our suppliers are being squeezed. They have problems in their supply chain so it\u2019s not so easy to mitigate these situations.\u201d Borg said Vattenfall has called on the UK government to adapt the financial framework which controls the price and was in \u201cconstructive discussions\u201d with officials. Industry experts have said that without an overhaul of the government\u2019s financing approach to take into account the steep climb in costs, the UK risks missing its target to increase its offshore wind capacity fivefold to 50GW by 2030. Jess Ralston, the head of energy at the thinktank the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said the government had set the starting price for the next contract auction before the global rise in market prices, meaning it was now too low. \u201cThere are some concerns that this could be too low for projects that have suffered supply chain price inflation, excluding them from entering the auction,\u201d she said. \u201cThe sensible strategy would be to seek to involve in auctions as much capacity as possible.\u201d Under the government\u2019s scheme developers can compete in the auction for a contract which gives a guaranteed price for the electricity generated. If wholesale market prices are below this level the project receives a \u201ctop up\u201d payment through a levy on energy bills. But if market prices are above the \u201cstrike price\u201d the project must pay back the difference to consumers, leading to lower bills. Setting the auction\u2019s starting price at a higher point would still result in contract prices well below the current market rate, according to Ralston, meaning households will continue to pay money back to households for the foreseeable suture. Dan McGrail, the chief executive of RenewableUK, said ministers would have to take into account global inflationary pressures \u201cwhich have significantly changed the economic landscape\u201d. \u201cWe need a stronger industrial strategy for the sector, which the chancellor should support with new measures in the autumn statement as a matter of urgency,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government needs to step up with a robust response to enable industrial growth throughout Britain.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b2231c", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/20/government-plan-britain-extreme-heat-society-economy", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "subCategories": "test", "title": "I thought the government\u2019s plan to protect Britain from extreme heat would be bad.

One that isn\u2019t in the grip of the highest temperatures ever recorded, where tens of thousands of people are not dying every summer in blistering heatwaves, where the oceans aren\u2019t boiling. This is the only explanation for the colossally inadequate national climate adaptation programme released this week. There is so much wrong with it that it\u2019s hard to know where to begin. The programme actually constitutes the third of three five-year plans, and therein lies the main problem. You can\u2019t plan in five-year chunks for climate mayhem that is set to last for decades, probably centuries. If it is to make living in Hothouse Britain safer and more bearable, any plan worth its salt has to look much further ahead and take in the bigger picture. You won\u2019t find anything in the programme about how the country will cope when temperatures don\u2019t just top 40C for a day but for a week or more, when river and surface floods arrive that dwarf anything we have seen, or when the sea comes in and stays in. As it stands, it is simply not fit for purpose. With global emissions needing to fall by half within seven years, it is now practically impossible for us to stay this side of the 1.5C dangerous climate change guardrail. This means that climate breakdown and all its ramifications will define the lives and livelihoods of everyone in the UK for generations and we need to plan on a commensurate timescale. To have any chance of adapting effectively to what\u2019s coming, the country needs to be on a war footing, but you wouldn\u2019t think it from the laid-back approach of the government\u2019s programme, which does little more than tinker with already inadequate actions. The report that launched the programme is all talk and no money \u2013 or very little of it. A measly \u00a315m to support the research and innovation needed to deliver adaptation action amounts to peanuts. Much of the report is inconsequential padding, and there is no ambition here, and virtually no concerted action. Consequently, there is nothing concrete on reforesting uplands to minimise river flooding, on cooling urban centres through greening and installing reflective surfaces, or on the immediate, wholesale retrofitting of homes, schools and hospitals to make them, and their occupants, more resilient to heatwaves. Nothing either on developing a national water grid or introducing large-scale rainwater harvesting, or on managing retreat from low-lying coastlines as sea-level rise accelerates. More specifically, you will find no consideration given to whether a new Thames flood barrier should be built or central London abandoned to the sea. Nor is any thought given to legislating for maximum working temperatures, both indoors and outside. The research underpinning all these initiatives has already been done, and the work could start today, given a green light and appropriate funding by government. The reason none of this is considered is that the government has no real grasp of the scale of the climate breakdown threat, either today or in the decades ahead. This is typified by plans to cope with food shortages that are laughable. The UK imports more than 40% of its food, and is therefore vulnerable to harvest failures abroad as well as at home. Shortages of certain produce have already become apparent in the past year or so, due to extreme weather overseas and supply chain problems, but this is small beer compared with what we can expect in future decades. In its 2021 climate change risk assessment, the Chatham House policy institute reports a worst-case projection that sees the world requiring 50% more food by 2050, by which time crop yields could be down as much as 30%. Translating, on average, to an effective halving of food per person, this \u2013 should it be realised \u2013 would be a recipe for societal collapse. A new paper published in Nature Communications earlier this month also highlighted the risks of simultaneous crop failures, but there is little in the latest adaptation programme that suggests this is a threat taken sufficiently seriously by the government. The initiatives that make up the programme are big on consultation, research, monitoring, building frameworks and gathering information, and there is a failure to recognise that these are luxuries whose time has come and gone. Instead of more discussion, debate and evaluation, we need action, now, on all fronts. It will cost, but it will cost a great deal more if we do little or nothing. If we wish to have anything like a functioning society and economy in mid-century and beyond, then large-scale adaptation is critical, and it has to start today. The environment secretary, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, has called the programme a step-change in the government\u2019s approach to managing the risks of the climate crisis. And indeed it is, a largely sideways step from nothing to next to nothing, when what we need is a great leap forward. And we need it now.

The move, in a draft document obtained by the DeSmog investigative journalism group and seen by the Guardian, appears to be part of an intensive two-year lobbying effort by a key gas boiler industry organisation, which has been critical of heat pumps, and promoted hydrogen for home heating to government and opposition parties, despite strong evidence of its unsuitability. The Energy and Utilities Alliance (EUA), an industry association that represents boiler manufacturers and other gas companies, including some that have branched out into heat pumps, has made a submission to a government consultation calling for measures forcing the industry to install more heat pumps to be delayed to 2026. Under the consultation on the clean heat market mechanism, published in March, ministers are proposing that, from 2024, manufacturers of fossil fuel boilers would face a quota for heat pump installations relative to their gas or oil boiler installations, with fines for failure to sell enough heat pumps. But in the draft, obtained by DeSmog and seen by the Guardian, the government targets are said by EUA to be \u201cunachievable\u201d because of the short timeframe, the difficulty manufacturers would face in gearing up to meet the regulations, and the potential cost of the fines, which the organisation has calculated at a potential \u00a3300m to UK industry. EUA wrote, in a document titled HHIC Clean Heat Market Mechanism Consultation Response: \u201cEUA does not believe that the proposed clean heat market mechanism will achieve its stated aims with the policy as currently designed. The central proposal that boiler manufacturers are able to dictate the products homeowners install in their homes is flawed.\u201d HHIC stands for Heating and Hot Water Industry Council, a trade body whose aim is to \u201cdefine practical solutions for decarbonising heat and hot water in UK homes and businesses\u201d, to which EUA is a parent organisation. Mike Foster, the chief executive of EUA, confirmed to the Guardian that EUA was seeking a delay to the introduction of the clean heat market mechanism to 2026. He told the Guardian that 2026 was a \u201csensible timeframe\u201d because the government\u2019s current proposals would hit gas boiler companies with fines for failing to install enough heat pumps, without putting in place the mechanisms necessary to allow them to sell more. Only about 30,000 heat pump installations are likely to qualify for grants under the government\u2019s upgrade scheme, but if boiler companies fail to install about 60,000 in private homes, they will be penalised. The limit on grants would act as a \u201cceiling\u201d on the number of heat pump installations in private homes, Foster said, making fines on the gas boiler industry almost inevitable. \u201cWhy would you retrofit without a grant when there are grants available?\u201d he asked. \u201cWho would want to fit one without accessing a grant?\u201d The EUA, with the help of a Birmingham PR firm, the WPR Agency, has also undertaken a campaign in the media that highlights some of the potential difficulties with installing heat pumps, evidence amassed by DeSmog suggests. EUA members are strongly identified with the gas boiler industry, with members including Cadent, which runs the UK\u2019s largest gas network, and many leading boiler manufacturers, including Baxi, Vaillant and Wolseley. EUA members carry out about 98% of the UK\u2019s heating installations, the vast majority of which are for gas boilers. Gas boiler makers and installers are facing an effective end to their industry, as it is currently constituted, if the UK moves to heat pumps as the main source of low-carbon home heating. They could turn to manufacturing and installing heat pumps, and some of the EUA\u2019s member companies, including Baxi, Vaillant and Wolseley, have done so, but these are a tiny part of their current market. Many companies also are working to repurpose their boilers to use hydrogen. This is viewed by experts as problematic, because more than 40 studies have found hydrogen to be unsuitable for home heating, as it is expensive, there are issues with its efficiency, and using it in the UK\u2019s leaky gas networks presents potential safety problems. Many current sources of hydrogen are also high-carbon. Foster, a former Labour MP, has used the media to promote hydrogen for home heating and criticise heat pumps. He has written articles for or been quoted in newspapers including the Sun, the Telegraph and the Express, and broadcast media such as GB News, LBC and BBC news. He wrote in the Times against the clean heat market mechanism: \u201cIf there is the demand for heat pumps then manufacturers will sell them anyway. But if the public don\u2019t want them, are you really helping by forcing companies to try and sell them? This feels like Soviet-style planning where you end up with warehouses full of Ladas that nobody wants.\u201d On the Politics.co.uk website, he wrote last year, about data on the cost of heat pumps: \u201cThese numbers make it crystal clear that the way to decarbonise homes currently using natural gas boilers is to switch to a net zero gas, not rip out the boiler. It is economically irrational to fit heat pumps, so converting the gas networks to hydrogen is the only sensible approach.\u201d Foster told the Guardian he was not against heat pumps. He said EUA had not lobbied the government against a ban on gas boilers, and said that in a personal capacity as chair of a fuel-poverty community-interest company he had approved projects to fund more than 11,500 heat pump installations. He said: \u201cEUA is not and has never been anti-heat pump. The only people suggesting this are those who know very little about decarbonising home heating or have some alternative agenda. EUA members make and sell heat pumps. EUA believes a wide range of technologies is needed to meet net zero \u2013 including heat pumps, heat networks and hydrogen. EUA does also highlight the many misleading claims around heat pumps and those promoting \u2018a one-size fits all\u2019 to the complex issue of decarbonising homes.\u201d On hydrogen, he said that heat pumps were not suitable for all homes, and hydrogen offered a potential alternative. \u201cEUA\u2019s stance, to explore hydrogen for heating, is in line with that of the government,\u201d he said. \u201cThe CCC [Committee on Climate Change] also identify a role for hydrogen, as does the Scottish government and the National Grid, in their future energy scenarios. Our view is also shared by some of the UK\u2019s biggest trade unions \u2013 GMB, Unite, Community, Unison and Prospect. Advocates of ruling out hydrogen as an eco-friendly energy source at this early stage are not serious about net zero, whereas we are.\u201d However, Grant Shapps, the energy secretary, recently appeared to cool on hydrogen for home heating. In a significant shift of stance, he told Politico earlier this month that although hydrogen could be used for heavy industry, it was unlikely to be used for homes. He said: \u201cI came in [to office] thinking, because this was the narrative that was around, that one day hydrogen will fuel homes. I think that\u2019s unlikely to be the way forward.\u201d In April, around the time EUA was drafting its plea to the government to delay measures that would promote heat pumps, WPR, the agency retained by EUA, sent a press notice to journalists detailing opposition by the EUA to the government plans for a clean heart market mechanism, describing \u201csome news of outrage from the heating and energy industry over policy that organisations believe is \u2018selling British manufacturers down the river\u2019.\u201d WPR until recently boasted on its website of campaigning to \u201cspark outrage at the cost and demand consumer choice over the heating technologies people put in their own homes. We demonstrated that, while consumers support climate change efforts, the government needs to take seriously concerns around choice and affordability.\u201d That wording has in recent days been changed to \u201cspark conversation\u201d. A spokesperson told the Guardian: \u201cWe changed the wording to better reflect the work we are doing for the EUA \u2013 that the country does not have to make a binary choice between heat pumps and hydrogen, we will need both to become net zero.\u201d The spokesperson added that the agency was not against heat pumps: \u201cWe work for manufacturers of heat pumps and are aware that they are a fantastic solution in the right properties. However, as manufacturers of heat pumps themselves admit, they aren\u2019t suitable for every home or every property. As with bodies such as the Climate Change Committee, and individuals such as the minister for energy efficiency and green finance, we believe we will need both heat pumps and hydrogen if we are to become net zero, which we must.\u201d Sarah Becker, of the Global Witness campaign group, said the promotion of hydrogen for home heating was based on manufacturers and installers seeking the least disruption to their business model. \u201cThe people who are pushing for hydrogen heating aren\u2019t genuinely interested in tackling climate breakdown \u2013 they\u2019re looking for a lifeline for the gas industry,\u201d she said. \u201cThey aren\u2019t just talking up a false climate solution, they\u2019re also working hard to undermine the right ones. Heat pumps will play an essential role in reducing our fossil fuel dependence and making our homes and buildings renewables-ready.\u201d Creating confusion in the minds of consumers has a serious impact on the uptake of heat pumps, according to Prof Martin Freer, director of the Birmingham Energy Institute. \u201cThe homeowner [in the UK] is confused by the mixed messages from government, industry and the [installation] sector around which low-carbon heating solution is best. This same confusion does not exist in countries such as Italy, Poland, France, Germany or the Netherlands.\u201d Foster said: \u201cI don\u2019t know how anyone could accuse me of sowing confusion, as I am clear that three [technologies] will be needed: heat pumps, distributed heat networks, and hydrogen for home heating. That is what the government has said. Why would the government be spending time investing in hydrogen otherwise?\u201d Foster added that he believed many critics of the EUA were lobbyists at the Regulatory Assistance Project, paid to undermine the UK\u2019s gas industry. Jan Rosenow, of the Regulatory Assistance Project, a thinktank that has drawn attention to the more than 40 studies finding hydrogen would not be viable for home heating, said: \u201cIt is quite ironic that lobbyists paid by the fossil fuel industry accuse me of being a lobbyist. I have never taken any money from the heat pump industry or lobbied on behalf of any other industry. I\u2019m an analyst with one agenda only: to decarbonise the energy system affordably and fairly to address the climate crisis. I never have and never will represent any special interests in my work.\u201d The Labour party press office did not respond to the Guardian\u2019s queries."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b2231e", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/20/west-ham-manchester-city-carlos-borges-arnaut-danjuma-everton", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "West Ham close to deal for Manchester City\u2019s Borges, Danjuma heads to Everton", "lead": "West Ham are close to winning the race to sign Carlos Borges from Manchester City after offering \u00a314m for the 19-year-old winger", "author": "Jacob Steinberg and Ben Fisher", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 12:14:10", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.229849", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/040e49187d905ab56009e100c79381b331726a70/0_0_3600_2160/500.jpg", "body": "West Ham are close to winning the race to sign Carlos Borges from Manchester City.

News of the small falls came 24 hours after it was announced that UK inflation fell further than expected in June, which immediately prompted speculation that the Bank of England would not raise interest rates by as much as previously expected. The pricing of fixed-rate mortgage deals is closely tied to expectations of future interest rate rises. Moneyfacts, the financial data provider, said the average rate on a new fixed-rate deal lasting for two years was now 6.79% \u2013 down from 6.81% on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the typical rate on a new five-year fix nudged down to 6.31%, from 6.33% a day earlier. The seemingly unrelenting rise in the cost of new deals has been piling pressure on would-be homebuyers and those whose fixed-term deals are expiring, and the new data will inevitably raise hopes in some quarters that new fixed rates may have peaked. However, it is too early to say whether these small falls are the start of a trend or merely a blip. Fixed-rate mortgage pricing has been on a rollercoaster ride in recent months: the average new two-year fixed rate was priced at about 4.75% in late September last year, but by the start of November it had climbed to 6.47%. In the months that followed, rates gradually fell back as markets stabilised, until they were spooked once again by a smaller than expected drop in the UK inflation rate at the end of May. They then resumed their upwards march, and the average two-year rate has been edging closer to 7%. Wednesday\u2019s official data revealed that the UK inflation rate eased to 7.9% in June. If the rate had stayed above 8%, some economists had suggested the Bank of England may have opted for another half-point increase in interest rates next month from the current level of 5%. However, they are now betting that a quarter-point rise is more likely. Nicholas Mendes, mortgage technical manager at broker John Charcol, said on Wednesday: \u201cIt will take a few months before we see any substantial decreases in fixed-rate pricing.\u201d However, Lewis Shaw, founder of broker Shaw Financial Services, said: \u201cI\u2019m going out on a limb here to say fixed mortgage rates have peaked.

That was the message from the Matildas on Thursday evening, with a historic win over Ireland in the co-hosts\u2019 opening match of the Women\u2019s World Cup. It was more laboured than expected, Australia struggling to break down a robust Irish defence following the 11th-hour omission of captain Sam Kerr due to a calf injury. But a clinical penalty from stand-in skipper Steph Catley early in the second-half was enough for victory in Sydney. Yet for all that the match should have been a celebration, the beginning of a momentous month-long festival of football on these shores, Kerr\u2019s absence and a less-than-vintage performance left fans in two minds as they departed Stadium Australia. The Matildas have three points and a clean sheet, but this was not World Cup-winning form from the hosts. It was a nervy start for the Matildas, shaken by the significance of the occasion, the expectant crowd and the late injury news. Mary Fowler replaced Kerr in the starting XI, tucked in behind Caitlin Foord who led the line in Kerr\u2019s absence. But neither fired immediately. The record-breaking 75,784 fans in attendance had come to be entertained on a historic night, but instead endured a tense opening passage. As both teams settled into the game Australia showed glimpses of the scything attacking movement that had looked so dangerous against France in last Friday\u2019s pre-tournament warm-up. In one attack midway through the half, the Matildas regained possession in their right corner. Katrina Gorry sprayed it horizontally across the park to Catley, who dispatched to Foord on the left wing. In the blink of the eye, the team had traversed the entire pitch \u2013 it was the Matildas at their counter-attacking best. But unlike France, Ireland were content to sit back and absorb the Australian pressure \u2013 three central defenders, two wing-backs and two defensive midfielders soaked up the Matildas\u2019 forward movement. Imposing themselves physically, the visitors brought the game to their hosts \u2013 midfield maestro Denise O\u2019Sullivan earned a yellow card for her over-exuberant efforts late in the half. Without the space created by an attacking opposition, the Matildas struggled to create any real opportunities. In occasional moments of fluid passing football the final touch was missing \u2013 neither Fowler nor Foord imposed themselves in the final third. In particularly desperate moments the team resorted to long-ball football, but the route-one approach was toothless without the aerial threat of Kerr. Early in the second half, a moment of good fortune struck. Following a period of attacking build-up on the left flank, the Matildas moved the ball into the middle. Kyra Cooney-Cross lobbed the ball into the box for on-rushing Hayley Raso, who was bundled down by Irish-American midfielder Marissa Sheva. There was no hesitation from Brazilian referee Edina Alves, who immediately pointed to the spot. With the weight of a nation on her shoulders, captain Catley placed the ball on the white dot. Then she waited, and waited. For what seemed like an age, Stadium Australia held its breath. They needn\u2019t have worried: Catley clinically sent the penalty past Courtney Brosnan and into the Irish net. The penalty energised the Matildas, with Fowler almost doubling the advantage just moments later. In response Ireland coach Vera Pauw rolled the dice with dual substitutes, Abbie Larkin and Lucy Quinn replacing Sheva, who had conceded the penalty, and Sinead Farrelly. At first it worked, the momentum shifting towards the Irish \u2013 who had been valiant in their Women\u2019s World Cup debut. But as the match wore on the Matildas regained composure; the addition of Emily van Egmond off the bench helping Australia. As the match entered injury time, the Matildas found themselves defending desperately \u2013 a far-cry from the dominance over the World Cup debutants expected before the match. But Ireland were unable to capitalise and the game concluded with Catley\u2019s penalty the only difference between the teams. In the stands at Stadium Australia, amid the capacity crowd (the highest of all time for a Matildas match on home soil), several fans held a banner aloft. It displayed the words of Johnny Warren, the grandfather of Australian football. Weeks before his passing in 2004, the ex-player, coach, administrator and commentator had been asked about his legacy. Warren said he wanted to be able to say \u201cI told you so\u201d to Australian football\u2019s many detractors. A World Cup on home soil, a record crowd, a national team that could legitimately win the tournament. Warren told us so, as did the many pioneers of women\u2019s football in this country \u2013 the players and staff who paid their way to early international tournaments, washed their own kits and, more recently, went on strike for equal pay. It was tense, it was nervy, it was Kerr-less. But on Thursday the Matildas made history \u2013 as all those who came before told us they would."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b22321", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/20/eu-climate-chief-frans-timmermans-quits-to-run-in-dutch-elections", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "EU climate chief Frans Timmermans quits to run in Dutch elections", "lead": "Departure of Green Deal\u2019s \u2018visionary mastermind\u2019 was anticipated after collapse of the Netherlands\u2019 coalition", "author": "Lisa O'Carroll Brussels correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 12:04:45", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.229906", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/c28bc78fa8ed1968936c4df99617a9afd429a658/0_17_4541_2724/500.jpg", "body": "Frans Timmermans, the mastermind of the EU\u2019s environment policies, is to quit the European Commission to return to national politics in the Netherlands.

Timmermans, a member of the Dutch Labour party, said he would run for the leadership of the combined Labour and Green Left parties before a Dutch national election due in November.

One Dutch political source said he expected Timmermans to have a good chance in November\u2019s election but that Rutte could be in power this time next year as Dutch politics was now so fragmented that it could take months to form a coalition.

Our goal is to give journalists the choice of using these emerging technologies in a way that enhances their work and productivity, just like we\u2019re making assistive tools available for people in Gmail and in Google Docs.\u201d Two executives at the New York Times who saw the pitch said it \u201cseemed to take for granted the effort that went into producing accurate and artful news stories\u201d. The paper quoted one person familiar with the product as saying the tool would serve as a \u201cpersonal assistant for journalists\u201d to automate some tasks, and that Google saw it as an opportunity to help \u201csteer the publishing industry away from the pitfalls of generative AI\u201d. The move comes after OpenAI and the Associated Press made a deal for the the ChatGPT maker to use the news agency\u2019s archive of stories for the purpose of training its AI models, which ingest vast amounts of material in order to produce plausible responses. In a report last month, the accounting group KPMG estimated that 43% of the tasks performed by authors, writers and translators could be carried out by AI tools. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development reported last week that major economies were on the \u201ccusp of an AI revolution\u201d that could lead to job losses in skilled professions such as law, medicine and finance. Apple is testing an AI-powered chatbot that engineers refer to as Apple GPT, according to Bloomberg. The chatbot is understood to have the potential to challenge ChatGPT, but Apple has not released a clear plan on releasing the technology to consumers. The chatbot operates from an AI model called Ajax. The Apple chief executive, Tim Cook, recently said the company was \u201clooking closely\u201d at AI technology. Peter Welinder, an OpenAI executive, has denied claims that the model underpinning the most advanced version of ChatGPT, a model called GPT-4, is getting \u201cdumber\u201d. Welinder said in a tweet that people were becoming such heavy users of it that they were noticing issues they hadn\u2019t seen before. \u201cWe haven\u2019t made GPT-4 dumber. Quite the opposite: we make each new version smarter than the previous one,\u201d he said. Users can check how responses have changed by inputting a previously used prompt from earlier days of ChatGPT and comparing the outputs. One user tweeted: \u201cit generates faster, but the quality seems worse.\u201d Another wrote on OpenAI\u2019s developer forum: \u201cIt\u2019s totally horrible now \u2026 It\u2019s braindead vs. before \u2026 if you aren\u2019t actually pushing it with what it could do previously, you wouldn\u2019t notice.

The Black Sea grain initiative was negotiated in July 2022 between Turkey, the UN and Russia as a way of ensuring that Ukraine, one of the breadbaskets of the world, could ensure that its grain could leave its southern ports via the Bosphorus. The grain could not be exported in the quantities required using the alternative methods of road or rail through Poland or by canal and river through Romania. Turkey was involved due to the close relationship between its president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, and Vladimir Putin and because under the Montreux convention signed in 1936 it oversees maritime traffic in the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits. What did grain deal promise? The initiative, one of the few diplomatic achievements since the war started, allows for commercial food and fertiliser (including ammonia) exports from three key Ukrainian ports in the Black Sea \u2013 Odesa, Chornomorsk, and Pivdennyi (formerly known as Yuzhny). Ukrainian vessels guide cargo ships into international waters of the Black Sea, avoiding mined areas. The vessels then proceed towards Istanbul along an agreed maritime humanitarian corridor. Ships heading to and from the Ukrainian ports are inspected by teams composed of Russian, Turkish, Ukrainian and UN inspectors. Alongside this memorandum, a separate deal was signed minimising the impact of sanctions on the export of Russian food and fertiliser. Both memorandums were subject to four- and then two-monthly reviews. Did it succeed? Despite the acute lack of trust, 33m tonnes of grain left Ukraine\u2019s ports in the year to July. The UK says about 61% of that has gone to low- and middle-income countries, and 65% of wheat alone. The World Food Programme bought about 750,000 tonnes of Ukrainian grain that was shipped immediately to places such as Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Somalia and Sudan. Partly as a result of this, the price of grain per bushel stabilised at $800 (\u00a3620), down from a high of $1,360. Russia claims the proportion of the grain that went to the very poorest countries was less than 4%, but this ignores the fact that even if wealthier countries were buying the wheat, the extra supply was depressing the general price all countries were paying. What started to go wrong? Russia started to slow down inspections. In October 2022 there were 10 completed ship inspections a day, meaning 4.2m metric tonnes left that month, falling to seven a day in November andtwo in May, when only 1.3m metric tonnes left. The UN had the capacity to inspect as many as 40 ships a day. Compared with March 2023, there was a 29% decrease in food exports by tonnage through the initiative in April and a 66% decrease in May. Russian ended the deal this week. Why did it start to go wrong? In essence, Russia felt the second part of deal allowing for greater Russian agricultural exports was not being honoured by the west. The UK says levels of Russian food exports are higher than last year and it is exporting plenty of grain and fertiliser out of Novorossiysk. But Moscow says sanctions on Russian goods exports have not been lifted clearly enough to give cautious insurers legal comfort to insure Russian ships carrying food. It also wanted sanctions lifted on its main agriculture bank. Other demands include the resumption of supplies of agricultural machinery and parts, the resumption of the Togliatti-Odesa ammonia pipeline and the unblocking of assets and the accounts of Russian companies involved in food and fertiliser exports. Who is to blame for the situation? The west claims Putin thought the deal was not worth preserving since it was allowing Ukrainian coffers and farmers to benefit from its grain exports. Genuine efforts were being made by the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, to meet Putin\u2019s demands. The west acknowledges grain exports to the least developing countries were not returning at the desired rate. In the case of wheat, there had been an export drop of 11.8m tonnes in 2022 on the previous year, equivalent to the annual wheat food consumption of 175 million people, roughly the population of Bangladesh. For corn and barley, the export gap is as large as 41% and 82%, respectively, of the previous year\u2019s level. Almost 8m tonnes of goods were shipped to China, nearly 25% of the 32.9m tonnes exported, while almost 44% of exports were shipped to high-income countries. What happens next? Russia\u2019s defence ministry has in effect said any ship leaving a Ukrainian port will be a legitimate military target. Turkey, a Nato member, could threaten to confront Russia by guiding the grain exports out of the ports without Russian permission but that is a high-risk step. Putin has hinted he is willing to go back into the deal if his demands are met. But the bombing of Odesa port suggests his hint at flexibility may be designed to stem a potential loss of political support in the global south. More likely, according to the analytics firm Smartcube, a drop in exports will lead to increased stockpiles in Ukraine and could force farmers to reduce sowing in the 2023-24 season. Russia might increase the export tax on wheat to finance its military campaign in Ukraine and, finally, shortages of fertilisers may intensify as Russia, together with Belarus, is one of the world\u2019s largest sources of mineral fertilisers. Both these countries account for approximately 14% of the world\u2019s fertiliser production and exports."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b22324", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jul/20/king-charles-to-take-smaller-cut-from-crown-estate-as-windfarm-profits-soar", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "King Charles to take smaller cut from crown estate as windfarm profits soar", "lead": "Sovereign grant to shrink from 25% to 12% of crown estate\u2019s profits, after monarch asked for money to be used for \u2018public good\u2019", "author": "Jillian Ambrose", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 11:56:29", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.229960", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/f9ed24856c74aba9134ee7619095e59bd4109852/0_375_6400_3841/500.jpg", "body": "King Charles has agreed to take a smaller share of the crown estate\u2019s profits ahead of a multibillion-pound windfall from Britain\u2019s offshore windfarms. The Treasury said it would halve the proportion of the crown estate\u2019s profits paid to the royal household through the sovereign grant, which will fall from 25% in recent years to 12% from next year. The monarch is still expected to take an \u00a386.3m cut from the crown estate, in line with this year\u2019s grant, because profits made by the crown estate from leasing the seabed to offshore wind developers are expected to soar in the coming years. The decision to shrink the sovereign grant was made by the royal trustees \u2013 the prime minister, Rishi Sunak; the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, and the keeper of the privy purse, Sir Michael Stevens \u2013 after King Charles asked for the profits from Britain\u2019s growing fleet of offshore windfarms to be used for the \u201cwider public good\u201d rather than as extra funding for the monarchy. The crown estate generated record profits of almost half a billion pounds from Britain\u2019s offshore windfarms in the last financial year, up by almost \u00a3130m from the year before, which reignited the debate over how much of the windfall should be shared with King Charles. Hunt said: \u201cFor almost 300 years, kings and queens have surrendered the profits from the crown estate to the British people, and in return the government has provided a fraction of that to properly support the king in undertaking his official duties. \u201cThe new sovereign grant rate reflects the unexpected significant increase in the crown estate\u2019s net profits from offshore wind developments, while providing enough funding for official business as well as essential property maintenance, including completing the 10-year reservicing of Buckingham Palace\u201d. For the past five years the profits made by the crown estate \u2013 which controls a vast property portfolio across England and Wales \u2013 have been paid to the Treasury, which then returned 25% to the royal household in the form of the sovereign grant. The sovereign grant was increased in 2017 from its previous level of 15% to help pay for extensive renovations at Buckingham Palace, which are likely to run until 2027. The crown estate has agreed to increase its new chief executive\u2019s pay by threefold in three years. The Guardian reported earlier this week that Dan Labbad was paid almost \u00a31.6m last year, up by two-thirds from the year before, when he took home a pay packet of \u00a3945,000. The remuneration is three times his equivalent full-year pay of \u00a3517,000 for 2019, when he stepped into the role, and almost \u00a31m more than his predecessor, Alison Nimmo, was paid in her final year at the helm. Molly Scott Cato, the finance and economy spokesperson for the England and Wales Green party, called the pay hike \u201ca disgrace\u201d. \u201cA wide-scale reform of the crown estate is long overdue to ensure that our national resources are managed with a focus on long-term sustainability and that such egregious remuneration at the public\u2019s expense is ended once and for all,\u201d she added."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b22325", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/20/nina-simones-20-greatest-songs-ranked", "primaryCategory": "music", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Nina Simone\u2019s 20 greatest songs \u2013 ranked!", "lead": "Ahead of an album of previously unreleased 1966 live recordings, we appraise the strident, sexual, socially conscious songcraft of a truly indomitable artist", "author": "Alexis Petridis", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 11:48:08", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.229978", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/4e94cc66eb57135995626e6411728d6bf8504ae5/600_1232_3067_1840/500.jpg", "body": "20. Pirate Jenny (1964) One thing Nina Simone had in abundance was attitude, which can be heard in her frankly astonishing version of Brecht and Weill\u2019s Pirate Jenny. It is a theatrical piece that she sings as if she means every word, her vocal dripping with venomous relish as it delivers its saga of murderous revenge: listening to it feels like being pinned to a wall. 19. My Baby Just Cares for Me (1958) You can see why Simone tired of the song that remained most closely associated with her: its breezy ease is the antithesis of her weightier, more political material. But listen to that piano solo: classical leanings and a feel for swing distilled into something that is entirely her own and incredibly stylish. 18. The Desperate Ones (1969) The self-explanatory title Nina Simone and Piano! was apparently Simone\u2019s favourite of her own albums. Certainly, its closing version of Jacques Brel\u2019s Les D\u00e9sesp\u00e9r\u00e9s is incredibly powerful: her raw, whispery vocal is close-mic\u2019d and intimate, turning a song about the death of youthful idealism into an eerie eulogy for the revolutionary zeal of the late 60s . 17. Fodder on Her Wings (1987) An impossibly moving cry of despair from Simone\u2019s exile in France, clearly rooted in personal experience, Fodder in Her Wings first turned up on a largely ignored 1982 album, but the killer version (with a tweaked name) \u2013 taut, wrenching and accompanied by piano rather than tinny synth \u2013 is on 1987\u2019s live Let It Be Me. 16. Mr Bojangles (1971) You could pick any cover from 1971\u2019s Here Comes the Sun for this list \u2013 the Five Stairsteps\u2019 O-o-h Child and Bob Dylan\u2019s Just Like a Woman among them \u2013 but the sweet sadness of Simone\u2019s take on country singer Jerry Jeff Walker\u2019s Mr Bojangles is particularly sublime: Sammy Davis Jr modelled his signature version on hers. 15. Funkier Than a Mosquito\u2019s Tweeter (1974) The breakbeat-hunting cratedigger\u2019s favourite Simone track, but there is far more to it than its writhingly danceable rhythm: Ike and Tina Turner\u2019s original was a dismissal of an old lech, but Simone turns it into a dismissal of the US itself, a country she had already departed by the time of the song\u2019s release. 14. Ain\u2019t Got No/I Got Life (1968) Of all Simone\u2019s musical reinventions, there is something particularly pleasing about Ain\u2019t Got No/I Got Life: two songs from Hair, a cash-in musical that served up the late-60s counterculture as supposedly edgy entertainment for Broadway and West End theatregoers, that were recast as a racial protest song: concise, punchy and defiant. 13. Don\u2019t Let Me Be Misunderstood (1964) Sometimes, Simone\u2019s interpretations transformed songs. Sometimes, they amplified them. Her terrifying cover of Strange Fruit is a case in point and so is Don\u2019t Let Me Be Misunderstood. No other version digs so deep into its themes of anger and regret, or sounds so racked with guilt: she audibly knew of what she spoke. 12. My Sweet Lord/Today Is a Killer (1972) Simone\u2019s live version of George Harrison\u2019s solo hit starts out straightforward enough, amping the song into joyous gospel, before turning it on its head, interpolating a poem by the Last Poets\u2019 David Nelson about feeling abandoned by God. Harrison\u2019s gently beseeching tone is transformed into a terrified howl into the void. 11. Backlash Blues (1967) By the time Langston Hughes presented Simone with the lyrics to Backlash Blues, the anger she had expressed in Mississippi Goddam was erupting across the US. There is a hint of I-told-you-so about her delivery, a confidence that offsets its ache \u2013 \u201cYou\u2019re the one who\u2019ll have the blues, not me\u201d \u2013 and only adds to its power. 10. Stars/Feelings (1976) The crushing centrepiece of the psychological white-knuckle ride that was Simone\u2019s 1976 performance at the Montreux jazz festival. She genuinely appears to be on the brink of a breakdown, investing both songs in the 17-minute medley with a fragile intensity so potent it\u2019s almost unbearable: disturbing, haunting, unforgettable listening. 9. Why? (The King of Love Is Dead) (1968) Recorded on stage three days after Martin Luther King\u2019s murder, performances come no more charged and raw than this. It slips between mourning, despair and militant rage, particularly in its 13-minute, unedited form, punctuated by Simone\u2019s lengthy, emotional, extemporised monologue: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford any more losses, they\u2019re shooting us down.\u201d 8. I Loves You, Porgy (1959) Simone was 25 when she released her debut album: what is startling is how assured she already sounded. Assured enough not just to take on I Loves You, Porgy \u2013 already, and seemingly definitively, recorded by Billie Holliday \u2013 but to stamp her own identity on the song, balancing tenderness, desperation and uncertainty. 7. Sinnerman (1965) Oft-sampled, but never improved upon, the adjective that best fits Sinnerman is fierce: the hellfire-and-brimstone take on religion, involving a God who tells her to get stuffed; the lyrics with its bleeding rivers and boiling seas; the focused insistence of Simone and her band\u2019s performance over the course of its 10 minutes. 6. Four Women (1966) A controversial assault on racial stereotypes and the imposition of white beauty standards, Four Women is a masterpiece of slow-burning rage, gradually amping up its intensity over a simple, repetitious piano figure: the moment when Simone\u2019s voice finally cracks into guttural fury as she hits the song\u2019s closing line is shattering. 5. I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel to Be Free (1967) Told to tone down the politicking by her label, Simone obliged with 1967\u2019s love song-heavy album Silk and Soul. Or rather, she almost obliged, slipping in something that starts out gentle and ends up incredibly funky, which you could just about mistake for a love song but clearly wasn\u2019t: a civil rights anthem was born. 4. Feeling Good (1965) Feeling Good became a TV talent show staple in the 00s, stripping it of its distinct civil rights undercurrent \u2013 a miserable fate for such a fantastic song \u2013 but umpteen lousy covers can\u2019t dim the ferocious impact of Simone\u2019s definitive reading: its slow build from a cappella to show-stopping finale is unforgettable. 3. To Be Young, Gifted and Black (1970) The documentary Summer of Soul shows Simone performing the incendiary Are You Ready? at the Harlem cultural festival. Debuted the same day, To Be Young, Gifted and Black was at the opposite end of the protest spectrum, an irresistible tough-but-optimistic expression of pride, subsequently turned into reggae gold by Bob and Marcia. 2. I Put a Spell on You (1965) Screamin\u2019 Jay Hawkins\u2019 original is fantastic, but wilfully OTT, befitting his shock-horror image. Simone\u2019s version \u2013 lushly orchestrated, with a sax solo that points up its bluesy origins \u2013 is anything but: she removes the cartoonish excesses, revealing a smouldering song about lust that is simultaneously sexy and slightly disconcerting in its forcefulness. 1. Mississippi Goddam (1964) Simone claimed she wrote Mississippi Goddam as an alternative to murdering someone in retaliation for the racist bombing of an Alabama church that killed four children. She wasn\u2019t joking: she started writing after failing to avail herself of a gun, the song \u201cerupting \u2026 faster than I could write [it] down\u201d. It erupted again the first time the world heard it, at Carnegie Hall: the recording is electric, the song churning urgently on, a flash of anger still blinding nearly 60 years on. Almost everything in this chart has a claim to be Simone\u2019s greatest song \u2013 she was that good \u2013 but Mississippi Goddam remains her most vital. \u2022 You\u2019ve Got to Learn, an album of six previously unreleased live recordings from the 1966 Newport jazz festival, is released 21 July on Verve/UMe"}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b22326", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/20/mexican-senator-xochitl-galvez-presidential-bid", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "X\u00f3chitl G\u00e1lvez\u2019s prickly presidential bid a thorn in side of Mexican leader", "lead": "But the buoyant politician with some decidedly progressive views has to win over voters from the conservative Pan party", "author": "Oscar Lopez in Mexico City", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 11:30:13", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.229998", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/51564f9b1c50ce26b642221b7d91f5813822ae73/0_206_6240_3744/500.jpg", "body": "Over breakfast at an upscale Mexico City restaurant, Senator X\u00f3chitl G\u00e1lvez struggled to get a word in amid the stream of interruptions as well-wishers came to shake her hand, pleading with her to run for higher office. Such shows of enthusiasm are rare these days for politicians in Mexico\u2019s seemingly soulless opposition. But since she announced a bid for the presidency last month, the excitement around G\u00e1lvez has risen to fever pitch: a poll published on Wednesday by El Financiero newspaper showed the senator within striking distance of the governing party\u2019s leading candidates. Suddenly, G\u00e1lvez has energized Mexico\u2019s 2024 presidential race, which for years had seemed all but certain. President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s landslide win in 2018 dealt a crushing blow to opposition parties: they lost election after election, while the president\u2019s popularity remained sky-high. Given Mexican law forbids re-election, the only question seemed to be which of the president\u2019s favorites would be vaulted to victory. Now, that path may be more difficult. \u201cShe\u2019s a woman with a lot of personal confidence, a lot of humor,\u201d said Blanca Heredia, a Mexican political analyst, of G\u00e1lvez. \u201cAnd for me something that is especially important is that she\u2019s not afraid of Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador.\u201d Although representing the conservative Pan party, G\u00e1lvez has pushed a more progressive agenda, promoting laws to expand domestic workers rights and championing clean energy. But she built up her brand through a series of political stunts, including dressing in an inflatable dinosaur costume to protest controversial electoral reforms. And when L\u00f3pez Obrador, or Amlo as he\u2019s known, falsely claimed G\u00e1lvez wanted to end his social programs, G\u00e1lvez obtained a judge\u2019s order securing her right of reply and showed up at one of the president\u2019s morning press briefings last month. The doors to the National Palace remained shut, but the ensuing media frenzy opened a path for the freshman senator\u2019s presidential ambitions. Within weeks, G\u00e1lvez, who many assumed would run for mayor of Mexico City, was coasting down the Paseo de la Reforma, the city\u2019s main boulevard, on her bike, traditional huipil blouse blowing in the wind, cameras clicking as she arrived to register for the opposition primary. \u201cAt the very least I knew that I was going to make this thing interesting because it\u2019s been really dull,\u201d G\u00e1lvez said in a recent interview. \u201cIt got a lot more interesting than I thought.\u201d Since then, G\u00e1lvez has inspired fawning opinion columns, graced front pages of major newspapers, gone viral on social media and drawn crowds at rallies across the country. But her greatest boost has come from Amlo himself, who has regularly attacked her in his daily news conferences. \u201cIt seems like Andr\u00e9s Manuel is her campaign director,\u201d said Heredia. \u201cThe president has the biggest audience imaginable in Mexico.\u201d Amlo\u2019s most recent attacks have focused on G\u00e1lvez\u2019s business, going so far as to tweet a document listing state and private contracts obtained by the firm, supposedly worth tens of millions of dollars. \u201cWhen the president messes with my business and makes public my clients\u2019 private information \u2013 that\u2019s a crime,\u201d said G\u00e1lvez. \u201cAs Shakira says, \u2018Women don\u2019t cry \u2013 we invoice.\u2019 I have a business on the straight and narrow that\u2019s been running for 31 years.\u201d Such cheeky quips are partly what have made G\u00e1lvez stand out from the rather uninspiring figures leading Mexico\u2019s political landscape. But her personal story has also been crucial. G\u00e1lvez was born in an impoverished community in Hidalgo state; her father was physically abusive and battled alcoholism. As a young girl, she worked with her mother selling puddings to make ends meet. She graduated with an engineering degree from Mexico\u2019s National Autonomous University, and went on to found a successful firm specializing in intelligent building design. In 2000, then president Vicente Fox chose her to head up the National Institute of Indigenous Peoples. She ran unsuccessfully for governor of Hidalgo in 2010, before winning the mayorship of the wealthy Miguel Hidalgo borough in Mexico City in 2015. She entered the Mexican senate in 2018. G\u00e1lvez\u2019s rags-to-riches story provides a sharp contrast to other opposition candidates, one of whom is the son of a former president. And despite being in politics for years, she hasn\u2019t been tainted by the graft scandals that have ensnared many in Mexico, making it harder for Amlo\u2019s punches against the \u201ccorrupt elite\u201d to find their mark. \u201cShe has a kind of armor through her own story,\u201d said Heredia. Still, Mexico\u2019s elections are nearly a year away, and there are relatively few polls showing that G\u00e1lvez has been embraced by Mexican voters, millions of whom are fiercely loyal to Amlo. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear that that media buzz, from the columnists and pundits and opinion writers, has a social base,\u201d said Carlos P\u00e9rez Ricart, a political scientist at the Center for Research and Teaching in Economics in Mexico City. \u201cShe reminds me more of a good song on Spotify that rises rapidly up the charts, but can fall just as quickly.\u201d To even claim the nomination, G\u00e1lvez will first have to win over voters from the Pan party, a conservative base largely opposed to the senator\u2019s progressive views on issues like abortion.

One of his jobs was to dispose of anthrax. \u201cIt seems bizarre now that a 17-year-old was allowed to do that\u201d Miriam, 29, London Occupation Researcher, PhD student Voting record Labour or Green Amuse bouche Miriam once won a six-month supply of Hobnobs. \u201cI was runner-up. If I\u2019d won I would have got a year\u2019s supply and \u00a31,000. Brutal\u201d For starters Mike I liked Miriam straight away. She came across as very intelligent. The age gap was only noticeable in so far as it was relevant to our discussion. Miriam We realised we are both musicians, which was a nice way to break the ice. I have been a professional singer, though I haven\u2019t picked it up since Covid. Mike We went vegetarian. I had curried cauliflower and a lime tart. Very nice. Miriam I had burrata, spring salad for a main and tarte tatin \u2013 all delicious. The big beef Mike My wife and I bought our first flats; when we met, we were able to live in one and rent the other out. We were both self-employed and didn\u2019t have occupational pensions. For people like us with precarious freelance jobs, it was the best thing for us to do. We kept our last three-bedroom house when we moved into the current one. The mortgage has gone up insanely. For the next two years, we might only be able to pay off the interest. Miriam I\u2019m a private renter. The purpose of housing is to house people. It\u2019s problematic that the way society is set up at the moment means it\u2019s actually one of the best investments, because it incentivises rich people to put their money into housing and then makes housing more expensive and harder to get for people who need it. You create a two-tier society. Mike There is injustice in the system. What we are doing is just what we need to do to provide a pension. What we\u2019re doing can be as ethical as you make it, because you\u2019re in control. It\u2019s up to you how much you charge and how good a landlord you are. Miriam I hadn\u2019t thought of it as a pension plan. I understand the lack of security \u2013 my parents are self-employed and I have been, too. But I\u2019m not sure someone of my age in Mike\u2019s position could ever get to the stage where they were able to have a second property. Sharing plate Mike If we were making policy together, I have a feeling we would be in agreement most of the time. We agreed there are terrible issues of inequality in the world. Miriam We agreed it\u2019s important to try to create fairer societies. We just had different ideas of how to get there. We also agreed on the power of music and that there is nothing better than performing a great gig. For afters Mike We got into the nature of capitalism. If you\u2019re a young person with a bright idea, you should be able to get someone to invest in you, and they should be able to make a return on it. Miriam I think Mike feels more comfortable with the idea that capitalism is Darwinian, and the people with the best ideas will get the funding and rise to the top. There are structural factors that inhibit that. On the one hand, there is intergenerational transmission of wealth; on the other, poverty and disadvantage. Levels of freedom depend on where and when you are born. What is a choice for one person doesn\u2019t exist for another. Mike I would say Miriam was a little more idealistic than me. Without wishing to sound patronising, I would love to check in with her in 25 years. Takeaways Mike There is nothing more stimulating than the company of intelligent people, especially when you disagree on things, because that gives you the chance to develop your worldview. It didn\u2019t change my mind about my property \u2013 but having said that, I respect how Miriam feels about it. Miriam Mike said he had hoped for someone conservative and religious, and I said: \u201cI\u2019m so sorry \u2013 I\u2019m neither.\u201d I think he was up for a fiery debate. I\u2019m not averse to confrontation, but think the most productive conversations are when you\u2019re negotiating your differences and recognising your commonalities.

It is always there, simmering away, even though 25 years have passed since the crippling Festina affair of 1998 and more than a decade since Lance Armstrong confessed his doping sins to Oprah Winfrey. Vingegaard, like so many before him, is having to recite the same mantra: trust me, I work hard, I sacrifice so much. Believe me, I am not taking anything. Entering Thursday\u2019s stage with a 7min 35sec lead over Tadej Pogacar and a 10:45 margin to third-placed Adam Yates, the Dane may well win this Tour by 10 minutes, which would be the biggest margin of victory since Jan Ullrich won by more than nine minutes in 1997. It doesn\u2019t help that the modern history of the Tour, from Lance to Landis, from Wiggins to Froome, is shrouded in a white noise of scepticism and suspicion that ebbs and flows according to the nature of performances. That is the unavoidable context, despite all the talk of a new generation. Yet some of the questioning of Vingegaard has been based not only on his results, but also on his taciturn nature and his undeniable Danishness. On Wednesday, after he pulverised Pogacar on the merciless slopes of the Col de la Loze, the questions came again. \u201cI can tell, from my heart, that I don\u2019t take anything,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t take anything that I wouldn\u2019t give to my daughter and I would definitely not give her any drugs.\u201d His Jumbo-Visma team manager, Grischa Niermann, defended his rider. \u201cI\u2019m not Jonas,\u201d the German former professional said, \u201cbut I think he\u2019s said a hundred thousand times that there is no performance-enhancing stuff, which is not allowed, and I\u2019m 100% putting my fingers in the fire for that.\u201d A degree of scepticism towards Vingegaard became open derision in some French media outlets after he flamed the opposition in Tuesday\u2019s time-trial stage from Passy to Combloux. \u201cFrom another planet,\u201d headlined L\u2019Equipe while Aujourd\u2019hui asked: \u201cHow did he do it?\u201d It was an extraordinary performance, magnified for some, by Pogacar\u2019s decline. A winning margin of 30 seconds would perhaps not have been so remarked upon, but inflicting a defeat of 1:38 in 22.4km on the Slovenian stretched credulity for some commentators. However, the ailing Pogacar was already slipping out of contention, as the following day\u2019s collapse on the brutal stage to Courchevel showed. Vingegaard had done enough earlier in the race, by containing his rival. Now, with Pogacar out of steam, he could press home his advantage. It is not just trust in the riders that is so fragile, but also trust in the sport\u2019s administration. Fraud in cycling has long been a characteristic. In the earliest years of the Tour, riders took lifts, skipped sections of the course and even caught trains. As well as the threat of doping, cycling\u2019s governing body, the UCI, now regularly scan the peloton\u2019s bikes for concealed motors. Machines are X-rayed every day, including the race leader, stage winner, other classification leaders and some selected at random. The use of motors, surely the darkest of the dark arts, has long been suspected. Femke van den Driessche was suspended for six years after being caught using one in the 2016 World Cyclo-cross Championships. No one have been caught using them in the Europe\u2019s Grand Tours. \u201cWe have a very solid and robust testing programme for both anti-doping and technological fraud and there is no reason to have doubts,\u201d the UCI president, David Lappartient, said in 2016. \u201cHowever, zero risk doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d Vingegaard\u2019s vagueness about his power outputs after Tuesday\u2019s time trial and the reluctance of his team to open up his power files have also raised questions of malpractice. Other teams also adopt the same policy for fear of leaking too much knowledge to their rivals. But it is also obvious that athlete development has continued, sports science has moved at high speed, equipment is hugely enhanced, insight and understanding of performance and nutrition is now fine-tuned to the rigours of the Tour. Scrutiny and vigilance of the sport has also ramped up, albeit not especially rapidly. All of that is just a smokescreen, argue the sceptics. Look at the range of performances, the history of the sport, the development of new doping practices. Some people have short memories, they say. Unfortunately for Vingegaard, many Tour watchers also have long ones."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b22329", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/jul/20/fun-flamboyant-fabulous-en-garde-is-the-ultimate-swashbuckling-fantasy", "primaryCategory": "games", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Fun, flamboyant, fabulous: En Garde! is the ultimate swashbuckling fantasy", "lead": "Fireplace Games\u2019 debut has comedic sword-fighting and an appealing anti-authoritarian vibe", "author": "Malindy Hetfeld", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 11:15:27", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.230054", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/eaffd175c831b0bedc2b239e777217354dadbe08/636_405_2569_1541/500.jpg", "body": "From Assassin\u2019s Creed to Rocksteady\u2019s Batman trilogy, from Absolver to For Honor, games never tire of coming up with interesting permutations of combat duels to fulfil the power fantasy of being a suave fighter. And then there\u2019s En Garde!, a game determined to let us know that you can\u2019t spell funeral without fun. You take on the role of Adalia de Volador, a renowned swashbuckler, ready to face a cruel Count-Duke and his minions in battle. In colourful environments that make Spain look like a giant theatre stage, Adalia confronts her enemies with a sharp sword and an equally sharp tongue. The heart of En Garde! is the carefully controlled chaos of its combat \u2013 you parry, attack and jump away from large groups of enemies, none of whom politely wait for their turn to stab you. Adalia can kick barrels, drop chandeliers, throw jugs left on tables and smack enemies with lutes. Foes come equipped with more than 3,000 individual voice lines, adding a chorus of \u201chaha!\u201d \u201choho!\u201d and \u201csurrender now!\u201d to the fighting as you run rings around them. It\u2019s silly fun that never leaves you in doubt that you\u2019re supposed to be the superior duellist, but developer Fireplace Games wanted to allow for different playstyles: the game has been compared to everything from Assassin\u2019s Creed to Dark Souls. \u201cWe didn\u2019t favour one approach over the other,\u201d says co-founder Ana\u00efs Simonnet. \u201cYou have the challenge of fencing and the cartoonish element in using the environment, and you can choose what to focus on.\u201d The slapstick-tinged combat attests to the fact that Adalia is a swashbuckler \u2013 not a pirate. If you were hitherto unaware of the difference, the game\u2019s artist and narrative designer, Julien Fenoglio, explains: \u201cSwashbuckling, de cape et d\u2019\u00e9p\u00e9e as we call it in French, has a distinct vibe \u2013 where pirates are kind of dirty or rough-and-tumble, swashbucklers merge action with artistic refinement. They are more urban, more elegant.\u201d \u201cWe also wanted to make a game about a part of culture you learn about as a French person,\u201d says Simonnet. \u201cI think it would have been really inappropriate to choose a foreign setting for us, create very archetypal characters and make jokes about them \u2026 It\u2019s very French to make fun of your own culture, and a lot of French humour is deeply satirical. We were really adamant about setting the game in Europe, about putting a spotlight on Musketeers, because you see those tropes everywhere, but not their origins.\u201d \u201cAt first we looked at things like The Three Musketeers, Zorro, Dumas, that kind of stuff,\u201d Fenoglio says. \u201cBut then when you look at these heroes from pop culture a little more closely, you find it returns pretty close to home \u2013 the studio is in Montpellier, which is home to a bunch of swashbuckling characters.\u201d En Garde!\u2019s proudly bisexual Spanish female protagonist isn\u2019t entirely like those traditional heroes, though Simonnet says this wasn\u2019t a deliberate attempt to buck a trend. \u201cIn the game your gender is not important,\u201d she says. \u201cWe talked a lot about how we didn\u2019t want enemies to be sexist when they mock you, just because when I\u2019m a player, I don\u2019t want to hear that sort of thing.\u201d En Garde! has what Fenoglio describes as an \u201coverall anti-authoritarian vibe\u201d \u2013 its fencing is fun, flamboyant and a touch fabulous. The most important thing for Fireplace Games is to let players enjoy the game in their own way. \u201cYou get what you give,\u201d Fenoglio says. \u201cA good swashbuckler makes a plan, but when those plans go awry, you improvise.\u201d En Garde! is out 16 August on PC"}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b2232a", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/20/lionesses-world-cup-women-football-england-team", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "subCategories": "test", "title": "The Lionesses could win the World Cup \u2013 but UK women\u2019s football will need huge support to stay on top | Carrie Dunn", "lead": "The England team have inspired a generation of girls to play.

At the 2023 Fifa Women\u2019s World Cup in Australia, they are high on confidence, knowing they go into the tournament as one of the favourites. And the Lionesses seized on their new high profile and swell of public affection, writing a striking open letter last year in which they declared: \u201cCurrently only 63% of girls can play football in PE lessons. The reality is we are inspiring young girls to play football, only for many to end up going to school and not being able to play.\u201d They asked the government to ensure that girls had access to at least two hours a week of physical education, and to ensure that female PE teachers were supported and invested in as well. The government agreed, revealing an \u201call-sports\u201d pledge on International Women\u2019s Day this year, telling schools to ensure that girls and boys had the same opportunity to play every sport, and announcing an increased investment in school sport and after-school activities. With the FA revamping its talent pathway to make sure that girls all over England can be talent-spotted and have access to top-class coaching, the future appears bright for elite players and their league teams. Arsenal and Chelsea have already announced a commitment to play more matches at their clubs\u2019 main stadiums next season, meaning that more huge attendances \u2013 like the Gunners\u2019 47,367 fans against Tottenham Hotspur, a Women\u2019s Super League record \u2013 can be anticipated. There\u2019s more cash on offer, up to a point. The FA and lead sponsor, Vitality, announced an increase to the Women\u2019s FA Cup prize fund \u2013 for the 2022-23 season, the overall pot was close to \u00a33m, with the winners getting \u00a3100,000. That was a notable increase from the previous season, where they got \u00a325,000, but still nowhere near as much as is on offer for the two finalists in the men\u2019s Emirates FA Cup, who split \u00a33m between them. In fact, the prize money in the men\u2019s competition has expanded, too \u2013 meaning that the gap between men and women has actually increased. The Lionesses announced on Tuesday that they were putting on hold their negotiations with the FA about bonuses and commercial structures; although they had hoped to come to an agreement prior to the start of the Women\u2019s World Cup, that has not happened. Even the European champions are still struggling to secure the money they believe they are worth. Last week saw the publication of a review of the domestic women\u2019s game led by former England international Karen Carney, calling for greater support for female players both physically and psychologically. It was one of the most pertinent observations in a wide-ranging white paper. Football is still coming to terms with the need to embed maternity provisions in contracts and to support female players who are also mothers; and prurient, exaggerated headlines about the \u201cepidemic\u201d of anterior cruciate ligament injuries in the women\u2019s game do not detract from the fact that women are indeed more prone to them, and that coaching, training, pitches, kit and equipment alike all need to be assessed and researched further in order to reduce the risk. But that applies all the way down the pyramid, where women\u2019s football is still having to fight to survive. That\u2019s not because there isn\u2019t the interest. Between October 2021 and October 2022, there was a 17% rise in numbers of female players across all levels of the game; then in the three months following the Euros win, there was a 196% increase in women\u2019s and girls\u2019 football session bookings through the England Football \u201cFind Football\u201d tool. These new female players, though, need clubs to play at, and coaches to train them. At non-professional level, that means volunteers need to come forward to make this happen. Carney\u2019s review also recommended that funders of grassroots facilities \u2013 government, councils and football\u2019s governing bodies \u2013 look at how their money is being spent to ensure that women and girls actually have access to pitches. Having nowhere to play is going to deter a keen potential Lioness, let alone someone who may not be the most naturally gifted, but wants to play for reasons of fitness, fun and friendship. Even established women\u2019s teams are shunted down the priority list. Colney Heath Ladies went viral in May when they arrived at their usual ground for a home fixture and found a bouncy castle in situ \u2013 the pitch was being used for a bank holiday celebration to commemorate the coronation. As Millie Bright leads the Lionesses out against Haiti in Brisbane on Saturday, all those who celebrated when football came home last summer will be hoping for a repeat performance. That triumph was not an endpoint, it was only ever a stepping stone; there is still much that needs to be done to ensure that women and girls can reach the top of the sport, but also that they can simply enjoy kicking a ball around with suitable boots and suitable kit on a suitable pitch \u2013 just as men and boys always have.

It was May 1993 and Ellis, now the head coach of the South Africa team preparing for their second World Cup, was picked as part of the first squad of players to represent their country in a women\u2019s football match. They were up against their neighbours Swaziland (now Eswatini) in a Sunday fixture in Johannesburg. Ellis travelled the 780 miles from her home in Cape Town by bus, a journey which took around 18 hours and was one of the stars of a dominant performance for the Banyana Banyana. She scored a hat-trick in a 14-0 win and celebrated briefly with her teammates before making the trip back in time for the work week. On the way, \u201cwe got a puncture, and it took us some time to get it fixed\u201d, she tells Moving the Goalposts. The delay meant Ellis arrived late to the butchery where she mixed spices for a living. \u201cWhen I got there, they told me I had absconded and I was fired. After that, I was out of work for three years.\u201d In that time, Banyana Banyana played eight more matches as Ellis reached the age of 33. Though her playing career would last another six years, and she would captain the team, football could never provide a sustainable income and her search for employment continued. Eventually, she was hired as a door-to-door salesperson and then as a picture editor for a publishing company that specialised in sports magazines, which allowed her to be more immersed in what she loved. But it was only when Ellis was named as an ambassador for the 2010 World Cup and opportunities in broadcasting opened for her, that football began to pay her back. Does she ever feel it took too long? \u201cNot at all. Our generation had to start somewhere.\u201d Ellis went on to serve as the national assistant coach under Vera Pauw between 2014 and 2016 and then took over from the Dutchwoman in an interim capacity before being named head coach in February 2018. Under Ellis, South Africa reached the Women\u2019s Africa Cup of Nations (Wafcon) final in 2018, qualified for the World Cup for the first time the year after, won Wafcon in 2022 and are back in this year\u2019s World Cup. While most teams have star players \u2013 and Racing Louisville\u2019s Thembi Kgatlana is one of South Africa\u2019s \u2013 Ellis is their talisman, especially after her achievements this year. She was awarded South Africa\u2019s the Order of Ikhamanga in gold \u2013 a presidential award which she compares to a knighthood \u2013 and is the subject of a mural in Salt River, the area of Cape Town where she spent her school days. He has also brought out an autobiography titled Magic. \u201cWe don\u2019t do things for awards and rewards,\u201d she says, but insists these ones were special. \u201cI wasn\u2019t present at the unveiling of the mural but when I saw it at first hand, it was very emotional,\u201d she admits. \u201cIt\u2019s just another way of saying to young girls that anything is possible, even if it doesn\u2019t happen immediately. Keep believing and keep hoping that that is going to happen, but make sure that when that does happen, that you are ready.\u201d Her biggest test will come in making sure South Africa are ready after a bumpy buildup, which included the boycott of a warm-up match and a dispute over pay. Four days before the squad was due to depart for the World Cup, they refused to play a friendly match against Botswana in protest over what they perceived to be weak opposition on a substandard pitch and concerns over the financial remuneration players would receive. While the numbers were being worked out, the South African Football Association instructed Ellis to pick a makeshift side, who went on to lose 5-0. Since then, South Africa\u2019s players have been promised not only the $30,000 (\u00a323,185) Fifa has made available to every participating player in the group stage but an additional $12,000 each, funded by the CAF president and billionaire businessman, Patrice Motsepe. There is still uncertainty over what the support staff will earn but the touring party are in New Zealand and beat Costa Rica 2-0 in Christchurch to conclude preparations. That victory, against a side ranked 18 places above them, bodes well for a South Africa side that have yet to win a game or secure a point at a World Cup and have plenty to prove. \u201cWhen you look at the men\u2019s World Cup recently, they\u2019ve shown you that the rankings don\u2019t really matter at the tournament,\u201d Ellis says. \u201cMorocco were not destined to come out of their group and to be honest, they almost won the World Cup. They had belief, they had a plan and they stuck to that plan. That\u2019s going to be key.\u201d But even with Ellis\u2019s praise for development programmes across the continent in countries such as Tanzania and fellow World Cup participants Morocco, their teams are often hamstrung by lack of regular competition against better opposition and for Ellis that has to change. \u201cThe gap is starting to close between Africa and the rest of the world but we need more competition,\u201d she says. \u201cGetting more quality opposition will really help. It\u2019s fairly easy for them in Europe to get on a bus and cross a border and play a higher-ranked team, and that\u2019s what we need to get more of.\u201d As long as the bus doesn\u2019t break down on the way back.

Another indictment for Donald Trump appears to be imminent after federal prosecutors sent a target letter to the former president, detailing three potential charges related to his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. Prosecutors appear to have evidence to charge Trump with conspiracy to violate civil rights, obstruction of an official proceeding and conspiracy to defraud the United States. The target letter was sent by prosecutors from the office of special counsel Jack Smith, who also charged Trump with retaining classified documents last month. Trump called the letter \u201cHORRIFYING NEWS\u201d in a post on his Truth Social platform. Then on Wednesday night, he hosted a screening of a movie promoted by QAnon followers. The potential charges come weeks before the Fulton county district attorney is expected to charge Trump and his allies over their efforts to overturn the 2020 election results in the state of Georgia.

O\u2019Kane sets out her stall here, trading in acidity and swagger as she jokes about her age-resisting regime and whether she might still lure younger men into bed. The frankness is winning, and carries us over into the meat of the show\u2019s first half, an account of how O\u2019Kane came to acknowledge her menopause (\u201cI\u2019m not just forgetting people \u2013 I\u2019ve gone off them\u201d) and seek help with her changing body. If it\u2019s not quite as wild as Bridget Christie\u2019s recent material on the same theme, the 55-year-old fashions enjoyable standup from her encounters with her well-heeled consultant and her adventures in HRT. OK, so the joke about not recognising her husband lands a bit awkwardly. More sure-footed are the jaundiced remarks about the inverse proportion between her own oestrogen (and collagen) and that of her teenage daughter. The gig swerves after that towards more nostalgic material about our host\u2019s 1980s upbringing. The reason for the change of tack isn\u2019t clear \u2013 even while something interesting is promised by a buildup referencing Ireland\u2019s then-tanking economy and her family\u2019s plunge into (relative) poverty. But that theme isn\u2019t developed, and the material we get instead (about her taciturn dad and her compatriots\u2019 aversion to sunglasses) is unremarkable. A later section about her mother today, \u201cdeaf in one ear and doesn\u2019t listen in the other\u201d, babbling semi-comprehensibly on the phone to Deirdre, is similarly likable but unexceptional. To trade profitably in the comedy of parental eccentricity, the eccentricity must be more distinctive than this. O\u2019Kane keeps it engaging, though, before pivoting to a tale of hair-raising goings-on on a recent visit to Gaza with Comic Relief. It\u2019s a balancing act, that one, given all the things we have to ignore to enjoy her story about the experiences of a visiting dignitary at border control. She pulls it off, just, in a show that finds the Irishwoman ageing but only occasionally dimmed.

Pembrokeshire county council said on Thursday: \u201cHundreds of seabirds have been washed up on beaches on the south Pembrokeshire coast recently. The birds are being regularly removed, although more are being washed up between the clear-ups. Most are guillemots, although razorbills and gannets have also been reported. \u201cTesting has taken place on a sample of the dead birds, and avian influenza (bird flu) has this week been confirmed.

Now, the provincial government has decided to part with the outfit in an online auction that has renewed a longstanding feud over the proper recipe for the beloved late-night snack. On 14 July, the province listed a \u201cdonair costume\u201d for sale on its surplus assets website, alongside unwanted computer printers, hospital beds and a confiscated radar detector. The post noted the outfit appeared to be in \u201cexcellent\u201d \u2013 if dusty \u2013 condition, with the caveat that the \u201coverall operational condition\u201d was unknown. Donairs are a particularly Canadian riff on the gyros or d\u00f6ner kebab, consisting of thinly sliced spiced beef on pita, topped with tomatoes and onions. Developed in Halifax, Nova Scotia, in the 1970s by Greek immigrants, the Canadian variation comes drenched in a sweet sauce made from condensed milk. In 2015, the dish was named the official food of Halifax, shortly after a city councillor dismissed the gyros and d\u00f6ner kebab as \u201cbland and tasteless\u201d. None of which explains why a provincial government on the other side of the country owns a donair costume or why it has put it up for sale. The listing was first spotted by reporter Catherine Griwkowsky, who covers the province\u2019s politics for AB Today. Less than a day after she tweeted about the costume, the bids had surged to C$1,000, far above the initial listing price of C$50. By July 20, bidding had reached more than C$6,000 as donair shops raced to outbid rivals and claim the costume for themselves. Some have called for the costume to be sent to Nova Scotia, widely seen as the home of the dish. But the costume\u2019s detailing, which shows lettuce tucked in among the tomatoes and meat and onion, has also renewed a fierce debate over the correct recipe. In an interview with the CBC in 2015, the owner of a chain of donair shops in Halifax described the addition of lettuce as \u201csacrilegious\u201d. But in Alberta \u2013 the highest per capita consumer of donairs in Canada (and probably the world) \u2013 the leafy vegetable has become an essential part of the recipe. According to the auction site, the costume measures 56in in length and comes with a silver body suit for an \u201cauthentic tinfoil look\u201d \u2013 a nod to purists who maintain that a donair must be wrapped in foil when served. Internet sleuths tracked the costume to Christine Papalexis, a Los Angeles-based costume and puppet designer. Papalexis did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Twitter users also suggested the costume could have been commissioned for a 2015 distracted driving commercial called Don\u2019t Drive and Donair but was never used. Others speculated the costume was intended for an unaired edition of a commercial for antacid tablets. \u201cThis costume was a prop for an advertising campaign and is no longer required by the department,\u201d the province wrote in response to a question on the auction site about the origins of the donair suit. Because of the outfit\u2019s unique nature, the province says it has extended the auction until 14 August."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b22331", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jul/20/make-your-price-labels-clearer-watchdog-tells-uk-supermarkets", "primaryCategory": "business", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Make your price labels clearer, watchdog tells UK supermarkets", "lead": "CMA says stores not stoking food inflation as it looks into competition on key categories such as milk and baby food", "author": "Sarah Butler", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 10:28:21", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.230199", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/2e01b9b6578a8bf42c16c924dc1da72a23d2455f/0_12_3257_1954/500.jpg", "body": "Supermarkets must make prices clearer, the UK\u2019s competition watchdog has said after finding that confusing labels were preventing shoppers from getting the best deals. Food retailers and their suppliers will be subject to a detailed investigation into competition in 10 product categories including milk, bread, and baby formula as part of efforts to ensure households benefit from competitive prices as cost inflation falls. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has written to retailers asking them to address its concerns about unclear price labels and said it would consider enforcement action if they did not change their behaviour. The watchdog said it did not find that weak competition had driven the historically high food price inflation that has emerged in the past 18 months. Average operating profits in the retail grocery sector fell by more than 40% in 2022-23 compared with the previous year, while average operating margins declined from 3.2% to 1.8%, the CMA said. The findings pour cold water on fears that \u201cgreedflation\u201d from supermarkets was pumping up prices. Its report said not everyone was benefiting from strong competition, particularly those who could not travel to large stores or shop online and may rely on higher-priced convenience stores instead. It said unclear labelling was making it harder for shoppers to find the best deals. Sarah Cardell, the CMA chief executive, said: \u201cWith so many people struggling to feed their families, it\u2019s vital that we do everything we can to make sure people find the best prices easily. We\u2019ve found that not all retailers are displaying prices as clearly as they should, which could be hampering people\u2019s ability to compare product prices. \u201cWe\u2019re writing to these retailers and warning them to make the necessary changes or risk facing enforcement action. The law itself needs to be tightened here, so we are also calling on the government to bring in reforms.\u201d She added: \u201cWe\u2019ve also looked at how competition is working across the grocery retail market more widely. The overall evidence suggests a better picture than in the fuel market, with stronger price competition between all of the supermarkets and discounters. \u201cIn the next phase of our work, we will examine competition and prices across the supply chain for the product categories we\u2019ve identified. We\u2019ll also continue to monitor the situation to ensure that competition remains effective as input costs start to fall.\u201d The watchdog said it was recommending changes to the law to ensure retailers make price labels more clear after identifying a number of confusing practices. It said it had found inconsistent pricing \u2013 with different measurements used for similar types of products, such as teabags being priced per 100g for some products and others priced per teabag within the same store \u2013 making it hard to compare. The CMA said unit prices were in some cases illegible, obscuredor missing \u2013 such as for online shoppers or on specific promotions. It recommends that unit pricing regulations are altered to ensure that all products on promotion, including multi-buys and special prices for loyalty scheme members, should show a unit price comparable with the standard price. Other recommendations include ensuring only one unit measurement can be used per product type across all retailers and across all sales channels, to enable shoppers to make meaningful comparisons; and ensuring prices are legible, not obscured and close to the products they relate to. Retailers have been asked to ensure that own-label products use the same method of unit pricing, for example per 100ml or 100g, as similar branded items. In June, the consumer group Which? reported Tesco to the watchdog over its failure to provide detailed pricing information on its loyalty Clubcard offers. A spokesperson for Britain\u2019s biggest supermarket chain said it had already confirmed plans to introduce unit pricing on \u201csimple promotions\u201d by early next year. Tesco said: \u201cWe are supportive of the CMA\u2019s recommendation to clarify the guidance on unit pricing to provide customers with more transparency.\u201d Helen Dickinson, the chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said fierce competition between British supermarkets was a key reason why the UK continued to \u201cdeliver among the cheapest groceries in Europe\u201d. She said: \u201cAs noted in the report, supermarket margins have remained extremely tight as they try to support their customers and absorb the worst of the rising costs in the supply chain. In the last few months, some of these pressures have begun to ease, such as with global commodity prices and the weakness of the pound, and we are now seeing competition driving down the price of key staples,.\u201d On Wednesday, Asda received a dressing down from MPs after its co-owner Mohsin Issa declined to answer multiple questions on whether profit margins on fuel had been increased since the supermarket chain was bought by a consortium including him and his brother Zuber in 2021.

Ellwood had sought to draw a line under the row, saying he was \u201csorry for my poor communication\u201d after his actions outraged those in his own party and military veterans. In a tweet and accompanying video, Ellwood described Afghanistan as a \u201ccountry transformed\u201d and talked up the group that seized power in August 2021, claiming \u201csecurity has vastly improved, corruption is down and the opium trade has all but disappeared\u201d. Days later, four members of the defence select committee tabled a no-confidence motion in an effort to remove him from the important position. The minutes of a meeting held on Wednesday showed that two Tories \u2013 Mark Francois and Richard Drax \u2013 and two Labour MPs \u2013 Derek Twigg and Kevan Jones \u2013 supported the motion. A vote will not take place imminently, however, as the Commons is breaking up for the summer recess on Thursday afternoon. After the backlash, Ellwood said: \u201cThe last couple of days have probably been the most miserable as a member of parliament,\u201d adding: \u201cI got it wrong.\u201d He called the row a Twitter \u201cstorm\u201d and said he stood by criticisms in the video about Britain\u2019s lack of engagement with Afghanistan\u2019s new leadership since the chaotic exit of western countries\u2019 armed forces from Kabul nearly two years ago. But Ellwood used a TV interview to repeatedly apologise, and said the video \u201ccould have been much better done\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s important to put your hand up and acknowledge errors, however well intentioned,\u201d the Bournemouth East MP and former army captain told TalkTV. \u201cI stand up, I speak my mind. I try and find solutions especially on the international stage, and I\u2019m very, very sorry that my reflection of my visit could have been much better worded and have been taken out of context.\u201d While on a trip to India with the defence select committee, Ellwood deleted the video and issued a statement saying his reflections about Afghanistan under Taliban rule \u201ccould have been better worded\u201d and he was sorry for \u201cpoor communication\u201d. Ellwood said the video, which critics said had a \u201cwish you were here\u201d feel and was set over uplifting music, was meant to focus on his push for Britain to reopen its embassy in Afghanistan. After his visit there with the Halo trust, which helps clear landmines from former war zones, Ellwood said he had been repeatedly drawn to Afghanistan since losing his brother in the 2002 Bali terrorist bombing. \u201cDuring my visit last week, I witnessed something I did not expect to see \u2013 an eerie calm and a visible change in security, corruption and opium growth which I felt obliged to report,\u201d he said in the statement. \u201cBut I also saw a very vulnerable economy that will soon collapse without international intervention, turning this country into a failed state, with terrorist camps no doubt returning and triggering mass migration.\u201d Having been criticised for glossing over the erosion of women\u2019s and girls\u2019 rights under the Taliban, Ellwood said in the statement he had witnessed the \u201cincreasing restrictions\u201d they faced. \u201cThis suggests our current strategy, of shouting from afar, after abruptly abandoning the country in 2021, is not working. My simple call to action was to see our embassy reopen again and pursue a more direct strategy to help the 40 million people that we abandoned.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b22334", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jul/20/lobbying-rules-to-be-tightened-in-long-awaited-response-to-greensill-scandal", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Lobbying rules to be tightened in long-awaited response to Greensill scandal", "lead": "Exclusive: Departments to be forced to release more information about meetings with lobbyists, say sources", "author": "Aubrey Allegretti Chief political corespondent", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 10:14:57", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.230254", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/844c90c2f03159a4f5f8db76e55558d28b094058/0_172_3500_2100/500.jpg", "body": "Lobbying rules will be toughened up across Whitehall in a long-awaited response by ministers to issues raised by the Greensill scandal, the Guardian has learned. Government departments will be forced to release more information about meetings with lobbyists and extend current requirements for disclosure to phone and video calls, sources say. Private emails, as well as WhatsApps and texts on personal phones that are used to discuss government business, will also now need to be declared, and senior civil servants will have to comply with the new rules. The changes come nearly two years after a major report was published following the Greensill lobbying scandal, involving a multinational supply chain finance firm, the former prime minister David Cameron, serving ministers and top officials. Nineteen reforms were proposed by Nigel Boardman, a corporate lawyer who was commissioned by the government to conduct an independent investigation and published his findings in August 2021. In its response, the government will commit to improving the quality of departments\u2019 transparency disclosures, which cover meetings, gifts and hospitality, and are meant to guard against any perception of improper or secretive lobbying. Declarations will be aimed to be published monthly instead of quarterly under the plans to be announced later this week. Instead of departments publishing their own declarations separately, an integrated database hosted on a single platform will be developed by the Cabinet Office. Stricter minimum standards will also be enforced about the level of detail regarding meetings that need to be declared. Phone calls and virtual meetings will have to be disclosed, as well as any exchanges via personal email, text or over WhatsApp concerning government business. Top civil servants, including commercial and finance directors, will need to comply with the new rules as well. Moves will also be made to avoid departments giving minimal detail about meetings with consultant lobbyists. The government will aim to tweak secondary legislation forcing those on the register of consultant lobbyists to provide more information about who they are operating on behalf of, meaning they will have to declare the ultimate beneficiary and subject matter of their lobbying approaches. The moves go some way towards meeting the recommendations made by Boardman, after a series of reports he produced about the scandal and associated issues to do with lobbying. In his August 2021 report, Boardman criticised the \u201cself-regulatory\u201d approach of Whitehall and the \u201cpatchwork\u201d approach to ethics regulation. It followed an outcry over the government\u2019s then chief commercial officer, Bill Crothers, having been given approval to work as an adviser to Greensill Capital in 2015 while still employed in the civil service. Questions were also raised over why Lex Greensill, the Australian financier behind the firm, was brought into the heart of government. He had a No 10 business card calling him a \u201csenior adviser\u201d and was nominated for a CBE by the then cabinet secretary. After leaving No 10, Cameron became an adviser to Greensill Capital. He approached ministers and officials with texts at the outset of the Covid pandemic to urge the government to support the bank, it was later revealed. When the scandal emerged, Cameron released a statement saying he had done nothing wrong, but accepting his communications with ministers should have been \u201cdone through only the most formal of channels, so there can be no room for misinterpretation\u201d. Greensill Capital, which operated by lending money to firms by buying their invoices at a discount, collapsed in March 2021. Greensill said in an appearance before the Treasury select committee in May that year that his business had made mistakes but defended the business model of supply chain finance. He said he took \u201ccomplete responsibility\u201d for the company\u2019s collapse. Crothers told another parliamentary select committee in June: \u201cMy intention was to completely follow the rules, in spirit and in form. I was transparent in all that I did and no conflict happened.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b22335", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jul/20/royal-court-theatre-appoints-new-dioramas-david-byrne-as-artistic-director", "primaryCategory": "stage", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Royal Court theatre appoints New Diorama\u2019s David Byrne as artistic director", "lead": "Byrne, who is also an award-winning playwright, said he would \u2018shape a rejuvenating culture\u2019 at one of London\u2019s most prestigious theatres", "author": "Harriet Sherwood Arts and culture correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 10:00:54", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.230275", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/e924aa4a2391901a73680a5e88b2511a417c3844/0_634_9504_5702/500.jpg", "body": "David Byrne, an award-winning playwright and director who has built a powerful reputation at a small studio theatre in London, is to be the new artistic director of the Royal Court. Byrne promised to continue his risk-taking approach and \u201cshape a rejuvenating culture\u201d at the Royal Court, one of London\u2019s most prestigious and influential theatres. He succeeds Vicky Featherstone, who is stepping down early next year after more than 10 years at the theatre\u2019s helm. She said being artistic director of the Royal Court was \u201cone of the best jobs in the world\u201d. Byrne is currently artistic director and chief executive of New Diorama, considered to be one of the capital\u2019s most vibrant and innovative theatres. As well as supporting new creative work, it has provided free rehearsal space for thousands of actors, writers and directors. A number of its productions, including Operation Mincemeat and For Black Boys Who Have Considered Suicide When the Hue Gets Too Heavy, have transferred to the West End. Byrne said that George Devine, the founder of the Royal Court, imagined the theatre to be where \u201cthe experimentalists of the modern era could be seen\u201d, often \u201cin advance of public taste\u201d. He continued: \u201cFor over a decade at New Diorama, I\u2019ve embraced those ideals, seeking out and supporting the boldest and most exhilarating artists so that, together, we could rewrite the theatre rule book. \u201cIn this new role, I\u2019m excited to continue working in service of the playwrights and artists raring to take big swings. Together, we\u2019ll shape a rejuvenating culture from which the experimentalists of this new era are safe to take risks, can gamble like they\u2019re never going to lose, and where audiences can glimpse the future of theatre, today. \u201cBecoming the artistic director of the Royal Court is an honour, a privilege, and is going to be the adventure of a lifetime. I can\u2019t wait to get started.\u201d Byrne is an advocate for accessible theatre. Ticket prices at New Diorama are around \u00a320, and it offers \u00a33 tickets for previews to people who are unemployed or are striking. The theatre offers \u201cbabes in arms\u201d matinees and shows especially for isolated people in the community. Anthony Burton, chair of the Royal Court, said: \u201cAs the founding artistic director of New Diorama, [Byrne] has led it with huge success, nurturing and developing new writers and producing award winning work on international and national stages. He has a reputation for artistic excellence, creative disruption and innovation in artist support.\u201d According to its website, the Royal Court receives less than half of its annual income from Arts Council England.

Like many, I knew her story, having followed her on social media since my own sister passed away from breast cancer. Online, she comes across as both candid and joyful, sharing adventures, advice and pictures of her bright handmade dresses. I had assumed her memoir would be the straightforward tale of a doctor turned patient. However, the experiences of illness, both depression and cancer, actually come in the final act of this revealing and ultimately hopeful book. The first two acts comprise a frank account of her long apprenticeship in medicine and surgery. She sets out in meticulous detail the complexities and demands of this process, which involves a new rotation every four months, in a different specialty where you effectively begin from zero, sometimes in a different hospital or a different town. O\u2019Riordan also documents casual sexism from male colleagues, the responsibility and risk of the on-call shifts, and how she had to spend the first year of her marriage living away from her husband in order to pursue the specialism she wanted. The bookends of her clinical journey are significant: that first appendicectomy, which left her buzzing, marred by the creepy surgical registrar whispering \u201cBut are you a real surgeon? Did you get an erection?\u201d. And the last surgery, where she is the consultant, digging out a difficult breast cancer the day before her own results are due, snapping at her locum, fearful that she hasn\u2019t done a decent job. In between, there are moments of doubt and dusted-off exit plans, thoughts about what she would do if she left surgery, or left medicine altogether. Instead, she perseveres. And then comes the deterioration in her already fragile mental health, and a diagnosis of cancer. She tells us what happened, how she felt, what she did. She is open about her fears, and her late-night tears. She praises her competent colleagues and her supportive husband. She finally acknowledges \u2013 after having to retire due to post-operative pain and lack of movement in her arm \u2013 that it is OK for her to be \u201cjust Liz\u201d, as opposed to being defined by her title, her status as surgeon. I wasn\u2019t quite convinced by the resolution of this trauma, in these neat and short chapters. One can\u2019t help wondering if there is more to say, but perhaps this requires greater distance from the events. And perhaps she is already sharing it in different places, in her podcast, blogs, and talks. What stays with me is O\u2019Riordan\u2019s compelling description of training, which doctors will recognise as a sort of Hunger Games with the post of consultant as a prize, though with no guarantee that you will be left happy or healthy enough to enjoy the role. At a time when so many of my junior doctor colleagues are talking about leaving the profession, and the vast majority are striking, this book feels sharply relevant. The author succeeds not only in telling us how she learned to love her life after cancer, but how a life after medicine can offer fulfilment too. \u2022 Everything Is True, A Junior Doctor\u2019s Story of Life, Death and Grief by Dr Roopa Farooki is published by Bloomsbury.

Despite road rage incidents occurring due to a multitude of reasons, the rise in longer and hotter heatwaves this summer appears to be a major factor resulting in a spike in aggressive behaviors on the road. In Texas, which is facing record-breaking heatwaves and triple-digit temperatures, a 37-year-old woman was shot in the head and killed last Monday in the city of Hurst, in what her husband said was the result of a road rage incident. Speaking to CBS, Paola Nunez Linares\u2019s husband, Zane Jones, said that they were on their way to work that evening when the fatal incident happened. Jones, who was trying to pass a car, said: \u201cI completed the pass. I got into the right lane, and he started to zoom past me \u2026 But then he leveled off when he got to me, and he like moved over, like pushing me but not touching me because I moved over too.\u201d He said that he then showed his middle finger and thought that the other driver was responding similarly, until he realized that the driver had actually pulled out a gun. \u201cHe slowed down until we were about like that, and he shot through my back left window and hit my wife in the back of the head,\u201d Jones said, who added that he believed the driver fired at least three times. In another fatal road rage incident in New York, what started as a minor collision between two vehicles led to the first driver slashing the other driver\u2019s tires before being mowed down \u2013 and killed \u2013 by the second driver. The collision between a sedan and a pickup truck in midtown Manhattan last week led to an argument between the two drivers, both of whom were male. NBC New York reports that the altercation quickly escalated as the pickup truck\u2019s driver, 54-year-old Roberto Velez Alvarez, took a knife and slashed the tires of the sedan, according to police. In response, the sedan\u2019s driver, 28-year-old Andre Mosby, allegedly stepped on the accelerator and pinned Alvarez against a building wall. Alvarez was taken to the hospital and later died of his injuries. In recent decades, various studies have emerged that indicate a clear correlation between aggressive road behavior and hotter temperatures. A 1984 study conducted during the spring and summer in Phoenix, Arizona, found a direct linear increase in aggressive horn honking with increasing temperatures, particularly among drivers who had their windows down \u2013 an indication that they did not have a working air conditioner. \u201cOur research \u2026 involved having a car stop at a light at an intersection with a median that disallowed anyone to go around the driver \u2013 who sat still through a green light. We found that people only honked in short bursts (the polite reminder honk) when the temperatures were below 80 [degrees fahrenheit], but when they got above 90 [degrees fahrenheit], drivers whose path was blocked increasingly leaned on their horn for longer and longer blasts, and occasionally made hand signals of the sort they don\u2019t teach you in driver\u2019s education,\u201d Douglas Kenrick, a psychology professor at Arizona State University and co-author of the study, said. Another study published by researchers in 2018 echoed similar discoveries. The study examined fatal traffic crashes in the US from May to September of 2001 to 2011 and found a 3.4% increase on heatwave days versus non-heatwave days. Speaking to the Guardian, Leigh Richardson, director of the Brain Performance Center in Texas, explained the various physiological impacts that hot temperature can have on drivers. \u201cResearch shows a link between aggression and extreme heat and it can manifest in your daily life, affecting the way you drive, making judgment errors. Intense heat puts stress on our organs. The heart can start to beat faster, the brain gets thrown into the fight-flight-freeze cycle threatening our psychological safety,\u201d said Richardson. \u201cWhen we feel threatened we can become more impulsive and reactive. Getting into a car that registers 108 degrees [fahrenheit] at the end of a long day, thinking of what errands must be completed on the way home, is overwhelming and the heat fatigues us. When someone cuts us off on the road, or won\u2019t let us change lanes, our brain can quickly switch into the fight cycle, causing us to react in an agitated manner,\u201d she added. Stephen Benning, a psychology professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, said hot temperatures likely magnify perceived threats among drivers, in turn triggering their physiological responses including their breathing speeds. \u201c[Drivers can] possibly breathe faster if they perceive their chest tightening up in some kind of way as their body just kind of shrinks in trying to not be as exposed to the heat. Sweating is definitely a big one and the possibility of heart rate increases as you try to circulate the blood faster to help yourself cool off through increased blood flow,\u201d Benning said. With temperatures across the country continuing to rise, experts have offered various ways to prevent road rage. One tactic is to redirect one\u2019s thoughts and reappraise the magnitude of the threat. \u201cRecognizing that that threat has likely already passed if it\u2019s someone driving really aggressively \u2026 and saying to yourself \u2018It\u2019s already passed, the threat is gone, I\u2019m letting them go ahead\u2019 [helps]. Reappraisal of what seems to be a threatening situation into a nonthreatening situation can then help your breathing become more regular and your thinking to become clearer rather than getting caught up in how much you want to hurt the other person or get even with them,\u201d Benning said. To Richardson, staying hydrated is key. \u201cThe brain weighs 3lbs and is approximately 80% water, and cannot store water. Keeping your brain hydrated throughout the day can protect your psychological safety,\u201d she said. Other tactics include using sun shades for windshields and being aware that other drivers may likely be in a worse mood on a hot day, said Kenrick. \u201cCount to 10 before raising one of those hand signals to someone who honks at you. I personally try to think of aggressive drivers the way I think about guard dogs: when they bark I don\u2019t take it personally \u2013 just think, \u2018Down boy,\u2019\u201d he said."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b22338", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jul/20/the-guardian-thursday-quiz-general-knowledge-topical-news-trivia-117", "primaryCategory": "lifeandstyle", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Wrong names, cancelled Games, and Taylor Swift\u2019s mispressed album \u2013 take the Thursday quiz", "lead": "Fifteen questions on general knowledge and topical trivia, plus a few jokes, every Thursday.

I am also here because these days I find happiness, like a growing number of Americans do, in something I like to call \u201ccollective joy\u201d. And it might be our best answer to the diktat of the corporate happiness industry. Happiness as a pill to swallow For much of my life, happiness was neatly sold as a product I could purchase, like a pill I was supposed to swallow. Happiness could be bought as literal medicine \u2013 Wellbutrin, Zoloft \u2013 or found in the self-help books and retreats. This idea of happiness was something one should achieve on one\u2019s own, by mastering one\u2019s own pessimism. And it had a serious business angle: a happy worker was supposed to be more productive. That notion of happiness took something from positive psychology, the movement that took hold in the 1990s. Martin Seligman was a supporter of this school of thought, saying in the American Psychologist journal in 2000 that he was seeking to \u201cchange the focus of psychology from a preoccupation only with repairing the worst things in life to also building positive qualities\u201d. Or as he said at the first Positive Psychology Summit in Lincoln, Nebraska, in 1999: \u201cPsychology was half-baked.\u201d What was \u201cunbaked\u201d, he continued, was \u201cthe side of strength, the side of what we\u2019re good at\u201d. It made sense that such focus on power and skill would appeal to American corporations more than the visceral slog of what caused unhappiness in the first place. Soon, companies like Google began employing someone called a \u201cjolly good fellow\u201d. The first of these was Chade-Meng Tan, also known as Meng, a software engineer with an added mission: he was to cheer co-workers while also greeting celebrities at the Google campus. Meng was not alone; he was part of a larger Silicon Valley tech ideology that focused on getting workers to work until the wee hours, using corporate happy talk to convince them to do so. It was also peddled by the likes of Tony Robbins, Dan Harris and Rick Hanson. (The latter\u2019s tech-accented book Hardwiring Happiness offers a \u201crecipe\u201d for how to weigh positive experiences more heavily in one\u2019s life.) The happiness industry was soon in full bloom: the so-called Happiness Business School, which offers a certificate program that produces chief happiness officers with international trainings that include a lesson in the \u201cROI of Happy Workplace\u201d, established itself; a Buddhist monk discussed happiness at Davos; happiness-themed Ted talks multiplied; mugs with sayings like \u201cPositivity Is a Choice\u201d or \u201cMake Happiness Your Business Model\u201d proliferated. This theory morphed depending on what platforms were popular. We were promised glee and resulting efficiency on social media, but if only we\u2019d buy \u201cmindful\u201d mayonnaise and nail polish, \u201chappy\u201d aromatherapy products or \u201cmood-supporting\u201d vitamins. We are also, not coincidentally, sold those things on platforms like Instagram, where illusions of personal happiness enshrined in sunshine-laden individual accounts abound. One recent embodiment of this corporate philosophy is the AmaZen, a closet-sized meditation chamber offered by Amazon in May 2021 to supposedly soothe its workers. Inside the booth, employees could use a computer to view mindful practices, which included screen-guided meditation videos and positive affirmations. (That the booths resembled toilet stalls in size and shape was ironic, because workers at the company had said they had to fight for bathroom breaks.) These \u201cpractice rooms\u201d stood within warehouses, and employees were told to lock themselves into the \u201cindividual interactive kiosks\u201d during exhausting work shifts, all during a union-busting era when they were being discouraged to organize. I spoke to Will Davies, author of the 2015 book The Happiness Industry. He sees the happiness industrial complex as one in which \u201cnegative thoughts and low moods were simply caused by bad habits\u201d. This view, he argues, relies on an \u201cimpoverished view of what a human being and what boredom is\u201d. As Davies says, this is \u201ca post-human understanding of the workforce\u201d, where workers are assets to be rented for the day and have to be happy to boot. (The television show Severance, in which workers are given a brain surgery so they forget their non-work lives when they are in the office, might not be just sci-fi after all.) Seeking transcendence The pandemic changed this paradigm. It\u2019s not that the happiness industry is over, exactly \u2013 it\u2019s just that Covid and its aftermath of so-called \u201cquiet quitting\u201d showed us a way out of the buying-happiness-so-you-are-more-productive game. Today, we can see the other option: collective joy. What is collective joy? It\u2019s a kind of happiness experienced in groups. It\u2019s found in meaningful occasions, like marches and celebrations of identity, but also in communal events that might otherwise seem trivial. For me, this might also include a reproductive rights event where people are dressed as uteruses but also things that are more hedonistic, like a large dance party that features at least two acrobats, a Reiki practitioner and a tarot reader. According to a 2022 Pew study, 21% of those surveyed had a renewed appreciation for social activities following lockdown, with many of them noting that large gatherings in particular were more cherished than ever. I am not the first to name the potency of celebration and mass public expression. My late friend and colleague Barbara Ehrenreich wrote about this in her book Dancing in the Streets, describing the power of spectacle and carnivals, in culture, politics and sports, including Pride, rock festivals and football matches. Such events, she wrote, offer individuals a communal glee that can ultimately transform for them into meaning and power. Take movements and phrases like \u201cBlack joy\u201d, which has nearly half a million posts under it on Instagram. The idiom refers to what Kleaver Cruz, founder of the Black Joy Project, says is an account of Black life that doesn\u2019t simply create an \u201calternate\u201d Black narrative that ignores the realities of collective pain, but, as Cleaver says, holds it \u201cin tension with the joy we experience\u201d. Thinkers like adrienne maree brown, in her book on the joy possible within Black liberation, Pleasure Activism, has written about extending the intimacy of romantic relationships to more public networks, encouraging people to \u201ccultivate collective agency\u201d as well as to \u201cdance when you make decisions\u201d. As I reported in my book Bootstrapped, collective resilience also includes new directions in the labor movement. It also consists of a growing number of mutual aid groups offering reciprocal altruism on a community level, participatory budgeting collectives, or even groups like peer therapy communities where informally trained people relieve the unmet need for licensed therapists around the country, including on college campuses. (In 2021, researchers with the Mary Christie Institute and Lady Gaga\u2019s Born This Way Foundation surveyed more than 2,000 college students and found one in five had received peer counseling.) In addition to these earnest collective encounters, there are more hedonistic gleeful communities. The most striking thing about \u201cdance culture\u201d post-pandemic, says the DJ Tasha Blank, who founded the large dance and party project formerly known as the Get Down and now called Body Lvnguage, is that \u201cnew people are coming to it, people who may not have been interested or willing before\u201d. Blank\u2019s events tend to have between 250 and 500 attendees, as well as drummers, poets and greeters at the door adorning dancers with glitter (partiers surrender their drinks and phones there as well). Blank, who lives in Nevada City, California, travels the country DJing and says she has seen how the pandemic has not only increased the number of revelers, but that those who come to her dance parties are \u201cembracing more connection\u201d. They are doing so paradoxically because they have been, she says, \u201ctraumatized by the experience of having everything taken away and by being afraid of invisible danger\u201d. Blank also cited a rash of new community singing groups \u2013 drum circles for voices. Claudia Cuentas, a Portland-based member of some of these singing circles, therapist and self-described Peruvian immigrant, sees those around her \u201cas relying on their own community more and more, seeing that being together and enjoying resources together is a life requirement: we need to be together to be coherent and healthy.\u201d They include Bipoc-specific singing circles, where Cuentas found collective joy. During the pandemic, partiers brought their own speakers and generators and DJs to Brooklyn\u2019s Prospect Park, near my home, where sometimes as many as 200 people danced at free gatherings. Some of the ringleaders have since created an informal club in a nearby house with electronic music playing all night long in the basement. And every Sunday morning up to 16 or so New Yorkers don their headphones and dance around the circumference of the park, listening to their own music, writhing and jumping in a free meet-up. The organizer of these dance meet-ups, Joanne Nerenberg, described them as an \u201cincredible catharsis\u201d. Among the collective activities that are in the same expressive vein yet slightly different are the new giant and sometimes illicit literary readings in the streets and private houses of Los Angeles; a recent gathering was replete with nitrous-filled balloons. A theory of radical happiness Part of the appeal of Ehrenreich\u2019s version of collective joy is that it highlights the destabilization of roles. \u201cAt the height of the festivity, we step out of our assigned roles and statues,\u201d she wrote, \u201cof gender, ethnicity, tribe and rank \u2013 and into a brief utopia defined by egalitarianism, creativity and mutual love.\u201d (This was over a decade before the pandemic: as usual, Ehrenreich was ahead of the curve.) This take stands in sharp contrast to the happiness preached by the happiness industry, which tended to be more about burrowing further into the possibility of wellbeing of whatever social identity the market and our unequal society had assigned you. The theorist Lynne Segal continued this line of thinking in her book Radical Happiness. Collective campaigns, however limited in their gains, can take ordinary, lonely geographies and transform them, she writes, \u201cinto spaces of hope\u201d. Embracing collective joy may well rest, though, on vanquishing the punishing, singular idea of happiness \u2013 that it\u2019s connected to efficiency, a person\u2019s job or even our individual wellbeing. Collective joy, in contrast, is an attempt to alchemize, say, loss or powerlessness into significance, through physical movement, sound and embodied politics. As brown, Pleasure Activism\u2019s author, writes, we need to make \u201cjustice and liberation the most pleasurable experiences we can have\u201d. Every summer, I experience this joy when I read poetry out loud with many inhabitants of an upstate New York town on 4 July. In 2021, we attended a nearby parade led by local artists \u2013 this was back when my daughter still thought it was fun to dress in costumes and make festive flags made of recycled turquoise toile scraps. We did so, joining hundreds clad in thrift finery, bearing noisemakers and hula hoops. In the midst of the crowd, I felt part of a single entity, as if I was obtaining a more real kind of happiness. That feeling was instructive: it\u2019s part of why lately, when I have been invited to do almost anything involving celebrating with strangers, I have almost always said yes. I\u2019ve never been sorry."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b2233a", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jul/20/david-byrne-royal-court-theatre-new-artistic-director", "primaryCategory": "stage", "subCategories": "test", "title": "David Byrne is a radical, dynamic appointment for the Royal Court", "lead": "The theatre\u2019s new artistic director proved himself a canny commercialist attuned to promising writing at the New Diorama.

Byrne has turned London\u2019s New Diorama theatre, which he founded, into a Goliath of new writing. The New Diorama was born in 2010 as an 80-seater run by eight staff. It is never an easy job to put a new fringe venue on the radar of audiences and its location, tucked away in the leafy surroundings of Regent\u2019s Park, only added to the challenge. Instead, it has become the place to go for edgy, exciting shows, often by young playwrights showing signs of raw talent. Byrne seems to sow the seed and water it. The theatre has picked up a clutch of awards under his leadership and numerous works have gone on to become mega-hits, the biggest of which is Operation Mincemeat, by SpitLip, originally commissioned and produced by Byrne, which transferred to the West End where it is currently doing a booming trade. There has also been Ryan Calais Cameron\u2019s For Black Boys Who Have Considered Suicide When the Hue Gets Too Heavy, programmed in 2021, which transferred to the West End, via the Royal Court, and was nominated for two Olivier awards. Both prove he has a canny eye for commercialism as well as an ear attuned to promising writing. It helps, I think, that he is a playwright himself. Politically, Byrne has shown a commitment to campaigning work around race, class, sexuality and gender but with no sense of ticking boxes. A radically reconfigured Antigone, staged at the New Diorama in 2020, which focused on sisterly relationships rather than patriarchal power, remains one of the most powerful interpretations I have seen of that Sophoclean tragedy. More recently, there was the musical After the Act, revolving around the homophobic Section 28 law, which was scrappily brilliant and timely in its more tacit reflections on institutionalised homophobia. Byrne\u2019s work is a fine fit for the Royal Court, which has publicly declared its commitment to addressing structural inequalities around issues such as race. How will his maverick sensibility translate to a larger venue, with a far bigger main stage (and a second space upstairs)? Unlike the Royal Court, the New Diorama is not one of Arts Council England\u2019s National Portfolio Organisations. Byrne is certainly resourceful in finding funding, but now may need to adhere to different criteria. A small fringe venue can also, more easily, be a testing ground for new writing without incurring harsh judgment around its misfires. But these misses should not always be counted as failures: I have admitted before now that I regarded Black Boys \u2026 as a failure when I saw it at the New Diorama. On its second staging at the Royal Court, it took my breath away. This is what more time and greater resources can do \u2013 and Byrne has more of them now. He saw the play\u2019s rough-hewn brilliance where some of us did not. I hope he brings an unexpected edge to the Royal Court and that he does not temper his radical, dynamic, fringe sensibility, or grow more commercially conservative. He must take the spirit of the New Diorama with him."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b2233b", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/20/toxic-flame-retardants-human-breast-milk", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018Disturbing\u2019: 25 types of toxic flame retardant found in US breast milk", "lead": "Research marks first time largely unregulated subclass of flame retardants called bromophenols found in human breast milk", "author": "Tom Perkins", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 10:00:27", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.230403", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/3a51002ae6335d3836559f65ad5d8ee133fd292a/593_627_3097_1858/500.jpg", "body": "New peer-reviewed research has identified 25 kinds of toxic flame retardant in human breast milk in the US, and all samples contained at least some level of the dangerous chemicals. The compounds are part of the brominated flame retardant class, which are commonly used in plastic, televisions, appliances and electronics. The research also marks the first time a largely unregulated subclass of the flame retardants, called bromophenols, have been found in breast milk. The chemicals are thought to be potent neurotoxins, especially for developing children, and the findings are \u201cdisturbing\u201d, said Erika Schreder, a toxicologist with Toxic Free Future and a study co-author. \u201cThe production and use of these compounds continues, and they are likely to impact children\u2019s health until governments require companies to end their use and switch to safer solutions,\u201d the study\u2019s authors wrote. The researchers, also from Emory University, the University of Washington, and Seattle Children\u2019s Research Institute, checked milk samples from 50 mothers across the US. Brominated flame retardants are a class of at least 75 chemicals used to prevent combustion in consumer products and electronics. Some older versions of the chemicals were removed from the marketplace in the 1970s because they were so toxic, and newer iterations have raised health concerns. Among other issues, many of the compounds are linked to memory impairment, increased impulsivity, impaired motor skills, decreased attention and overall lower measures of intelligence in children. Some of the chemicals may also be carcinogenic. Humans are exposed to brominated flame retardants when the chemicals break off from the plastics, get in dust, and are either breathed in or ingested. In 2007, some states started enacting bans on polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), one commonly used subclass of the flame retardants, prompting some in the industry to stop using or producing them. The new research found concentrations of PBDEs in milk seem to be decreasing over time \u2013 median levels in mothers in the Pacific north-west region are about 70% lower than researchers found in a similar study 20 years ago. The findings show \u201cregulations work for making breast milk safer\u201d, Schreder said, but she added that it highlights how unregulated flame retardants are still a problem. As PBDEs have attracted increased regulatory scrutiny and their health risks have become clear, industry has started switching to bromophenols subclass. Though the two chemicals are structurally similar and used for the same purpose, bromophenols are unregulated because so little is known about their toxicity. However, like their predecessors, bromophenols have been linked to brain development disorders, and the study found the chemicals in 88% of samples. The process by which chemical companies slightly alter chemicals\u2019 properties to make similar compounds that evade regulation is called \u201cregrettable substitution\u201d, and industry\u2019s actions with brominated flame retardants is a \u201cclassic\u201d case of it, Schreder said. \u201cThe parallels between these chemicals are extremely disturbing, and we\u2019re seeing bromophenols building up in breast milk,\u201d Schreder said. \u201cI hope we can learn our lesson this time and put policies in place that address the entire class and make sure chemicals used in products are known to be safe.\u201d The European Union and New York recently passed bans of the entire class of brominated flame retardants in electronic displays or enclosures, while the state of Washington this year enacted a wider ban on their use in electronics. Safer alternatives exist, Schreder added. Best Buy recently stopped using PBDEs in products it manufactures, and did research to find the safest alternative. \u201cThat is an example of how it should be done,\u201d Schreder said."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b2233c", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/20/homeless-unhoused-houseless-term-history", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Why \u2018homeless\u2019 is giving way to \u2018unhoused\u2019: a history of a term shift", "lead": "The use of the term unhoused has grown exponentially in the last few years, and those who have adopted it say it emphasizes a lack of affordable housing", "author": "Amanda Abrams", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 10:00:27", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.230422", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/521d65332cc88de344985c7ce4516cbc72ecba3a/1_0_2998_1800/500.jpg", "body": "Beverly Graham was sitting in an executive leadership class in Seattle in 2006 when she first recalls using the word \u201cunhoused\u201d. The director of OSL, a non-profit that provides meals to food-insecure Seattle residents, Graham hadn\u2019t planned on speaking up. But her classmates \u2013 two dozen regional business leaders \u2013 were discussing the number of homeless people in the area, and their perspective felt very different from the one she had gained after years of helping vulnerable Seattleites. She had to pipe up. \u201cI said, \u2018They\u2019re unhoused,\u2019\u201d remembered Graham. \u201cThey have a home: Seattle is their home.\u201d OSL has used the word ever since to describe people lacking a fixed abode, feeling that \u201chomeless\u201d had gained discriminatory, ugly connotations. The term caught on. Gradually it spread among west coast professionals working with or advocating for people living on the streets, and then it made its way across the US. Adam Aleksic, a Harvard linguistics graduate who started the Etymology Nerd blog, noted its apparent first appearance on Twitter as another word for homeless occurred in October 2008. Around 2020, the use of unhoused began growing exponentially, according to Google Trends. Today, in mainstream articles and conversations, it\u2019s synonymous with \u2013 and for many people, preferable to \u2013 homeless. While governments don\u2019t yet widely employ it, some grassroots groups and scholars use it exclusively. Critics have derided the new word as clunky and unfamiliar, potentially the product of woke virtue signaling. But those who have adopted it say it\u2019s for the same reasons OSL originally did: to lessen stigma and to highlight that those lacking permanent roofs over their heads may still have communities or physical spaces they consider home. And with the country currently in the midst of an intractable housing crisis, there\u2019s another reason for the popularity of unhoused: the word\u2019s root emphasizes that the problem is a structural one linked to a lack of affordable housing, not a personal weakness. Unhoused is no neologism; it\u2019s been around since the mid-16th century. The etymologist and linguistic consultant Jason Greenberg pointed out that Shakespeare used it to illustrate Othello\u2019s love for Desdemona, though it had a slightly different meaning at the time: \u2026 for know, Iago, But that I love the gentle Desdemona, I would not my unhoused free condition Put into circumscription and confine For the sea\u2019s worth.\u201d Homeless is an old word too, with origins in old English, said Greenberg. But historically it has referred to a lack of social and emotional connections, rather than the absence of a physical residence. In the 1980s, however, largely due to deep cuts in federal housing and welfare programs, increasing numbers of people began finding themselves without a place to live. Those numbers grew from roughly 100,000 people in 1980 to 600,000 in 1987, and journalists and analysts needed a word to describe the new denizens. Around the mid-80s, homeless became the term of choice. The popularity of unhoused could be tied to a similar shift in public life: the emergence of large tent communities in many big cities around the country. \u201cI think I first heard [the word] maybe 10 years ago, when encampments became more prevalent,\u201d said Maria Foscarinis, founder of the National Homelessness Law Center. While homelessness in the US has risen only slightly over the past few years, the proportion of unsheltered people \u2013 that is, those who don\u2019t utilize overnight shelters but instead sleep outside or in vehicles \u2013 and the number of tent encampments have significantly increased, making the overall problem much more visible. Correspondingly, housing prices in many of those same cities have steeply risen over the past decade. The use of unhoused is an effort to humanize those residents. \u201cIt\u2019s a powerful way to remind us that the issue is really a housing problem,\u201d said Elizabeth Bowen, a professor of social work at the University of Buffalo. \u201cI think that\u2019s useful: there can be a tendency to think about homelessness in more individualistic ways, like it\u2019s a person\u2019s personal failing or the result of their life choices. When really the most important thing is that we just don\u2019t have enough affordable housing in this country.\u201d Some advocates think the newer word doesn\u2019t go far enough. \u201cHomeless, houseless, unhoused: they\u2019re abstract and kind of euphemisms. I prefer \u2018housing-deprived\u2019, but it\u2019s a mouthful,\u201d said Jonathan Russell, chief strategy and impact officer at Bay Area Community Services. Still, asserted Mark Horvath, founder of the advocacy organization Invisible People and himself formerly unhoused, \u201cmost homeless people still say homeless.\u201d Intentional shifts in terminology might seem like a game of Whac-A-Mole \u2013 an ultimately unsuccessful effort to outrun a concept\u2019s ugly implications. The Harvard professor Steven Pinker dubbed it the \u201ceuphemism treadmill\u201d. \u201cWhat usually happens is, over time, a term that may have been neutral at some point becomes pejorative,\u201d said Robin Queen, a linguistics professor at the University of Michigan. \u201cAnd that\u2019s usually when you find people finding new words for it.\u201d In the past, for example, people lacking permanent residences were described as bums, hobos or transients; homeless itself was once considered a neutral, more palatable alternative. Queen and other analysts agree that words and the thinking behind them can have real consequences, especially as the housing crisis becomes increasingly politicized. Conservative organizations like the Heritage Foundation and the Cicero Institute have become involved, describing homeless encampments as \u201chotbeds\u201d of crime, violence and social disorder. They have been pushing back on the housing first model, which aims to end homelessness by quickly moving people into permanent housing paired with supportive services and has been widely successful. The Cicero Institute in particular has developed a coordinated campaign to promote model legislation that criminalizes homelessness. So far, legislatures in Texas and Missouri have successfully used Cicero\u2019s template to ban public camping, and bills have been introduced in Kansas, Tennessee and several other states. Writ large, what\u2019s occurring is a struggle for the narrative. \u201cPeople are frustrated, seeing homelessness grow,\u201d explained Horvath. In response, he said, \u201cThere\u2019s a huge amount of money on the right going to reinforce negative stereotypes that people hold onto regarding homelessness.\u201d It\u2019s not nearly enough, but the term unhoused \u2013 giving a fresh name to a tired, infuriating topic \u2013 is one small strike in that battle over public opinion."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b2233d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/20/ex-meteorologist-names-us-heatwaves-after-oil-gas-firms", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Ex-meteorologist names US heatwaves after oil and gas firms to shame them", "lead": "\u2018People need to be riled up,\u2019 says Guy Walton, who has already christened two previous heatwaves this summer Amoco and BP", "author": "Oliver Milman", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 10:00:27", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.230440", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/a2af4d6858bfe7ba70f61a4e9672d5ec9a3f083a/0_428_7594_4557/500.jpg", "body": "The summer\u2019s heatwaves have been so blistering they have inspired their own names.

The rebadging of heatwaves as being directly the fault of companies like Chevron is \u201ca naming a shaming thing\u201d, according to Walton, who wants weather forecasters and the media to be more explicit between the links between extreme heat and the burning of fossil fuels that has caused the climate crisis. \u201cI\u2019m trying to be a bug in the ear of my compatriots to take what I\u2019m doing and run with it,\u201d he said. \u201cI realize what I\u2019m doing is controversial and corporate media will want to steer clear of it, but people need to be riled up. I don\u2019t think we need to pull any punches. If it causes consternation, so be it.\u201d Walton has devised his own criteria for named heatwaves in the US, based on duration and extremity, on a one to five scale similar to hurricanes. Heatwave Chevron is classed as a four and is \u201chistoric\u201d, Walton said. The meteorologist said he has a list of 20 oil and gas companies \u2013 including Exxon and Shell \u2013 for upcoming heatwaves and will turn to coal companies if he runs out of names. \u201cIt\u2019s a little tongue in cheek but it\u2019s not a fun topic, I want to galvanize the way the public thinks about these threats,\u201d said Walton, who previously named heatwaves after dragons (a heatwave in Europe blamed for 60,000 deaths last year was named Smaug, after the antagonist in JRR Tolkien\u2019s novel the Hobbit). \u201cIt would be great if the media started naming heatwaves, although I\u2019d expect them to use a more buttoned up criteria than what I\u2019ve used,\u201d he added. Although extreme heat is the deadliest weather phenomena in the US and many other countries, there is no standardized naming system for heatwaves, unlike hurricanes that are routinely named after people \u2013 Atlantic storms this year will be given monikers including Emily, Cindy and Sean. The World Meteorological Organization, comprised of 121 governments, has said it has no plans to alter this status quo, pointing to the lack of an agreed definition of heatwaves and the perceived danger that names would \u201cmisdirect\u201d public and media attention away from important messages on how to cope with a blast of dangerous heat. A wave of record heatwaves has, however, forced a rethink in some quarters. Last year, authorities in Seville, Spain, started naming heatwaves \u2013 one, called Zoe, reached 43C (109F) \u2013 and this summer an Italian weather website has turned to mythological figures to name some of the fiercest heat the continent has ever seen. Two major heatwaves that have affected southern Europe with temperatures as high as 48.8C (119F) have been named Cerberus, the ferocious three-headed hound belonging to Hades, and Charon, the ferryman of Hades, the Greek underworld. The names have caught on with several media outlets and prompted some calls for change among meteorologists. \u201cI can see a benefit to giving heatwaves names, to help people understand them and make them memorable,\u201d said Chris Gloninger, who had a long career as a TV meteorologist in the US before quitting after receiving a death threat for mentioning climate change on air. \u201cBut I\u2019d have a concern about naming them after oil companies,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s already such a politicized issue and it would give people dismissive about climate change more ammunition. I\u2019d fear it would turn people off.\u201d Some climate campaigners, though, see a benefit in directly linking oil companies to the escalating climate disasters currently unfolding around the world. \u201cI think it\u2019s a great idea,\u201d said Margaret Klein Salamon, a psychologist and executive director of the Climate Emergency Fund. \u201cAny kind of extreme weather should be named after the fossil fuel companies. It\u2019s a brilliant way to bypass media silence and denial, and get the message to the public. We are in a climate emergency, and the fossil fuel industry is to blame.\u201d Chevron did not respond to a request to comment about being named after a heatwave that Walton said is now shifting eastwards. \u201cI\u2019m sure it will be responsible for about 100 deaths, it\u2019s got a while to go yet,\u201d he said."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b2233e", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/20/my-adventures-at-sea-have-brought-me-many-things-mainly-raw-nipples-and-exhaustion", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "subCategories": "test", "title": "My adventures at sea have brought me many things.

It took me a while to get to paddleboarding. As a kid, I spent hours on those polystyrene boards, rubbing my nipples red raw. (They have been upsettingly sensitive ever since, but let\u2019s not go there.) I tried proper surfing, but was only any good flat on my belly; I couldn\u2019t stand up and quickly became discouraged. I tried windsurfing, but found I was either getting fed up with all the falling off, or going so fast that I was frightened to death. Also, I was too scared to go out on my own as I didn\u2019t trust myself to rig the bloody thing properly. Apparently, kitesurfing is less of a faff, but potentially dangerous. I read something about a poor chap who had come to a terrible end, so I gave that up before I started. That\u2019s the best way, I think. So, to paddleboarding I turned. A nice chap showed me how to do it and within half an hour I was on my way home with a board of my own. It was a very solid thing, possibly the last of its type before much better, lighter, inflatable ones took over. But I loved it very much. By the time I had lugged it down to the beach, I loved it a little less, but told myself that carrying the thing was a knack I would soon acquire. Full of enthusiasm, if already exhausted, I commenced my maiden voyage. I paddled out to sea. After a while, I stopped and had a look around. All very lovely. But now what? Hmm, I paddled back in again. And that was that. Oh well. I traipsed home with it and, upon arrival, collapsed in exhaustion. I told myself it would be more interesting and much easier next time. It wasn\u2019t. Nor the time after that. And then I never went again. Now, I\u2019ve brushed the weeds back over it and I\u2019m trying to pretend none of this silly business ever happened. \u2022 Adrian Chiles is a broadcaster, writer and Guardian columnist"}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b2233f", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jul/20/how-we-met-i-knew-the-moment-i-saw-her-i-was-going-to-marry-her", "primaryCategory": "lifeandstyle", "subCategories": "test", "title": "How we met: \u2018I knew the moment I saw her I was going to marry her\u2019 ", "lead": "Steve, 46, and Maite, 43, met at a restaurant in Barcelona in 2001.

When they arrived, they went to a tourist kiosk to inquire about accommodation and were directed to a small hotel in El Born district. \u201cWe\u2019d asked for a crappy hotel near the beach and we got a crappy hotel that was quite far from the beach,\u201d he says, laughing. They did, however, find a nice restaurant. \u201cWe went there for lunch the next day and that\u2019s when I saw Maite for the first time,\u201d he says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t looking for a girlfriend, but I knew the moment I saw her that I was going to marry her.\u201d Maite was managing the restaurant but, when Steve asked the waiting staff about her, he was disappointed. \u201cThey said: \u2018That\u2019s the owner\u2019s daughter. She won\u2019t talk to you\u2019.\u201d She admits that she didn\u2019t notice Steve initially, but he stayed in Barcelona for the next two months, regularly popping into the restaurant. \u201cHe kept ordering the same food and looking at me,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought he was a bit arrogant because he was staring.\u201d Steve went home to the US, but returned to Barcelona on holiday. \u201cIt was an excuse to go back to the restaurant and see Maite,\u201d he says. Whenever he visited, her colleagues would say: \u201cThe American is here again,\u201d and try to persuade her to go out with him. But Maite had a boyfriend and wasn\u2019t interested. In 2003, she decided to study in Australia. \u201cI ended my relationship and was preparing to leave,\u201d she says. That was when she decided to give Steve a chance. \u201cWhen he came to the restaurant, he always used to ask if I wanted to go for a drink. I always said no, but then I thought, what if I never see him again?\u201d They met on the terrace of another restaurant and, \u201claughed all night. We were speaking in broken Spanish, English and through gestures because we didn\u2019t speak each other\u2019s language well, but it was so much fun,\u201d says Maite. She went to Australia, but they kept in touch. \u201cSteve emailed me and sent handwritten letters and CDs. He said he wanted to wait for me.\u201d In 2005, he invited her to visit him in San Francisco. \u201cI loved the trip and he treated me so well,\u201d she says. \u201cMy English was much better by then too.\u201d Afterwards, they tried a long-distance relationship, but Steve says it was hard. \u201cMaite wasn\u2019t sure about us as she was still studying. We kept in touch, but it was hot and cold.\u201d After she finished college and returned to Barcelona at the end of 2006, Maite began to feel \u201ca bit lost\u201d. Steve suggested they meet in New York to celebrate the new year. When she arrived, her mobile phone wasn\u2019t working and she realised they hadn\u2019t arranged a place to meet. \u201cBy chance, I went to get an elevator at the airport. The doors opened and there was Steve. We were together for three days, but I didn\u2019t want to leave. I was really in love by that point.\u201d After a brief trip back to Barcelona, she packed her bags and went to San Francisco to be with him. She got pregnant that year, and began to panic because she didn\u2019t have a visa. \u201cSteve asked me to marry him and stay \u2013 I just knew it was right,\u201d she says. Steve\u2019s friends and family pulled together and threw them a wedding in Lake Tahoe. \u201cWe planned nothing and it couldn\u2019t have been better,\u201d says Steve. The couple have two sons, born in 2008 and 2011. From California, they moved to Texas in 2010 for Steve\u2019s job in manufacturing management. Maite initially took time out to look after their children, and now works as a coordinator for a clinical trials company. Steve believes they were meant to be together. \u201cWe fit perfectly and she is one of the smartest, most caring, giving and sensitive people I have ever known. You know when you\u2019re home \u2013 and that\u2019s how I feel with her.\u201d Maite loves Steve\u2019s sense of humour and integrity. \u201cHe\u2019s so loving to me and the boys.

District court judge Donald Middlebrooks rebuked the state in a scathing 79-page ruling for its \u201csystemic institutionalization\u201d of the children, and flagrant breaches of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) which compels care to take place in the least restrictive environment available. Pediatric expert Mary Ehlenbach toured three nursing homes to compile a report used to guide the court\u2019s decision, and praised Middlebrooks for an \u201camazingly comprehensive\u201d ruling that ended an 11-year legal tussle between Florida health officials and the justice department, which accused the state of consigning the children to a life of loneliness and isolation. \u201cThe site visits were emotionally taxing, particularly in light of the fact that I care for children with similar conditions and statuses who live with their families and are integrated into the community,\u201d said Ehlenbach, medical director of the pediatric complex care program at the University of Wisconsin-Madison\u2019s school of medicine and public health. \u201cTo envision some of my own patients being forced to live in an institution, that really hit home for me. It was challenging.\u201d In testimony during a two-week hearing in May, she said she witnessed children abandoned for long periods in cribs with high metal bars on all four sides, with just an electronic tablet to engage them. \u201cOne [child] was sitting alone in a stroller at the edge of an open common area,\u201d she wrote in the report. \u201cWhen I interacted with her, she tracked me with her eyes and smiled at me, clearly engaged with the interaction.\u201d At another facility, she saw a boy make a bolt for freedom as soon as a railing on his bed was lowered. It was, she said, another example of a child with \u201cminimal medical needs\u201d unnecessarily residing in a skilled nursing facility. And according to the state\u2019s own inspection records, other children were left for hours in urine-soaked diapers because staff were \u201cbusy\u201d elsewhere. \u201cThe approach of institutionalizing children is really quite antiquated,\u201d she told the Guardian, noting that advances in technology, and a commitment to the proper funding of community care, had led other states away from the practice. \u201cThe vast majority of children with medical complexity live at home, generally with their biological families, sometimes in medical foster homes. So I think the fact that [Florida] relies on the facilities, and it appeared they were extremely committed to keeping them, is not in line with the national landscape of care of children with medical complexity.\u201d Some parents, she said, were wrongly told their children would require private bedrooms and round-the-clock care at home, even though many shared rooms in the nursing homes. Florida has about 140 so-called \u201cfragile\u201d children living in three state-licensed facilities in Broward and Pinellas counties, according to the Miami Herald. Lawyers for the state argued that in almost every case it was in the child\u2019s best interests to be cared for in the nursing homes, despite a number of families seeking discharge to their homes or community care. They portrayed the legal proceedings with federal authorities as a battle of sovereignty, and claimed that a shortage of nurses meant it would be too difficult for the children to be cared for outside of the nursing facilities. Middlebrooks was unimpressed, accepting the assertion there was a nursing shortage, but not the argument that nothing could be done about it. He also criticized a pediatric doctor who gave evidence for the state, whose experience was limited only to hospital settings, as \u201cnot credible\u201d. \u201cMost of these children could thrive in their own homes, nurtured by their own families. Or if not at home, then in some other community-based setting that would support their psychological and emotional health, while also attending to their physical needs,\u201d he wrote in the ruling. \u201cUnjustified institutionalization of individuals with disabilities is unacceptable, especially given the advances in technology and in the provision of home-based care. Any family who wants to care for their child at home should be able to do so.\u201d His ruling orders changes in procedures in order to keep children out of nursing homes, but it is not yet clear exactly what it means for the 140 already there. The Florida agency for healthcare administration said in a statement to the Guardian that it would seek an immediate stay of the order, and would file an appeal. \u201cThe judge\u2019s failure to understand the law is demonstrable in his order. The court\u2019s conclusion that the state\u2019s actions or omissions force children to live in nursing homes against their parent\u2019s wishes is unsupported and refuted by the evidence presented at trial,\u201d the statement said. \u201cDuring the trial, witnesses testified that their medically complex children were in nursing homes for various reasons unrelated to the state or its policies. Not one parent testified that they are ready and willing to take a child home but cannot do so because of the state\u2019s actions or omissions. \u201cThe court\u2019s conclusion that the state\u2019s actions or omissions forced children to live in nursing homes against their parents\u2019 wishes is a generalization unsupported and even refuted by the evidence presented at trial.\u201d Ehlenbach, however, has no doubt the ruling was the correct one. \u201cThe best thing for the individual children institutionalized in Florida would be to have home and community-based services so they can be integrated into society, be reunited with their families and live their best life,\u201d she said. \u201cOn a broader scale, I would hope that other states will take notice that it\u2019s imperative for home and community-based services to be prioritized for children with medical complexity.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b22341", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/20/state-abortion-legal-care-providers-challenge", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Legal dithering over abortion in states leads to uncertainty for care providers", "lead": "Rights groups and their lawyers have challenged abortion bans in many states and some rulings have led to a gray areas in law", "author": "Mary Yang", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 10:00:26", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.230514", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/4880797f97e4d618f8f94ae9b2f19d82d72935b4/0_72_4202_2522/500.jpg", "body": "Obtaining an abortion after six weeks of pregnancy, before most know they are pregnant, was a crime in Iowa \u2013 for a weekend. On Friday afternoon, Kim Reynolds, the Iowa Governor, a Republican, signed a law banning the procedure after six weeks, at which point doctors begin detecting cardiac activity in an embryo, with narrow exceptions at an evangelical conference. Abortion providers immediately filed a lawsuit seeking a temporary injunction and an Iowa judge approved it on Monday. Reproductive rights groups and their legal teams welcomed the temporary block \u2013 but with caution, as state lawmakers could challenge the ruling in court. \u201cWe are deeply relieved that the court granted this relief so essential health care in Iowa can continue,\u201d said Abbey Hardy-Fairbanks, the medical director at the Emma Goldman Clinic, in a joint statement with the ACLU and Planned Parenthood after the ruling Monday. \u201cWe are also acutely aware that the relief is only pending further litigation and the future of abortion in Iowa remains tenuous and threatened.\u201d Reynolds, who called a rare special legislative session to pass the six-week ban, signaled her ongoing crusade in a brief statement released shortly after the Monday ruling: \u201cThe abortion industry\u2019s attempt to thwart the will of Iowans and the voices of their elected representatives continues today, but I will fight this all the way to the Iowa Supreme Court,\u201d she said. The legal back and forth over abortion in Iowa has mirrored court battles in other states, where reproductive rights groups and their lawyers have taken a number of approaches to challenge abortion bans under state law. Since the supreme court overturned Roe v Wade, 25 states have tried to implement either a complete or \u201cpre-viability\u201d ban, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) tracker. The bans are currently blocked by courts in seven states. In Nebraska abortion providers and the ACLU are challenging the state\u2019s 12-week ban, which Jim Pillen, the governor, signed into law in May. Plaintiffs Planned Parenthood of the Heartland and Sarah Traxler, an OB-GYN, are seeking a temporary injunction on the law, which also bans gender-affirming surgery for people under 19, saying it violated the state constitution by lumping together two unrelated bills. And in Wisconsin, where clinics are no longer performing abortions after an 1849 law making abortion a felony in nearly all cases took effect last May, attorney general Josh Kaul, a Democrat, is suing to repeal the ban. A judge ruled in July that the lawsuit could continue after a defendant, a conservative Wisconsin attorney, moved to dismiss the case. But ongoing legal battles have led to uncertainty for abortion providers and those seeking abortion care. Over the last year, 20% of OB-GYNs have felt constraints on their ability to provide care for miscarriages and other pregnancy-related medical emergencies, according to a KFF survey conducted in May. That figure doubled in states where abortion is banned. \u201cProviders have stopped providing things preemptively because they\u2019re afraid about their criminal liability or they\u2019ve actually moved out of the state,\u201d said Laurie Sobel, an associate director for women\u2019s health policy at KFF. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot in the middle that poses burdens and challenges to people seeking abortion care.\u201d Varied restrictions over contraceptives and abortion methods across states have further complicated access to care since the Dobbs ruling, Sobel said. More than two-thirds of OB-GYNs nationwide said they understand the circumstances under which abortion is legal in the state they practice very well while just 45% of OBGYNs in states where abortion is restricted by gestational limits said so, according to the survey by KFF. In Iowa, the last ruling that set a clear standard for how to review abortion cases was in 2015, according to Sally Frank, a professor at Drake University Law School and an expert on Iowa\u2019s abortion law. In that case, the Iowa supreme court used the standard of \u201cundue burden\u201d to rule that a ban on televisits to obtain abortion pills violated the state constitution. If the state appeals the judge\u2019s ruling and the lawsuit goes up to the Iowa supreme court, justices will need to decide whether to use the 2015 undue burden test, which favors reproductive rights groups, or set a new standard, said Frank. \u201cThe thing about abortion is you can ban it, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to stop,\u201d said Frank."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b22342", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2023/jul/20/londons-tory-mayoral-candidate-is-pedalling-backwards-cycling-policy-susan-hall", "primaryCategory": "environment", "subCategories": "test", "title": "London\u2019s Tory mayoral candidate is pedalling backwards on cycling policy", "lead": "Susan Hall\u2019s lack of enthusiasm for active travel reflects a view within the party in sharp contrast with other major European cities", "author": "Peter Walker", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 09:56:44", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.230536", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/1802dd6624b5432eeee6acf18715598902e0132b/0_239_3888_2333/500.jpg", "body": "Among the political strands exposed by the Conservatives\u2019 decision to pick Susan Hall to stand for London mayor \u2013 not least the apparent unlikeliness that she can win \u2013 is one that might seem niche but is in fact arguably very telling: what it says about active travel. Anyone who has observed Hall in her six years as a London assembly member, and especially her energetic and often outspoken Twitter feed, will have realised she is not a fan of cycle lanes, cycling, or indeed of cyclists themselves. While Hall intermittently insists she is not anti-cyclist as such, she has lambasted those on two wheels as lawless and dangerous, raised the idea of mandatory registration for cyclists, and claimed bike lanes and other active travel measures cause congestion. There could be an argument that given the long odds on Hall unseating Labour\u2019s Sadiq Khan next May, and the slightly arbitrary process through which she won the nomination, such opinions can be written off as marginal, even irrelevant. This would be wrong. There are several ways in which Hall\u2019s one-woman war against cycling, and her subsequent adoption as the governing party\u2019s choice to inherit the biggest direct electoral mandate in the UK, is significant and telling. First, her opinions are not too far from those now emanating from the Department for Transport (DfT), which has pointedly said it will no longer fund low-traffic neighbourhoods, a relatively routine intervention that seeks to make smaller residential streets more friendly to pedestrians and cyclists. In an interview earlier this month, the transport secretary, Mark Harper, chose to criticise such schemes as tending to be about \u201cbanning cars or making it difficult for motorists\u201d. It is not a coincidence that Hall is a keen member of the Conservatives\u2019 \u201cculture war\u201d faction, a section of the party whose views are often fanned by stories in a handful of rightwing newspapers, and that has an increasing influence on Rishi Sunak and his team. Active travel \u2013 or, more specifically, moves to try to incentivise this over urban car use \u2013 has become increasingly drawn into this orbit, in part through traditional politics such as Conservative opposition to Khan\u2019s expanded ultra-low emission zone (Ulez), but also, at the fringes, through conspiracy theories linking traffic schemes to supposed UN plots to imprison people in their homes. Culture wars and negative media headlines are not the only reason why Harper\u2019s DfT is so sceptical about active travel, a view insiders say Sunak firmly shares. Among Conservatives, Boris Johnson\u2019s strongly pro-cycling view was always seen as an outlier. But it is undeniable that when you are a Conservative minister and looking for policies to axe, those that are already the subject of regular condemnation in friendly newspapers, not to mention considerable social media froth, are an easy target. All this brings us to the crux of why all this matters: on one of the more crucial policies for urban life in the coming decades, London and the UK risk not just falling behind but actively moving backwards, with potentially significant economic and social consequences. For all sorts of reasons that would take too long to set out now, including the environment, public health, social equity, and the small matter of attracting businesses and tourists, cities around the world are trying to puzzle out how best to move away from cars and vans as the dominant transport mode for shorter urban trips. Other places are moving fast. Paris is spending hundreds of millions of euros to make it more friendly for bikes and pedestrians, with dramatic and immediately visible results, while cities such as Brussels and Barcelona have also transformed their approach to urban streets. Even Copenhagen, a city with a long record of high cyclist numbers, used its role as the departure point for the 2022 Tour de France to launch a heavily funded, multi-level push to try to get even more ordinary Danes on their bikes. It is by no means universal, but in many cities, especially in Europe, this tide seems to be moving only one way. But Hall, Harper, and many other Conservatives, appear intent on trudging backwards. Yes, many previous UK governments have paid little more than lip service to active travel, but they have generally praised it, at least in theory. Now we have a DfT that is at best neutral \u2013 and in Hall, a high-profile candidate who is actively hostile. This is new, and in terms of other countries it is anomalous. And it matters."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b22343", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jul/20/heathrow-failed-to-meet-minimum-accessibility-standards-caa-report-finds", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Heathrow failed to meet minimum accessibility standards, CAA report finds ", "lead": "Airport only one to be rated as \u2018poor\u2019 and \u2018needs improvement\u2019 over all four quarters in year to March", "author": "Geneva Abdul", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 09:33:19", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.230554", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/1edacc18045c049d13007c9e171a50cecef293d0/0_195_5845_3507/500.jpg", "body": "Heathrow failed to meet the minimum accessibility standards for disabled passengers in the year to March, the sector\u2019s regulator has said. The airport was the only one in the UK to be rated as \u201cpoor\u201d and \u201cneeds improvement\u201d by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) over all four quarters in the period, according to the report. Eighteen airports received good or very good ratings and seven airports improved from poor to good. Heathrow was an outlier, however, not having met the criteria for a good rating. Heathrow\u2019s chief operating officer, Emma Gilthorpe, said: \u201cLast year we didn\u2019t consistently deliver an appropriate level of service for passengers requiring extra support with their journey through the airport. Between 2019 and 2022, disabled and less mobile passengers represented 2.38% of all passengers at Heathrow, the highest proportion in the UK, according to the regulator. \u201cI want to reassure those passengers that we have put in place a strong plan which is turning that around and we are now meeting service targets,\u201d said Gilthorpe. The report covers 26 of the UK\u2019s largest airports, in an industry that has encountered unprecedented challenges in recruitment, industrial action and equipment shortages since the Covid-19 pandemic. Last year, the airport was one of several, including Bristol, Leeds Bradford and Luton, to come under scrutiny from the aviation regulator after many disabled and less mobile passengers missed flights or had to wait for extended periods. Scope, a disability charity in England and Wales, described the findings as a \u201cworld away\u201d from the reality of disabled passengers who were being let down by the air industry. \u201cInstead of the industry marking its own homework, there needs to be much tougher punishments to reflect how serious these problems are,\u201d said Charlotte Morley, the charity\u2019s consumer affairs policy adviser. \u201cEnough is enough. It\u2019s time to start fining airlines and airports when they fail disabled passengers. The government has committed to bringing more legislation in, but it needs to happen now. Disabled people have been waiting far too long.\u201d In 2022, a CAA survey found that disabled respondents with physical disabilities or health conditions said they were considerably more likely to experience difficulty in accessing airports or flying, with 70% of such passengers requiring assistance. The number of passengers requiring assistance has risen in recent years. In 2022, 3.45 million people \u2013 or 1.56% of all passengers \u2013 received assistance across UK airports, compared with 1.35% of passengers requiring assistance prior to the pandemic. The joint-interim chief executive at the CAA Paul Smith said the industry was making strides toward returning accessibility levels to those seen before Covid-19. \u201cIt\u2019s also important to acknowledge that there is still a way to go in providing a consistently good service for disabled and less mobile passengers across the industry, particularly for those with more complex needs, and throughout the busier summer months,\u201d said Smith."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b22344", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/jul/20/abc-sbs-funding-cut-threats-labor-policy", "primaryCategory": "media", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Labor to consider ways to protect ABC and SBS from future funding threats", "lead": "Michelle Rowland says review into security of national broadcasters will consider options to support their independence ", "author": "Amanda Meade", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 09:30:25", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.230572", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/827772105df52ead7b90bd80a5c5f2e49da38fcc/0_155_3960_2376/500.jpg", "body": "A review into the security of ABC and SBS funding will examine ways to protect the public broadcasters from future threats of privatisation and arbitrary funding cuts, the communications minister Michelle Rowland has said. Rowland told an ABC Friends dinner the communications department review would consider options to support the independence of the ABC and the SBS and it was open for public submissions. The review, foreshadowed in Guardian Australia in November, will also examine the appointment of ABC and SBS board members, which continues to be subject to political stacking. \u201cUnder the former Liberal National government, the threat of privatisation was real, arbitrary funding cuts caused disruption and uncertainty, and there was scant regard for the independent merit-based selection process for ABC board members,\u201d Rowland said on Thursday evening. \u201cThe fact is that the past decade was a tumultuous time for the ABC.\u201d Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Labor legislated a nomination panel in 2012 to prevent political appointments but only half of its 10 recommended candidates were taken up by the government. The Morrison government handpicked several of the appointees. Despite being elected after promising no cuts to the ABC and SBS, the Abbott government reduced funding to the ABC in its first budget in 2014 and added a pause in the indexation of funding in 2018 under Malcolm Turnbull. Labor has already implemented five-year funding terms, which started this financial year, and restored $83.7m in funding cuts to the ABC. But budget cuts have hit the ABC hard and diminished services, including the recent decision to abolish eight state-based 7pm Sunday news bulletins. Another 120 jobs have been axed since Labor was elected, including 41 in the news division comprising journalists, editors, camera and sound operators on 7.30, Australian Story, Four Corners and the investigations team. The review will not examine funding levels but will identify potential mechanisms to implement and maintain five\u2011year funding terms. Options include legislating to ensure a single funding term is \u201clocked in\u201d and amending the ABC and SBS Acts to state that base funding must be provided on a five-year basis, according to a discussion paper seen by Guardian Australia. The review will not consider the level of funding or funding models, changes to the ABC charter or merging the SBS and the ABC. \u201cIndependent public broadcasters are a hallmark of a healthy democracy,\u201d Rowland said. \u201cThis review is an opportunity for Australians to have their say on the funding and governance arrangements for the ABC and SBS, including measures to support stable funding terms and promote effective board appointments. \u201cThe ABC and SBS are key democratic and cultural institutions that provide essential services for communities across the country. I encourage all Australians to share their thoughts on how to provide greater stability to support the independence of the national broadcasters.\u201d The review will not consider operational matters such as the ABC\u2019s \u201csignificant transition\u201d towards digital transmission, which is likely to reduce the resources invested in AM radio stations and programs, and broadcast TV channels. The public broadcaster\u2019s five-year-plan stops short of following the BBC\u2019s lead in planning to shut down its traditional television and radio broadcasts to be digital first, but will involve moving resources from broadcast to digital channels."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b22345", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/20/sober-alcohol-consumption-britain-drinking-culture", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "subCategories": "test", "title": "People are fascinated by the sober and sober-ish.

But not in the way you might think: his grievance centres on the impossibility of buying a non-alcoholic beer from a shop after 10pm. A formerly enthusiastic drinker, he has recently discovered the delights of 0% lagers: all the fun of the fair without any of the hangover. And now he finds himself unable to buy what is essentially a soft drink, simply because you can\u2019t buy alcohol after 10pm in Scotland, and his 0% beer is categorised alongside its alcoholic equivalent. \u201cI\u2019m going to start a social media campaign about this,\u201d he complained, only partly joking. The UK may have one of the highest numbers of pubs in the world, but the evidence is growing that we\u2019re teetering on the edge of a sober sea change. Drinking among the nation\u2019s teenagers and young people is on the decline \u2013 and this June, sales of low- and non-alcoholic beer at Tesco outstripped those in dry January by 25%. Retailers are responding by launching lines of low- or non-alcoholic drinks; far more pubs and bars now offer them. I have been \u201csober adjacent\u201d (a term a friend favours for those of us not completely teetotal, but more likely than not to go \u201cdry\u201d on any given night) for a year now, and I have noticed more and more friends and acquaintances either cutting back or quitting booze altogether. Some are in recovery programmes for addiction; others, like me, are lucky enough to be able to moderate our drinking at will \u2013 a rarer gift, in our drinking culture, than you might think. People seem fascinated by the rise of sober and sober-adjacents, and the first question you tend to hear is: why? The answer will be different depending on personal circumstance and demographic, though for most it falls into some combination of health, wealth and context. Today\u2019s teenagers may be drinking less because the places where they socialise have changed \u2013 social media is now their main public square, a location that offers significantly fewer opportunities for drinking copious amounts of Sourz Apple \u2013 and because it\u2019s prohibitively expensive. Most of the sober or sober-curious people I know \u2013 urban-dwelling, middle-class millennials like me \u2013 want their all-too-short weekends unmarred by a day lost to sore heads, and to manage their health better. Another clue to what\u2019s going on in the urban millennial demographic lies in the upswing in the recreational usage of magic mushrooms and ketamine. Unlike stimulants such as cocaine (whose use is closely associated with booze), these drugs are used to \u201csoften the edges\u201d, and are increasingly building profiles as alternative treatments for conditions like depression. The hardcore, booze-driven lad and ladette culture of the 90s and the \u201cthree-day bender, no surrender\u201d approach of the noughties are now pass\u00e9. Partying is still substance-assisted, but the idea is to enhance your experience rather than block it out \u2013 there\u2019s an emphasis on the spiritual, rather than having your body remind you who\u2019s boss by forcing you to vomit up rum and coke on your shoes. All this is against a backdrop of creaking welfare and healthcare services, and the premium placed on both physical and mental health by \u201cwellness\u201d culture. Taking care of yourself has become an individual, not a collective, endeavour. The ill effects of alcohol have been well-documented \u2013 is it any wonder that people are opting for alternatives? I do think, though, that when people ask \u201cwhy\u201d we\u2019re moving away from alcohol, what they really want to know is, \u201cHow? How have you managed it?\u201d The spotlight on us sober and sober-ish folk is so bright, I suspect, because we\u2019re still outliers: because ours is a nation of people who, for the large part, feel compelled to drink, while receiving little to no state-provided assistance in reducing their consumption, and a lot of cultural reassurance that their boozing is \u201cnormal\u201d. It\u2019s pretty clear why people don\u2019t drink \u2013 the real question is why do people continue to drink when they don\u2019t want to? Over and over again, I\u2019ve played priest in whispered confessions from smashed people who tell me they yearn to be able to cut down their drinking, but can\u2019t. Because it lubricates social situations; because they need it to manage their mental health conditions; because life in Britain is bleak and hellish and this is their one escape, OK? One thing I have learned is that those who are secure in their drinking habits don\u2019t give a fig who is or isn\u2019t drinking \u2013 and that they\u2019re far rarer than you might think. The pandemic may have seen light drinkers reduce their consumption, but at the same time, heavy drinkers increased theirs. Ten million people in England regularly exceed drinking guidelines; and cultural stigma surrounding the image of the alcoholic prevents people from seeking what help there is if they feel uneasy about their relationship with alcohol \u2013 while acting as a source of comforting denial if they have not yet reached \u201crock bottom\u201d. Instead, the burden often falls on the individual to \u201cmoderate\u201d their drinking or to simply give it up. For some of us, that is an option. For others, it is not that easy: even if they stop the act of drinking, it dominates their thoughts, as actor Tom Holland recently articulated when discussing his sobriety. In a society with a comprehensive understanding of when drinking stops being a choice and becomes a compulsion, people would feel they could reach out for more structured help, rather than struggling alone to find their way to sobriety. But I fear that such a utopia is still a long way off.

The airline reported a record pretax profit of \u00a3203m for the three months to the end of June, surpassing analysts\u2019 forecasts. This ws despite continuing disruption from strikes across Europe, including those by air traffic control managers in France. EasyJet\u2019s rivals across Europe are also expected to announce strong earnings for the past quarter. Growth in bookings is predicted to continue into the winter. The Luton-based carrier said it was seeing strong demand for its holidays, and bookings for winter trips had more than doubled compared with a year earlier. Johan Lundgren, easyJet\u2019s chief executive, said it expected to make another record pretax profit between July and September, when it will operate more than 160,000 flights. There was no sign that the heatwave was putting off holidaymakers from northern Europe from booking, he said: \u201cBritish people have gone for a long time to places like Egypt or Turkey in August, which constantly have very, very high temperatures. So it doesn\u2019t seem to be a deterrent at all for a lot of people. They are on holiday, sitting by a pool or swimming in the Mediterranean and they have air-conditioned hotels.\u201d Lundgren said the current extreme temperatures in destinations such as Italy and Greece was a reminder of the climate crisis. He said: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t think of this summer as a wake-up call [to aviation] \u2026 this realisation has been there for years. The weather we\u2019re seeing currently is just a reminder of what we probably have ahead of ourselves here, and we need to demonstrate that we can have less impact on the environment, contribute less to that, and be able to grow, and that\u2019s what we intend to do.\u201d The carrier said it was earning 23% more per seat on its aircraft compared with a year earlier, while the cost of flying its planes \u2013 not including fuel \u2013 had fallen slightly, with oil prices stabilising. Lundgren said half of the average \u00a311-per-seat fare increases was due to fuel, and profits had been driven by ancillary revenues such as seat allocation and inflight sales, as well as a 72% growth in customers in easyJet\u2019s package holidays arm. Lundgren warned of potential disruption to travel from strikes, including in air traffic control across Europe, and possible limited airspace availability. Last week easyJet cancelled 1,700 summer flights, primarily from Gatwick, potentially disrupting the holiday plans of thousands of passengers, blaming \u201cunprecedented air traffic control delays\u201d. More air traffic control strikes on mainland Europe have been threatened. This month a union at the Eurocontrol network manager operations centre gave formal warning of strikes witin the next six months. It did not name firm dates. Lundgren said strikes had not yet led to any serious disruption. \u201cThe situation is stable so it\u2019s difficult to say what this will be going forward. It\u2019s usually down to delays rather than cancellations across European networks,\u201d he said. There have been 40% more days of strikes by air traffic control managers across Europe so far this year compared with in 2019. Lundgren said easyJet was increasing its capacity over the winter."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b22347", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/20/matildas-captain-sam-kerr-out-of-world-cup-opening-matches-with-calf-injury", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Matildas captain Sam Kerr out of World Cup opening matches with calf injury", "lead": "The Australian star will miss at least first two matches of tournament after picking up calf injury at training on Wednesday", "author": "Kieran Pender at Stadium Australia", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 09:25:58", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.230625", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/6a7c791383762224c126e211c5e86a5b922fe084/0_40_4954_2974/500.jpg", "body": "The Matildas have been rocked only an hour out from their opening Women\u2019s World Cup match with news of a calf injury to talismanic captain and star striker Sam Kerr.

The New Zealand prime minister, Chris Hipkins, said the gunman was also dead and there was no national security risk or increase to the national threat level. Visiting the scene on Thursday afternoon, he confirmed that that the World Cup would go ahead as planned and people should feel safe to attend the matches. He said the shooting was a \u201cstandalone incident\u201d, but added that fans would see an enhanced police presences in and around sports venues. In a televised speech on Thursday evening, Hipkins said the whole nation was in mourning. \u201cThe victims went to work this morning as they do every morning, but they won\u2019t be coming home tonight,\u201d he said. \u201cThe trauma of this event will still be significant.\u201d The shooting began at a building site on Queen Street, Auckland\u2019s main thoroughfare, at about 7.20am, when police received reports of gunfire. Police said the gunman, armed with a pump-action shotgun, moved through the building site firing and after reaching the upper levels \u201ccontained himself within the elevator shaft\u201d. \u201cFurther shots were fired from the male and he was located deceased a short time later,\u201d police said. A police officer was shot and injured by the gunman during an exchange of fire in a lift well, but is in a stable condition and is due to have surgery. The other people injured sustained moderate to serious injuries, police said. The gunman has been identified as Matu Tangi Matua Reid, 24, who was working at the site and had a history of family violence. He was the subject of a home detention order but had an exemption to work at the site, the New Zealand police commissioner, Andrew Coster, said. \u201cThe individual is known for primarily family violence history,\u201d he said, adding that there were \u201cindications of mental health history\u201d but that there was no evidence Reid was of high lethal risk and that his previous offences had not suggested he posed this kind of threat. He did not have a firearms licence. Hipkins said authorities were investigating how the gunman acquired a firearm and whether his behaviour suggested any red flags before the shooting. The Department of Corrections is reviewing its interactions with Reid. The shooting came just hours before the opening match of the ninth Women\u2019s World Cup at Eden Park in Auckland, which saw New Zealand, the co-host, beat Norway 1-0 in an upset. A moment of silence was observed before the match, and players wore black arm bands in honour of those who had died in the shooting. The city has welcomed thousands of international players and tourists for the event, which is being co-hosted by Australia. Hipkins said he had spoken to Fifa organisers and the tournament would go ahead as planned. Police assured the public there was no continuing risk and no reason not to proceed. Fifa issued a statement saying it had been told the shooting was not related to football operations, so the opening match could \u201cproceed as planned\u201d. Several streets in Auckland were cordoned off, all ferry services into the city cancelled, while buses running through some areas of the city were on detours. The shooting took place near the Norwegian team hotel in downtown Auckland, and several players reported on social media that they were safe. The Italian team\u2019s training was delayed as players could not get out of their hotel, while the US team said all its players and staff were accounted for and safe. The Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, who is to visit Wellington next week, offered condolences to Hipkins. \u201cI\u2019ve been in contact with Chris this morning about that. And that is very sad indeed to see another dreadful shooting with fatalities here in New Zealand,\u201d he said. Auckland\u2019s mayor, Wayne Brown, told TVNZ the attack was dreadful. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t have come at a worse time given the world has its eyes on us now with the Fifa soccer thing,\u201d he said. Gun violence is rare in New Zealand, which tightened its firearm laws after a gunman killed 51 Muslim worshippers in Christchurch in 2019, the country\u2019s worst peacetime mass shooting. The government banned all military style semi-automatics and similar weapons the same year. The US forward Lynn Williams said the shooting was something she and her compatriots had dealt with \u201cfar too many times\u201d in the US, where gun violence is common. \u201cThere was definitely a sense of, \u2018Let\u2019s come together\u2019. We still have a job to do. But also recognising that there was lives lost and that is very real and very devastating,\u201d said Williams.

These individuals may be party members or even Liberal-aligned people in the community.\u201d The FEC, led by Liberal operative Alex Dore, is hoping to preselect a candidate for the seat, on Sydney\u2019s northern beaches, before November. The latest possible date that the Albanese government could choose to hold the election is in May 2025. From within the Liberal stable, the controversial former candidate Katherine Deves has been floated as a chance to run again, as has barrister Jane Buncle, who withdrew her nomination ahead of the 2022 election. Neither responded to requests for comment on Thursday. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup A senior Warringah Liberal member argued a \u201cteal-style\u201d scheme \u2013 to open the process for expressions of interest \u2013 this far out from the next polling day was being driven by \u201cdesperation\u201d in a now \u201cunwinnable\u201d seat. \u201cThey\u2019ve gone from one extreme kneejerk to another,\u201d they said. \u201cIt\u2019s problematic if it\u2019s too early because people have jobs and other responsibilities. There is a sweet spot and this isn\u2019t it.\u201d The local said many within the party underestimated the strength of Steggall, insisting \u201chubris and arrogance\u201d were rife in the seat once held by the former prime minister Tony Abbott. A preselection date is yet to be finalised but party seniors believed the state executive would endorse a date aligned with Dutton\u2019s wish to have candidates in all winnable seats \u2013 other than Cook \u2013 by 31 October. Multiple senior New South Wales Liberals say the party needed to avoid the \u201cshambolic\u201d preselection processes that affected Scott Morrison\u2019s campaign in 2022, but that starting it this early was not in the party\u2019s best interest. One described it as \u201cprescriptive and heavy-handed\u201d. One senior Liberal claimed it would \u201cdrastically reduce the quality [of] people who would nominate\u201d, while another said there was the chance the party \u201cwon\u2019t get a superstar candidate\u201d. \u201cBut, the counter is being in the field for 12 or more months gives them an opportunity to doorknock and get them well-known in the community and run a grassroots campaign,\u201d one Liberal said. Another concern expressed about the early preselection process was that it might force candidates into revealing their stance on the voice, \u201cwhich could have ramifications depending on the way the referendum goes\u201d. Some within the party believe the early preselection edict was part of a federal plot designed to see the NSW branch fail to meet deadlines, giving the national executive cover to mount a 2022-style intervention, handing Dutton more power. While it appears likely the state executive will preselect most candidates in line with the timeframe, some want the party to settle on a third way \u2013 agreeing to preselection deadlines that would have candidates endorsed by June 2024. \u201cIf we get the tip that Labor\u2019s going running early, we can bring the timelines forward,\u201d another senior Liberal said. \u201cTwo years is a very long time to run a campaign.\u201d Preselection nominations closed this week for a number of key seats, with challengers for two of Scott Morrison\u2019s allies, Alex Hawke and Melissa McIntosh, and two other senior federal Liberals \u2013 the deputy leader, Sussan Ley, and the manager of opposition business, Paul Fletcher."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b2234a", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/20/new-zealands-norway-womens-world-cup-match-report", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "New Zealand\u2019s Hannah Wilkinson stuns Norway in Women\u2019s World Cup opener", "lead": "New Zealand kicked off the tournament with their first win at a Women\u2019s World Cup, Hannah Wilkinson\u2019s goal just after half-time sinking Norway", "author": "Jeff Kassouf at Eden Park", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 09:21:59", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.230683", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/1ca3d720cb2ccf3757d0f9508d0c293ac2a7b1f9/90_62_2672_1604/500.jpg", "body": "New Zealand\u2019s initial goals for the Women\u2019s World Cup were extremely modest by the standards of a host country: winning a game would be progress. Mission accomplished. Hannah Wilkinson\u2019s goal in the 48th minute proved decisive on Thursday as New Zealand defeated Norway in Auckland in the opening match of the tournament. \u201cIt\u2019s the best night of my life,\u201d the New Zealand captain, Ali Riley, said. \u201cWith the performance, we deserved it. I know we came in as underdogs, I know there was a lot of doubt, a lot of articles being written saying how many times we haven\u2019t won a game, but we believed in ourselves the whole time.\u201d New Zealand had failed to win in 15 previous World Cup finals matches, exiting in the group stage in all five appearances. Thursday\u2019s victory provides hope that the country, which is co-hosting the World Cup with Australia, can taste knockout football for the first time. A crowd of 42,137 \u2013 a record for a soccer match, men\u2019s or women\u2019s, in New Zealand \u2013 that included the prime minister, Chris Hipkins, was buzzing from the opening ceremony. The energy stood in stark contrast to the grim mood around Auckland earlier in the day after the deaths of three people, including the gunman, in a shooting that took place close to Norway\u2019s team hotel. CJ Bott said: \u201cWhat happened this morning was devastating and it\u2019s news no one wants to wake up to, and our condolences go out to those that have been hurt by this. It definitely motivated us.\u201d On the field New Zealand played direct from the start, looking for Wilkinson in behind the seams of Norway\u2019s unsteady defence. The strategy paid off three minutes after half-time. New Zealand needed three touches of the ball from a goal kick to break down Norway\u2019s shape and play Jacqui Hand in behind. She had Mathilde Harviken for pace,and Wilkinson streaked past two other defenders to tap in the cross. New Zealand tried that clipped, short goal-kick to the right on multiple occasions before it paid off. \u201cWe knew Norway were going to try to track us on the left and often when it was played to me, Ada [Hegerberg] was running right at me,\u201d said the New Zealand defender Katie Bowen, who took the goal-kick. \u201cI just said to our keeper like, do you want to just try it? Do you want me to take it? I was doing the secret whatever [covers mouth]. I just hit it, CJ [Bott] had a great touch and it ended in a great goal. Absolute elation.\u201d Despite a surplus of attacking talent, Norway asked few questions of New Zealand\u2019s defence. Hegerberg, the former Ballon d\u2019Or winner, attempted (and scuffed) a bicycle kick five minutes in, but Norway failed to produce a shot on target until the 81st minute, when Tuva Hansen\u2019s shot was tipped off the crossbar by Victoria Esson. Hansen\u2019s opportunity came following a rare moment of joy for Norway in transition. New Zealand\u2019s Ria Percival controlled the middle of the park as the hosts neutralised Barcelona\u2019s Caroline Graham Hansen and Chelsea\u2019s Guro Reiten. \u201cOpening game, they are the hosts: We have talked about this,\u201d Reiten said. \u201cWe knew they were going go out there and be aggressive. We knew exactly how they wanted to play, but still, we were so poor, especially in that first half. I\u2019m very disappointed.\u201d Percival hit the crossbar from the penalty spot in the 90th minute after a video review \u2013 including the first in-stadium referee explanation of the tournament \u2013 determined that Hansen had handled the ball in the area. Reiten lamented Norway\u2019s flat performance, saying \u201ceverything\u201d went wrong while the holding midfielder Ingrid Engen pointed to New Zealand\u2019s ability to win duels in the middle of the park and cut off service to Norway\u2019s talented forwards. That was a testament to Bowen, Riley and the rest of the backline. \u201cNo secret, it was a team performance,\u201d Bowen said. \u201cI know that I was able to get up Ada\u2019s ass but I knew that I had cover behind me. Ali Riley did a great job against Graham Hansen, but everybody did their jobs around the park and ultimately that led to the 1-0 win.\u201d The next task for the Football Ferns is getting out of the group, which no Women\u2019s World Cup host has previously failed to do and this victory gives them hope in arguably the weakest of the eight groups at this tournament. \u201cThe expectations, we will put those on ourselves first,\u201d Wilkinson said. \u201cWe\u2019ll take momentum from this first win into the next game. It\u2019s incredibly important that we secure a space outside of this group and we can do that in this next game.\u201d At least for Thursday night, however, they will celebrate. Moments after the final whistle Riley walked across the field with her hands covering her face as she sobbed tears of joy. As she got to the sideline, she briefly put her hand on her heart and waved at the crowd before bending over, hands covering her face again, to collect herself before turning to the camera for a TV interview. As she did, her teammates \u2013 led by Wilkinson hopping and pumping her fist \u2013 did a lap around the fabled stadium to wave at the crowd. Among those in attendance were a number of former New Zealand players who, talented as they were, never managed to achieve what this current group did here: win a World Cup game. \u201cI wasn\u2019t playing for me; I was playing for them,\u201d Riley said. \u201cI was playing for the Ferns that came before us and to inspire the Ferns that will come after me. It meant so much for all of us. \u201cWe put so much pressure on ourselves because it wasn\u2019t just about winning a game, it was about inspiring our entire country. With what happened this morning, trying to do something positive today and honour the first responders. That\u2019s a lot, and I felt like we did it.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b2234b", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2023/jul/20/new-zealand-v-norway-womens-world-cup-2023-group-a-live-updates-scores-nz-vs-nor-start-time-kick-off-results-eden-park-first-game", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "New Zealand 1-0 Norway: Women\u2019s World Cup 2023 Group A \u2013 as it happened", "lead": "<strong>Minute-by-minute report</strong>: The Football Ferns stunned Norway on a historic night at Eden Park in Auckland thanks to Hannah Wilkinson\u2019s goal", "author": "Mike Hytner (now) and Jo Khan (earlier)", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 09:14:12", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.230700", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/0784a4f99a3e3154d16f5c8194cdd30233a288a7/0_112_3363_2018/500.jpg", "body": "And with that, I\u2019ll try to catch my breathe (it\u2019s going to be hard, with the Matildas about to kick off their tournament in Sydney minus Sam Kerr). But what an opening match this one was \u2013 a classic that will be remember in New Zealand for many a year to come. Thanks for joining me and Jo. Time to turn your attention to Jonathan Howcroft\u2019s minute-by-minute account of the game in Sydney, here: And stay tuned for our match report from Eden Park, which will land once Jeff Kassouf has had time to take in all the drama. Bye from me! Incredible scenes in Auckland. What a result. Not many would have picked that one before this evening, but there you go. Football, bloody hell. New Zealand were good for their win \u2013 they fended off Norwegian attacks in the first half before enjoying the better of the second and delivering a knock-out blow through Hannah Wilkinson. Her name will now deservedly enter Eden Park folklore. For Norway, it couldn\u2019t be a worse start. They were disjointed and didn\u2019t know how to deal with the Ferns\u2019 second half display. Perhaps they will count themselves unlucky that Hansen\u2019s effort struck the bar and didn\u2019t nestle in the roof of the net, but they also benefitted from a slice of good fortune, with Percival missing a chance to seal victory from the penalty spot. 90+10 mins: When is this going to end? Now! There it is! All over in Auckland! New Zealand stun Norway to win their first World Cup game! 90+9 mins: We\u2019re pretty much there now. Tension fills the air at Eden Park. The ball falls into the grateful arms of Esson! She\u2019ll take her time in thumping the ball downfield. 90+8 mins: Chance for Norway! Hegerberg stabs the ball to Reiten, but she can\u2019t apply a finishing touch from close range! 90+7 mins: New Zealand are just looking to run the clock down now. That\u2019s all they have to do. The whistles are already coming from the stands \u2013 the crowd want this one to end. 90+6 mins: Meanwhile, over in Sydney, big big news before the other opening night game \u2013 Australia\u2019s Sam Kerr will not play against Ireland after having been ruled out with a calf injury. Get the latest with our other live blog: 90+5 mins: Gabi Rennie comes on as New Zealand make another change. 90+4 mins: Still New Zealand hang on. 90+2 mins: Bjelde has a problem here and will have to be replaced by Anna Josendal. She\u2019s down on the floor, but her teammates can\u2019t wait \u2013 they pick her up themselves and run her off the pitch, before dumping on the sideline! No time for niceties at this point! 90+1 mins: Not quite sure where nine minutes came from. 90 mins: What drama late in the game! And it\u2019s not over yet \u2013 nine minutes of injury time to be played! 89 mins: NO! Percival hits the post! Mikalsen was beaten, but the ball strikes the upright! Such are the margins! 88 mins: What a moment for New Zealand! Percival will have the chance to seal victory for the Football Ferns! 86 mins: Another penalty check! Another handball shout, against Tuva Hansen! Play stalls, and the eyes of a nation are on the referee as she watches her screen. It\u2019s a Bott cross into the box that is stopped by the arm of Hansen. And it\u2019s given! PENALTY TO NEW ZEALAND! 85 mins: The first yellow card of the night is dished out to substitute Haavi. And another change now: goalscorer Wilkinson departs to a tremendous roar from the crowd, what a performance from her. On comes Paige Satchell in her place. 84 mins: I reckon this is going to be one-way traffic for the final six minutes now. That strike against the bar has really given Norway hope. 83 mins: The corner comes across, but it goes all the way through without any touch from a player. That\u2019s disappointing from Norway, and will give New Zealand a chance to breathe. 82 mins: Corner to Norway now. And all of a sudden, New Zealand\u2019s lead looks rather fragile. Can they hang on? 81 mins: Off the bar! Hansen smacks the woodwork with a superb long-range strike, with Esson well beaten! 80 mins: Hansen intercepts a Steinmetz ball forward and Norway can come forward now. They\u2019re by no means finished here, by the way. \u201cWhat an opening game this has been and the referee really deserves credit for playing her role in making it as good as it is,\u201d Luke Pierce emails in. It\u2019s a good point. The ref has really allowed the game to flow, but also retained control. 77 mins: Percival! Oooh! So close to a second for the Football Ferns! She strikes it sweetly from the edge of the box and it flies just wide of the upright. 75 mins: Into the last quarter of an hour and we\u2019re getting very close to history being made. The crowd attendance is announced: 42,137. That\u2019s a big crowd for New Zealand and sets a record for any football match in the country \u2013 men\u2019s or women\u2019s. 74 mins: Back to the football. Actually, not just yet. Another change first: Manchester United\u2019s Vilde Boe Risa comes on for Norway. She\u2019s one of 108 players at this World Cup who play in England, the TV commentators have just said. 71 mins: \u201cI\u2019m confused by Norway,\u201d writes in K\u00e1ri Tulinius. \u201cOn paper they should be one of the contenders for the title, but their play lacks fluency and is all too predictable for the New Zealand defence. I worry they\u2019ll have another disappointing tournament, like last year\u2019s Euros.\u201d Far from their best performance tonight. 70 mins: A reader email, from friend of the live blog Phil Withall! \u201cIt seems pretty much my luck, having got used to missing sporting events due to the time difference meaning I\u2019m asleep when they happen, I\u2019m now in the position where I miss most of the World Cup in Australia/New Zealand due to work commitments.\u201d Sorry to hear that Phil. \u201cOnce again the Guardian MBM is my saviour (both footballing and cricketing versions) I thank you.\u201d Glad to be of service Phil. 69 mins: New Zealand make their first change: Claudia Bunge of Melbourne Victory comes on to replace the popular Stott. 66 mins: Hassett now heads off on another forward run. Nothing comes of it but New Zealand really are impressive going forward. Haavi tries to make a difference for Norway again, but her cross-shot from the Norway left bounces on top of the Football Ferns net. 64 mins: Down the other end, and some brief respite for Norway as Haavi hammers an effort goalwards, but it never reaches its intended target as Percival bravely puts her body on the line. 63 mins: Still New Zealand press forward. This time Bott has a shooting chance, but her standing leg slides on the turf and her shot bounces harmlessly wide. She allows herself a rueful grin. 62 mins: Here come New Zealand again, Hand goes over but the ball finds Riley, who curls a beauty that seems destined to hit the back of the net until Mikelsen dives across and tips over the bar for a corner! 61 mins: Wilkinson fires off a shot, a bit speculative this time, and it\u2019s wide of Mikalsen\u2019s goal. 60 mins: An hour gone, and New Zealand\u2019s Football Ferns lead, against all-pre-match wisdom. Not only that, but they\u2019ve looked good for their lead. Wilkinson up front in particular is causing problems. 59 mins: Oh dear! A great opportunity falls Maanum\u2019s way, but she can\u2019t capitalise! A stabbed effort from in front of goal goes wide, and a great chance is spurned. 57 mins: A bit more detail below on goalscorer and current Golden Boot leader Hannah Wilkinson. 56 mins: Here\u2019s a first change for Norway, who really have to do something if they are to turn this tide. Off goes Blakstad, on comes Emilie Haavi of Roma. 55 mins: Hand again gets past Harviken, who\u2019s under the cosh at the moment. The Fern hits the deck in the box and the ball runs out of play. No penalty though, and Norway breathe a sigh of relief. 54 mins: The ball does hit Harviken\u2019s arm, but only after it deflects up off her leg, so no penalty. That could have been disastrous for Norway! Play continues, still 1-0 to New Zealand. 53 mins: Hang on, what have we got here? Looks like a check for a penalty! There\u2019s a bit of confusion, but yes, there\u2019s some consultation for a penalty \u2013 a possible hand ball in the Norway box! 52 mins: Wilkinson is proving a handful for the Norway defence and it\u2019s all New Zealand at the moment! 50 mins: Still New Zealand attack. Bott sends over a deep cross after a corner is played all the way back to near the halfway line. Riley gets the ball and again takes on her marker\u2026 beats her marker again, but again runs out of turf and the ball goes behind for a goal kick. 49 mins: Hannah Wilkinson scores first goal of this World Cup and what a goal it is, on a day of such emotion in Auckland. New Zealand are on track to win their first ever game at a World Cup. Norway, meanwhile are shellshocked. 48 mins: Incredible! What a start to the second half! New Zealand take the lead after a Wilkinson sends Eden Park into delerium! Hand breaks away down the right hand side and her cross is inch perfect for Wilkinson who just has to tap home! 46 mins: It\u2019ll be interesting to see how long Norway keep with the current line-up before making any changes. We\u2019re back under way. No changes for either side to tell you about at the break. Well, that didn\u2019t go quite according to plan for Norway, with New Zealand belying their underdog status with a terrific first-half performance of defensive vigour and no little attacking clout. Norway, of course, remain dangerous going forward, but a few moments of defensive uncertainty will be of concern. An intriguing second half awaits. Stick with us. 45+1 mins: Nothing comes of it, and that will be that for the first half. 45 mins: Wilkinson muscles her way through the Norwegian defence, until a perfectly-timed tackle from Bjelde prevents her from getting a shot away. Still, a corner to New Zealand! 44 mins: It\u2019s all New Zealand at the moment. Norway are struggling to get the ball clear as the first half draws to a close. 43 mins: Still New Zealand press on the front foot. Reilly does really well to keep the ball alive down near the corner flag, she lays it back to Bott who delivers the ball into the box with her left foot. It\u2019s decent, but just slightly overhit this time. 41 mins: Corner to New Zealand now\u2026 Percival pings it across but it\u2019s easily cleared by a Norway head. 39 mins: Here come New Zealand. Wilkinson plays it wide to Reilly, but her foray forward is ended by a physical challenge that the ref deems fair (the majority of the crowd don\u2019t agree, perhaps unsurprisingly). 37 mins: Bott and Hansen collide, but it\u2019s a fair shoulder charge from the Norway player, and it\u2019ll be a Norway throw. 35 mins: Oh! best chance of the game! Graham-Hansen turns on the after-burners down the right before playing the ball inside to Hegerberg, but Stott is there to make a crucial block! 34 mins: New Zealand have done very well so far; they\u2019ve defended resolutely but also enjoyed moments of their own going forward. And the Norway defence has, at times, failed to convince. 32 mins: From the resulting free-kick, Bowen delivers the ball towards Wilkinson at the back stick. She\u2019s unmarked but her header back across the face of goal is too close to Mikalsen and the keeper claims comfortably. 31 mins: Blakstad is pulled up for another Norwegian foul and she\u2019s given what seems like a final warning from the referee. A card is likely the next time she steps out of line. 30 mins: Riley does well on the New Zealand right, as she dances past Engen, who is caught a bit flat-footed. But she ends up running the ball out of play. Shame, as that was a lovely bit of skill. 28 mins: More neat passing from Norway\u2026 it ends up with Blakstad on the left, and after a one-two off the unwitting Riley, she sends over a cross. It\u2019s easy enough for Esson in the New Zealand goal to claim though. 27 mins: Oh that\u2019s nice from Norway\u2026 a neat exchange of passes and headers involving four players. Nice, but doesn\u2019t get them anywhere. 26 mins: Just over halfway through the first half and it\u2019s still goalless. No real clear-cut chances to speak of, and New Zealand have held their own so far against a much more fancied opponent. 24 mins: What a run by Steinmetz! She brings the ball out of the back and as things open up for her, she just keeps on going, and going, until she overruns it slightly and the move breaks down. The crowd respond! 22 mins: The referee has a word with Guro Reiten, after the Chelsea star is pulled up for a third Norwegian foul in quick succession. A sign of a bit of frustration creeping in? 20 mins: They\u2019re praising CJ Bott on the telly and rightly so. The Leicester City defender has been heavily involved at right-back so far, and not much has got past her. 19 mins: Great play now from Blakstad, who crosses towards Hegerberg. The former Ballon d\u2019Or winner nods down with precision to Maanum, but she skies over the bar! Well worked, and unlucky not to open the scoring there. 18 mins: Norway manage to get clear eventually and Graham-Hansen wins a corner, from which Hegerberg rises high but can\u2019t direct the ball goalwards. 17 mins: Nothing comes of it for New Zealand, but they keep the ball in the Norway half and Bott\u2019s eventual ball into the box causes more consternation. It nearly falls kindly for Hassett as the Norwegian defence dithers again! 16 mins: Bowen sends over a free-kick to the far post\u2026 Blakstad reckons she hasn\u2019t touched it, but the ball runs out for a corner. 15 mins: A word on the crowd \u2013 it\u2019s difficult to tell for sure from the TV pictures, but it certainly looks like a decent-sized crowd at Eden Park. 14 mins: Here come Norway, a long ball punted forward, but that\u2019s not going to work. It bounces all the way through to Esson in the Football Ferns goal. 12 mins: Seeing that Hegerberg is in the action, why not take a look at her player profile? 11 mins: It opens up for Hassett after a lovely ball through from Stott, but her shot on goal is well blocked by Harviken! 10 mins: Reilly wins a free-kick now after a muscular challenge from Hegerberg (who is heavily involved at the moment, as you would expect her to be). 8 mins: This game is being played at a hectic pace so far. New Zealand, searching for their first World Cup win of course, are not overawed by the occasion so far and they\u2019re giving Norway as good as they\u2019ve got going forward to this point. 7 mins: Moments later Hegerberg gives another indication of her immense talent with an acrobatic bicycle kick. She mis-times it this time, but 10 out of 10 for vision. 6 mins: Back down to the other end, and Hegerberg hares off on a run of her own down the left-hand side again. Her ball into the box finds\u2026 no one. There isn\u2019t a single white shirt there and the move breaks down. 5 mins: Ohh, but what\u2019s this! Wilkinson storms clear down the inside right channel\u2026 she just takes one touch too many and with the angle too tight, she can\u2019t get a shot off that will test Mikalsen in the Norway goal. The 2015 champions make a hash of clearing their lines though, and there\u2019s a moment of panic before they do eventually get it clear! 4 mins: New Zealand are struggling to get out of their own half at this point though. Norway are pressing high when not in possession. 3 mins: Hegerberg on the Norway left now is held up, but the visitors retain possession and end it winning a throw. Still Norway press down the left-hand side. Eventually the ball is put out and it\u2019ll be a throw for the Football Ferns, to be taken by CJ Bott. 2 mins: Frida Maanum tries a nifty little flick early on, but it doesn\u2019t come off this time, as Norway\u2019s attacking intent is put on show early on. 1 min: New Zealand get us going! So, here we go then. Years of waiting have come to this point. The pre-match is finally done, the teams are ready, the ref has her whistle in her mouth\u2026 strap yourselves in for a month of football. And the Women\u2019s World Cup in this year of 2023 is under way! Nearly there. But now time for a minute\u2019s silence in memory of the two people who lost their lives earlier this morning in Auckland city centre. Time for a quick team picture for the Football Ferns before a toss of the coin and an exchange of pennants in the centre circle. New Zealand are in all black, Norway in all white. The VAR room is all set \u2013 don\u2019t forget we have that video technology available this tournament. Eden Park looks sensational from an aerial shot with the lights on, the teams on the pitch, huge flags next to them. We\u2019re getting through the anthems. Norway first, sang lustily by their players. New Zealand follow, plenty of smiles on the faces of their players. Prime minister Chris Hipkins is in the crowd. Thanks Jo. Brilliant stuff, teeing this all up over the past couple of hours. It may have been brief, by Olympic standards at least, but that was a decent opening ceremony in my opinion. Poignant given today\u2019s news, but also a celebration of this event, as it should be. Just 10 minutes to go to the big kick-off. The World Cup trophy is making its entrance onto the pitch. It takes its place on a pink plinth, and will be followed by the teams shortly. The briefest of opening ceremonies! On that note I will hand over to Mike Hytner who will take you through this opening game between New Zealand and Norway minute by minute. Thanks for starting the Women\u2019s World Cup with me. It\u2019s anthem time! Mallrat and Benee are getting the crowd pumped up with their official song Do It Again. There\u2019s a small group of dancers for each country in the tournament, and we\u2019re getting a bit of a montage each team\u2019s star players. The players have retreated back into their rooms and the lights go down at Eden Park. M\u0101ori and First Nations dancers and singers take to the centre of the pitch. The stands are filling, faces are painted, signs are written. You love to see it! Suzy Wrack spoke to Norway\u2019s Ada Hegeberg about the battle female footballers face and her hopes for the team after their Euros 202 flop. 23 Aurora Mikalsen 4 Tuva Hansen 6 Maren Mjelde 13 Thea Bjelde 16 Mathilde Harviken 7 Ingrid Engen 11 Guro Reiten 18 Frida Maanum 10 Caroline Hansen 14 Ada Hegerberg 17 Julie Blakstad Teams are live!

The coach, the star, the rising star, their World Cup hopes. Here is everything you need to know about the Football Ferns. They look like they are having fun already! The New Zealand All Blacks have a message for the Football Ferns ahead of their match! With the biggest Women\u2019s World Cup due to start in under an hour, it\u2019s worth remembering where everything started for this tournament. It hasn\u2019t been the smoothest road, but there have been some incredible moments in its relatively short history. Look no further than David Squires\u2019 extremely educational cartoon on the matter. New Zealand may have the home advantage but you can be sure Norway fans will be out in force too. I\u2019ll update you with the starting XI when it comes through. In the meantime do take a look at our extensive team guides. Last year\u2019s humiliating Euros exit hasn\u2019t dampened expectations for a team who look more solid under new coach Hege Riise This interactive guide to all 736 players in the tournament is simply phenomenal. Details on every player have been contributed by a global network of experts. Get to know every single squad member at the tournament. The Football Ferns have arrived at Eden Park and have hit the pitch to warm up. If, unlike me, you are calm and composed enough to focus on anything other than these two opening games \u2026 maybe have a go at this quiz: ONE HOUR TO GO! We inch closer to kick off. Can New Zealand get their first World Cup win? Fans of the Football Ferns are making their way into Eden Park. Indigenous cultures are at the forefront of this Women\u2019s World Cup. You will have noticed every host city has dual names \u2013 one being the English placename and the other in the language of the traditional owners of the land the city sits on. The game in New Zealand tonight is in Auckland / T\u0101maki Makaurau, and if you\u2019re lucky enough to be at Eden Park you may be able to get your hands on a poi. Want to see the Matildas? Get in quick \u2026 While we\u2019re getting ready for the first whistle, let me introduce you to some of the Guardian team who are covering the World Cup. A few I have mentioned already: Suzy Wrack is bringing you all things England. She has been travelling with the Lionesses to their pre-tournament camp and home base, and will be on the ground in Brisbane when they play their opening game against Haiti on 22 July. You can find her on Twitter @SuzyWrack. Women\u2019s football writer and founder of the The Equalizer, Jeff Kassouf, is in New Zealand following the USWNT for the Guardian. He has written this thorough preview on the team chasing an unprecedented third consecutive World Cup trophy. Follow @JeffKassouf on Twitter for updates from New Zealand. Lapping up the home soil atmosphere in Australia is Kieran Pender with the latest from the Matildas camp as well as their games in Group B. As the tournament rolls on we will have more coverage from Jonathan Liew, former Matilda Joey Peters, former England international Anita Asante and more. OK first prediction is in from Kurt who is predicting USA over Brazil in the final. \u201cUSWNT all the way! Despite injuries and inexperience the USWNT will win their third Fifa Women\u2019s World Cup. They\u2019ll win group E, defeat Sweden (managed by former USWNT manager Pia Sundhage) in the round of 16, kick Italy in their boot in the quarter-final, fish fry Norway in the semi-final &amp; beat up Brazil in the final.\u201d Love the confidence Kurt! Our writers have offered their views on how the tournament will pan out. There\u2019s a suspiciously high number of votes for Australia and Sam Kerr. Can the co-hosts capitalise on their home advantage and run of excellent form? Jonathan Liew and Suzy Wrack say yes \u2026 so that\u2019s that then I guess. It\u2019s just after 6.30am in the UK (I think) and I\u2019ve got a message from Melanie in Jersey. \u201cFootball at breakfast, what\u2019s not to like! \u201cReally looking to seeing how England cope with some key players missing, but there is a depth in the squad that offers lots of choice. I think the Lionesses can go all the way!\u201d Thanks for getting in touch Melanie! Tickets might have been slow to shift at first in New Zealand but it seems fans are ready to get behind the Football Ferns now. Hit me with your predictions! How do you think the 2023 Women\u2019s World Cup will unfold? Some Guardian readers have given their verdict on how the teams will go. What do you think? Can the USA make it three in a row? Will veterans Christine Sinclair and Marta take Canada and Brazil all the way? Who are the dark horses? Let me know: email or tweet @_jokhan. The view from Australia is quite different. The national women\u2019s team, the Matildas, are a Top 10 team and one of the most loved sport teams in the country. Unless Fifa release some last minute tickets to the three Matildas group games you will be lucky to find one \u2013 they were snapped up fast. After couple of hours after New Zealand\u2019s opening game in Auckland today Australia will face the Republic of Ireland in front of about 75,000 fans \u2013 a record home crowd for them. As Guardian Australia\u2019s sport reporter, Jack Snape, writes, international sporting events are very much part of the culture. Plus, they have Sam Kerr. Our Matildas correspondent Kieran Pender is on his way to Stadium Australia for the second game of the night. Looks like the atmosphere is building in Auckland but the word on the ground was New Zealand was moving a bit slower to catch up with the hype. Ticket sales were lagging behind those across the ditch in Australia, although it looks like the opening game between the Football Ferns and Norway is close to sold out! Gabi Lardies spoke to some of the key operators in women\u2019s football in the country about the lead-up. It\u2019s still early but fans are starting to make their way into Eden Park. There\u2019s a few things to get through before the football. Fun things, of course! The party starts in Auckland / T\u0101maki Makaurau at New Zealand\u2019s national stadium, Eden Park. Fifa have been pretty tight-lipped on what exactly we can expect before this opening game, but here is what we know so far. The headline act will be a performance by Mallrat and BENEE of their official Women\u2019s World Cup anthem: Do It Again. Thoughts on the song? Eden Park is most often home to rugby and tonight the New Zealand M\u0101ori All Blacks will perform a haka. There will also be various pieces from the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, and a poem about the power of football read by a group of children. I\u2019ll bring you everything from Eden Park as it happens. It seems the Matildas have their preparation for their opener against Ireland sorted. I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s any better way to quiet the nerves than pat a puppy. Let me set the scene a bit more. This tournament will be the biggest Women\u2019s World Cup ever. Ticket sales are on their way to 1.4m and have already surpassed the previous record. Fifa branding is dripping from inanimate objects in every host city. The Guardian\u2019s football writer Suzy Wrack has flown in from the UK to follow the progress of England\u2019s Lionesses, and she\u2019s also taken the pre-tournament temperature. I think it\u2019s fair to say football fever has taken hold. Hello and welcome! Are we ready for this? The Women\u2019s World Cup is finally here. It\u2019s been just over three years since Australia and New Zealand won the bid to host the 2023 tournament, and tonight both nations will be tested on and off the pitch. My name is Jo Khan and I am very excited to be kicking off our live coverage today. If you had described this moment to young Jo when she laced up her first pair of football boots more than two decades ago she just wouldn\u2019t have believed you. A record-breaking Women\u2019s World Cup in Australia and New Zealand? No way. But here we are! Festivities are one thing, but the opening day took a sombre turn this morning with news of a fatal shooting in Auckland / T\u0101maki Makaurau, where things will soon kick-off. As my colleague Jeff Kassouf said, it\u2019s a reminder that everything is relative. Millions of people around the world may be gearing up to celebrate women\u2019s football today, but this morning three people died and six were injured not far from where that celebration will begin. New Zealand and Fifa officials confirmed the opening game will go ahead as planned, and players from the teams based around the area (the US, the Philippines, Italy, Norway and New Zealand) expressed sadness but assured fans they were OK. And so, it begins. In two hours\u2019 time the Football Ferns will play Norway at Eden Park. Please get in touch and tell me how you are kicking off your World Cup spectating. Where are you tuning in from? What\u2019s the vibe at the stadium, at the pub, in your living room? Send me an email or tweet @_jokhan."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b2234c", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jul/20/nigel-farage-praises-swift-intervention-ministers-closed-coutts-account", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Nigel Farage praises \u2018swift\u2019 intervention by ministers over closed Coutts account", "lead": "Ex-Ukip leader welcomes prospect of law to stop bank account closures due to customers\u2019 political views", "author": "Aubrey Allegretti Chief political correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 09:12:03", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.230718", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/884ba31160b1344d877b9afdc32c9c451f9f53d7/0_180_5568_3341/500.jpg", "body": "Nigel Farage has praised a \u201cswift\u201d intervention by government ministers after reports that new laws could be drawn up to stop banks closing customers\u2019 accounts because they disagree with their political views. The former Ukip leader said MPs were \u201cbeginning to realise that this system is coming for them as well\u201d after his bank accounts were closed by Coutts, he says because his views \u201cdid not align with\u201d its values. Ministers are considering legislation to protect free speech by threatening banks with losing their licences if they blacklist people with controversial views, according to the Times. Farage said it was \u201cone of the swiftest interventions I\u2019ve seen by government for many, many years\u201d, and suggested it was a problem that had been \u201cbuilding up for years and years and years\u201d. \u201cEvery MP will know of constituents, small businessmen and women, who\u2019ve literally been shut down by their banks with no reason given whatsoever,\u201d he told PA Media. \u201cI also think that because of the politically exposed persons (PEP) rule, I think they\u2019re beginning to realise that this system is coming for them as well.\u201d Those designated a PEP are typically political representatives and their family members, whose accounts can be treated with extra due diligence by financial institutions. Farage claimed there was \u201ca real sense of anger\u201d among the public, who bailed out banks during the 2008 financial crisis, that now such banks could \u201ctreat us with contempt\u201d. The closure of Farage\u2019s accounts sparked outrage among senior Tory MPs, who have put pressure on Coutts and its owner, NatWest. The prime minister, Rishi Sunak, intervened in the row on Wednesday to say it was \u201cwrong\u201d and that \u201cno one should be barred from using basic services for their political views\u201d. The Treasury will announce plans as soon as next week to protect against further sudden closures of politically associated people\u2019s accounts, according to the Times. Options being considered include extending the notice time given to customers to close their accounts from one month to three months, and forcing banks to explain why the accounts are being closed, with an appeal process built in. Farage said as well as his own trouble with Coutts, he had been left \u201creally angry\u201d that several family members had been refused bank accounts or had them closed. \u201cIt\u2019s tough enough for individuals to go into public life and take the stigma that goes with it,\u201d he told PA. \u201cBut if it\u2019s now going to have a huge effect on your family and close friends, why would anybody of any calibre want to go into public life in our country? I mean, this really matters.\u201d The politician turned broadcaster revealed several weeks ago that Coutts had shut his accounts with no explanation. This week he obtained a 40-page dossier from Coutts, using a subject access request, to gain information about the decision. According to MailOnline, to which he handed the documents, the bank mentioned his retweet of a Ricky Gervais joke about trans women and his friendship with the unvaccinated tennis player Novak Djokovic to flag concerns that Farage was \u201cxenophobic and racist\u201d. The BBC, citing \u201cpeople familiar with Coutts\u2019s move\u201d, had previously suggested Farage fell below the financial threshold needed to hold an account with Coutts. The Telegraph said the BBC report came a day after the BBC business editor, Simon Jack, sat next to the NatWest chief executive, Dame Alison Rose, at a charity dinner. Asked for comment, the BBC pointed to its own reporting of the story."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b2234d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/20/a-spanish-test-and-an-attacking-explosion-our-writers-us-world-cup-predictions", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "A Spanish test and an attacking explosion: our writers\u2019 US World Cup predictions", "lead": "The defending champions are looking to win a third successive title.

Rose Lavelle. The team\u2019s creative No 10 hasn\u2019t played a competitive match in three months due to a lingering injury but was selected with the expectation that she\u2019s healthy enough to deal with stingy defensive teams. If she can perform near her usual level, she will unlock the rest of an already potent attack. JK Lindsey Horan. The only player in the squad not to play Stateside, Horan is coming off a title-winning season in France with Lyon. An excellent midfielder and a proven leader, she will be the driving force as the Americans try for the three-peat. SCM Alex Morgan. The USWNT usually have experience to burn, but this time around, the forward corps is startlingly callow. Sophia Smith and Trinity Rodman will surely be effective, and there\u2019s always supersub Megan Rapinoe to take 80th-minute set-pieces, but Morgan will need to set the tone and make sure Vlatko Andonovski doesn\u2019t regret omitting Ashley Hatch, the US player with the second-best resume in the No 9 spot. BD Naomi Girma. She has melded herself into the national team so effortlessly that it would be easy to overlook the huge role the defender is about to play. But with uncertainty in the midfield in front of her, and long-time captain Becky Sauerbrunn out injured, Girma will need to step up in the toughest moments. MS Unheralded player to watch ... \u201cUnheralded\u201d is a difficult term to use for any United States player, but one name lost among the stars is Emily Fox. Most full-backs like to push high and wide. In contrast, Fox shifts into central midfield to overload the area. She\u2019s also very good defensively and agile enough to get up and down the field frequently. JK Naomi Girma. Before the last World Cup, the team faced doubts about their lack of depth at the back. But this tournament, they have Girma. The Californian, who was the NWSL\u2019s Rookie of the Year and Defender of the Year last season, may be the breakout star of the entire tournament. SCM Outside the USWNT, Nigeria\u2019s Asisat Oshoala although maybe \u201cunheralded\u201d is the wrong word for a player who has been nominated for the Ballon d\u2019Or. On the US, where most of the attention goes to the oldest players and prodigies, the player in the middle in more ways than one is midfielder Andi Sullivan, who was once the Next Great Thing but wound up having to wait for this opportunity. BD Lynn Williams. Somehow, despite a prolific career, this is the 30-year-old\u2019s World Cup debut. And while Williams\u2019 impact is obvious \u2013 her defensive pressure, intuition for space, incredible speed \u2013 it can be easy to lose track of her in a roster of marquee forwards. But she can make the difference in pivotal moments. MS USWNT\u2019s biggest weakness ... Breaking down an organized low block. This answer has not changed greatly from previous years. Overmatched opponents often benefit by using a disciplined defensive shape when they come up against the US. The Americans have made progress in how to handle that since the 2016 Olympic debacle, but they still often lack ideas to break down these types of defenses. JK Themselves. There is a lot of pressure to make history (again). But with key players injured, increasingly competitive opponents, and Andonovski\u2019s job potentially on the line, this tournament will not be a walk in the park for the No 1 ranked team in the world. SCM The absence of Mallory Swanson. Last year, Swanson\u2019s goal against Germany snapped the team\u2019s three-game losing streak, the first such skid in nearly 30 years. In the team\u2019s only games against top opposition this year, the SheBelieves Cup games against Canada, Japan and Brazil, she scored four of their five goals. BD Uncertainty. The fitness of key players \u2013 including Lavelle and defensive midfield destroyer Julie Ertz \u2013 has loomed ominously over preparations, and the US have prepared without knowing for certain what their go-to lineup looks like. MS USWNT\u2019s biggest strength ... Depth and firepower in attack. Even with high-profile injuries, Andonovski has forwards who can strike fear into opponents. Smith and Morgan will help lead the line, and Rapinoe is a dangerous set-piece option off the bench. JK Themselves. Despite the above-mentioned pressure, there is no reason to believe that the USWNT cannot win the tournament; they have proved time and time again why they are the best in the world. And with Rapinoe\u2019s recent retirement announcement, lifting the trophy would be her perfect swan song. SCM The letters \u201cUSA.\u201d Opponents often feel the pressure and make uncharacteristic mistakes against the Americans. To be honest, so do referees \u2013 like Michael Jordan in his NBA glory days, the USWNT have the star players who get the calls. And make no mistake \u2013 despite all the injuries and a passing of the torch to some less-experienced players, this is a solid team who are justifiably the tournament favorite. BD Attacking talent. No matter who starts and who subs on in the 60th minute to shatter the tired legs of the opposition, the US run deep with ruthless, dynamic talents capable of conjuring goals out of nothing. Victory may hinge on that ability. MS The biggest threat to the US is ... Spain or Sweden. Many assume that the World Cup will play out to script, with the US and Sweden winning their respective groups. If either team slip and finish runners-up in their respective group, however, it could mean meeting in the round of 16. In such a scenario, one heavyweight would be going home way too early. JK Canada. With the potential to face their neighbors to the north as the tournament progresses, the USWNT may be taken by surprise by an unpredictable Canadian team. Despite a lacklustre performance at the SheBelieves Cup, Canada will be hoping to add the World Cup title next to their Olympic gold medal. And doing so by beating their North American rivals may just give them the extra push that they need. SCM Any player who has developed in the competitive cauldrons of Europe\u2019s Champions League, England\u2019s Women\u2019s Super League and Germany\u2019s Bundesliga. Competitions that were once top-heavy are now more consistent tests of players\u2019 mettle, and those players are scattered not just on European teams but other squads as well. Woe be to a team like China, who keep most of their players at home, and don\u2019t have ample representation from the European competitions or the NWSL. BD Spain. While the US lifted their second consecutive World Cup in 2019 on an unbeaten run through the tournament, many forget how tough a test Spain were early on. Many current US players point to that Round of 16 match as the 2019 tournament\u2019s most difficult. Any route to this year\u2019s final could very well include another meeting with Spain in the knockouts. MS One bold prediction ... Williams stakes a claim to a starting role in the knockout stage. Depth on the forward line is exceptional, but as the games grow more tense, Andonovski will turn to Williams for her two-way play and defensive pressure, and utilize his other wingers off the bench to run at tired opponents. JK The Netflix film crew following the team around to document their journey prove to be too big a distraction. Having to perform both on and off the pitch may divert attention from focusing on the USWNT\u2019s actual goal. SCM A sponsor that did absolutely nothing to lean on European broadcasters to pay more for Women\u2019s World Cup rights, which Fifa was unable to sell at the prices it hoped, will make a performative \u201cequal pay\u201d gesture during the event. BD Smith is the US\u2019s most obvious threat. But with opponents\u2019 focusing on her, goals may need to come from elsewhere. That means Rodman, Williams, the ever-reliable Morgan, or a combination of all the above, as Smith still scores but creates for teammates while teams try to stop her. MS The USWNT\u2019s campaign will end with ... A trip to the final weekend. The US have never finished worse than third at a World Cup, a record that will inevitably end one day (as it did for the Olympics in 2016). This tournament looks as likely a time as ever, but the US will find a way to get through to the semi-finals. There, they could be ousted by Spain or Sweden, two teams that have challenged (and beaten) them in recent years. JK The Stars and Stripes not hoisting the World Cup, but the rest of the world praising the team as the blueprint for success. Love or hate them, you cannot deny what this team have done for women\u2019s socceron the pitch \u2013 and in courtrooms. The team don\u2019t need another piece of hardware to make history; they have already and forever cemented their legacy. SCM If they win it all, resounding praise for every player on the team, especially the oldest ones. If they don\u2019t, unyielding criticism of and surely the dismissal of Andonovski. That\u2019s the lot of a USWNT coach\u2019s life. Jill Ellis won back-to-back World Cups, thanks in part to some brilliant decisions to paper over the team\u2019s weaknesses, and she was still eyed with suspicion by some US journalists and fans. In their eyes, a loss is almost never the players\u2019 fault. At least, not the popular players\u2019 fault, and most of the players today are popular. BD The semi-finals. While this team are fully capable of clinching another World Cup title, an expanded tournament with the toughest competition yet will prove a difficult test. A potential meeting with Spain on a cold, rainy night in Auckland could be where the three-peat falls short.

The open letter, which has been set up by the Authors Guild, America\u2019s largest professional organisation for writers, is addressed to the CEOs of OpenAI, Alphabet, Meta, Stability AI, and IBM. It presents these generative AI leaders with three demands, asking that these companies: \u201cObtain permission for use of our copyrighted material\u201d; \u201cCompensate writers fairly for the past and ongoing use of our works\u201d, and \u201cCompensate writers fairly for the use of our works in AI output, whether or not the outputs are infringing under current law\u201d. Maya Shanbhag Lang, president of the Authors Guild, said: \u201cThe output of AI will always be derivative in nature. AI regurgitates what it takes in, which is the work of human writers. It\u2019s only fair that authors be compensated for having \u2018fed\u2019 AI and continuing to inform its evolution.\u201d National book award-winning novelist Jonathan Franzen, My Sister\u2019s Keeper author Jodi Picoult and nonfiction author and journalist Michael Pollan are among the letter\u2019s nearly 8,000 signatories. \u201cThe Authors Guild is taking an important step to advance the rights of all Americans whose data and words and images are being exploited, for immense profit, without their consent\u201d, said Franzen. \u201cIn other words, pretty much all Americans over the age of six.\u201d The median writing-related income in 2022 for full-time writers in the US was just $23,330, according to the Authors Guild\u2019s most recent income survey. \u201cThe advent of AI technology further exacerbates these challenges and will make it increasingly difficult, if not impossible, for writers \u2013 particularly those from underrepresented communities \u2013 to earn a living from the craft most spent years if not decades perfecting\u201d, a statement from the Authors Guild read. \u201cWhen writers have to give up their profession, it is a grave problem for all of us, not just the writers, because far fewer great books get written and published; and a free, democratic culture depends on a healthy, diverse ecosystem in which all views and voices are heard and ideas exchanged.\u201d This petition is the latest in a series of steps taken by literary figures to combat the rising use of AI in the books sector. Earlier this month two North American authors, Mona Awad and Paul Tremblay, filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, claiming that the organisation breached copyright law. OpenAI is the company behind the tool ChatGPT, a chatbot that is \u201ctrained\u201d by copying large swathes of text and extracting information from it. The suit filed on behalf of Awad and Tremblay argued that \u201cChatGPT generates summaries of plaintiffs\u2019 copyrighted works \u2013 something only possible if ChatGPT was trained on plaintiffs\u2019 copyrighted works\u201d. This line of argument could be difficult to prove, as ChatGPT may work \u201cexactly the same\u201d if it had not ingested the books themselves, Andres Guadamuz, a reader in intellectual property law at the University of Sussex, told the Guardian at the time. This is because it may have been trained on non-copyrighted information such as internet users discussing the books. The UK\u2019s leading industry body for writers, the Society of Authors (SoA) has backed both the legal action taken by Awad and Tremblay and this new petition by the Authors Guild. Nicola Solomon, chief executive of the SoA, said she and her colleagues \u201cfully support\u201d the open letter. \u201cThe principles of consent, credit and compensation are bedrocks of our intellectual property regime, and a critical part of every author\u2019s ability to protect and make a living from their work.\u201d But influencing AI developers is \u201conly one part of the challenge here\u201d, she added. \u201cThe race to build the next generation of systems is driven primarily by the profit motives of large corporations. It is opaque, unfettered and unregulated, while the ethical ramifications of AI systems are complex and crying out for scrutiny.\u201d Solomon said the SoA is \u201cworking flat out on this - advising members and working closely with other creators\u2019 unions (through the Creators\u2019 Rights Alliance) and the British Copyright Council, as well as making sure we are part of conversations with industry, policy makers and technology companies to try to identify common ground and establish safeguards, regulation and compensation.\u201d While the SoA does not currently have firm plans to publish its own open letter, it is something the team has discussed. At the moment, however, its focus is on continuing \u201cto lobby in line with the recent report by the House of Lords, which urged government, in no uncertain terms, to protect IP and better fund and support the creative industries\u201d, Solomon said. In June, the SoA published guidance for authors on how they can protect themselves and their work from being exploited by AI. In the same month the UK\u2019s Publishers Association also announced it was setting up a taskforce to support the industry amid AI developments. This petition is not the first time the Authors Guild has taken tech companies to task. In 2005 the writers\u2019 organisation filed a copyright infringement case against Google, claiming that the search engine\u2019s scanning of millions of books \u201cwas a plain and brazen violation of copyright law\u201d. In 2016, the long-running dispute came to an end when the US supreme court denied the Guild the right to appeal the ruling that Google\u2019s scanning of books constituted \u201cfair use\u201d, and that \u201cGoogle Books provide significant public benefits\u201d."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b22350", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/20/uswnt-defender-crystal-dunn-on-auckland-shooting-condolences-womens-world-cup", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018This is very real\u2019: USWNT defender Crystal Dunn on Auckland shooting", "lead": "Crystal Dunn has said that players had to \u201ccompartmentalise everything\u201d on Thursday after a central Auckland shooting left three dead", "author": "Jeff Kassouf in Auckland", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 08:28:07", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.230791", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/ed10eff80630ba6f631c5c117f8d17867dc2ecc3/976_221_2831_1699/500.jpg", "body": "The United States women\u2019s national team defender Crystal Dunn has said that players had to \u201ccompartmentalise everything\u201d on Thursday after a central Auckland shooting left three dead, including the gunman, only a few blocks from the team\u2019s hotel. \u201cThis is very real,\u201d Dunn said. \u201cOur condolences are with the families of the victims. Everyone handles these situations differently so it\u2019s important to give people the space that they need to work through, obviously, the trauma that has occurred today. But just understanding that we\u2019re a unified team and we give people the space that they need. Hopefully today, we\u2019re able to get on the pitch and just have ourselves a kickaround and just try to be connected again on a tough day.\u201d The USA players were just getting ready to eat breakfast at their team hotel when the incident took place around 7.30am local time. Team security immediately liaised with local authorities and the state department and determined that everyone was safe, a team spokesperson said. Team training was delayed slightly due to the incident. Hotels hosting several World Cup teams were in the immediate vicinity of the incident. The Norway and Philippines squads were within about one city block of the incident. Spokespersons for both teams said that all members of their respective delegations were safe. \u201cUnfortunately, I feel like in the US. We\u2019ve dealt with this far too many times,\u201d the USA forward Lynn Williams said, \u201cbut there was definitely a sense of let\u2019s come together. We still have a job to do, but also recognising that there were lives lost and that is very real and very devastating. So, we were just thankful that we were safe, that first responders came, and everything was very quick.\u201d The World Cup opener between New Zealand and Norway went on as planned, with what authorities said would be increased security. Around Eden Park, the venue for the Thursday\u2019s first game, everything appeared to carry on normally in the hours before the match. Dunn said that her son, who she gave birth to in May 2022, was in transit towards the hotel at the time of the incident but was not in the immediate vicinity. Players often like to walk around the local area in the little free time they have during the day after training. The night before the incident, the USA players could be seen in the surrounding blocks, Philippines players were meeting family and friends in their hotel and Italian players went shopping for souvenirs. A US Soccer spokesperson said that players will be able to proceed with free time as usual. New Zealand\u2019s prime minister, Chris Hipkins, said after the shooting that there is no threat to national security. \u201cIt\u2019s been pretty much understood that it\u2019s cleared,\u201d Dunn said. \u201cWe have a pathway out of the hotel if we want to go see family. Obviously, I\u2019m thinking: \u2018Can I go see my son? Can I see my husband?\u2019 And I think we got the go-ahead that everything is OK. \u201cBut at the end of the day, we\u2019re the USA. We know that every time we step out of the hotel, we need to be smart. People notice us and it\u2019s really great, but it also comes with responsibility of being smart about everything you do.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b22351", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2023/jul/20/australia-news-live-kerry-obrien-indigenous-voice-to-parliament-commonwealth-games-robodebt-clare-nowland-simon-crean-national-security", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Minister orders briefing on $33m grant \u2013 as it happened", "lead": "This blog is now closed.", "author": "Emily Wind and Rafqa Touma (earlier)", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 08:18:04", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.230810", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/829e64e46ee50f73cb22bc2a0037ca4eb8914924/0_457_6853_4112/500.jpg", "body": "Thanks for joining us on the blog today!

The mayor, Tom Tate, said he is confident the city has the facilities and accommodation to host the games if the federal government provides support via a \u201cre-provision\u201d of funds. The federal government has already declined to provide funding for the Games, and the Queensland government previously ruled out hosting, saying its focus is on the upcoming 2032 Olympics. Senior Department of Defence official Kathryn Campbell has been suspended without pay in the wake of the royal commission report into robodebt. The unemployment rate fell to 3.5% in June and 32,600 jobs were added to the economy, according to the latest ABS figures. The minister for employment, Tony Burke, said Australia is \u201cmillimetres shy of half a million new jobs since this government came to office\u201d, highlighting that 54% of the growth is full-time positions for women. Co-author of the voice to parliament handbook Kerry O\u2019Brien said the conduct of the official no campaign has been an \u201copen invitation to racists\u201d. Guardian Australia has annotated and factchecked the official yes and no campaign pamphlets. You can read the yes essay here, and the no essay here.

Enjoy your evening and as always, we\u2019ll see you back here tomorrow. It was a chilly morning across NSW today, with many locations plunged well into the negatives overnight. According to the Bureau of Meteorology records were broken in Scone, Merriwa, Moss Vale and Bombala: Meanwhile, parts of Victoria have been issued a frost warning for tomorrow: \u2018Closed tenders are anti-competitive\u2019: unions add to criticism of $33m grant to PwC backed company The Community and Public Sector Union \u2013 which represents the bulk of the federal public servants \u2013 has also raised concerns about the $33m grant given to a PwC linked startup without an open, competitive process. Here\u2019s the union\u2019s assistant national secretary, Michael Tull: Closed tenders are anti-competitive and a corruption risk. We need improved government procurement rules that only provide for closed tenders in exceptional circumstances and where those circumstances are publicly detailed. Tull and the CPSU have long been critical of public sector work being outsourced to consultants. Those concerns have been amplified after the scandal at PwC involving the misuse of confidential tax policy information. Shadow education minister Sarah Henderson has called for Victorian premier Daniel Andrews to resign for cancelling the 2026 Commonwealth Games. Appearing on Sky News tonight, she accused Andrews of misleading and betraying regional communities and affecting the state\u2019s international reputation: Daniel Andrews should resign over this \u2026 he should absolutely resign. \u2026 He has trashed our international reputation. \u2026 We have some of the best facilities in the world and he has entered into a very serious agreement \u2026 It is very very serious and he needs to go. Senator Nita Green said it\u2019s been the \u201cprivilege of a lifetime\u201d to co-chair Parliamentary Friends of Football during the past four years.

The Matildas are an inspiration to women all over the country. I can\u2019t wait to cheer them on tonight. Take a second to catch up on today\u2019s biggest headlines with the Afternoon Update, courtesy of Antoun Issa: The Greens have vowed to use parliamentary process to find out more about the Coalition government\u2019s decision to award $33m of taxpayer funds to a PwC-backed startup without a competitive process. As Guardian Australia reported earlier on Thursday, the federal Department of Health and Aged Care entered a funding agreement with Innowell Pty Ltd in June 2017 for a series of collaborative research trials known as Project Synergy. Innowell Pty Ltd was established in February 2017, Asic documents show, with one of the largest shareholders being PwC. The funding was to be used to develop a digital mental health platform. The government then decided not to use the platform, due to health workers finding it an administrative burden. The federal health minister, Mark Butler, is now seeking a briefing from his department on the grant. Greens senator Barbara Pocock, who is leading a senate inquiry into consultants along with Labor\u2019s Deborah O\u2019Neill, has raised serious concerns about the grant. We\u2019ve been told that it was a decision of the previous government not to go to open tender and to directly fund this company without a competitive process. I\u2019d say there would be many suppliers in that market who would have jumped at the chance to bid for a contract such as this, so the question is why weren\u2019t they given that opportunity? \u2026 We\u2019ll be asking questions when parliament resumes about precisely what went on and who was responsible. I\u2019m sounding like a broken record here but I\u2019ll say it again, we need accountability and transparency in government, particularly when dealing with private sector suppliers and particularly when dealing with the Big 4 consultants. Shorten \u2018after a scalp in Stuart Robert\u2019, Liberal MP says Liberal MP Angie Bell also speaks to the ABC on robodebt: Certainly people should be held accountable for their actions, but Luke [Gosling] says on the one hand that it\u2019s OK for the Victorian government, for example, to break a promise, and on the other hand it isn\u2019t OK for governments to make mistakes, so which one is it in terms of how we deal with these very big issues? (This is in reference to Victoria\u2019s decision to cancel the Commonwealth Games). Bell continues, accusing NDIS minister Bill Shorten of \u201cpoliticising\u201d the issue: Robodebt had terrible consequences on very many Australians and the former Coalition government has apologised, the current opposition has apologised for what has happened to many families. We have made those payments to those families that happened two years ago, and I think that Australians realise that Bill Shorten was simply after a scalp in Stuart Robert. He politicised the whole thing. I\u2019m not sure how much work he has done on the NDIS in the 12 months he has been in the portfolio because every single question time that I have been seated in all he has talked about is Stuart Robert and robodebt. Labor MP Luke Gosling tells the ABC there is \u201cno doubt\u201d the royal commission on robodebt was needed: As a local federal member here in Darwin, I had many people come in to my office who were just in tears about debts they were told that they had and they didn\u2019t, in fact, have them. It\u2019s a sad indictment on the former government, frankly, but also on some public servants who were part of this scheme and perpetuated it. And the alleged actions of some public servants and some federal politicians during the time of robodebt, there needs to be some accountability. Liberal MP Angie Bell is appearing on the ABC and is asked about the Gold Coast\u2019s offer to host the Commonwealth Games. She said she\u2019s been on the phone to mayor Tom Tate and his deputy mayor this afternoon: He has one small hurdle, which I will say is the Queensland premier, to get over. But certainly the Gold Coast delivered a fantastic Commonwealth Games last time \u2026 let\u2019s not rule it out. Bell is asked what the federal funding component was, and if it is \u201ca bit hypothetical\u201d: In terms of what the Gold Coast mayor is looking at, it was about the ratepayers not having to pay for that. He said to me it was operational funding that he\u2019d be looking for from the federal government, but of course the Queensland premier will have to be part of that conversation and the last I heard she had ruled it out. Police investigating after baby suffered \u2018serious head injuries\u2019 Queensland detectives are investigating after a two-and-a-half month old baby was taken to hospital with serious head injuries last month. In a statement, Queensland Police said the infant, from Marsden, was presented at Logan hospital on 18 June with \u201cserious head injuries\u201d. Preliminary investigations indicate the injuries may have been inflicted in the days leading up to 18 June. Detectives from the Logan district child protection and investigation unit are seeking public assistance with their investigation, urging anyone with information to contact police or Crime Stoppers. Agriculture minister Murray Watt is speaking to the ABC from the Torres Strait Islands, where he is currently visiting. He reflects on conversations he\u2019s had with community leaders about the Indigenous voice referendum: \u2026 For anyone who has spent time here you\u2019d be aware that Torres Strait Islander culture is very different to mainland Aboriginal culture, and there\u2019s a lot of different history that needs to be recognised as well. I have taken the opportunity while I\u2019ve been up here \u2026 to ask them about their views on the voice, what they\u2019re thinking about, what they want to know more about. Like much of the country, people are interested in hearing a bit more about it but there\u2019s certainly some strong enthusiasm from the Torres Strait Islanders that I have met with for having a more direct way of having a say over government decisions which, of course, is what the voice is really about. Assistant minister for employment Andrew Leigh spoke to the ABC about the role of factions in party politics. One of only two politicians federally not part of a faction, he\u2019s given a speech calling on Labor to rethink the role of factions, arguing they \u201cstifle debate and quash ideas\u201d. \u2026 I enjoy having my only loyalty being to the party itself. Whether this decision has come at a cost for his career progression is for \u201cothers to judge\u201d, he said. I\u2019m not anti-faction \u2026 [but] we should leave space in the party for people who don\u2019t want to join a faction, just as we have space for people who do want to join a faction. Leigh said over the recent decades there has been a decrease in the number of unaligned members in the federal caucus. He also said the decline of the \u201ccentre left\u201d has meant a move away from three factions in the Hawke era, to two large factions now: I think as we\u2019re looking to attract young progressive activists, it is really important that the Labor party is able to say \u2018just be Labor\u2019. If you join the Labor party and you don\u2019t want to be in a faction, you won\u2019t be a second-class citizen. The health minister, Mark Butler, has asked the Department of Health and Aged Care for a brief on the allocation of $33m of taxpayer funding towards a PwC-backed startup. As Guardian Australia reported earlier on Thursday, the federal Department of Health and Aged Care entered a funding agreement with Innowell Pty Ltd in June 2017 for a series of collaborative research trials known as Project Synergy. Innowell Pty Ltd was established in February 2017, Asic documents show, with one of the largest shareholders being PwC. The funding was to be used to develop a digital mental health platform. The government then decided not to use the platform, due to health workers finding it an administrative burden. Policy experts and transparency watchdogs have raised alarm about the grant and called on the federal government to explain why the money was not allocated through an open and competitive process to ensure value for money. Guardian Australia put multiple questions to both the department of health and the minister\u2019s office asking for any documents that explain how the funding decision was made by the former government, who made the decision, and why the funding was not allocated through a competitive tender process. On Thursday afternoon, a spokesperson for minister Butler\u2019s office responded to the list of questions with one line, saying: The Minister has asked the Department of Health and Aged Care for a brief on the matter. NSW police speak on \u2018unusual\u2019 pursuit through Sydney\u2019s west Earlier, Supt Adam Whyte spoke to the media about the police pursuit through Sydney\u2019s west this morning, in which a man and a woman were subsequently arrested. Whyte said that apart from the pursuit, the woman was being investigated for a separate break and enter, stealing and fraud offences. He said the man had two outstanding warrants in relation to property-related offences and in relation to an aggravated robbery. Whyte said: Our proactive crime team here in Liverpool are exceptional \u2026 the efforts they have done have been outstanding. Whyte described today\u2019s pursuit as \u201cunusual\u201d and said different police agencies worked together appropriately to arrest the individuals involved. The system has worked as it should, the vehicle was monitored from a distance and safely. He said that despite the alleged reckless nature of their driving, the pursuit was able to be brought to an end. When questioned on the fact there were no other injuries in relation to the pursuit, Whyte said the timing was \u201cvery beneficial\u201d with the \u201cnumber of users on the road\u201d. If the vehicle was determined to be stolen, charges would be laid accordingly, he said. I\u2019d like to thank all the officers for their work today, especially PolAir. be Tasmania\u2019s premier is dropping the key health portfolio and will shuffle ministerial roles in his minority government after months of political turbulence, AAP reports. Jeremy Rockliff conceded the Liberal state government had been \u201cknocked off course\u201d by the departure of two MPs to the crossbench over contentious stadium plans. The government plunged into minority on 12 May when Lara Alexander and John Tucker quit the party to become independents. They flagged concerns around transparency over a proposed $715m Hobart waterfront stadium, a condition of the AFL granting Tasmania a licence for a team. During a speech in Hobart today, Rockliff said he would hand over the health portfolio in coming days and announce \u201csmall changes\u201d to the roles of cabinet MPs. He said there would be no new MPs in cabinet, and reiterated that he would not call an early election. My government will not be defined by one issue, and two individuals. Rockliff said he had \u201cno personal beef\u201d with Alexander and Tucker, who have guaranteed the government their votes of supply and confidence in parliament. Labor opposition MP Dean Winter said the government \u201creset\u201d was an admission it had got things wrong. Aaaaaaand the Barbie memes continue: Heat disrupts cancer tests for rural Australians Hot weather could disrupt vital cancer screening for 1 million rural Australians, prompting calls for better public health education in country communities, AAP reports. The national bowel cancer screening program delivers home tests to Australians aged over 50, but the kits are not sent out when regions experience average heat above 30.5C. The hot-zone policy prevents deterioration of samples, but also means people in some rural and remote areas have a shorter window in the cooler months to self-test. A study by the Daffodil Centre, a cancer research organisation, for the first time calculated 1.02 million eligible Australians are affected by the policy, often in areas with higher levels of disadvantage and already low testing rates. But targeted interventions like education campaigns ahead of cool weather and direct assistance from health workers could reduce mortality rates. The study\u2019s lead Joachim Worthington said: The hope is that when there\u2019s planning around campaigns or government restructuring screening that they\u2019re not applying a one-size-fits-all approach. It\u2019s mostly just ensuring that whenever planning is made about the screening program ... rural areas aren\u2019t left behind. Well wishes are flowing for the Matildas as they prepare to kick off their World Cup campaign against the Republic of Ireland tonight. The NSW RFS labelled them \u201cthe best in the world\u201d. Labor MP Libby Coker tweeted support, saying the country was behind them: And Liberal MP Keith Wolahan said that although he was born in Ireland, tonight his \u201cheart will be beating\u201d for the Matildas. Nationals senator Bridget McKenzie was also in attendance at Simon Crean\u2019s state funeral today. She tweeted: A wonderful state service today [at St Paul\u2019s Cathedral in Melbourne] celebrating the life of Simon Crean. He genuinely loved the regions and despite being on different sides of politics was a great source of wisdom during my time as [Minister] for Agriculture. Rest in Peace. More on Simon Crean\u2019s state funeral, via AAP: Crean has been remembered as a \u201cbeloved son of the Labor party\u201d at a heartfelt service. The 74-year-old was laid to rest at a state funeral at St Paul\u2019s Cathedral in Melbourne today. He died suddenly after exercising in Berlin in June. Prime minister Anthony Albanese spoke at the service and said: Simon embodies so much of what truly matters at the heart of the labour movement, that spirit of working together and standing up for each other. Crean\u2019s brother, David Crean, recounted his treasured memories and moments spent with his sibling, with whom he shared a special bond. Trade unionist Bill Kelty, who served alongside Crean as secretary of the ACTU, lauded his friend\u2019s achievements in improving pay and conditions for workers: Simon\u2019s DNA is in every one of those policies. Crean\u2019s widow, Carole, said his \u201cincredible\u201d self-belief \u201cgave him the strength to fight for what he believed in\u201d. His daughter Sarah spoke about the close relationship she had with her father and the support he provided her: Dad was my mentor in life and what an honour it was to have such a good teacher. Acting opposition leader Sussan Ley paid her respects on behalf of the Coalition. Crean a \u2018lion of the Labor party\u2019, Shorten says NDIS minister and former Labor leader Bill Shorten has penned a tribute to fellow former Labor leader Simon Crean, who was farewelled at a state funeral in Melbourne today. Shorten described Crean as a \u201clion of the Labor party and the union movement\u201d and said he served the party with distinction: He was a fine trade unionist and fierce defender of the worker. A compassionate and dedicated politician, Simon represented his community in the seat of Hotham for 23 years and was a minister in the Hawke, Keating and Gillard governments. He rose to the rank of opposition leader, a role he carried out with his trademark integrity and courage \u2013 best illustrated by the stand he took against Australia\u2019s involvement in the second Gulf War in Iraq. Simon was a good man and friend. Fifa addresses WWC ticket activation concerns There has been some murmurs online of issues with tickets remaining unactivated in the lead-up to the opening matches of the Women\u2019s World Cup. Tickets still have not been \u201cactivated\u201d yet, with some ticket holders taking to Twitter, worrying their experience at tonight\u2019s match may be affected. But a representative of Fifa told Guardian Australia that this was all going \u201caccording to plan\u201d and that tickets would be activated 2-3 hours before kickoff. In Sydney, the Matildas are due to kick off their World Cup campaign against the Republic of Ireland at 8pm, so tickets should activate between 5 and 6pm. The representative said: When gates open, that is when the barcode will appear on the app, and when tickets will be activated. Exactly as planned and exactly as it should be. Tony Burke was asked if the jobs figures were hampering the fight against inflation. He said: The Reserve Bank has particular rules that they need to work too. I will leave it to them to be able to explain that and deal with that. As far as the government is concerned, we want people to have jobs. We want people to be in work. And we also want, where people previously wanted more shifts and couldn\u2019t find them, now increasingly people who want full-time work are able to find it. That isn\u2019t to say there aren\u2019t people out there who want to work and are still finding it hard, because of other barriers there in the workforce, barriers that might be there because of disability, barriers to the workforce that might be there for a range of factors. And the government is still working to try to make sure that we can get a better deal for those individuals as well. Minister for finance and women Katy Gallagher announces full-time employment for women in Australia is now the highest it has been since 1994 \u2013 hitting 57.9% last month. Burke hails growth of new jobs Labor MP and minister for employment Tony Burke just gave a press conference to speak on the new jobs figures: We are now millimetres shy of half a million new jobs since this government came to office. The official figure, now that we\u2019ve have 13 months of data, is 498,300 new jobs. And what is extraordinary of that nearly half a million new jobs in the time that we have been in office is that 85% of them have been full-time jobs \u2026 Added to that, female full-time jobs alone are 54% of the growth in jobs. \u2026 We are now seeing that change the lives of people, being able to get full-time work in Australia where that is what they want and that is what they require for their lives. This is Lake Hillier in Western Australia, known for its bright pink colour. Scientists believe its pigment comes from the presence of dunaliella salina, an unicellular algae that is red/pink in colour. The rest of us believe it is next-level Barbie movie marketing. More from Gold Coast mayor Tom Tate\u2019s press conference: He said there would be \u201cno impasse\u201d on Gold Coast ratepayers to pick up the cost, and that the Gold Coast was \u201cnot willing to pick up the cost that Victoria is believed to have blown\u201d. Cr Tate said he had put calls in to various places, including Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk: I rang and I haven\u2019t had a return call. He said his motivation for putting his hand up was because of the athletes: They have trained relentlessly. It\u2019s their journey towards the Paris Olympics \u2026 the Paralympians and the Olympians themselves would want all these games to hone their skill. As we noted earlier, the federal government has already declined to provide funding for the Commonwealth Games, and the Queensland government also previously ruled out hosting the Games, saying its focus is on the coming 2032 Olympics. Gold Coast mayor says \u2018I know it can be done\u2019 Guardian Australia has obtained a copy of Gold Coast mayor Tom Tate\u2019s earlier press conference where he announced the city had put its hand up to host the 2026 Commonwealth Games. During the press conference, Cr Tate said the Gold Coast was \u201cgames ready\u201d: The facilities and the legacy facilities that we\u2019ve had here [have been] maintained to the highest level. \u2026 Under the condition that the federal government give us the green light on federal funding, I would absolutely put up our hand and say the Gold Coast can accommodate. I\u2019ll need the Queensland government\u2019s support but we\u2019ll have all the boxes ticked for them to say yes easily. \u2026 I\u2019ve got more facts than most because I was host of the 2018 Games. I know the budget and I know it can be done. The premier of Victoria\u2019s lemon, the Gold Coast can turn that into lemonade because that\u2019s how we roll. Tate is calling on the federal government to re-provision the money allocated for the 2026 Games in Victoria to the Gold Coast \u201cbecause they\u2019re going to spend the money there anyway\u201d. Re-provision that and we can make it work. New snake species identified In case you missed it yesterday \u2013 a new species of snake has been identified by a team of researchers from the University of Adelaide, the South Australian Museum and the Western Australian Museum. The desert whip snake is the newest of 15 species of whip snake found in arid habitats and outback towns across the country. Dr James Nankivell, a DNA researcher and first author of the study, said: Unlike other species of whip snake, the desert whip snake has a blueish body with a copper head and tail. It also doesn\u2019t have as much black on its scales as its closest relative. These subtle but consistent differences in external appearance and genetic evidence have led to us identifying this new species of whip snake. Nankivell said the desert whip snake\u2019s mildly venomous bite was painful but unlikely to cause humans any serious harm. Our country is home to more species of reptile than anywhere else in the world and there are still even more species just waiting to be discovered. More on the Blak Sovereign Movement\u2019s own version of a no essay on the Indigenous voice to parliament referendum: The movement\u2019s essay describes the voice as \u201csomething that pretends to be a great change, but provides none\u201d, claiming it is \u201cnothing but cheap window dressing to constitutional recognition\u201d. Instead, the essay calls for \u201crecognition of sovereignty and truth-telling\u201d, as well as calling on the government to implement all recommendations from the royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody and the Bringing them Home report: Do not be bullied by the Yes campaign and do not be intimidated by the racists. Do not let yourself be emotionally blackmailed. There are many good reasons to say No. If the only voices you are hearing or amplifying are the \u2018progressive Yes\u2019 or \u2018the conservative/racist No\u2019, it shows you are failing to engage with the diverse spectrum of grassroots Blak voices across the country. We may not be on the front page but we are most definitely still here. Senator Lidia Thorpe and the Blak Sovereign Movement have blasted both the yes and no campaigns for the Indigenous voice, but are still calling for voters to defeat the referendum later this year. The Victorian independent\u2019s office has released a statement on behalf of the Blak Sovereign Movement, which is advocating for people to vote no on the referendum over their belief that the voice would not go far enough in advancing the interests of Indigenous Australians. Thorpe was locked out of contributing to the no side\u2019s essay in the referendum pamphlet, which was written by the Coalition and featured mostly conservative talking points. Thorpe, instead, is advocating a so-called \u201cprogressive no\u201d vote, and the Blak Sovereign Movement has released its own version of a no essay. The essay said: We understand that many well-meaning folk are hurting as a result of being coerced by the Yes campaign, or are afraid to vote No due to the racism of the conservative No campaign. The Voice debate is not just a waste of resources, it is a waste of your time and energy. Telstra is cutting almost 500 roles as the telecommunications company works to streamline operations under new CEO Vicki Brady, AAP reports. The changes would involve a net reduction of around 472 jobs, a spokesman said in a statement on Thursday. Decisions like this are always difficult. We know and feel the personal impact on our people and their families. The spokesman said the job cuts addressed impacts from exiting legacy products and services as well as gaining efficiencies from digitisation, automation and new technology. They are critical for us to remain competitive and achieve our customer ambitions. There would be no reductions to Telstra consumer teams that served customers in store, over the phone or at home. Some further commentary from Gold Coast mayor Tom Tate, via 9 News Queensland: Cr Tate has reportedly offered for the Gold Coast to host the 2026 Commonwealth Games after Victoria cancelled. He said: The premier of Victoria\u2019s lemon, the Gold Coast can turn that into a lemonade because that\u2019s how we roll. 9 News Queensland reported Cr Tate called Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk to discuss but hasn\u2019t \u201chad a return call\u201d yet. It\u2019s worth noting the Queensland government has ruled out hosting the Games, saying its focus is on the upcoming 2032 Olympics. The Guardian has put a call in to Cr Tate\u2019s office. Crean a \u2018great Australian\u2019 who served with integrity, says PM Anthony Albanese has taken to social media to honour former Labor leader Simon Crean, who was farewelled with a state funeral in Melbourne today. The prime minister said: Today we gather in Melbourne to honour Simon Crean. A great Australian who served his country and his community with humility and compassion, integrity and intellect. A beloved son of the Australian Labor party, a devoted husband to Carole, a dear friend. May he rest in peace. Two in critical condition with meningococcal in SA Two unrelated cases of meningococcal have been notified in South Australia. A 36-year-old male and a 13-year-old female from metropolitan Adelaide have both been admitted to hospital in a critical condition. Sixteen close contacts have been directed to receive clearance antibiotics. There have been 15 cases of meningococcal disease reported in South Australia this year, compared with seven cases reported at the same time last year. Andrew Bragg pursues papers from treasurer Liberal senator Andrew Bragg has been busy in the regulatory space since the Coalition lost government, with the NSW senator spending his time looking into whether Australia\u2019s regulatory bodies are up to scratch. Bragg is chair of the economics references committee in the Senate, which is part way through an inquiry into the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (Asic) \u201ccapacity and capability\u201d to \u201cundertake proportionate investigation and enforcement action arising from reports of alleged misconduct\u201d to the committee. So \u2013 does Asic have the resources and capability to do its job. As part of that the committee wanted the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, to produce documents to the Senate. Chalmers, it seems, has not done that. So Bragg will now call on the senator who represents Chalmers in the Senate \u2013 finance minister Katy Gallagher \u2013 to make a statement explaining why the documents the committee wanted were handed over. Bragg has reported to the parliament: The treasurer was ordered to provide the documents to the committee by midday 18 July 2023. In the event of non-compliance, the minister representing the treasurer is required to attend the Senate on Wednesday 2 August 2023 at the conclusion of motions to take note of answers, to provide an explanation of the failure to comply with the orders. On 18 July 2023 the committee received no response from the treasurer. The committee has considered this and confirms that the orders have not been complied with. Gold Coast mayor Tom Tate has announced the Gold Coast has offered to host the 2026 Commonwealth Games after Victoria cancelled, 9News Gold Coast is reporting. Tate reportedly said the Gold Coast had sufficient infrastructure and housing in place but would need operation funding from the federal government: The federal government has already declined to provide funding for the Commonwealth Games, and the Queensland government has also ruled out hosting the Games, saying its focus is on the upcoming 2032 Olympics. Canberra imposes fresh sanctions on Russia over Ukraine invasion Australia has imposed targeted sanctions on 35 entities in Russia\u2019s defence, technology and energy sections, and 10 individuals, including Russian ministers and senior officials, and senior military personnel in Belarus. In a joint statement from foreign minister Penny Wong and assistant foreign minister Tim Watts, they said the action was taken in coordination with international partners to have maximum impact on those playing a role \u201cin directly or indirectly supporting Russia\u2019s illegal and immoral invasion of Ukraine\u201d. Australia has already taken action to impose costs on Russia and has sanctioned more than 1,100 individuals and entities supporting the invasion. Wong said: Today\u2019s sanctions underline Australia\u2019s commitment to working with partners to maintain pressure on Russia and those supporting its illegal and immoral war. Watts said: Australia again calls on Russia to immediately withdraw from Ukrainian territory and for Belarus to stop supporting Russia\u2019s senseless war. Flu prevalence declines across NSW in line with school holidays Flu activity remains moderate to high across New South Wales but has declined during the past two weeks due to the school holidays, NSW Health says. Its latest surveillance survey for the week ending 15 July shows that Covid activity continues to decline and RSV activity remains stable. It said 6,187 people were diagnosed with the flu during the reporting period, a decrease of 14% on the previous week. The decline was greatest among the 5-16-year-old age group. Hospital presentations for flu-like symptoms were also down. Two arrested after pursuit across Sydney\u2019s west Two people have been arrested following a police pursuit through Sydney\u2019s west this morning, NSW police have confirmed. Officers were patrolling the Revesby area around 9.30am when they detected an allegedly stolen vehicle travelling along the Hume Highway. A police pursuit was initiated when the Hyundai Sonata sedan failed to stop as directed. The pursuit, however, was terminated a short time later due to safety concerns. PolAir continued monitoring the vehicle before it crashed at North Rocks just after 11am. The male driver and a female passenger were arrested at the scene before being taken into Ryde police station. Sky News broadcast the final minutes of the chase through suburban roads. The vehicle was shown veering into oncoming traffic and at one intersection crossed into moving traffic. NSW police said inquiries were continuing. NSW\u2019s jobless rate sinks below 3%, driving national tally lower New South Wales, which accounts for about a third of the Australian economy, continues to be a jobs-creating machine. Last month, the jobless rate sank to just 2.9% (cue: politicians claiming the record low) in June from 3% in May. Queensland was another mover, with the unemployment rate last month sinking to 3.6% from 3.9% in the previous month. Victoria, now sans any Commonwealth Games to look forward to, was unchanged at 3.7%. No matter how you cut it, the economy is still motoring along well enough for employers to keep wanting to add jobs. Can we start to anticipate a \u201cgoldilocks\u201d outcome where the economy avoids a recession and the unemployment rate doesn\u2019t tick up beyond 4%? (We hinted at this outcome here.) A small retreat in the participation rate last month from a record 66.9% in May helped nudge the jobless rate lower. Hours worked, though, picked up to 1.947bn, underscoring how tight the jobs market remains. Bjorn Jarvis, ABS\u2019s head of labour statistics, notes the economy has now added 1m jobs since the pandemic began. Let that sink in. Monthly hours worked increased by 0.3% in June, another sign of the strength of demand for workers. Jarvis said: Over the past 12 months, hours worked increased 4.7%, outpacing the 3% increase in employment. Follow on at home here: Veteran environmentalist Bob Brown will fight a criminal charge stemming from a protest against the logging of land claimed to be home to a critically endangered parrot, AAP reports. Brown appeared in Hobart magistrates court on Thursday and pleaded not guilty to trespassing on 8 November 2022. It alleged the former federal Greens leader remained on land at Royal George in Tasmania\u2019s east. He said outside court: We have one of the most critically endangered creatures on the planet in the swift parrot, on the verge of extinction, and they\u2019re cutting down the trees they\u2019re nesting in. We\u2019re proud to have defended the swift parrot. Two other protesters, Kristy Alger and Karen Weldrick, also entered pleas of not guilty to trespassing charges relating to the same protest. Brown will return to court on 7 September ahead of an expected two-day hearing at a date to be determined. He said: We believe we were wrongly arrested in our forests, protecting our wildlife. Brown\u2019s lawyer Roland Browne hit out at an eight-week adjournment in the case, saying the prosecution had more than enough time to complete the file. It is estimated there may be as few as 750 swift parrots in the wild, with a declining population trend. Brown\u2019s court appearance comes after an activist from his foundation was jailed last week for three months after breaching a suspended prison term during separate anti-logging and mining protests. Social media managers are definitely embracing the fun this Thursday morning. First, we have Victorian police on Twitter lamenting the endless Euro pictures flooding our feeds: And then we have the NSW SES capitalising on the Barbie movie hype, announcing that Barbie has joined as their latest recruit, #OrangeIsTheNewPink: It\u2019s almost enough to make me want to re-download the Twitter app on my phone. Almost. A third of Australians plan to change or cancel health cover A new survey has shown that nearly one-third of Australians with a health insurance plan to switch or ditch their current plan amid the cost of living crisis. Conducted by Finder, the survey looked at 1,080 Australians (577 with private health cover) and revealed that 31% of people plan to change or cancel their health cover \u2013 equating to roughly 3.3 million Aussies. Twenty-six per cent plan to renew but might switch policies for a better deal, while 5% plan to cancel entirely. Tim Bennett, health insurance expert at Finder, said: Aussies have been hit with everything from skyrocketing energy bills to rising petrol prices and food bills and in many cases insurance is the first non-essential to be cut. We may start to see higher rates of underinsurance over the coming months as many simply won\u2019t be able to afford the policies they need. Those in the most vulnerable positions are at risk of ignoring health concerns for fear of a medical bill they can\u2019t afford. Health insurance is one of the most stressful expenses for 14% of Australians who have it, according to Finder\u2019s consumer sentiment tracker. The yes and no pamphlets, annotated and fact-checked The pamphlets written by politicians and published by the Australian Electoral Commission on the upcoming Indigenous voice to parliament referendum have put the official case for a yes and a no vote. They were not independently fact-checked before publication, so Guardian Australia has added notes to the full essays to help you make better sense of them. You can read the annotated and fact-checked yes pamphlet here: And the annotated and fact-checked no pamphlet here: Many thanks Rafqa for taking us through the morning! I\u2019ll be with you for the rest of today\u2019s news. Thanks for joining me on the blog this morning. Time for Emily Wind to take the wheel! Queensland opens race for billions in government contracts ahead of Olympics Queensland businesses will bid to \u201cbuy Queensland\u201d as they compete for up to $180bn worth of government contracts in the lead-up to the 2032 Olympic Games. The \u201cQ2032\u201d plan launched on Thursday invites businesses with a local workforce to apply for contracts ahead of the Games. First nations- and women-led businesses, along with companies with low-emissions plans, will be looked upon favourably. Speaking to reporters in Brisbane on Thursday, the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said she would be travelling the \u201clength and breadth\u201d of the state to ensure small and regional businesses also took up these opportunities. Palaszczuk said: This is a blueprint for 1000s of businesses across Queensland to get their share of work through a whole range of areas. This could involve things such as flag sports equipment, cabling, catering, costs, food, laundry services \u2026 and seats. There are billions of dollars of opportunities out there for businesses, all Queensland can benefit. Australia\u2019s unemployment rate dropped back to its half-century low of 3.5% in June as the economy defied the Reserve Bank\u2019s rate hikes to add more jobs. Last month, the economy added a net 32,600 jobs in seasonally adjusted terms, or more than twice the 15,000 expected by economists. After a revision to May\u2019s jobless, also put at 3.5%, the unchanged tally also beat economists\u2019 expectations of a 3.6% reading. The Australian dollar jumped a quarter of a US cent to US68.25c in the immediate aftermath of the release. That implies investors reckon there\u2019s an increased chance the RBA will lift its interest rate again in August. Lawyers tell inquiry of concerns over secrecy laws The Human Rights Law Centre and the Law Council of Australia have both raised serious concerns about the operation of secrecy laws designed to protect sensitive information during court proceedings. HRLC senior lawyer Kieran Pender has told an inquiry the laws \u201csignificantly undermined open justice\u201d. He said the law currently made no mention of open justice, either as an objective or a consideration to which the court could have regard. Among other things, he recommended that an independent advocate be appointed where the NSI Act is used to ensure someone is in court arguing for open justice. [The open justice advocate] addresses an all-too-real vice in these cases where secrecy otherwise suits the interests of all of the parties. The Law Council of Australia said the way the NSI Act was operating represented an \u201cunacceptable restriction on the right to a fair trial, and to a public hearing and the principle of open justice\u201d. The inquiry has already heard submissions about the huge practical hurdles faced by lawyers working on cases where the NSI Act is invoked. Among other things, the law allows the government to effectively dictate which lawyers can act for defendants by imposing a security clearance requirement. Lloyd Babb SC, the chair of the law council\u2019s national security law working group and the Northern Territory\u2019s top prosecutor, said the law was at odds with Australia\u2019s international obligations. Without significant amendments, these provisions permit an unjustified interference to a person\u2019s legal right to a legal representative of his or her choosing. This is a critical facet of the rule of law and it is protected by Australia\u2019s obligations under international human rights law. June jobless rate eases to 3.5% from 3.6%, matching half-century lows. Foreign affairs minister Penny Wong throws her support behind the Matildas as the Fifa Women\u2019s World Cup kicks off tonight. June jobs data could be telling for RBA\u2019s interest rate stance We\u2019ll shortly get the June labour market numbers from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, with a strong showing likely to lift expectations of another rate rise by the Reserve Bank. As it stands, investors have settled on the view that there\u2019s only one more 25 basis-point increase in the works, and probably not at the RBA\u2019s 1 August meeting: Now labour numbers can be sliced and diced various ways. The drop in the jobless rate in May to 3.6% was a surprise \u2013 but the nearly 76,000 extra jobs created was an even bigger one. For June, market consensus is that the jobless rate will remain at 3.6% with a net 15,000 jobs added. Hours worked will be another thing to watch. Anyway, watch out for the data dump at 11.30AEST. Liddell\u2019s closure nudged power prices higher but trend is a friend Eastern Australia\u2019s wholesale power prices increased in the June quarter, although they remained well below the level reached during the energy crisis a year earlier, the Australian Energy Regulator says. New South Wales posted the highest spot pricing with an average of $148 a megawatt-hour, up from just over $100/MWh during the first three months of the year. During last winter\u2019s energy squeeze, prices averaged about $320/MWh. For the June quarter, Queensland and South Australia\u2019s wholesale prices averaged about $140/MWh, Victoria\u2019s just under $100, while Tasmania\u2019s were cheapest at $65. Despite AGL Energy giving the market more than seven years\u2019 notice it was closing its Liddell coal-fired power plant in the Hunter Valley, its final demise still resulted in an uptick in prices for the quarter. The outlook, though, is a bit more promising with wholesales prices coming down (though it won\u2019t affect our bills for a while yet): A generally mild winter \u2013 today being one exception across most of the south-east \u2013 has kept energy demand restrained. Read more about the market here: Kate Chaney calls for public sector reform Independent MP Kate Chaney says the suspension of Kathryn Campbell \u201cis a start\u201d but public sector reform must follow as a priority. \u201cAfter being \u2018responsible for a department that had established, implemented and maintained an unlawful program\u2019, suspension of Kathryn Campbell is a start,\u201d Chaney tweeted. But the cultural issue goes much deeper than individuals. Public sector reform must be a priority of this govt. Police apprehend driver after western Sydney car chase Police have apprehended a driver after a car chase through Sydney\u2019s west that was broadcast live on Sky News. Police swarmed the vehicle, a white Camry sedan, and handcuffed one person. The car came to crashing halt after an earlier collision. Sky News, which carried the final minutes of the chase through suburban roads, said the pursuit had begun 30 minutes earlier. The car drove from Bankstown through the Hills District and crashed into a traffic island in north Parramatta, Sky said. The vehicle was shown veering into on-coming traffic and at one intersection crossed into moving traffic. An independent watchdog is contemplating telling the government to greatly reduce the scope of national security information that is covered by secrecy laws after \u201cextraordinary\u201d evidence this week. The Independent National Security Legislation Monitor Grant Donaldson is currently probing secrecy laws designed to protect sensitive information during court proceedings, most notably in the prosecutions of Bernard Collaery, Witness K, David McBride, and Witness J. Intelligence agencies believe the law \u2013 known as the National Security Information Act (NSI Act) \u2013 is necessary to prevent sensitive material being exploited by foreign spies, who see court cases as a way to obtain information about Australia\u2019s intelligence sources, methods, capabilities, and priorities. But Donaldson said this morning that the evidence of Commonwealth prosecutors on Wednesday shocked him by revealing the breadth of material that was affected by the secrecy laws in cases where the NSI Act was invoked. When the scales fell from my eyes in relation to this, some views that I had developed I\u2019m rather thinking about reviewing, I must say, quite significantly. Because if the view is taken that in a criminal matter in which the NSI act is invoked, every single document that is held by the Crown and every single document that is held by a defendant \u2013 because on the definition as articulated by the DPP it relates to national security, because you\u2019re in a trial where the act has been invoked \u2013 that seems to me to be just an extraordinary proposition. And if that\u2019s where we are, then I think what is going to have to happen is a very significant narrowing of the scope of the definition of national security information. Here is a look at last night\u2019s forum on the Voice in Sydney, where minister for Indigneous Australians Linda Burney joined Indigenous lawyer Noel Pearson to discuss \u201cwhy a vote for yes is a vote for unity and hope\u201d. You can read more on Burney\u2019s comments at the forum from Ben Doherty\u2019s reporting here: BHP Group has recorded its highest ever annual iron ore production, while flagging challenges ahead due to volatile economic conditions. The world\u2019s biggest listed miner also acknowledged the deaths of two workers during the financial year and pledged to eliminate fatalities and serious injuries at its operations. In an operational review released on Thursday, BHP said its Western Australian ore production results were helped by productivity gains in its supply chain, rail network and unloading facilities. BHP chief executive Mike Henry said: Competitiveness will be ever more important as we enter the new financial year and at a time when there are new challenges and opportunities to resource development and global economic volatility. BHP and rivals Rio Tinto and Fortescue Metals are grappling with a faltering pandemic recovery in China, the major buyer of Australian iron ore. BHP has forecast an increase in iron ore production this financial year of up to 294m tonnes, up from 285.3m tonnes last year. Margaret Kelly served with eviction notice The last remaining resident of the Barak Beacon public housing estate in Port Melbourne has been given an eviction notice. Margaret Kelly, 68, has been living in the estate for 25 years and has been fighting to keep her home since the redevelopment was announced. The eviction notice is the result of VCAT proceedings launched against by the Victorian Labor Government, which is in the process of demolishing the estate. The government plans to lease the land to a company that will build new dwellings there, with a mix of social, affordable and market rental homes. The redevelopment will achieve a minimum 10% increase in social housing and provide more housing options for people on low and medium incomes, the government has said. Leader of the Victorian Greens, Samantha Ratnam: In the midst of a housing crisis, evicting public housing residents and demolishing public homes when no contracts for reconstruction have been awarded is criminal. Margaret will now be forced to leave her home of 25 years because this Government is utterly addicted to privatisation, and refuses to keep public land in public hands. If other estates are anything to go by, Barak Beacon will be flattened and no homes will be rebuilt for years like we saw at Walker Estate in Northcote, where the site has laid vacant for five years. Guardian Australia\u2019s inequality reporter Stephanie Convery has covered Kelly\u2019s fight to stay in her home along the way.

Minister first heard of games axing at cabinet meeting Andrews government frontbencher Colin Brooks is holding a press conference where he is being questioned about the state\u2019s cancellation of the 2026 Commonwealth Games. The Andrews government on Tuesday announced the games would not go ahead in Victoria, citing a significant cost blowout from $2.6bn to $6-$7bn. Brooks, the state\u2019s housing minister, says he first heard of the $6-$7bn cost blowout figure at a cabinet meeting on Monday that endorsed the cancellation. Six years to save for a deposit for a home in Sydney and Melbourne First-home buyers face house prices three times higher than previous generations, while only earning 1.6 times the income, according to new research from the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute (AHURI). Professor Stephen Whelan of the School of Economics University of Sydney: Our research certainly shows that over the last 30 years, ownership rates for households at age 30 to 34 have declined substantially; from 65% of people born in the mid to late 1950s being homeowners by age 30 to 34, to only 45% of people born in the mid to late 1980s Almost a third fewer first-home buyers are achieving home ownership than in previous decades, with the research showing younger generations are less likely \u2018to catch up\u2019. After 10 years the ownership rate \u2018gap\u2019 when comparing the 1950s cohort to the 1980s cohort (at age 40 to 44) has closed by less than half, and after 20 years (at age 50 to 54), the ownership rate is only around 75% of the 1950s group. There are fears among policymakers that Australia may see large falls in living standards and increases in poverty among people who have retired but are still renting. One of the key constraints younger people are facing in wanting to buy a home today is the need to save enough to be able to pay a deposit or downpayment. If we measure housing affordability by the time required to save for a deposit for a \u2018typical\u2019 dwelling for an \u2018average\u2019 household, we see that in markets such as Sydney and Melbourne, it now takes over six years. PM dodges questions on whether discussions about commonwealth funding were held BeAs he\u2019s on Melbourne radio, Anthony Albanese spends much of this ABC interview being asked about the Victorian government decision to cancel the 2026 Commonwealth Games. In particular, why there was no commonwealth funding announced for the games, in the last budget. The prime minister says the games hadn\u2019t been held yet and there are \u201ca couple of budgets between now and 2026\u201d. Albanese would not go into any detail about whether there had been discussions about commonwealth funding, despite being pressed several times, other than to say the federal and state governments have discussions about a lot of things, all the time. On the issue of whether Daniel Andrews should apologise to the athletes who had been preparing for the games, Albanese says that is a matter for the premier. Albanese says the federal government was advised shortly before the public announcement of the decision to scrap the games. \u201cWe were advised just prior to the announcement,\u201d he said. It\u2019s a decision of the Victorian government. I certainly think that for the athletes, it\u2019s a very difficult decision for them who would have been looking forward to participating in the Commonwealth Games at our home games, as they did in Melbourne in 2006. And, as they did, more recently on the Gold Coast, but this was a decision made by the Victorian government. Speaking about the no campaign Kerry O\u2019Brien told Guardian Australia\u2019s Full Story podcast today: I think the way this campaign has been conducted has been an open invitation to the racists in our nation to come out of the woodwork and vent. And now with social media, they\u2019re able to do that without having to look you in the eye as they do it. They can do it anonymously. They can do it in a cowardly way. And when I heard Peter Dutton accusing the Prime Minister of re racializing Australia, it was the pot calling the kettle black. The truth is that it is precisely that kind of terminology that has been, I think, a part of the process of inviting the racists amongst us to come out and be heard. On the official referendum pamphlet he said: There is a web of fabrication that is reflected in the No campaign, but it is reflected in this pamphlet, and it doesn\u2019t surprise me \u2026 they talk about it would somehow elevate Indigenous Australians to a position of greater privilege. The solicitor general of Australia, along with a raft of high court judges, senior pre-eminent constitutional academics and so on, all of whom are saying essentially the same thing: that this voice does not represent risk to the constitution, to the court system, to the system of executive government. Today Guardian Australia launched The voice AMA, our new podcast series taking your questions on the voice. Kerry O\u2019Brien was joined by Indigenous affairs editor Lorena Allam and Queensland Young Australian of the Year Saibai Koedal (crocodile) woman Talei Elu. Albanese on radio rounds Anthony Albanese is doing the ABC radio rounds this morning \u2013 now speaking to ABC radio Melbourne. He is of course asked about Kathryn Campbell and how long the suspension will be for, and says much the same thing he said to NSW listeners: One of the things the royal commission was about was making sure we get proper processes so we don\u2019t have the sort of governance arrangements whether it be some of the actions of the public service, but more particularly as well, the actions of government ministers. Albanese refuses to detail Kathryn Campbell\u2019s suspension On ABC Melbourne, Anthony Albanese was asked who made the decision to suspend Kathryn Campbell. Albanese said the decision was made \u201cby the department of the prime minister and cabinet, and appropriate bodies\u201d. He said: It\u2019s not appropriate given the potential legal matters involved to go through all of the detail there. Certainly there has been an appropriate response from my department, and from the public service to the royal commission findings. Asked how long the suspension is for and whether it will result in a full dismissal, Albanese said he won\u2019t go into the details because \u201cindividuals do have rights as well, we\u2019ll go through appropriate processes\u201d. Albanese said the findings of the royal commission were \u201cmore damning than anyone was expecting\u201d. Campbell has not responded to media requests for comment after the royal commission report, but at the hearings Campbell defended her handling of the matter and said she had assumed the scheme was lawful despite earlier advice raising serious questions. During questioning at the royal commission, Campbell said: I have never been in a department that sought to mislead. And I have never been involved in an operation that has sought to mislead the government. Kathryn Campbell has not commented publicly on the royal commission report Kathryn Campbell has not responded to media requests for comment after the royal commission report, but at the hearings Campbell defended her handling of the matter and said she had assumed the scheme was lawful despite earlier advice raising serious questions. During questioning at the royal commission, Campbell said: I have never been in a department that sought to mislead. And I have never been involved in an operation that has sought to mislead the government. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, was asked about the suspension of Kathryn Campbell on ABC Radio. Albanese said: I\u2019m not going to comment on individual cases in detail about the future because there are processes in place. But I certainly have been advised that that is the case. And I think that that action \u2013 of course most people who have a look at the human tragedy caused by robodebt and the findings of the royal commission are very clear, about failings by the Morrison government and indeed before, going back to when [Scott] Morrison was the minister and indeed the bureaucracy as well, and it\u2019s appropriate that there be a response to that. Morrison has said he \u201ccompletely\u201d rejects adverse findings, claiming they were \u201cwrong, unsubstantiated and contradicted by clear documentary evidence presented to the commission\u201d. As the cabinet minister who brought the robodebt proposal to cabinet, Morrison said he had \u201cacted in good faith and on clear and deliberate department advice that no legislation was required to introduce the scheme\u201d. Melbourne\u2019s most unsafe roads RACV\u2019s inaugural My Melbourne Road survey has named the city\u2019s top ten most unsafe roads and intersections. Among them are Sydney Road in Brunswick and Coburg, Dandenong Road in Windsor, Prahran and Caulfield, and North Road in McKinnon, Oakleagh and Clayton. The spot where Moonee Valley\u2019s Mount Alexander Road meets with Keilor Road received most responses for safety concerns in both the intersection and road categories. Intersection safety was the area of greatest concern raised, followed by unsafe behaviours of other drivers like speeding and erratic driving, RACV head of policy James Williams said. Notably, four of the roads and intersections with the most number of safety concerns identified pedestrian or cyclist related issues as a primary concern. It\u2019s a case of what might have been, with Liberals in the former Perrottet government in New South Wales putting together a multi-pronged effort to end native forest logging prior to last March\u2019s election. There were several strings to this bow but in particular the plan sought to generate carbon credits from reining-in the loss-making industry that would be used to compensate loggers and their communities (and pay for additions to the national park estate), as we report here this morning: There were several hurdles to this plan, not least the NSW Nationals who were not supportive. Another though, came from the Albanese government. A letter seeking changes to how carbon credits can be generated was sent by then environment minister James Griffin and energy minister (and treasurer) Matt Kean to their federal counterparts in December last year. However, neither Tanya Plibersek nor Chris Bowen bothered to reply, we understand. The election of the Minns Labor government in March has left a big question mark. It\u2019s not Labor policy to end native logging in state forests but given the depletion of the timber reserve (and all our precious critters therein) and the prospect of another bad bushfire season ahead, the issue is not going to disappear. Who knows, elements of the Liberal plan might even get picked up by Labor. It won\u2019t be easy for the opposition to reject their own scheme after all. BOM says weather will be just perfect for Matildas match The Bureau of Meteorology forecasts clear skies and dry conditions at the Accor Stadium in Sydney for the Matildas\u2019 first match of the Fifa Womens World Cup. Senior Department of Defence official Kathryn Campbell has been suspended without pay in the wake of the royal commission report into robodebt. Guardian Australia has confirmed that Campbell was suspended without pay, effective Monday 10 July \u2013 three days after the royal commission report was tabled. The Canberra Times was the first to report the suspension. The royal commission report tabled in parliament said Campbell, a former head of the Department of Human Services, had been \u201cresponsible for a department that had established, implemented and maintained an unlawful program\u201d. But Campbell \u201cdid nothing of substance\u201d when exposed to information that brought to light the illegality of income averaging, the report said, and \u201cfailed to act\u201d when presented with opportunities to obtain legal advice. The Department of Defence has previously declined to comment on Campbell\u2019s future as a senior adviser on Aukus projects. But when the royal commission report was released, the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said: Agency heads are of course empowered to take immediate action, pending further investigations, and I am very confident that they will. Campbell has not responded to media requests for comment after the royal commission report, but at the hearings Campbell defended her handling of the matter and said she had assumed the scheme was lawful despite earlier advice raising serious questions. During questioning at the royal commission, Campbell said: I have never been in a department that sought to mislead. And I have never been involved in an operation that has sought to mislead the government. Buy now and pay later used to pay for food and petrol as cost of living bites More people are being forced to use buy now pay later services to pay for basics such as food and petrol, as the cost of living and inflation continue to rise, AAP reports. The survey conducted by Financial Counselling Australia found more than 80% of counsellors said clients were using buy now pay later for general retail. A total of 71% said clients were using buy now pay later for food, and 41% said they were using it for petrol. Almost one-third said clients were using the services for utility bills. And 93% said more clients were using buy now pay later in general. Financial Counselling Australia chief executive Fiona Guthrie said she was concerned with the findings. BNPL was never intended as a way to pay for everyday living expenses. But the ease of accessing BNPL loans, combined with mounting cost-of-living pressures, has meant more people are resorting to it just to get by. Northern Territory chief minister Natasha Fyles says the government is extending takeaway alcohol restrictions in Alice Springs. Alcohol-related emergency department presentations at Alice Springs ospital have reduced by a third, alcohol related assaults have decreased, and domestic violence has halved since restrictions were introduced, according to evidence pointed to in a government statement. Fyles said: Alcohol-related harm is one of the Territory\u2019s biggest social challenges. From risk-based licensing to the Banned Drinkers Register, from the minimum floor price to our Police Auxiliary Liquor Inspectors, and with record funding for alcohol treatment services and domestic, family and sexual violence, we continue to do more than any previous government to tackle this problem. But we know we\u2019ve still got more work to do. Our police officers, our hospital staff and our social sector, who work in Alice have been loud and clear \u2013 they are all telling us that these restrictions need to stay in place. We are listening to them. I know that some retailers may not like this approach. It\u2019s a difficult decision, but it\u2019s the right decision. It has to be done. And I thank retailers and other businesses for continuing to work with us. Matildas official jersey sales running hot Will PNG field a team in the NRL?

Sold out crowd to watch Matildas tonight Support is pouring in for Australia\u2019s Matildas ahead of their match against Ireland opening Fifa\u2019s Womens World Cup tonight. Police say a knife-wielding man has been shot dead by police in Sydney, AAP reports. The officers were called to a home in inner-western Glebe just before midnight over concerns for a man\u2019s welfare. When police arrived they were confronted by a 43-year-old man armed with a knife. One officer discharged a Taser before another officer shot the man who was treated by paramedics but died at the scene. A critical incident team from the State Crime Command\u2019s omicide quad will investigate. The investigation will be subject to an independent review and oversight by the Coroner and the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission. For more updates on the fatal shooting in Auckland this morning, follow along with Helen Sullivan here: NZ shooting was in construction site New Zealand Police said the serious incident in Auckland\u2019s CBD involving a gunman unfolded after receiving reports of a person discharging a firearm inside a building under construction on lower Queen Street at around 7:22am. Police responded and cordoned off the area, and the Police Eagle helicopter was deployed. The offender moved through the building, continuing to discharge his firearm. On the upper levels of the building, the offender stayed inside an elevator shaft where police staff said they attempted to engage. \u201cFurther shots were fired from the male and he was located deceased a short time later,\u201d the police said. \u201cDetails around what has exactly occurred are still emerging and police will continue to provide updates around injuries and the circumstances.\u201d The incident comes on the eve of the Fifa World Cup, where Australia\u2019s Matildas are up against Ireland on the opening night. NZ shooter and two others dead in Auckland, police say New Zealand Police have confirmed the offender who opened fire in Auckland\u2019s CBD is deceased. They have also confirmed the death of two people, and multiple injuries. The incident that unfolded at a building under construction this morning has been contained, police say.

Reports of gunman on streets of Auckland Here are visuals of scenes unfolding in Auckland\u2019s CBD, where streets are cordoned off amid reports of an active gunman. Two people have been confirmed injured in an attack this morning, just hours before the Fifa Women\u2019s World Cup opening match, where Australia\u2019s Matildas are set to compete against Ireland. Opposition says Commonwealth Games not forced on Victoria Opposition leader John Pesutto says premier Daniel Andrews is misleading Victoria about the 2026 Commonwealth Games being forced onto the state. \u201cThe Commonwealth games were hunted for by the Andrews government,\u201d he says on 7\u2019s Sunrise program this morning. I regret to say to the Victorian people and the Australian people that he is pretending the games were forced on Victoria. They went hunting for it in 2021. There was no business case to back it up. They locked Victorians into something it now turns out we could never afford and the reason we are not running the games ultimately is because we are broke down here under the Andrews government. Police have cordoned off several streets in Auckland\u2019s CBD as they respond to a serious unfolding incident involving a reported gunman.

Read the full story here: HIV could be eliminated in Australia A bit of good news this morning, courtesy of AAP: Australia is on the brink of eliminating HIV. There has been a steady decline in rates of HIV recorded over the past decade, pointing us in the direction of eliminating the disease. Australia has recorded a steady 46% fall in rates of HIV over the past decade and could be on track to virtually eliminate the insidious disease. 555 cases were recorded in 2022, compared to a total of 1037 in 2013, figures released by the Kirby Institute today show. Australia\u2019s rate of decline is in line with other leading countries in northern Europe, and ahead of rates in the US and Canada. A \u201cvirtual\u201d elimination does not mean zero new cases of HIV \u2013 but an absence of sustained endemic community transmission. Sharon Lewin, the International AIDS Society president and director of the Peter Doherty Institute, said Australia has maintained a progressive approach to HIV since the very beginning of the pandemic in the early 1980s. Australia is poised to be one of the first, if not the first, countries to achieve virtual elimination of HIV. Gay and bisexual men still make up the majority of HIV diagnoses but now represent a smaller portion, accounting for 57% of new cases last year compared with 79% in 2013. Andrew Grulich, who heads the Kirby Institute\u2019s HIV epidemiology and prevention program, said the group could be virtually HIV-free within the next three to five years. Electricity prices increase The Australian Energy Regulator\u2019s new wholesale markets report found average spot prices in the national electricity market increased from April to June, compared to the preceding quarter, AAP reports. The onset of winter, the seasonal decline in solar generation, and reduced cheap coal capacity offered in Queensland and NSW has driven the higher demand. Looking at higher wholesale costs of electricity \u2013 the exit of the Liddell power station in April contributed to higher wholesale prices, but was partly offset by new solar, wind and battery capacity. Wind output reached record levels in June. East coast gas spot market prices averaged $14.50 per gigajoule \u2013 mostly due to supply constraints at the Longford gas plant, and transportation constraints on the Moomba to Sydney pipeline during a period of high Victorian demand. The Iona gas storage facility in Victoria finished the quarter at a record high level of capacity \u2013 the regulator said this is critical to managing extra demand. The regulator was pleased to see prices remain well below the highs of the second quarter of 2022 as states face the remaining winter months. \u201cThe second quarter of 2022 was an extremely challenging time for the sector,\u201d AER board member Justin Oliver said. We\u2019re pleased the factors that drove the high prices at that time weren\u2019t present to nearly the same extent this year. We have seen far fewer coal generator outages and more coal capacity offered into the market than the same period last year. The report warned higher-than-expected summer temperatures and lower-than -average rainfall will likely to contribute to higher prices in the first half of next year.

To the news! Start voice conversations with friends and family, Mayo urges Last week Guardian Australia revealed that Advance Australia was paying for social media advertising that claims the voice proposal was either too much or not enough, depending on the demographic targeted. O\u2019Brien has co-authored a handbook on the voice with referendum working group member Thomas Mayo. Mayo urged attendees at the Sydney campaign event to start conversations with friends and family about why they were voting \u2018yes\u2019. \u201cI want you to do that in a respectful way, in a way that will listen to their views so that you can put the best position back to them about why they should support it,\u201d the Kaurareg Aboriginal, Kalkalgal and Erubamle Torres Strait Islander man said. He said he believed \u201ca great majority\u201d of Indigenous people would vote for change in the referendum, due in the last quarter of 2023. Australians will be asked later this year whether they support an Indigenous advisory body being enshrined in the constitution. \u201cI see lies being told and not properly challenged,\u201d O\u2019Brien said on Wednesday night, AAP reports. \u201cI ask myself if there is a strength to the \u2018no\u2019 campaign against this referendum, why do the people substantially behind that campaign feel the need to lie? \u201cWhat does that tell us about the authenticity of what is motivating them? \u201cThese are questions that I believe should be dealt with in a transparent and strong way by media and I have not seen it.\u201d O\u2019Brien did not name individuals but called out the actions of the conservative political lobby Advance Australia. Good morning and welcome to our live news coverage. I\u2019m Martin Farrer and I\u2019ll be bringing you some of the best overnight stories before Rafqa Touma slips into the hot seat. Australia may lose its only chance for indigenous constitutional recognition if the referendum on the oice is defeated later this year, the minister for indigenous Australians has told a yes rally in Sydney. \u201cIf we miss this moment, we may never get it again,\u201d Linda Burney told a packed Sydney own hall on Wednesday night. Veteran journalist Kerry O\u2019Brien took aim at unnamed no campaigners, saying they were telling lies.

An Australian-led research team has uncovered the first genetic link to strong immunity against Covid-19, which may help to explain why some people never develop any symptoms of the illness. A person who carries one copy of the protective HLA-B15 gene is twice as likely to remain asymptomatic after infection with the Sars CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19, while someone who carries two copies of the gene is eight times more likely to have no symptoms, the research, published in the journal Nature, found.

This lorry wound its way along the East Neuk of Fife, dodging washing lines, mooring bollards and seagulls, parking with impunity to make deliveries. There was an understanding in the East Neuk that nobody would ever get angry and honk at the inbound \u201ctattie\u201d lorry, fish and chips being a staple meal, vital to the region\u2019s economy. Tourists come shocking distances to sit on old harbour walls and stab around in takeaway trays with wooden forks. The fish and chips sold in the East Neuk might be the best in the British Isles and because of that (it follows) the best on the planet. Even so, by July 2022, local friers were finding it harder and harder to balance their books. The driver of the tattie lorry, a red-cheeked Scotsman named Richard Murray, carried keys for most of the businesses on his route, to save from waking any tired friers who\u2019d been up late the night before, poring anxiously over their sums. War in Ukraine coupled with ongoing complications from Brexit had driven up prices of almost all the goods that fish and chip shops depended on, from live ingredients to oil and salt to packaging. More distressing was the problem of rising energy costs. This meal is prepared using a great guzzler of a range cooker that must be kept on and roiling at all hours of a trading day. As the price of gas and electricity threatened to double, then triple, through 2022, friers were opening their energy bills with gritted teeth. A trade association called the National Federation of Fish Friers said that as many as a third of the UK\u2019s 10,500 shops might go dark, warning of a potential \u201cextinction event\u201d. It was about 8am when Murray drove his tattie lorry into a village called Pittenweem. He was met on the road by Alec Wyse, a skilled frier, 59 years old and known as Eck, who ran a takeaway called the Pittenweem Fish Bar. The tiny shop had been bought by Wyse\u2019s father using money from the sale of a family fishing boat. There were nautical portraits on the walls. A peg-letter menu listed eight unchanging menu items, one of which was described in its entirety as \u201cFISH\u201d. Working together, Wyse and Murray unloaded sacks of potatoes from the lorry, carrying them inside on their shoulders. A mile along the shore from Pittenweem, in the smarter harbour town of Anstruther, Murray parked his lorry outside a fish and chip shop called the Wee Chippy. Founded by Ian Fleming, a 64-year-old seafood trader with a tattoo of a shark on his forearm, the Wee Chippy stood across from a seaweed-covered strip of beach and a cobbled jetty. Fleming later told me it ruined his marriage, this fish and chip shop. \u201cThe hours,\u201d he growled in explanation. Daily operations had long since passed to his business partner, a chef in his 40s called Chris Lewis. But Fleming kept a close eye on the Wee Chippy, which had absorbed such a big part of his life. Leaving Anstruther behind, the tattie round almost done, Murray swung his lorry inland, in the rough direction of Dundee and a fish and chip shop called the Popular. Bright and cramped, the Popular had an eye-catching facade that was painted brown and baize green, making it resemble a snooker table turned on one side. A family concern, the Popular was staffed six days a week by a man called Graham Forbes, his wife Angela, and their two adult children. Though Forbes was in his mid-70s, he was the one who rose early to let the tattie man in. He liked to get started at about the same time the sun came up, feeding potatoes into the Popular\u2019s rumbling peeler. These three businesses \u2013 the Pittenweem Fish Bar in Pittenweem, the Wee Chippy in Anstruther, the Popular in Dundee \u2013 shared not only a potato supplier but the near-religious devotion of the communities they serviced. They were run by men and women who had thick skins, literally so when it came to their fingertips, which had become so desensitised to heat that they could be brushed against boiling oil to better position a fillet of frying fish or test the readiness of chopped potatoes as they fizzed and crisped. But these people were not invulnerable to strain. By the following summer, two of the three businesses would be gone, forced to close against their owner\u2019s will. I visited the East Neuk several times during that difficult year: in high tourist season, in the eerie quiet of winter, in the limbo between. As a national industry foundered, I wanted to document what it was like for a group of friers as they were brought to the brink, competing against each other even as they helped each other out, always prepping for tomorrow, cooking for today, running their numbers at night, trying not to become yet another fish and chip shop that disappeared. Between July 2022 and July 2023, things got tougher and sadder in the East Neuk than anybody predicted they would. By the time I made my last visit, people were in mourning, having said goodbye to a beloved local figure who gave their all to a cherished, suddenly endangered trade; and it was no longer so difficult to imagine a world without fish and chips. * * * The origin question, wrote the historian John Walton in his definitive history of the dish, \u201cis a matter of murky and probably insoluble dispute\u201d. Should Londoners take the most credit for its creation and proliferation, or Lancastrians? The textile towns around Manchester or the fishing ports of Scotland? Undoubtedly, fish and chips is immigrant food, imported, perfected and perpetuated by a mish-mash of refugees and others originating from Portugal, Spain, eastern Europe, Italy, Cyprus, Greece and China. The method of deep-frying white fish in a liquid batter made of flour and egg or milk was likely brought over to London by Jews in flight from Catholic inquisitors. Walton and other food historians have identified chipped potatoes \u201cin the French style\u201d being sold from carts in the industrial Pennines as early as the 1860s. Whether styled as chippy, chippie, chippery, chipper, fishery, fish bar or fish restaurant, whether given cheerful punning titles (the Haddock Paddock, the Plaice to Be) or rootsier names that acknowledged their founders (Jimmy\u2019s, George\u2019s, Low\u2019s, Long\u2019s), these shops proliferated through the 20th century, carpeting the land from the northernmost \u2013 Frankie\u2019s, up in Shetland \u2013 all the way to the Smugglers, down on the tapering tip of Cornwall. The fundamental cooking method is always the same. Fillets of white fish, usually haddock or cod, are slapped about in a viscous yellow batter before being dropped into 180C baths of oil. An experienced frier will tend their bubbling fillets compulsively, using a metal strainer to turn and tease the food as the batter flares and hardens, basting with twitches of the wrist. After about five minutes, the battered fish will be golden, curved in on itself like a banana, firm enough to be set atop chips without surrendering its shape. As for the chips, these are made from white potatoes, peeled and cut to the thickness of thumbs, then placed in a steel basket and submerged in the same hot oil until they will crack apart when squeezed. There is resistance in Scotland towards the frying of cod, which is seen as an English lunacy, but it is generally accepted that potatoes grown in the drier soil of England do better when fried, being lower in glucose and less likely to caramelise. National pride stretches so far. Only not so far as brown chips. Ideally, just after eating a portion of fish and chips, you should be aware that what you\u2019ve put inside your body was prepared using ungodly quantities of grease, yet you don\u2019t yourself feel greasy. This paradoxical richness without grossness, an angelic lightness of touch in preparing one of the heaviest meals on Earth, sets the better shops apart. At the Golden Galleon in Aldeburgh, takeaways are lined up in paper pouches on the counter, the fish tumbled in with the chips, all to be eaten with a rooting fork. At the Ashvale in Aberdeen, the hungriest diners can order a \u201cwhale\u201d portion, so huge that anyone who finishes it unassisted wins a prize. Along a particular stretch of pavement in Holborn in London, pedestrians walk headlong into a bubble of airborne fat that seems to enclose a shop called the Fryer\u2019s Delight. They fry in beef dripping at the Delight, not vegetable oil, creating a flavour that is fattier, more unctuous. At the Popular in Dundee, Graham Forbes and his family cooked using beef dripping as well. Sit-in diners at the Popular huddled into wooden booths, sometimes packing so close, Forbes told me, that if those at table #1 were talking politics, those at tables #2 and #3 were inevitably talking politics as well. He tended not to think of the Popular as a business. It was a little world. And like any world, it had its points of pride, its stubborn habits. One day I spoke to a man up the supply chain who oversaw the weekly tattie runs through the East Neuk. His name is Conor Booth. He works for a Scottish company called John Callum Potatoes. Booth explained that the top fish and chip shops are kept consistent by generations of rolling tradition. But many of those traditions (the dawn calls to prep ingredients, the midnight equipment-scrubbing, the reliance on inefficient cookers) have made willing staff scarcer and costs harder to bring down. \u201cEvery industry has to adapt to survive,\u201d said Booth. \u201cUnfortunately, in fish and chips, there\u2019s only so much you can do while keeping it traditional. The potatoes need their peeling. The fish needs its frying.\u201d Last year, as trading conditions worsened, proprietors were giving interviews to local newspapers, explaining the pressures they were under. These communications tended to have the tone of panicky messages scribbled by hostages. At the Crispy Cod in Worcester, they said: \u201cIt feels like we have no control.\u201d The Gipsy Lane Chippery in Leicester: \u201cIt\u2019s scary.\u201d Paddy\u2019s Plaice in Criccieth: \u201cNeed help.\u201d In the town of Macduff in Scotland, a shop called the Happy Haddock received a bill that put up its energy costs from \u00a3600 a month to \u00a32,000. The Happy Haddock closed. Roughly the same thing happened at the Fryar Tuck in Belfast, then at Barnacle Bill\u2019s in Somerset, and Chip Ahoy on the Isle of Wight. At Chung\u2019s Chinese Chippy in Lancashire, a note to customers appeared in the window, similar in substance to the messages put on display at Stefano\u2019s in Glasgow and chalked on a blackboard outside Jones Plaice in Caldicot: \u201cDue to excessive price increases in all areas, raw materials, labour, fuel and utilities, we have decided to close.\u201d At the Popular in Dundee, the Forbes family issued a plea to customers via Facebook: \u201cUse us or lose us.\u201d Graham Forbes\u2019s son Lindsay had already given an interview to a Dundee newspaper that amounted to a forewarning of closure. A clipping of this article (\u201cCHIPPERS ARE BATTERED BY SOARING COSTS\u201d) was pinned to the Popular\u2019s fridge on the summer day the family huddled to make a decision. \u201cThis is the end,\u201d Graham said, \u201cisn\u2019t it?\u201d They telephoned the Dundee newspaper again, which published a story confirming the Popular would close after 35 years. Graham\u2019s daughter Gaynor put an announcement online. The next day, \u201cas soon as we opened the doors at 11.30am,\u201d Graham said, \u201cwe were mobbed. Generations of customers. Grandparents. Grandkids. People asked, why? I told them the enjoyment had gone out of it, from worrying all the time. I told them, if you\u2019d kept coming, even just once a fortnight, it might have been different.\u201d * * * Before the main danger to fish and chip shops was the quarterly energy bill, it was sudden fire. Ignored for a moment, the hot cooking fat can get too hot, rising to an auto-ignition point and exploding. In a single year \u2013 2018 \u2013 there were serious fires at Old Salty\u2019s in Glasgow, the Admiral in Overseal, Mr Chips in Fakenham, the Pilton Fryer in Pilton, the Fish Bar in Fenham, Crossroads in Kingstanding, Graylings in Fremington, the River Lane Fish Bar in Norfolk, the Portway Fish Bar in Rowley Regis, Bruno\u2019s on Canvey Island, Jimmy\u2019s Palace in Liverpool, Scoffs in Paignton and Moby Dick in Shirley. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter how experienced you are,\u201d said Chris Lewis, one of the owners of the Wee Chippy in Anstruther, \u201cif something mechanical goes, or something catches, and you haven\u2019t seen it \u2013 that\u2019s it, that\u2019s your time.\u201d The Wee Chippy\u2019s time came on Remembrance Sunday in 2018, in the middle of a lunch service. A frier was distracted; the oil in the range ignited; a huge ball of fire was sucked into the Wee Chippy\u2019s ventilator, leaving just enough time for staff and customers to flee before the ground floor was thick with smoke. In the subsequent blaze, unpeeled potatoes from the tattie lorry blistered and shrunk in their sacks. About 100 North Sea haddocks cooked inside a fridge. Jars of pickled eggs boiled and burst. Lewis and Ian Fleming, who both live nearby, came running. They watched from across the harbour road as the glass in the windows of their shop began to melt and pulsate. Jets of orange flame licked out the chimney pots. Fleming (he of the shark tattoo) had opened this fish and chip shop in 1999, in perverse defiance of the fact that there was already a popular alternative, the Anstruther Fish Bar, just a short way along the harbour road. After the 2018 fire, Fleming\u2019s insurance claim was rejected. \u201cWe were classed as having a flammable material behind the plasterboard,\u201d he told me. He talked it over with Lewis and they decided to spend their own money on a refurbishment, if only to give the insurance company as well as their rivals in Anstruther \u201ca kick in the nuts\u201d, as Fleming put it. Between them they spent nine months and a six-figure sum getting the Wee Chippy back open in summer 2019. Now, in summer 2022, conditions were tougher than Fleming had ever known them. As consumers battled rising costs of living at home, they were eating out less. Because they were eating out less, proprietors were being forced to charge more, right when they could least afford to discourage custom. There is a fish bar in Cardiff, John\u2019s, that shut in 2001 and has never been bought or altered since. A decaying menu at John\u2019s still advertises a takeaway portion of fish and chips for the unthinkable price of \u00a32.45. Two decades later, the same meal cost \u00a39.40 at the Wee Chippy. Few proprietors dared breach the holy barrier of \u00a310. In fact, the owners of a shop called Caf\u00e9 Fish in Belfast had done some honest maths and concluded that, given prevailing costs, fish and chips ought to be selling for about \u00a315 per portion. \u201cWho would pay it?\u201d Fleming wondered. If motivation ever flagged at the Wee Chippy, Fleming and Lewis only had to think of their nearest rivals up the road. For decades the Wee Chippy had been engaged in a losing battle with the Anstruther Fish Bar, which had achieved outsized fame since it opened in the 1980s, doing much to establish the East Neuk as an area of excellence for fish and chips. Prince William was a customer there during his student days. His stepmother Camilla later stopped a royal motorcade on the harbour road and sent in a security guard for takeaways. The Anstruther Fish Bar had won every industry award going. It was celebrated in guidebooks and travel pieces. Sometimes, Fleming and Lewis watched through the windows of their shop as tourists parked on the terrace outside, wandering along the harbour to eat at the Anstruther Fish Bar, later compounding the insult by putting their scraped-clean takeaway trays in the Wee Chippy\u2019s bins. Over time there had been squabbles between the two neighbouring businesses over property, parking, staffing, branding, packaging, naming rights, as well as dibs on who could sell which variety of savoury pudding. Such rivalries were quite common, I learned. One day I got talking to an East Neuk man called Murray Cameron, a former fisherman who now ran a mobile fish-and-chips service out of a modified Vauxhall Movano van. Cameron had his own beef with the Anstruther Fish Bar. And with the Wee Chippy. Cameron said he had spent years perfecting the precise blend of flour and grains he put in his batter mix; and because of this he tended to hide his empty packaging in the bottom of his bins, fearful of his secret getting out. In every corner of the country there are friers who fret about their nearest rivals, hourly remaking the same dish until they are tweaking it minutely, improving the batter-cling, the chip-give, vying to be thought of as number one. By now I\u2019d spent enough time in the East Neuk to notice that whenever friers complained about each other, there was one family \u2013 the Wyses of Pittenweem \u2013 they exempted from criticism. Eck Wyse and his relatives had run the Pittenweem Fish Bar since the 1980s, taking it over from the Baird family, before them the Smalls. This was a seriously adored village hub, one of the few places in Pittenweem that remained open after dark. The Wyses\u2019 ancient cooker, wide as the room that contained it and submarine-like in appearance, turned out takeaways that were passed to customers the old fashioned way, wrapped in paper. Though the Pittenweem Fish Bar wasn\u2019t often included in tourist books or internet must-try lists, people in the region knew how rare and special it was, an inexpensive gem that seemed to stand outside of time. When the Pittenweem Fish Bar burned down at the end of summer 2022, it was a trauma felt for miles. * * * The fire started on a Tuesday afternoon, hours after the tattie lorry passed through on a run. Flames massed in the cramped interior of the shop, burning up the net curtains, popping out windows, sending a shaft of dark smoke over Pittenweem\u2019s church and towards the sea. A passing neighbour rushed in to drag out Wyse, who had been cooking at the range and, according to a later account by an eyewitness, was dazed by smoke. Fire engines were on the scene for hours. By morning the shop was unrecognisable, its painted sign gone, the front walls blistered and cracked. When he drove through Pittenweem again in October 2022, Richard Murray slowed down his tattie lorry to pass the ruined shop. He turned off his music. \u201cDevastating,\u201d he muttered. Arriving in Anstruther soon afterwards, Murray parked near the seaweed-covered beach as usual. He fell into conversation with Ian Fleming, who was waiting in the chill outside the Wee Chippy, peering along the harbour road. \u201cTown\u2019s quieting down,\u201d Fleming observed. Murray nodded. As they started to unload sacks of potatoes, the two men chatted about the terrible frequency of fires in their industry. In former times, Fleming said, you could try to rebuild after a fire, just about trusting that the fish-and-chip economy would support you. Even after the Wee Chippy was denied its insurance payout back in 2018, the market seemed stable enough to make the risk of reinvestment worthwhile. Now, in 2022, when uncertainty prevailed, would it even be possible to bring a burned fish and chip shop back? \u201cThat\u2019s where you worry about Eck,\u201d Murray said to Fleming. \u201cAye,\u201d growled Fleming. \u201cSeen him?\u201d Fleming shook his head. \u201cI texted.\u201d A lot of people in the East Neuk had been sharing memories of the Pittenweem shop, using Facebook forums to gather anecdotes and photographs. Former employees at the fish bar spoke of after-school jobs peeling or cleaning. Customers memorialised favourite orders. That autumn, when I visited an East Neuk seafood business run by a family called the Wilsons, the two married owners reminisced about a courtship spent eating unimprovable Pittenweem takeaways. People stood in queues so long, Wendy Wilson remembered, the line would snake away from the Wyses\u2019 door, beyond the local bank, wrapping around the village church. Since the fire, the village had lost something irreplaceable: a queue to join, a set of flavours and smells, an illuminated place to go after dark, a takeaway to eat on a sea wall. It is an article of faith that fish and chips tastes better \u2013 best \u2013 when eaten by the sea. I\u2019ve agreed with this sentiment all my life, without wondering why it might be so, except to think that being near a shoreline must equate to freshness of fish. It did used to be the case that many East Neuk villages could support their own seafood markets. When the Pittenweem Fish Bar first opened in the 1980s, haddocks were bought off the boats in Pittenweem harbour. Today, an auction house in Peterhead on the north-east tip of Scotland is all that\u2019s left on one whole side of the country. Almost every haddock that is fried in the East Neuk has been trucked 100 miles south from Peterhead first. Why, then, should fish and chips by the sea taste special? In a place like this, I think it must be the continued intimacy between fish as a trade and fish as a meal. As well as part-owning the Wee Chippy, Ian Fleming is a seafood trader. He is the son of a seafood trader. Before he became a frier, Eck Wyse was a fisherman, the son of a fisherman. Down on Pittenweem harbour, two bronze statues \u2013 a mother and a daughter \u2013 face the choppy water, memorialising all the local people who have tried to make a living from the sea, as well as the 400 or so who have died trying since the 1800s. Decades ago, Fleming\u2019s father-in-law drowned in a fishing accident. Many, many people in the East Neuk have lost a friend, an uncle, a cousin. Fishing is a serious matter here. Fish and chips is a serious meal. * * * It was December 2022. The Pittenweem Fish Bar had burned down. The Popular in Dundee was closed. The Wee Chippy clung on, though tourists would not visit the East Neuk in any sort of number again until the spring. After about 5pm, the whole coast could seem abandoned, just the tide audible in the dark as well as the grumble of salt lorries as they gritted the roads in case of a freeze. When I visited Fleming at his house on the outskirts of Anstruther, he opened his ledger to see how many haddocks they were getting through at the Wee Chippy in the offseason. Not so many haddocks, he frowned, putting aside the book. \u201cWe\u2019re telling ourselves that business is down because of the frozen roads. That might be denial.\u201d In Dundee, the Forbes family had stripped and emptied the Popular, selling off a fridge, a chest freezer, a bain marie, two menu boards, as well as their till and the small paper rolls that were meant for future receipts. Tables #1, #2 and #3 were uprooted and taken away for use in a restaurant in Inverness. Lindsay Forbes accepted a job with a wholesaler. Graham and Angela Forbes retired. The next time Graham walked by the Popular, around Christmas, there was a \u201cTo Let\u201d sign in the window. He could still see his own tacked-up notice to customers, explaining the closure. \u201cNo other option,\u201d Graham had written. In Pittenweem, charred wood and plaster were heaped on the pavement outside the ruined fish bar. Cones and metal fencing stopped passersby getting too close. The scene appeared frozen in time since the fire, even though months had passed, even though the Wyse family had written a message to customers saying they hoped to \u201crise from the ashes\u201d if they could. Murray Cameron, the mobile frier who travelled around the villages of the East Neuk in his van, had never once encroached on Wyse\u2019s territory in Pittenweem. It was his tribute to Wyse, his show of confidence that one day Wyse would bring this business back. Behind the scenes, as a member of the Wyse family later told a local newspaper, Eck was taking the closure badly. \u201cLike losing a limb,\u201d said his wife, Anna. As more and more weeks went by without the fire damage being cleared, Fleming began to doubt the prospects of a revival. He had experienced a blaze at first hand. He remembered how crushing it was, waiting weeks and months to get answers from an insurance company \u2013 all for nothing in the end, because the Wee Chippy\u2019s claim was refused. As 2022 turned to 2023, and another month passed without the wreckage outside the Pittenweem Fish Bar being cleared, Fleming worried more and more about his friend. Elsewhere around the country, a fish and chip shop called the Little Fryer in Southampton had to close. Unsustainable costs. The Dolphin in Belfast closed, as did the Seafarer in Northwich and the High Plaice in Alston. The owners of Simpsons in Quedgeley felt they were busy, thriving even. But their energy bill had quadrupled, so it closed. Staff at the Whieldon Fish Bar in Stoke-on-Trent told their local newspaper they were clinging on by leaving the lights off whenever they could. Simeone\u2019s in Glasgow was listed for sale, along with about 700 other fish and chip shops including the Ocean King in Gosport, the Haddock Paddock in Cumbria and Ightenhill Traditional in Burnley. Smarts in Abingdon closed. At the end of January 2023, Fleming received a text message from a friend. He was told that Eck had died that day. It was sudden. The police were not treating the death as suspicious. The family put out a photograph, online, that showed Eck behind the range at his old fish and chip shop. \u201cWhere he was happiest,\u201d they wrote, \u201cwhere he belonged.\u201d * * * There are fancier meals than fish and chips. There are bigger-ticket meals, those we put on bucket lists or pencil in for birthdays. We look to fish and chips for something different, which I think of as constancy, a firm handrail to our pasts. As a schoolboy I often bought lunch from Andrews in Enfield, where they would douse a takeaway with the leftover brine from pickled gherkins. Later I went to university in Yorkshire. The taste of sweet curry sauce over chips will forever turn me 18. My parents\u2019 parents were from different backgrounds. Every spring, at Passover, my maternal family would gather to eat fried fish from a London takeaway. Every autumn, we would drive 500 miles north to visit my paternal family in Aberdeen. My Jewish grandma and my Protestant gran were very different people. Both put absolute trust in fried fish as a food that would unite and enthuse a bunch of disparate relatives. The same as hearing a Beatles tune, or rewatching The Snowman at Christmas, or raising up a pint of foaming beer, fish and chips is a national pleasure we expect to repeat and repeat. Impossible to imagine eating this meal for the last time. When a shop called Kong\u2019s in Greater Manchester announced it would close, following so many others, people massed outside as if for a wake. There was a one-hour wait to get inside, then a two-hour wait. In the queue they joked about buying extra portions, to freeze them and sell them on to anybody suffering Kong\u2019s withdrawals. We don\u2019t expect these takeaways to be taken away. We imagine dining-in in perpetuity. In spring 2023, the Lowford Fish Bar in Bursledon closed, its owners describing the decision as the hardest of their lives. At around the same time, Jack Spratt\u2019s Superior in Oldham closed after 25 years of continuous trading. Skircoat Green Fish Bar in Halifax closed after 40 years. Jackson\u2019s Chippie in Ilkeston closed after 62 years. The owner of Sam\u2019s Fish Bar in Fenton said he was moonlighting as a delivery driver to stay afloat. Pawsons Golden Plaice in Chorley closed. Earlier this month, I was back on a tattie run through the East Neuk. The weekly delivery was no longer being driven by Richard Murray. It was no longer weekly. With fewer businesses to sell to, potato orders in the region were often so reduced that Murray\u2019s boss, Conor Booth, could handle a delivery using his pickup truck. Booth met me in the truck and we thundered along the coast road. It was raining, \u201ca real dreich\u201d, Booth said. As we went, he talked about potato prices, twice what they were a year ago and causing yet another threat to businesses. There had been a weak seasonal yield. It was unfortunate timing. In fish and chips, Booth said, \u201cif there wasn\u2019t bad luck, there wouldn\u2019t be any luck\u201d. Booth had a one-month-old baby waiting for him at home and he was eager to finish the delivery run and get back. Parenthood had brought up a confusion of memories, he said, as well as premonitions about the future. He had been remembering driving around with his granddad when he was small, hearing about vanished local businesses, some of which were impossible for him to picture. That used to be a boot-maker, his granddad would say, pointing. That used to be a knife-sharpener. Booth wondered if he would drive a grandchild of his own along this coast; if he would have to explain, there used to be these places we called fish bars. It stopped raining. Booth delivered some final potatoes, then let me out of the truck at Pittenweem cemetery. As the sky brightened overhead, the damp reddish gravel of the cemetery paths started to dry, getting its crunch back. The night before Wyse\u2019s funeral in February, there had been a great spectacle in these skies \u2013 an aurora that flared purple and green. The following morning there was another extraordinary sight in Pittenweem. The village was full of people, not only Wyse\u2019s family and friends but his customers, hundreds of whom had turned out to say goodbye. There were so many mourners that the church did not have enough pews. They ran out of standing room. Mourners left outside started to line the route to the cemetery and later joined the funeral procession as it passed. Wyse was buried next to his father, who had run the family shop before him. After paying my respects, I walked along the coast to Anstruther. It was teatime. The harbour was busy with boats. Riggings clacked and hissed in the breeze. A dad on a bench fed his toddler, one scrap of batter at a time. A middle-aged couple sat in their car. They had a tray propped between them, two teas in china cups, cutlery from home, and steaming takeaway boxes on their laps. At about 6pm, I met Ian Fleming outside the Wee Chippy. They had a good number of customers in the dining room. The shop was enjoying a bit of a summer-season revival, Fleming said. They had recently won a Scottish catering award, beating their rivals up the road for once. The Wee Chippy would abide through another summer at least. We waited and got a table. The waitress asked, do you want fish and chips? \u2022 This article was amended on 20 July 2023 to replace a map which misspelt Kirkcaldy. \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, listen to our podcasts here and sign up to the long read weekly email here."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b22353", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2023/jul/20/womens-world-cup-2023-golden-boot-top-goalscorers-game-by-game", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Women\u2019s World Cup 2023 Golden Boot: top goalscorers, game by game", "lead": "The Golden Boot is awarded to the player who scores most goals in the tournament.

It\u2019s a question I found myself asking when faced with a recent commission, a request for a composition to mark the 250th anniversary of the sermon that became known as Amazing Grace. On the face of it, the task looked fairly simple; I was being invited to write a choral piece for a concert that would be the summation of a year-long round of events, lectures, displays and discussions, with one of the world\u2019s most iconic hymns at its centre. Two major concerns were raised from the outset, however. The first was about the problematic past of the man who penned the sermon that became Amazing Grace. That man was John Newton. Born in Wapping in 1725, Newton went to sea aged 11 and, after an ignominious career in the Royal Navy, transferred to working in the slave trade, captaining slave ships and investing in further operations once a stroke caused him to retire from the sea. A spiritual conversion during an intense storm in 1748 did not initially dampen his enthusiasm for the slave trade but after joining the clergy he served at Olney in Buckinghamshire where he wrote Amazing Grace, and in the later years of his life he became an active abolitionist. He lived long enough to see the Slave Trade Act pass through parliament in 1807, the year of his death. Reactions to Newton\u2019s most famous words today can be mixed. To some, his slave-trading past cannot easily be ignored or in any sense redeemed by his later activities. And yet ironically, Amazing Grace has become almost an unofficial anthem for the civil rights movement in the US and is especially prominent among Black Americans, sung famously by a raft of soul singers and even by President Obama. The words can also suit any occasion, from wedding to funeral, from protest to presidential inauguration, from reverential church service to massed singalong. The 250th anniversary is certainly worthy of recognition, but Olney\u2019s most famous curate and lyricist brings with him a story that needs contextualisation. The other concern is a more personal one for me as a musician: the melody. It\u2019s not just any melody; it is one of the strongest, most recognisable, most enthralling melodies to have emerged from western folk music. Often referred to by the name New Britain, it was conjoined with Newton\u2019s words in 1835 and the two have been inseparable ever since. Just say the words \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d to anyone and the tune will play in their heads (and that\u2019s if they don\u2019t immediately start to hum or sing it out loud). Bagpipers play it ceaselessly outside the Houses of Parliament. Newton\u2019s words always come to mind. It is the words that are being commemorated this year, not the melody. More than that, as I have been invited to write a new piece of music around the words, to end with an audience singalong of the old melody would render anything I have written largely redundant \u2013 the folk tune is so strong, it would easily obliterate my new notes. But just as obviously, to write a new piece of music about Amazing Grace without referencing the New Britain tune would be quite unthinkable. So there was my brief; commemorate the anniversary of Amazing Grace without celebrating or glorifying its author, acknowledge that its history is troublesome, and also without referring too closely to the melody that has contributed so much to making those words globally iconic. OK. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I was delighted to have been selected for this challenge. One benefit was that I am effectively an outsider; I do not live near Olney or Milton Keynes, the centre of Amazing Grace 250 commemorations. If I am known within the music profession for anything, it is not for any association with singing this hymn. This enabled me to take an objective stance. But I needed someone to help tell me the story, or, more than that, decide what story to tell. My piece could not be a music biography of John Newton or an \u201corigin cantata\u201d describing the birth of the sermon-hymn text. I turned to writer and academic Rommi Smith. She travelled from her home in Leeds to conduct hours of painstaking interviews with interested parties from the Olney area and indeed far beyond. She painstakingly assembled testimonies from individuals, all of whom had a very personal response to Amazing Grace, responses that were varied and often in opposition to each other. Rommi presented me with a series of carefully crafted poems based on her interviews, each poem prompted by a different question concerning the meaning and legacy of AG250 for people today. Hence the question mark included in the title of Rommi\u2019s work \u2013 Forever? I immediately felt the possibility of musical responses to her words and her clever, varied poetic structures; it inspired me both in terms of my emotional response and also from a musical, architectural standpoint. I had been asked to write for a local community gospel group, the Sweet Sound Choir, created especially for this occasion. I knew I wanted them to propel my piece with their infectious energy and quickly identified which of Rommi\u2019s poems would suit such writing. I was also composing for an instrumental chamber ensemble derived from majority Black and ethnically diverse orchestra Chineke! with the addition of two vocal soloists, a mezzo-soprano and a tenor. My eventual choice of instruments, including strings, flute, trumpet and trombone, and also a saxophone, electric bass, keyboard and percussion, gave me a wide range of colours to choose from. It has allowed me to inhabit many musical styles which I hope will reflect the wide range of personal testimonies. The resulting piece consists of 10 movements; the answers to 10 questions posed during Rommi\u2019s research interviews. While I begin, almost unavoidably, by quoting the irrepressible New Britain melody, it is soon varied, stretched, parodied, expanded and ultimately lost (which one can interpret metaphorically in any way one wishes) in order that new themes can emerge. The movements vary between voices, solo and chorus, and different instruments come to the fore so that each song has its own sound world. I write in a gospel style for some movements (as I have been gifted a gospel choir!) and in various other styles elsewhere. There is even a piano jazz movement that nods to John Dankworth and Cleo Laine, founders of the Stables venue, where the piece will receive its premiere as part of the IF: Milton Keynes international festival. I hope the result will satisfy as many parties as possible: those who revere Amazing Grace, those who hold it in contempt, those who feel a personal ownership of it, and those who have magical stories to tell, stories brought about by their acquaintance with these immensely powerful words. I hope Rommi and I will have done justice to the testimonies we have received. And I hope I might have written a couple of decent tunes in the process. Forever? is at IF: Milton Keynes international festival on 22 July.

Beckham was, after all, the catalyst for the growth of a league that now boasts arguably the greatest player of all time. Messi, who was presented to a crowd of 20,000 Inter Miami fans on Sunday, could now be the catalyst for something more. \u201cThere will always be a before and after Lionel Messi,\u201d Jorge Mas said in the South Florida rain, which the Inter Miami co-owner poetically called \u201choly water\u201d. Even amid the downpour, which threatened to wash out the event, there was a sense that Messi\u2019s unveiling marked the start of a new era for MLS. The 36-year-old is expected to make his Inter Miami debut against Cruz Azul this Friday, although he may not start the match. Messi was unveiled alongside Sergio Busquets, his former Barcelona teammate who has also made the switch to Inter Miami. Jordi Alba didn\u2019t attend, but he too is also expected to join soon. Meanwhile, speculation is swirling around Luis Su\u00e1rez, another of Messi\u2019s former Bar\u00e7a teammates \u2013 reports in Argentina claim Su\u00e1rez has been talking to Inter Miami for months. That Messi is already attracting more household names to MLS is notable and offers some validation to a league that took unprecedented measures to land the Argentinian. Not only will Messi collect an annual salary of somewhere between $50m and $60m, his contract includes commercial incentives related to Adidas jersey sales and Apple TV+ subscribers. Messi was also offered equity in Inter Miami for good measure. Of course, MLS has bent its own rules to sign a player before. Back in 2007, the league gave Beckham the option to buy a franchise for just $25m. A decade later, the former England captain activated that clause to establish Inter Miami at a time when MLS franchise spots are going for as much as $500m (see the recent expansion into San Diego). Beckham\u2019s move also created the Designated Player (DP) rule, a mechanism that allows clubs to spend above their salary cap to sign stars. Without \u2018The Beckham Rule,\u2019 as it was initially dubbed, the likes of Thierry Henry, Kak\u00e1 and Wayne Rooney never would have played in MLS. It ensured Beckham wouldn\u2019t be the last international star to join the league. One wonders how Messi\u2019s move will change the way MLS attracts players. Players and agents around the world will have noted how Messi\u2019s Inter Miami contract is heavily incentivised. The more money MLS makes from Messi, the more money Messi himself makes. What\u2019s to stop prospective signings asking for a cut of the same deals Messi is now tied into? It could even change the global transfer landscape as a whole. Michael Jordan raised the ceiling on what athletes could earn from endorsement deals by demanding a cut of every Air Jordan shoe sold. Now, revenue sharing is commonplace with athletes more protective of their image rights than they were even a decade ago. Could Messi\u2019s Inter Miami deal change soccer contracts in a similar way? Many already see him as soccer\u2019s Jordan. On a more micro level, Messi\u2019s arrival in MLS will surely prompt many within the league to reconsider its restrictive roster rules. At present, MLS clubs are permitted to have just three DPs at any given time. While the rule originally helped to protect the league from reckless spending and the mistakes made during the NASL era, it is now holding back clubs from realising their full potential. Not only could MLS clubs be given more freedom to spend as they like, MLS\u2019s trade and transfer rules could do with some untangling. While the rest of world soccer uses transfer gossip to generate year-round headlines and interest, MLS complicates such discussion for the casual fan by wrapping it up in unnecessary jargon. Does anyone truly understand what GAM and TAM is? Or why the the Discovery List, which essentially allows clubs to call dibs on a player, still exists? The league\u2019s commissioner, Don Garber, insists he doesn\u2019t view the Saudi Pro League as a threat, but MLS figures should be looking at how many star players are joining Saudi clubs this summer and pondering how to open up the transfer trade route to the USA and Canada. Barriers must come down. Some of the bigger clubs with richer owners want to spend more money, so let them \u2013 albeit within some sort of structure that retains a semblance of parity. Mas is unsurprisingly believed to be pushing this point among MLS owners now he has Messi\u2019s signing to underline his argument. \u201cWe have a special moment to capitalise on,\u201d said Garber. That moment doesn\u2019t just include Messi\u2019s arrival at Inter Miami, but the 2024 Copa America, 2025 Club World Cup and 2026 World Cup. MLS has a new landmark 10-year, $2.5bn broadcast deal with Apple, has recently renewed its long-term partnership with Adidas until 2030 for a reported $830m and kicks off an entirely new competition (the Leagues Cup) this weekend. In almost every way, MLS has entered its most significant period of transition since Beckham joined the LA Galaxy 16 years ago. With Messi now part of the league, the opportunity is obvious, but MLS can\u2019t afford to sit back and think the job is done. Instead, it should push everyone within American soccer to strive for better. Messi joining Inter Miami won\u2019t change MLS on its own."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b22356", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/20/pet-by-catherine-chidgey-review-a-teachers-masterclass-in-manipulation", "primaryCategory": "books", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Pet by Catherine Chidgey review \u2013 a teacher\u2019s masterclass in manipulation", "lead": "A Catholic primary school in New Zealand provides the setting for this atmospheric tale of cruelty and betrayal", "author": "Catherine Taylor", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 08:00:23", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.230900", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/ddb1dd3f997b359d092afa2c6f02ec66b2c9ab64/0_119_2338_1403/500.jpg", "body": "On first reading, New Zealand author Catherine Chidgey\u2019s new novel has little in common with her previous one, the Women\u2019s prize-longlisted Remote Sympathy. That book, set mainly in Buchenwald concentration camp during 1943-44, focused on the unlikely affinity between a Jewish doctor prisoner and his patient, the terminally ill wife of one of the camp\u2019s Nazi administrators. It is worlds away from Pet, set in a Catholic primary school in a Wellington suburb in the 1980s, and a care home in Auckland 30 years later. And yet the claustrophobic, slightly surreal aspect of this school, its random violence, racism, misogyny and oppressive authoritarianism, are not dissimilar to the themes of Remote Sympathy, while Chidgey again displays her prodigious talent for psychological suspense and minutely evoking past eras. Justine, an only child whose mother died of breast cancer a year before, is 12 in 1984. Like all her classmates in their last year of primary school at St Michael\u2019s, she is in thrall to their new teacher, Mrs Price, who is \u201cyounger than our parents, and prettier than our mothers\u201d. Superficiality and manipulation \u2013 whether by means of body image or religion \u2013 are uppermost in this book. Mrs Price \u201cwore her wavy blond hair with a deep fringe like Rebecca De Mornay in Risky Business \u2013 not that we\u2019d been allowed to see the film, because it wasn\u2019t suitable. Around her neck a gold crucifix, with a tiny gold figure of Jesus, all ribs and thorns.\u201d Mrs Price \u2013 whose husband and daughter are alleged to have died in a car accident, adding to her mystique \u2013 is all ribs and thorns too, existing on diet milkshakes, little brown pills, faux sweetness and actual sadism. \u201cMy classroom, my rules,\u201d as she coolly explains to Justine. Mrs Price runs her domain on a sinister divide-and-conquer basis. Individual students are selected as \u201cpets\u201d \u2013 to clean the blackboard dusters after class, collect Mrs Price\u2019s endless prescriptions from the pharmacy \u2013 before being inexplicably dropped from favour, to their disorientation and dismay. The atmosphere is redolent with mistrust and competitiveness, especially among the girls. Justine, who suffers from seizures and is lonely and unpopular, apart from her friendship with classmate Amy, is taken up by Mrs Price, who presents herself as a substitute mother. Amy is swiftly shunned when Justine becomes part of an exclusive set who swarm around Mrs Price, acting on her every whim. In one particularly discomfiting scene at Mrs Price\u2019s house, the girls are egged on not only to verbally condemn their classmates but to dress up their teacher, plaster her with garish makeup and even shave her \u201csilky golden\u201d legs. She is a human idol, in contrast to the passive statue of the Virgin Mary at school, \u201cher heart full of roses and fire\u201d. Chidgey\u2019s examination of sexual politics is ruthless, with the girls crudely ranking each other in terms of prettiness and thinness and avidly watching beauty contests on TV. At school, the children are primed for a morbid fascination with death, from the cruel treatment of the classroom\u2019s pet salamander to the shocking events that play out later in the novel. Lessons on the Indigenous history of Australasia, meanwhile, simply reinforce colonialism. Amy, from a Chinese family, is systematically bullied and ostracised. Karl, the class prankster, who is M\u0101ori, is singled out for excessive corporal punishment by the headteacher, \u201cwho strapped us for bad behaviour, and sometimes \u2026 drew blood\u201d. Justine\u2019s father Neil, an antiques dealer, is kind but depressed, with his \u201csad drinks and sad records\u201d. Soon he falls into Mrs Price\u2019s orbit. When students\u2019 belongings start to go missing from the classroom, Pet\u2019s sticky tension rises by uncomfortable degrees. The novel hums with the low-level fever of adolescent boredom and betrayal, as well as providing an indelible portrait of a country still mired in \u201ctradition\u201d. Even popular culture is subject to a geographically induced time lag, adding to the paradoxically unmoored sense of living in a place that is a very long way from anywhere else. Less successful is the rather camp acceleration of the plot into high-octane thriller territory, and the book\u2019s too-neat denouement, set decades afterwards in 2014. Despite this, Chidgey\u2019s grasp of the slipperiness and self-delusion of memory \u2013 from Justine as an increasingly unreliable narrator, to her father\u2019s later dementia \u2013 is faultless. \u2022 Pet is published by Europa (\u00a314.99).

The grocery sector has been under pressure in recent months, with food producers facing a surge in cost of ingredients and retailers trying to keep prices low to attract customers.

Riyad Mahrez is another Saudi Pro League signing that will need replacing. Manchester City think they know just the man for the job: Raphinha. Barcelona need to get a few quid into the coffers in order to carry on with their summer dealings, so a deal could make sense for a fee of \u00a340m. In recent weeks, Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix made it abundantly clear to Atl\u00e9tico Madrid that he fancies a move to Barcelona to reignite his career after a tough season in the capitals of Spain and England. Aleksandar Mitrovic has headed on to Fulham\u2019s pre-season tour to USA with a frown. The striker is not happy that he is still at the club, who are unwilling to sell him to Al-Hilal for anything less than \u00a352m because he is a decent Premier League striker with his best years ahead of him. Mitrovic has, supposedly, told relatives he will never play for the club again. Interestingly, Al-Hilal are still pushing to make Fulham\u2019s Marco Silva their new head coach. On Fulham\u2019s own radar is Ajax defender Calvin Bassey, who they have offered \u00a315m for, which is less than the fee the Dutch club paid for him 12 months ago, so seems unlikely to succeed. There is still plenty of back and forth to be had between Chelsea and Brighton over the sale of Mois\u00e9s Caicedo. The Seagulls rejected an opening bid in the region of \u00a370m but the Blues are set to return with an offer of \u00a380m in the hope they can procure the midfielder. With Harry Kane\u2019s future up in the air, it would be sensible for Tottenham to make a contingency plan or two. One player they are monitoring is Flamengo\u2019s Pedro. The Brazilian once had an underwhelming spell with Fiorentina but is willing to give Europe another go. What is the latest with Kane? Well \u2026 supposedly he is \u201c50/50\u201d about staying or going. Spanish full-back Iv\u00e1n Fresneda is, supposedly, wanted by Barcelona, Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund \u2026 but Bournemouth have somehow stolen a march on them and could nab the 18-year-old Real Valladolid defender for around \u00a315m. With Harvey Barnes Newcastle-bound, Leicester are continuing to clear the decks after relegation and midfielder Boubakary Soumar\u00e9 is another player they are willing to sell. Napoli and Torino are keen on the Frenchman, but do not expect much of a bidding war. Change is certainly needed at Everton and one man they have earmarked to provide that is Ajax forward Brian Brobbey. The 21-year-old is in his second spell with the club, scoring a respectable 13 in 32 league matches last season."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b22359", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/20/i-was-a-football-atheist-until-the-womens-world-cup-arrived-how-do-i-pick-a-team-or-can-i-cheer-for-everyone", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "subCategories": "test", "title": "I was a football atheist until the Women\u2019s World Cup arrived.

I don\u2019t mean people who actually play football (that looks exhausting), but people committed to chasing the fortunes of a particular team. I crave that kind of religious fervour, while remaining a staunch sports atheist. Indeed, I somehow lived in Melbourne for the best part of 20 years without ever producing a good answer to that holiest of questions: \u201cSo, which team do you support?\u201d The arrival of the Fifa Women\u2019s World Cup in Australia has made that question more urgent. More specifically, being the parent of two young, football-curious girls has made that question urgent. The rise of women\u2019s football has been an inspiration to them. If I\u2019m honest, a strange transformation has come over this atheist in recent years. I have become one of those parents. The shouting-from-the-sidelines parents. The parents who talk about strategy and technique and who willingly spend Saturday mornings standing on muddy fields in the rain. In short, I now understand the appeal of sport. From a safe distance, obviously. But the World Cup has brought a new dilemma \u2013 how are you supposed to choose a team? I was raised in a team-free household. Other people seemed to have been assigned teams like star signs or passports \u2013 an accident of birth or an inheritance. At heart, choosing a team seems a question of identity. Maybe when you\u2019re younger, and the stakes are lower, you can experiment with different team colours. Different state or city teams. When I moved to London at 22, I toyed with backing Arsenal for no better reason than I\u2019d read Fever Pitch. A World Cup feels more significant. When winning and losing is everything, nobody wants to back Switzerland (except, possibly, the Swiss). The obvious answer is to back the home team. But I suspect for many Australians, given our diverse demographics, that choice is far from obvious. At our local school, expat families are fretting over whether their kids should maintain loyalties to Ireland, Italy, Japan or South Africa. Both my parents were born overseas (almost half of Australians have at least one parent born abroad), with our immediate family having cultural ties to England, Germany and Hungary (who didn\u2019t qualify). During last year\u2019s Euro championships, we rooted for the Lionesses \u2013 partly out of some genetic obligation, partly because the idea of England winning anything felt so novel. Our household was happy to try backing the Lionesses in the World Cup, up until the exact moment the Matildas obliterated them in April\u2019s friendly. The kids, being ruthless in their taste for victory, switched allegiances with brutal haste. Are we now a Matildas household? To me, this switch feels anything but permanent. If and when the rematch comes, our favoured team will probably depend on the half-time score. Frankly, this fair-weather barracking feels somewhat unsatisfactory, if not outright treasonous. In the Matildas\u2019 favour, we had been tracking home town girl Sam Kerr\u2019s career for Chelsea FC. Kerr was born two suburbs south of our place, so she brings a tantalising sense of proximity and possibility. She offers proof that growing up at the wrong end of the world \u2013 and being a girl on what still often is a boy\u2019s field \u2013 needn\u2019t be a fatal blow to dreams of global sporting stardom. Australians are somewhat suspicious of jingoism. At extremes, this reticence expresses itself as the cultural cringe that sees us shun local talent for imported success. But maybe sport can provide us with a safer brand of nationalism, imbued with a sense of fair play. In her new documentary, Australia\u2019s Open (showing at the Melbourne international film festival), director Ili Bar\u00e9 examines how a major sporting event can shape a nation\u2019s view of itself. When I interviewed Bar\u00e9 recently, she said that moments of national victory \u2013 such as Ash Barty\u2019s Australian Open triumph in 2022 \u2013 can bring about a rare, precious sense of communal euphoria. \u201cIt\u2019s absolute euphoria for much of the community, even if different sections of the community would have felt that euphoria [of Barty\u2019s win] for different reasons,\u201d Bar\u00e9 told me. \u201cThese are moments when briefly, we become one, because it allows us to forget a whole lot of other contexts.\u201d In a partisan age, it\u2019s comforting to think that something as simple as a tennis or football match can help a country or a community transcend its differences. Sport can provide an example of the sort of super group that Amy Chua talks about in her book Political Tribes \u2013 an antidote to the kind of tribalism that threatens to divide nations. We like to see ourselves winning on an international stage. Surely some of the outrage over Daniel Andrews canning the Commonwealth Games isn\u2019t pining for a lost empire, but the loss of a tournament in which Australia usually does pretty well? Still, tribalism is a key part \u2013 and, I suspect, a key appeal \u2013 of choosing a team. Your reading of the latest Ashes controversy had possibly less to do with what was or wasn\u2019t cricket and more to do with the colour of your passport. Likewise, the Australian Open questions whether the infamously larrikin behaviour of the Aussie crowd is an international embarrassment or a true blue democratisation of an elitist sport. Sport divides us even as it unites us. Maybe the answer to enjoying the World Cup is not to pick a team. Do you really need to cheer for a single side? I may be one of those parents shouting from the sidelines, but I\u2019ve also found it easy to cheer for the sportsmanship of the opposing team \u2013 to applaud the skills of the opposing foes even as I commiserate with my defeated offspring. We have a month ahead in which news headlines are about to be dominated by some of the world\u2019s best female athletes. Our girls are over the moon. Surely we\u2019re all winners here. \u2022 Myke Bartlett is a writer and critic"}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b2235a", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/jul/20/ethiopians-dying-agony-due-to-lack-opioids-while-west-battles-surfeit-acc", "primaryCategory": "global-development", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Ethiopians dying in agony due to lack of opioids while west battles a surfeit", "lead": "Poor countries get 1% of global supply \u2026 to treat half the world\u2019s people.

Many of them are slowly dying and in extraordinary pain. She carries with her a box of assorted medicines, but lacks the one drug she needs to relieve suffering: oral morphine. The powerful opioid is not made in Ethiopia and shortages of imported medicines mean it has disappeared from pharmacy shelves. Filagot makes do with painkillers usually recommended for mild aches and pains. These barely dent the agony endured by patients like Marset Ermelo, who is undergoing chemotherapy and has advanced bowel cancer. \u201cIt\u2019s really frustrating,\u201d says Filagot. \u201cOur patients are like our family \u2013 the relationship is really strong. So if you feel you are not doing anything to help them, it hurts a lot.\u201d Marset is in so much pain she struggles to stand up or find the energy to speak. Morphine is traded on the hidden market, but neither Marset nor Hospice Ethiopia, the organisation that employs Filagot, can afford the sky-high prices it fetches. Visiting Marset\u2019s flat on the top floor of a ramshackle housing estate, the best Filagot can do is listen and offer emotional support as her patient describes the symptoms. \u201cThe pain is getting worse daily, it is hard to describe,\u201d says Marset. Such suffering gives a glimpse into a vast, hidden opioid crisis that is the reverse of what is happening in wealthier countries. While addiction to unregulated opioids such as fentanyl is claiming tens of thousands of lives every year in rich countries, millions more in the developing world are dying in agony for want of medication. The poorest countries receive just 1% of the global morphine supply, despite having 50% of the world\u2019s people, according to a report published in 2017 by the Lancet\u2019s commission on palliative care and pain relief. In Nigeria, for example, there is only enough morphine available to meet 0.2% of needs. In Canada, by contrast, there is enough to meet more than 3,000% of national needs. The result is \u201cabsolutely unnecessary suffering\u201d, says Ephrem Abathun, executive director of Hospice Ethiopia. His charity is the only organisation dedicated to providing palliative care services in Ethiopia, Africa\u2019s second-biggest country by population, with more than 120 million people. Last year, Hospice Ethiopia helped 280 chronically and terminally ill people in Addis Ababa. Tens of thousands more sick Ethiopians suffer with no relief at all. \u201cThey are experiencing the worst possible pain,\u201d says Ephrem. \u201cI have had some patients who ask for euthanasia just because of their pain. Especially the ones who have experienced the help of morphine, when they don\u2019t have access to it again \u2013 it is really traumatic for them.\u201d The World Health Organization calls morphine \u201ca gold standard for pain relief\u201d and has included the opioid in its essential medicines list since 1977. It is strong, fast-acting and easy to administer. It is also cheap. Making morphine available as part of a wider palliative care package would cost just $3 a head in poor countries, according to the Lancet. When prescribed as a drinkable syrup, it is too weak for addicts. Yet in many African countries, doctors are often reluctant to prescribe the drug, seeing it as addictive or dangerous. This stems from a lack of training, with palliative care rarely featuring on medical school curricula, says Dr Yoseph Mamo, one of the handful of Ethiopian health professionals with palliative care expertise. Low investment in palliative care also limits morphine\u2019s availability, as do outdated policies aimed at restricting use and low doctor-to-patient ratios. In countries such as Ethiopia, foreign currency shortages mean that imported drugs are prohibitively expensive, and poor supply-chain management produces regular shortages. The impact of morphine can be transformational. \u201cIf I get morphine, my pain is more manageable and I can talk to my family and sleep,\u201d says Marset. \u201cIf I don\u2019t take morphine, I cannot speak.\u201d End-of-life care has no priority in the national health strategy, admits Elubabor Buno, head of medical services at Ethiopia\u2019s Ministry of Health, where the focus has been on bringing down infant mortality and tackling diseases such as malaria. \u201cThe main constraint at the ministry is the limited budget,\u201d says Elubabor. Ethiopia allocates 5% of its budget to health, despite being a signatory to the African Union\u2019s 2001 Abuja declaration, which commits it to spending 15%. Things are slowly changing. Taking the lead from Uganda\u2019s innovative approach, which focuses on free access to morphine, several African countries including Rwanda, Malawi and South Africa have integrated palliative care into their health systems. Ethiopia has more work to do, but has developed national guidelines for palliative care, and a plan to produce morphine locally \u201cis in the pipeline\u201d, says Elubabor. However, homegrown production is not a panacea. Ethiopia once had a company that made oral morphine, but it stopped production due to lack of demand from doctors fearful of prescribing the drug. Guidelines cannot be followed by doctors unless they have proper training, says Yoseph. Faced with a health system that does not offer them effective treatment, some terminally and chronically ill patients turn to traditional remedies. Kedija Deltera, a breast cancer patient, uses crushed black cumin mixed with honey, applied two to three times a day to treat her pain. It is a remedy she learned from the Qu\u2019ran. Many Christian patients use holy water in a similar way, says Ephrem at Hospice Ethiopia. Kedija often feels discomfort in her chest and legs, and itching in her arms and hands where her lymph nodes have swollen. When she stands, she feels dizzy, and that forced her to leave her job as a security guard. \u201cBut when I am taking morphine, I feel very little pain. I can live almost as normal,\u201d she says. But, like Marset, she cannot pay hidden market prices, so has to do without: \u201cIt\u2019s too expensive.\u201d Yoseph spends part of his time as a volunteer, teaching other health professionals how to integrate pain relief into their daily work. He says the importance of palliative care has gone unrecognised for too long. \u201cYou can still do something for people who can\u2019t be cured,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can give them their quality of life back and return their dignity. It is saying to the patient, \u2018I will not abandon you, I will be there for you.\u2019 And that is a very important thing.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b2235b", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/20/right-climate-backlash-natural-england-conservation", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "subCategories": "test", "title": "To understand the right\u2019s climate backlash, look no further than its monstering of Natural England | George Monbiot", "lead": "MPs and newspapers alike are attacking the public body charged with conserving the English countryside for doing just that, says Guardian columnist George Monbiot", "author": "George Monbiot", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 07:00:22", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.230992", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/909d8e103844738f21d48d2bcfa0f0792db89131/0_480_7200_4320/500.jpg", "body": "Several grisly bloodsports, legal or otherwise, are enjoyed in the English countryside. But none is as popular as shooting the messenger. Rather than attend to our environmental crisis, politicians, lobbyists and the media prefer to hunt the people seeking to address the problem. No quarry is pursued as keenly as the government\u2019s conservation agency Natural England. This weekend, a full-spectrum attack was launched in the billionaire press. The Sunday Telegraph raged against the agency\u2019s call for \u201cnutrient neutrality\u201d. This means that new housing or business developments should not increase the amount of shit in our rivers. The paper also attacked Natural England\u2019s advice that when new homes are built there should be no net increase in air pollution. It quoted a mysterious \u201cinsider\u201d accusing the agency of \u201cgreen activism\u201d. What\u2019s the betting that this \u201cinsider\u201d is a property developer? A similar attack was launched in the Times on Monday. A column in the Sunday Times by Robert Colvile, director of the Centre for Policy Studies, a dark-money junktank that won\u2019t reveal who funds it, also excoriated Natural England for advising councils that housing developments should be accompanied by new green spaces, to take pressure off existing nature reserves. In all these cases, Natural England is simply discharging its statutory duties. Under the habitat regulations, it must ensure that new developments don\u2019t adversely affect important wildlife sites, through water pollution, air pollution, visitor pressure and other impacts. It is following the evidence, not the politics. This is its cardinal sin. But the campaign against it seems to be working. Rishi Sunak is reported to be rewriting the rules. Instead of ensuring that wastewater treatment plants must be upgraded before major new developments are completed, the government, the Telegraph says, intends to \u201cforward count\u201d promised improvements. In other words, just as sewage pollution becomes a major political issue, our rivers can be loaded with even more excrement, on the grounds that one day the problem will be addressed. Relying on promises of future action by water companies and housebuilders \u2013 what could possibly go wrong? The Tories will claim they are simply eager to ease the housing shortage \u2013 and that this reported reversal is entirely unrelated to the fact that property developers are among the principal donors to the Conservative party, and seem to give most when their demands are met. The Telegraph correctly points out that the largest share of water pollution comes not from homes but \u201cfrom farms\u201d. But the government has got that covered too. Following representations from another powerful lobby \u2013 the National Farmers\u2019 Union \u2013 it introduced loopholes into the farming rules for water, permitting livestock farmers to load rivers with dung without fear of prosecution. There\u2019s been a similar hue and cry about Natural England\u2019s attempts to defend protected places (sites of special scientific interest or SSSIs) on Dartmoor. In 2012 and 2013, it struck 10-year agreements with farmers on the moor to adjust their \u201cgrazing calendars\u201d (how many animals they release, where, when and for how long) to reverse the disastrous decline of protected species. The farmers proposed a new grazing regime that, they agreed, would be adjusted if it wasn\u2019t working. In return, they were given millions of pounds of public money, in the form of \u201chigher level stewardship\u201d payments. As the conservationist Tony Whitehead documents, it became clear several years ago that these agreements weren\u2019t working, either because the wrong calendars had been proposed or because the farmers weren\u2019t sticking to them. The protected sites are still in catastrophic decline. The farmers were repeatedly asked to make adjustments by Natural England. This year, the agreements were due to expire. But the farmers receiving this money could, if they wanted, seek a five-year extension. Natural England published a blogpost explaining the issues and sent emails to farmers taking the payments, asking for further changes if they wanted another tranche of money. The result was an eruption in parliament and the press. The Country Land and Business Association led the charge, calling for a \u201cfull-scale review of Natural England\u2019s remit and track record\u201d, and claiming that the agency \u201cdoes not receive sufficient scrutiny\u201d. But it was simply doing its duty: it has a legal responsibility to protect and restore SSSIs. In a parliamentary debate on the issue, only one MP (Labour\u2019s Daniel Zeichner) offered a halfhearted defence of Natural England. Everyone else \u2013 Conservative, Labour, LibDem and DUP \u2013 lacerated the agency. MPs wrongly claimed that no one was consulted and no warnings were given, that Natural England \u201cis attempting to force farmers out of business\u201d and that its efforts to improve the condition of protected sites are \u201can insult\u201d, \u201cheavy handed\u201d and a \u201cgrave wrong\u201d. Somehow they all managed to forget that the special subsidies \u2013 higher level stewardship grants \u2013 are payments for services rendered. If you don\u2019t render the service, you shouldn\u2019t get paid. Farmers could continue to trash the land, but they would no longer be paid public money for it. Somehow, they all also managed to forget that Dartmoor, allegedly a national park, is an ecological disaster zone, among the most mistreated ecosystems in Europe. At the end of the festival of ignorance that passed for parliamentary debate, the farming minister Mark Spencer gave our elected vandals everything they demanded. The issue would be taken out of the hands of Natural England and handed to an \u201cindependent\u201d review. In the meantime, the livestock farmers would continue to receive the special payments, regardless of the damage they inflicted. Who would chair this review? David Fursdon, the former president of the Country Land and Business Association. Attacks like this are launched whenever Natural England tries to do its job. It was furiously denounced at the end of last month when it designated, for solid environmental reasons, a new protected site in Cornwall. Wildlife protection is in freefall in this country. The government\u2019s own figures show that the proportion of SSSIs in favourable condition has fallen from 44% in 2003 to 38% last year. The figures are even worse in our national parks. Natural England has an average of just one staff member to assess the condition of every 73 protected sites: an impossible workload. It doesn\u2019t have the capacity even to see what is happening, let alone act on it. None of the official targets are being met. The government is preparing to smash its promise of no decline in environmental protection after we left the EU. There are two options in such circumstances: address the problem or find a scapegoat. Who could have guessed they would take option two?

Reddit received the most reports of people\u2019s images being shared without their consent. A total of 795 requests by the eSafety commissioner to remove alleged bullying of children from various platforms were made since the beginning of 2022. For TikTok alone, 209 requests were made in 2022, and 100 in 2023. The Meta-owned Instagram platform followed with 186 requests in 2022, and 84 in 2023. Snapchat was next with 70 and 45, respectively. There were four requests in 2022 to Roblox, and two so far this year. The data is contained in tables from the office of the eSafety commissioner, released to Senate estimates in response to questions on notice from the Greens senator, David Shoebridge. Not every complaint received by the commissioner\u2019s office results in a removal request being made. The acting eSafety commissioner, Toby Dagg, said earlier this month complaints of cyberbullying from children under 14 had tripled since 2019. \u201cWe received around 230 cyberbullying complaints in May this year alone and around 100 of these involved children aged eight to 13 experiencing this kind of harm. Nasty comments, offensive pictures or videos, and impersonation accounts are among the most reported issues,\u201d he said. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The office revealed it has made 852 removal requests for image-based abuse since the start of 2022, with 54 in total made to Reddit, which topped the requests last year. Twitter was third with 21 requests last year. A spokesperson for Reddit said the platform took the issue seriously and site policies prohibit any nonconsensual sharing of intimate or sexually explicit media, adding that 60% of material is caught by automated systems before anyone sees the content. \u201cReddit was one of the earliest sites to establish site-wide policies that prohibit this content, and we continue to evolve our policies to ensure the safety of the platform,\u201d the spokesperson said. Some sites that had requests made for removal were censored on the table because they were predominantly created for the purpose of exploiting victims of image-based abuse, or threatening or harassing users through doxing, the office said. In May, the commissioner said that more young men had been reporting image-based abuse than women. A total of 1,700 reports in the first quarter of this year \u2013 1,200 of which were people aged 18 to 24, and 90% of which were male. Meta\u2019s Facebook and Instagram received the most removal requests for the cyber abuse of adults over 2022 and 2023, with 267 and 153 requests respectively. TikTok was not far behind with 117, followed by YouTube at 37. A spokesperson for Meta said the company heavily invests in safety tools to ensure users have a positive experience. \u201cOur policies clearly prohibit people from sharing and engaging in online abuse and we will remove this content as soon as we become aware. We also work collaboratively with the eSafety commissioner and have a dedicated reporting channel where the eSafety commissioner can report content directly to us for review,\u201d the spokesperson said. The vast majority of the removal requests were informal, the eSafety office said, with only 53 formal removal notices issued since the start of last year.

Unbelievable. Bizarre. Unprecedented. The then Irish prime minister Charles Haughey famously used these four words at a press conference in the summer of 1982, when a double murderer, the subject of a high profile nationwide search, was found to be staying as a guest in the seaside penthouse of the attorney general, Patrick Connolly. The most wanted criminal in Ireland was occasionally chauffeured around in the state car provided to the Irish government\u2019s chief legal adviser, complete with a garda driver. It was Conor Cruise O\u2019Brien who shortened this into the acronym that was to define an era: Gubu. The ensuing scandal cost Connolly his job and contributed to the fall of the Haughey government later that year. Picking up Mark O\u2019Connell\u2019s remarkable new book about these murders, I was half expecting social analysis, and perhaps some theoretical reflections on 1980s Ireland, such as Fintan O\u2019Toole offers when dissecting the case in his recent autobiographical social history, We Don\u2019t Know Ourselves. Yet while O\u2019Connell tells the story of the crimes, their background and their fallout with painstaking care, his approach is too restrained and self-searching for state-of-the-nation diagnostics or political allegory around class and power. He has produced a profound meditation on violence and its roots, on the skeining of barbarism and high culture, and on our urge to make sense of chaos and brutality. Malcolm Macarthur had plenty of what we would now call privilege. He inherited enough from his family\u2019s small estate in Meath to indulge his social and intellectual fancies without the burden of daily work. A handsome, well-spoken man, he was a suave denizen of Dublin\u2019s bohemian bars. Yet however high born, his crimes were lowly and squalid. He had run into financial trouble as a result of his spendthrift ways and, aghast at the prospect of losing his independent lifestyle, conjured up a bank heist that never even made it to the bank, ending up as a tragic and brutal farce. Over the course of a weekend in July he took the lives of Bridie Dargan, a nurse whom he bludgeoned with a hammer in Phoenix Park when stealing her car and three days later, Donal Dunne, a farmer, whom he shot in the face. Both his victims were 27 years old. Macarthur is the loose inspiration for Freddie Montgomery, the protagonist in John Banville\u2019s 1989 novel The Book of Evidence, but while Montgomery is an aesthete and art collector, Macarthur is more avowedly scientific \u2013 well read but a student of economics and analytic philosophy, not fiction. His cultivated rationalism becomes a leitmotif in this book, expressed both in the story of what he calls his \u201ccriminal episode\u201d and the often frustrating opacity of the authorial interviews with him. O\u2019Connell begins by describing his hunt for Macarthur who, after his release from prison on licence in 2012, had taken to turning up unexpectedly at book launches and seminars in Dublin, like a Baggot Street Banquo. Trinity College is a favoured spot, predictably enough; a place O\u2019Connell himself studied, writing his PhD on the works of Banville. After his release, Macarthur is alleged to have applied unsuccessfully to read English as a mature student. At one point, deliciously, he even turns up at an event where Banville is the guest speaker. O\u2019Connell walks the streets hoping to run into his now white-haired quarry. The lead that allows him to find Macarthur is an article in the Irish Sun that sounds as if it might have been published in the Onion: the headline read \u201cMasking a Murderer: Double killer Malcolm Macarthur backs Covid lockdown restrictions \u2013 labelling them \u2018necessary precaution\u2019\u201d. Gubu indeed. But also, as becomes apparent in O\u2019Connell\u2019s later interviews with Macarthur, entirely in keeping with his scientism and prosaic practicality. When he finally meets Macarthur, stopping him on the street, O\u2019Connell rather sheepishly identifies himself as an \u201cessayist\u201d in an attempt to distinguish himself from the sort of true-crime hack who might put Macarthur off. Yet to my mind, it\u2019s a deadly accurate self-description. O\u2019Connell\u2019s writing, like the essay form, sits on the cusp of faithful reportage and personal reflection, objective retelling and creative obliquity. Here is a meticulous attempt to bear witness, to find the truth of what happened and to explain Macarthur\u2019s behaviour by fleshing out his life and background. Yet O\u2019Connell also relates, with lyrical candour and sensitivity, his own familial connection to the case, his struggle with the ethics of writing about a murderer, and his anguish at the ineffability of his quest \u2013 of the \u201csullen and persistent silence at its centre\u201d. The story is compellingly told, with the structure and pacing taut, the writing deft and limpid, all marked by an absorbing honesty and ethical concern. Crucially, the moral intelligence with which he treats the themes, including the plight of the victims, explodes the idea that the criminal is interesting for reasons of diabolical glamour. Macarthur compels him not as an individual but rather as a cipher, an \u201cemissary\u201d and \u201cavatar\u201d. \u201cMy relationship with him is, after all, an inherently extractive one,\u201d he writes, \u201cas though I were a prospector that has struck a rich vein of crude oil. With this, I can reconcile myself. Because to understand Macarthur, or to attempt to do so, is to understand the darkness and violence that run beneath the surface of so many lives, and which have shaped so much of human experience.\u201d O\u2019Connell\u2019s literary persona is warm and winning: curious and tenacious, yes, but also modest, hesitant, self-querying. Nonetheless, this book is an outstanding achievement, and a worthy addition to literary attempts to understand the human propensity for evil. \u2022 A Thread of Violence: A Story of Truth, Invention and Murder by Mark O\u2019Connell is published by Granta (\u00a316.99).

The Conservative-held constituencies are being targeted by Labour and the Liberal Democrats, who hope to overturn large majorities and send Tory MPs off into the summer recess nervous about their own political futures come the general election. Voters can cast their ballots from 7am on Thursday, across the south-western Tory stronghold of Somerton and Frome, Boris Johnson\u2019s old seat in the west London suburbs Uxbridge and South Ruislip, as well as Selby and Ainsty in North Yorkshire. Sunak was privately downcast on Wednesday afternoon about the his party\u2019s electoral prospects, in part given the nature of why the contests were triggered. Johnson stood down to avoid being suspended from parliament over a report that found he misled MPs over Partygate. Adams quit after being passed over for a peerage. And David Warbuton, an MP in Somerset since 2015, quit after being investigated over claims of harassment and drug use. On top of the circumstances of the byelections being called, Sunak\u2019s party is also polling poorly, nationally. At a behind-closed-doors meeting of Tory backbenchers on the eve of the byelections, MPs said he appeared to acknowledge the results would be \u201ctough\u201d. If the Conservatives are trounced, Sunak could become the first prime minister since Harold Wilson in 1968 to lose three byelections in a single day. The safest Tory seat is Selby and Ainsty \u2013 which delivered a 20,000 majority at the 2019 general election. Both Labour and the Conservatives say they expect the result to be tight \u2013 within about 1,000 votes. Keir Starmer\u2019s party want to pull off a win there to show they can win in rural areas as well as metropolitan cities and their traditional former industrial heartlands. But the swing required is much greater than current polls suggest they would achieve at a general election. Somerton and Frome should also be a Tory safe seat \u2013 with the party holding a 19,000 majority at the last election. But after the loss of Tiverton and Honiton last year, which saw an area in neighbouring Devon clinched by the Liberal Democrats, it is considered the most likely to flip. In Uxbridge and South Ruislip, hopes of a Tory resurgence have grown in recent days given some anger at the extension of the London ultra-low emissions zone by the capital\u2019s Labour mayor, Sadiq Khan. The byelections will have a unique tinge to them. They will be the first parliamentary elections where voter ID is required, after the scheme was rolled out to council elections earlier this spring."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b22360", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/jul/20/albania-fears-grow-over-environmental-impact-of-new-airport", "primaryCategory": "travel", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Albania: fears grow over environmental impact of new airport", "lead": "A new airport and new routes may take pressure off creaking buses \u2013 but at what cost to a valuable wetland for flamingos and other birds?", "author": "Eibhlis Gale-Coleman", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 06:00:21", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.231082", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/6b272a5f74eeaca5a492d26c156c2a62469510a4/202_0_7827_4700/500.jpg", "body": "Black smoke billows from the front of the bus. With no air-conditioning besides the sympathetic wafting of a folded map from another passenger, I\u2019m five hours into a bus journey from Tirana to Sarand\u00eb. Has the engine exploded? I\u2019m not too sure. But judging by the groans of the driver and other passengers, this is far from ideal. For many visitors, this is the reality of travelling in Albania. Buses and car hire are the primary methods of transportation \u2013 so incidents like these are pretty regular. The only two cities accessible by international flights are Tirana and Kuk\u00ebs in the north, leaving mid and south Albania fairly inaccessible unless travelling by bus or car. However, Albanian transportation is shifting. Flight routes to Albania are increasing, and not everyone is happy about it. Vlora international airport is scheduled to open in April 2024, and Ryanair has announced 17 new routes to Tirana, including flights from Stansted and Manchester. The tourism sector will welcome these developments \u2013 previously, the budget way of reaching Tirana was via bus from Montenegro. And Vlora airport will allow holidayers to fly directly to Albania\u2019s coastline for resort holidays on the Adriatic Sea, potentially boosting development and tourism revenue. But sustainability-wise, there are many questions to be asked. Taulant Bino represents the Albanian Ornithological Society, one of two national NGOs behind a lawsuit against the Albanian authorities over the construction of the airport. The organisation aims to protect places of conservational importance and says it has seen a pattern in the exploitation of state-owned protected areas \u2013 particularly in coastal regions. The airport borders \u2013 or encroaches on, depending on your stance \u2013 Narta lagoon, renowned for birdlife and home to up to 3,000 flamingos. The accusations are damning, including queries over whether the airport even holds a valid construction permit to have begun works. \u201cAs an NGO, we are not against airports in general. It has to make sense and unfortunately, from different perspectives, Vlora airport makes no sense. It is a protected area, a wetland of crucial importance [and] an important bird area.\u201d Bino says. \u201cOn the other hand, it\u2019s close to the Tirana airport. It makes no sense because the airports are very close to each other, so other proposals should be taken into consideration\u201d, he continues. Annette Spangenberg, head of conservation at Euronatur, a European nonprofit conservation foundation, echoes Bino\u2019s concerns and questions why a fast-train option from the existing Tirana airport was not provided, especially considering Vlora and Tirana\u2019s airports are just two hours apart by car. \u201cThere is a current boom to build hotel resorts along the coast \u2013 at first glance \u2013 it may seem like the more promising option and provide more money,\u201d she says. However, \u201cConstructing an airport so close to a undeveloped stretch of the coast clearly hints towards plans to further develop tourism in the area\u201d, she adds. The prime minister, Edi Rama, is a leading supporter and driver of the project, previously voicing hopes that the new airport would prompt exponential tourism growth. Vlora airport is expected to host direct flights from around the globe, with some estimating that it would create thousands of new jobs, reduce fare prices and turn the airport into the most important tourist gateway of the region. The benefits are clear, but the real conversation seems to be at what cost. There is a risk that the airport may create another unsustainable resort bubble that fails to entice tourists to inland destinations. Mirela Kumbaro, Albania\u2019s minister of tourism and environment, previously promised to seek high-end eco-tourism, in a move away from package beach holidays. The current plans seem to be moving in a different direction. For visitors who want to have a positive impact on the country, Spangenberg advises seeking out small-scale, local tourism offerings. \u201cIt is good to be curious,\u201d Spangenberg advises, \u201cto go with open eyes through the world.\u201d For those with the luxury of having time to slow travel to Albania, the options of ferry crossings and buses remain. Similarly, Bino suggests avoiding large, sprawling developments that have been built in protected areas, warning of their disastrous impact on nature and lack of longevity for tourist despite initial, quick boosts. \u201cThe impact goes beyond generations,\u201d he says."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b22361", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/jul/20/ebay-refused-my-refund-after-fraudsters-nintendo-no-show", "primaryCategory": "money", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Ebay refused my refund after fraudster\u2019s Nintendo no-show", "lead": "The seller seems to have used an old tracking number to suggest my order had been delivered", "author": "Anna Tims", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 06:00:21", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.231100", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/58a27c18e9876fc8f8d855a19871ac6cf9ecded3/850_1052_3439_2063/500.jpg", "body": "In March this year I purchased a \u00a360 Nintendo Switch console on eBay.

When the temperature in Sicily is approaching 50C, you know something is wrong. When most of Italy\u2019s major cities have issued warnings of dangerous conditions, wildfires burn for days on end across Greece, and staff at the Acropolis and other ancient sites are refusing to work because it\u2019s too hot, it becomes harder to ignore that, while Europe has always had seasonal heatwaves, something more extreme is happening. The science, of course, is very clear on the global heating emergency, but evidence of its escalating effects in Europe has been more widespread than ever over the past fortnight. Surely, as this situation worsens, governments will take meaningful action to combat the crisis? Surely now voters will demand it? Ajit Niranjan is the Guardian\u2019s European environment correspondent, based in Berlin and Brussels. I spoke to him about how the countries affected have responded to the current heat crisis \u2013 and what needs to happen before real political change takes place. First, today\u2019s headlines. Five big stories New Zealand | Two people died and six people were injured after a shooting at a building site in Auckland city centre, hours before the Women\u2019s World Cup is due to start. The gunman was also dead. New Zealand\u2019s PM, Chris Hipkins, said the World Cup would proceed as planned. Politics | Almost 200,000 families living under Labour-run councils are affected by the two-child benefit cap, a Guardian analysis has revealed. Keir Starmer\u2019s decision not to scrap the policy if Labour wins power has led to attacks from anti-poverty campaigners and disquiet from senior figures in the party. Health | MPs have urged the government to introduce restrictions on the packaging and marketing of disposable vapes to tackle the \u201calarming trend\u201d of children using these addictive products. The health and social care committee said there should be restrictions on how e-cigarettes are sold, in line with those applied to tobacco products. Slavery | Caribbean countries are considering approaching the UN\u2019s international court of justice for a legal opinion on demanding compensation from 10 European countries over slavery, as the fight for reparative justice is stepped up. Ralph Gonsalves, the current leader of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, said he is also looking for an apology from the British government and expressed disappointment in Rishi Sunak\u2019s lack of engagement in the matter. Strikes | A strike by train staff in the RMT union will severely affect rail services across Britain in the next week. About 20,000 RMT members at 14 train operators will strike for 24 hours on Thursday and again on Saturday, coinciding with the end of a week-long overtime ban by train drivers in the Aslef union. The 10 days of transport disruption will coincide with the peak summer holiday getaway weekend. In depth: \u2018It\u2019s shaping up to be one of the most damaging summers that we\u2019ve seen\u2019 It is not just Europe that has been experiencing extreme weather this month: South Korea has been battered by heavy rain, inmates in US prisons are dying from the extreme heat, while a region of China recorded a record-shattering 52.2C. But while those in southern Europe have long endured high temperatures in summer, adapting their lifestyles over centuries to accommodate the heat, many of the conditions they now regularly face are unprecedented. More than 60,000 people died in Europe as a result of the heat last summer, Ajit says. \u201cAnd this year is already shaping up to be one of the most damaging summers that we\u2019ve seen. \u201cWe\u2019ve already heated the planet 1.2C by burning fossil fuels and destroying nature. And climate scientists can say confidently that this heatwave has already been made hotter because of the fuels we have burned.\u201d That means record-breaking temperatures across a huge area, and an increased risk to life \u2013 especially for vulnerable people. Older women are particularly at risk, he says, for reasons that are not yet fully clear. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing massive chunks of Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece are under heatwave warnings. [There is no question] that we are now in this very hot, horrible world.\u201d *** Reasons for hope \u2013 and driving the message home These are frightening facts to acknowledge \u2013 but there are some glimmers of optimism, he says. For one, the fact that the evidence is increasingly hard to ignore does mean people are more aware that climate change is real. \u201cIt\u2019s safe to say that more of the media coverage of heatwaves [goes beyond] pictures of people in bikinis on beaches, having ice cream. It\u2019s likely climate change will be mentioned in the article somewhere. Within rich, western European countries, there has definitely been a noticeable shift.\u201d And yet, Ajit says, the picture varies widely across Europe; while he sees some improvement in climate coverage in Germany, France, the UK and Spain, for instance, Italy\u2019s rightwing-dominated media has been more focused this week on the foreign coverage of the heatwave than its effects. \u201cEven though we are seeing big progress, we still very much at the beginning of that curve,\u201d says Ajit. \u201cIt\u2019s understandable that somebody sitting at home who reads the paper once a week, or listens to radio once in a while, doesn\u2019t realise how threatening this is to their own health \u2013 and how much worse it\u2019s been made through policy choices. \u201cUltimately, there\u2019s a huge gap in fundamental awareness of how serious the problem is. It\u2019s not just about saying, \u2018We\u2019re worried about climate change,\u2019 but perhaps understanding that your gran might be more likely to die in the next weeks, because burning fossil fuels made the heatwave hotter.\u201d *** Changing planet, changing minds Even where populations understand the reality, though, there can be a lack of willingness to make changes, whether through the influence of powerful lobby groups, or individual self-interest, says Ajit. \u201cIf you take Germany as an example, you\u2019ve got a very high level of public support for climate action. If you talk to people across the political spectrum and say, \u2018Do you want to stop climate change?\u2019 they say, yes. \u2018Are you worried about climate change?\u2019 They say, yes. But if you ask them, \u2018Should we put speed limit on the motorway?\u2019, half of them say no.\u201d Politicians know this \u2013 Rishi Sunak\u2019s five key priorities for 2023 make no mention of the climate, despite a very high proportion of Britons saying they are worried about it. Experts this week condemned the UK government\u2019s plan to deal with the climate crisis as \u201cvery weak\u201d. And yet there is a lot that we can do in wealthy Europe. \u201cFlying is the biggest one on my mind right now,\u201d says Ajit, \u201cbecause people are flying on holiday to southern Europe from northern Europe to sit around in a heatwave that is so deadly, and maybe aren\u2019t so conscious of all the emissions that they\u2019re spewing out that are contributing to that.\u201d Regardless of whether we want to make changes, however, the planet is changing around us. \u201cAll of our lives, every day, for the rest of however long we live, are going to become harder in some ways because of climate change,\u201d says Ajit. *** The global damage being done Any conversation about Europe\u2019s energy usage and European temperatures must acknowledge, of course, that this remains a relatively privileged corner of the globe, and the extremes experienced here are already much worse elsewhere. \u201cThe heat that\u2019s hurting us in Europe today is worse if you live in north Africa. And if you live in north Africa, you\u2019re probably much more likely to lack the money to deal with it as a government, andto find technological solutions at a household level, like air conditioning. \u201cIf you live on a small island state that\u2019s going to be drowned by sea-level rise in the next decade, then you don\u2019t have a choice \u2013 you have to move. \u201cSo it\u2019s much harder for the rest of the world to cope with the damage being done by climate change.\u201d What else we\u2019ve been reading Ghostwriters penning the memoirs of the rich and famous is nothing new.

Restaurants and cafes also use the app to sell ready-made meals that they have left over, with time slots for customers to drop by and collect them. As food waste is a growing environmental problem, the app is a great way for people to save a bit of money and be more sustainable. And it seems to have worked well \u2013 in the eight years since it was launched, it has rescued more than 230m meals from going to waste and saved 592,000 tonnes of CO2 from being emitted into the atmosphere. While the app is run as a for-profit business, its ethos is underpinned by a sense of ethical responsibility to the planet: \u201c[Too Good to Go is] very much about democratising accessibility to food and accessibility to a sustainable lifestyle,\u201d says co-founder Jamie Crummie.

Parked just 20 metres from the building with her colleague Jerome Hisus, she watched as streams of workers fled en masse. \u201cFirst we heard two gunshots, we had closed up our truck, and everyone started running. We looked up and saw two men crouching, cowering in the corner, and one lying down, we thought he had been shot.\u201d From their vantage point, Tuala and Hisus could see the three men in the building, many floors above \u2013 clearly visible in their bright hi-vis work gear \u2013 taking refuge in a corner. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know why people were running at first. People were yelling to get out, police and security were helping to push people behind buildings, or anything hard, because the shooting was happening.\u201d Hisus, originally from the Philippines, said many of the construction workers were Filipino and relayed to him in their native language the situation as they ran. \u201cThey told me they had seen firing from a gun, one man had seen the gunman and told me someone had fallen on the stairs \u2013 maybe he had been shot.\u201d It was early, Tuala says, \u201cso a lot of people were eating breakfast at cafes, holding food as they fled. A Swat team in black ran past our truck. It felt like a movie, surreal-like it wasn\u2019t happening.\u201d Ferried to a large shed across the road, the pair heard a further eight quick-fire shots in succession. \u201cThere were a couple hundred people crowded in the shed, tourists who didn\u2019t know what was going on, everyone in the vicinity.\u201d Two people were killed when a shooter opened fire on the Auckland building site early on Thursday. Police say the gunman had a history of violence and mental health issues. Armed with a pump-action shotgun he made his way through the 22-floor building under construction in the city\u2019s central business district, injuring a further five people, including a police officer. When he reached the upper levels, he took refuge inside an elevator shaft. \u201cFurther shots were fired from the male and he was located deceased a short time later,\u201d police said. Just a few hours later on Quay Street \u2013 a narrow thoroughfare that traverses downtown Auckland\u2019s waterfront \u2013 small crowds were still gathered behind a police cordon stretching several blocks. Among the assembled onlookers were tourists, newly arrived in New Zealand for the opening of the FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup. A family visiting from Los Angeles and San Francisco surveyed the scene before them: police vehicles parked on angles in front of yellow cordon tape, rows of commuter buses stacked and paused in a chain and closed storefronts. Having landed in Auckland an hour earlier, awaiting a long layover for a flight to Dunedin for the Philippines vs Switzerland match tomorrow night, the news of a shooting was, says Max Ramos, surprising \u2013 but not unusual. \u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s common. More so in the United States, but doesn\u2019t New Zealand have strict gun laws?\u201d Frank Hess was also newly arrived to attend the World Cup, having landed in Auckland on Monday. He and his family from Berlin had planned to take the ferry across the harbour to Waiheke Island for a day trip. Wearing a thick black puffer jacket to guard against the chill, he said that having lived in Texas for five years he was unsurprised by the news. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate, but there are shootings everywhere around the world. We even get used to it.\u201d His son Leo described being witness to the 2016 Berlin truck attack, where a truck was deliberately driven into a Christmas market, killing 12 and injuring 56 others. At a press conference late on Thursday, police commissioner, Andrew Coster, described New Zealand as a safe country. He said the situation was tragic, but was connected to the workplace and there was no elevated concern for the World Cup launch tonight. He promised an increased police presence and said that his staff showed tremendous courage. \u201cI\u2019m proud of them\u201d, he said. But \u201cfor those who hid or remained trapped, this was a terrifying experience.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b22364", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jul/20/china-complicit-in-russias-invasion-of-ukraine-says-mi6-chief", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "China complicit in Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, says MI6 chief", "lead": "Sir Richard Moore says Xi Jinping\u2019s regime has supported Vladimir Putin diplomatically and amplified \u2018Russian tropes\u2019 such as Nato being to blame", "author": "Helen Davidson in Taipei", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 05:39:16", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.231155", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/68da6057a31bf82ea88ef6b0c1b559d20e12086c/0_0_5287_3173/500.jpg", "body": "The head of MI6 has accused China\u2019s government and its leader, Xi Jinping, of being \u201cabsolutely complicit\u201d in Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, in a rare public address in Prague. Sir Richard Moore, who has been chief of the British Secret Intelligence Service since 2020, also offered comment on the extraordinary mutiny in June by the mercenary Wagner group led by Yevgeny Prigozhin. Shortly before Russia invaded Ukraine, Xi and Vladimir Putin signed a \u201cno limits\u201d partnership between their countries. After the war began, China\u2019s government sought to present itself as a neutral peacemaker, and there have been signs of Xi\u2019s dissatisfaction with events, but in practice Beijing refused to publicly censure or discourage Russia, and senior officials often expressed direct support. \u201cWhen Putin invaded Ukraine, the Chinese very clearly supported the Russians,\u201d Moore said at the event hosted by Politico on Wednesday. \u201cThey have completely supported the Russians diplomatically, they\u2019ve abstained in key votes at the United Nations, they\u2019ve absolutely cynically repeated all the Russian tropes, particularly in places like Africa and Latin America \u2013 [by] blaming Nato and all of this stuff.\u201d Moore said MI6 now devoted more resources to China than any other mission, which \u201creflects China\u2019s importance in the world and the crucial need to understand both the intent and capability of the Chinese government\u201d. His comments are likely to spark an angry response from Beijing, and follow a recent speech and essay by Bill Burns, in which the CIA director warned of Beijing\u2019s \u201cactions\u201d accompanying its powerful rise: \u201cRussia\u2019s aggression poses a formidable test. But China is the only country with both the intent to reshape the international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military and technological power to do so.\u201d Moore said the balance of power between Russia and China had shifted in the latter\u2019s favour, and this had hurt Putin\u2019s prestige in Russia. Putin\u2019s power had also been affected by the Wagner group revolt in June, Moore suggested. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a group of mercenaries advance up the motorway towards Moscow and get to within 125km of Moscow unless you have not quite predicted that was going to happen,\u201d he said. \u201cPrigozhin was his creature, utterly created by Putin, and yet he turned on him.\u201d Moore said Putin \u201cdidn\u2019t fight back\u201d but used allied Belarus to \u201ccut a deal\u201d with Prigozhin. The Wagner group leader\u2019s specific whereabouts have not been clear since he marched his troops against Putin, then called it off in return for no charges being laid against the mercenaries. The Kremlin has said Putin held lengthy meetings with Prigozhin \u2013 whom Putin had denounced as a traitor \u2013 and senior Wagner group commanders after the aborted coup. \u201cPrigozhin started off that day as a traitor at breakfast, he had been pardoned by supper, and then a few days later, he was invited for tea,\u201d Moore told the Prague event. \u201cSo, there are some things that even the chief of MI6 finds a little bit difficult to try and interpret, in terms of who\u2019s in and who\u2019s out.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b22365", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/jul/20/its-a-huge-sign-of-progress-the-battle-to-decriminalise-suicide", "primaryCategory": "global-development", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018It\u2019s a huge sign of progress\u2019: the battle to decriminalise suicide", "lead": "In at least 17 countries, suicide remains a criminal offence \u2013 a \u2018huge barrier\u2019 to mental health care.

Osafo, head of psychology at the University of Ghana, had been engaged in a near 20-year battle to abolish the law \u2013 brought in by the British \u2013 which stated that anyone who attempts suicide should face imprisonment or a fine. \u201cIt was a very good feeling. I felt like a certain burden had been removed. I was extremely elated,\u201d he remembers. \u201cThen the next morning, I realised we had a lot of work to do.\u201d Ghana is one of four countries to have decriminalised suicide in the past year \u2013 Malaysia, Guyana and Pakistan are the others. More could soon follow, which campaigners say is a sign of greater awareness and understanding of mental health. Kenya and Uganda have filed petitions to overturn laws and members of the UN group of Small Island Developing States have committed to decriminalise. Discussions are also being held in Nigeria and Bangladesh. \u201cThere seems to be a domino effect taking place,\u201d says Muhammad Ali Hasnain, a barrister from United for Global Mental Health, a group calling for decriminalisation. \u201cAs one country decriminalises suicide, others start to follow suit.\u201d \u201cIt is quite unusual,\u201d adds Sarah Kline, the organisation\u2019s chief executive. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge sign of progress and an important step forward for the populations most at risk, as well as the countries as a whole.\u201d More than 700,000 people globally die by suicide every year, about three-quarters (77%) in low- and middle-income countries. It is the fourth leading cause of death among 15 to 29-year-olds. A large number of laws were introduced by the British during colonial rule. Suicide was decriminalised in England, Wales and Northern Ireland in the 1960s \u2013 it was never criminalised in Scotland. At least 17 countries still have laws labelling suicide a criminal offence. Just last year, Jordan criminalised attempting suicide in a public place, and sentenced a man to a month\u2019s imprisonment. In Nigeria, children as young as seven can be arrested, tried and prosecuted for attempted suicide. In the Bahamas, Bangladesh and Kenya, the will of someone judged to have killed themselves may be discounted. In other countries, people who attempt suicide can face time in prison and/or a fine. The results of these punishments can be \u201cdevastating\u201d and present \u201ca huge barrier\u201d to addressing the problem, says Natalie Drew, a technical officer with the mental health policy and service development team at the World Health Organization. Health experts and advocates argue that suicide should be treated as a public health issue rather than a crime. Criminalising suicide denies people the right to access health services and discriminates against them because of something they\u2019re experiencing, Drew adds. Research shows that in countries where suicide has been decriminalised, people can seek help for mental health and rates tend to then decline. In September, the WHO is due to release a guide on decriminalising suicide for policymakers, with explanations of how countries have managed it. In Ghana, Osafo is tasked with making sure the logistics, facilities and resources are in place for people needing support. The government is thinking of initiating a national suicide prevention policy and expanding a mental health helpline, he says. The Ghana Association for Suicide Prevention is devising programmes, information is being disseminated to teachers in schools, and there are plans to hire more psychologists. Osafo hopes Ghana\u2019s decision to decriminalise will encourage other countries in the region to look at their statute books. \u201c[Ghana\u2019s decision] should have an impact on the work ongoing in other countries, especially in the Africa region,\u201d says Osafo. Within the past couple of months, he has set up a mental health working group with representatives from about 20 African countries, and one of the biggest issues on the agenda is decriminalisation of suicide, he says. \u201cNigeria is active, Cameroon is active \u2026 Kenya has joined and is doing fantastic work. We have Uganda. People have been asking us how we did it.\u201d Derrick Kizza, executive director of Mental Health Uganda (MHU), a network of people with lived experience of mental health issues, hopes to replicate Ghana\u2019s success in his country. \u201cWe think Ghana gives [our case] some more mileage because it\u2019s in the African context,\u201d he says. In April, MHU, along with Raymond Felix Odokonyero, a psychiatrist, Sarah Tushemereirwe, a woman who has attempted suicide and John Mary Kimuraheebwa, an advocate of the high court, filed a petition with the constitutional court of Uganda arguing that the Penal Code Act, which labels suicide \u201ca misdemeanour\u201d carrying a prison term of up to two years, is at odds with the Ugandan constitution and international human rights law. In neighbouring Kenya, which like Uganda and Ghana, inherited suicide laws from the British, the Kenya National Human Rights Commission has also filed a petition for the decriminalisation of suicide. Last month, at the Small Island Developing States ministerial conference on noncommunicable diseases and mental health, members adopted the Bridgetown Declaration, which commits them to decriminalise suicide. Meanwhile, Abdullah Al Harun, a project manager at ADD International Bangladesh, a UK-based international NGO, is involved in a grassroots movement looking at how to decriminalise suicide in the country. Bangladesh inherited the Indian Penal Code of 1860 and according to section 309, suicide and suicide attempts are considered criminal offences. The government of Bangladesh lists mental illnesses as one of the top 10 priority health concerns in the country. There has been some recent policy changes but nothing relating to suicide decriminalisation. The Lunacy Act 1912, another remnant of British colonial law, was repealed and replaced by the Mental Health Act in 2018. It was introduced to protect the dignity, property rights, rehabilitation and overall welfare of people living with mental health problems, which was missing in the previous act, says Abudullah. He has been closely watching events in Pakistan and Malaysia, which share cultural similarities and where, as in Bangladesh, Islam, which labels suicide a sin, is the predominant religion. Since suicide was decriminalised in Malaysia last month, Anita Abu Bakar, founder and president of the Mental Illness Awareness and Support Association (Miasa), has already seen things change. Crisis response teams and helplines are expanding, and money from the mental health budget is being given to organisations who work in the community. \u201cThis is the shift we\u2019re so happy to see,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was such an archaic law.\u201d She adds: \u201cI\u2019m a person with lived experience. What does decriminalisation mean to people like me? We feel supported, we feel this conversation can go to a different level. Obviously decriminalisation is not the only way to prevent suicide, but it\u2019s a big one. I\u2019m happy for this progressive move \u2013 better late than never. I\u2019m excited to see what happens next, not just for Malaysia but for the rest of us.\u201d In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

You can read our full story on the shooting here. Below is a summary of what happened: Two people were killed and six injured by a gunman in a shooting at a building site in central Auckland on Thursday morning, hours before the Women\u2019s World Cup was due to start in the city. The shooter later died, in circumstances that are unclear. The shooting was not politically or ideologically motivated, New Zealand prime minister Chris Hipkins said. At least one police officer was among those injured during an exchange of fire. The offender was the subject of a home detention sentence, but had an exemption to work at the building site where the shooting occurred, New Zealand police commissioner Andrew Coster said. \u201cThe individual is known for primarily family violence history,\u201d he said. He said there were \u201cindications of mental health history\u201d but that there was no evidence he was of high lethal risk and that his previous offences did not suggest he posed this kind of threat. Police did not identify the gunman, saying only that he was 24 and died after isolating himself in an elevator shaft at the top of the building site. The shooting occurred as the Fifa Women\u2019s World Cup was due to begin in Auckland on Thursday night, with a match between New Zealand and Norway. Players staying in hotels nearby described their experiences as the shooting unfolded. Authorities said the tournament would proceed as planned and that there was no threat. \u201cAucklanders and those watching around the world can be assured that the police have neutralised the threat and that they are not seeking anybody else,\u201d Hipkins said. The gunman was armed with a pump-action shotgun. \u201cHe moved through the building site and discharged his firearm. Upon reaching the upper levels of the building the man contained himself in an elevator and Police engaged with him, shots were fired and he was located a short time later,\u201d the prime minister said. Police said it was safe for members of the public to return to the city centre. \u201cPolice are reassuring the public that they can continue to come into the CBD,\u201d New Zealand police said, with the security cordon lifted several hours after the shooting. The organisers of the Fifa Fan Festival are waiting for further advice from the police before deciding when to open. The Fan Festival was meant to have opened at midday local time. There would be an update at 2pm, the organisers said. In a second press conference later on Thursday, Hipkins said police will investigate how the shooter managed to get hold of a gun despite not having a licence. They will look to see if \u201cred flags that could have identified something earlier,\u201d he said. He expressed his condolences for the families of those killed. \u201cThe whole nation is mourning with you.\u201d He reiterated that it was safe to go to the World Cup match tonight, and that he would be there himself. Hipkins reiterates that it is safe to go to the FIFA match tonight. He will be going and it is safe to go, he says. Police are going to investigate how the shooter managed to get hold of a gun despite not having a licence. They will look to see if \u201cred flags that could have identified something earlier,\u201d he says. New Zealand Prime Minister Chris Hipkins is speaking now. He expresses his condolences for the families of those killed. \u201cThe whole nation is mourning with you,\u201d he says. We\u2019re expecting New Zealand Prime Minister Chris Hipkins to speak at 5pm local time \u2013ten minutes from now. Jerome Hisus, originally from the Philippines, told The Guardian\u2019s Anna Rankin that many of the construction workers on the site where the shooting happened were Filipino. \u201cThey told me they had seen firing from a gun, one man had seen the gunman and told me someone had fallen on the stairs\u2014maybe he had been shot. They were speaking Filipino so I was able to figure out what was going on.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Anna Rankin is on the ground in Auckland and has spoken to witnesses: Truck drivers for a manufacturing company, Jerome Hisus and Christina Tuala, arrived this morning at a building adjacent to the site of the shooting to deliver joinery supplies for a store fit-out. The pair finished unloading at around 7:30 am when shots rang out above, prompting streams of workers to flee the building en masse. They could see three men cowering in a corner, Tuala said. First we heard two gunshots, we had closed up our truck, and everyone started running. We looked up and saw two men crouching, cowering in the corner, and one lying down, we thought he had been shot. We got escorted out and could see another ten people in the building, trapped in there. We didn\u2019t know why people were running at first. There were about 50 workers, and what seemed like hundreds as we were escorted across the road. People were yelling to get out, police and security were helping to push people behind buildings, or anything hard, because the shooting was happening.\u201d US Ambassador Tom Udall has expressed his condolences, saying, \u201cJill and I, alongside our U.S. wh\u0101nau, are heartbroken by the senseless tragic event that took place in T\u0101maki Makaurau, Auckland this morning. Sending our deepest thoughts and aroha to everyone affected, their families, and the entire community. Kia kaha.\u201d Lynn Williams, of the US women\u2019s football team, have spoken at a press conference ahead of the World Cup\u2019s opening, Stuff.NZ reports. \u201cUnfortunately, in the US, it feels like we\u2019ve dealt with this far too many times,\u201d she said. Governor general Cindy Kiro has released a statement: I was deeply shocked to learn of the shooting incident in Auckland this morning. My husband and I extend our sincerest sympathy to the families of the victims. Successive Governors-General have had close relationships with NZ Police, and we admire their bravery and share their concern for their wounded colleague. As Prior of the Order of St John, I also commend the courage of the first responders to the scene. I know we speak for all New Zealanders in expressing our aroha to everyone who has been impacted by this terrible event. The property company that owns the building where the incident occurred has issued a statement, Stuff.NZ reports. The chief executive of Scott Pritchard, Precinct Properties, who own 1 Queen St, said: \u201cOn behalf of Precinct Properties, I would like to extend our sincere condolences to the families of the victims following this morning\u2019s tragic incident. Our thoughts are also with those workers onsite who were involved in today\u2019s traumatic events.\u201d \u201cWe are deeply shocked and saddened that this occurred on our 1 Queen Street construction site, and I would like to thank the Emergency Services who bravely responded,\u201d chief executive Scott Pritchard said. He said the site will be closed until advised by the police. A little bit more detail about the Fifa Fan Festival at The Cloud, which will not open today as planned. Ng\u0101ti Wh\u0101tua \u014cr\u0101kei, the Office of the Mayor and Auckland Council said in a statement that, out of respect for the dead and those affected by the shooting, it would cancel festivities at the Queens Wharf but that it would be open at midday on Friday. Here is what we know so far about today\u2019s events: Two people were killed and six injured by a gunman in a shooting at a building site in central Auckland on Thursday morning, hours before the Women\u2019s World Cup was due to start in the city.

The offender was the subject of a home detention sentence, but had an exemption to work at the building site where the shooting occurred, New Zealand police commissioner Andrew Coster said. \u201cThe individual is known for primarily family violence history,\u201d he said. He said there were \u201cindications of mental health history\u201d but that there was no evidence he was of high lethal risk and that his previous offences did not suggest he posed this kind of threat. Police did not identify the gunman, saying only that he was 24 and died after isolating himself in an elevator shaft at the top of the building site. The shooting occurred as the Fifa Women\u2019s World Cup was due to begin in Auckland on Thursday night, with a match between New Zealand and Norway. Players staying in hotels nearby described their experiences as the shooting unfolded. Authorities said the tournament would proceed as planned and that there was no threat. \u201cAucklanders and those watching around the world can be assured that the police have neutralised the threat and that they are not seeking anybody else,\u201d Hipkins said. The gunman was armed with a pump-action shotgun. \u201cHe moved through the building site and discharged his firearm. Upon reaching the upper levels of the building the man contained himself in an elevator and Police engaged with him, shots were fired and he was located a short time later,\u201d the prime minister said. Police said it was safe for members of the public to return to the city centre. \u201cPolice are reassuring the public that they can continue to come into the CBD,\u201d New Zealand police said, with the security cordon lifted several hours after the shooting. The organisers of the Fifa Fan Festival are waiting for further advice from the police before deciding when to open. The Fan Festival was meant to have opened at midday local time. There would be an update at 2pm, the organisers said. The Fan Festival will be closed, \u201cout of deep respect for those who lost their lives and those affected in downtown Auckland today\u201d, organisers said. Meanwhile all of the cities roads are now open. The FIFA Fan Festival in Auckland will remain closed today, organisers have said. Here is New Zealand police commissioner Andrew Coster addressing the media after the shooting: The New Zealand police have published the full statement from Police Commissioner Andrew Coster. You can read it here. We\u2019re expecting New Zealand Prime Minister Chris Hipkins to release a statement shortly. Here is our full summary of what happened today: Speaking in New Zealand\u2019s parliament, Deputy Prime Minister Carmel Sepuloni said that it was too early to say whether the Prime Minister would meet the families of the people killed in today\u2019s shooting, the New Zealand Herald reports. \u201cTo think that people had gone to work this morning in the CBD and this is what they\u2019d encountered \u2013 absolutely shocking.\u201d \u201cWe can only imagine what they are going through at the moment. We share in the sadness and like them we will be awaiting more updates from the investigation.\u201d She also spoke more about the shooter\u2019s history. \u201cAnd, despite some family harm history, there was nothing to suggest something of this nature would happen. They have also been clear that they had done searches of the house and never come across any firearms. So that is the information we have.\u201d \u201cClearly he didn\u2019t have a firearms license, but they searched, they didn\u2019t come across any firearms.\u201d Some Auckland roads are still closed, the city\u2019s transport authority says. It has published this map: Apologies, that was not Deputy Prime Minister Carmel Sepuloni. Her comments from parliament shortly. The New Zealand Herald reports that a Parliamentary hearing on a petition to allow gun club members to own banned semi-automatic rifles for competition, which had been due to take place this afternoon, has been cancelled. The petitioner is the Council of Licensed Firearms Owners, and the committee was also due to hear from the Pistol New Zealand and the New Zealand Police. \u201cPetitions Committee chair and National MP Jacqui Dean told the Herald it was cancelled due to sensitivities over this morning\u2019s shooting incident and would be scheduled for a later date,\u201d the Herald reports. Three people were killed, including a gunman, and six injured, in a shooting in downtown Auckland on Thursday morning. The shooting was not politically or ideologically motivated, New Zealand Prime Minister Chris Hipkins said. At least one police officer was among those injured. The offender was the subject of home detention, but had an exception to work at the site, New Zealand Police Commissioner Andrew Coster said. \u201cThe individual is known for primarily family violence history,\u201d he said. He said there were \u201cindications of mental health history\u201d but that there was no evidence he was of high lethal risk and that his previous offences did not suggest he posed this kind of threat. The gunman, 24, killed two people before he died, either due to police fire or by shooting himself. The offender did not have a gun license. He is believed to have used a shotgun. The police officer injured was shot during an exchange of fire with the gunman. He is in a stable condition and is expected to have surgery today. The shooting occurred as the FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup was due to begin in Auckland on Thursday night, with a match between New Zealand and Norway. Authorities said the tournament would proceed as planned and that there was no threat. \u201cAucklanders and those watching around the world can be assured that the police have neutralised the threat and that they are not seeking anybody else in relation to the incident,\u201d Hipkins said. The gunman was armed with a shotgun. \u201cHe moved through the building site and discharged his firearm. Upon reaching the upper levels of the building the man contained himself in an elevator and Police engaged with him, shots were fired and he was located a short time later,\u201d Hipkins said. Police said it was safe for members of the public to return to the CBD. \u201cPolice are reassuring the public that they can continue to come into the CBD,\u201d the New Zealand police aid on Twitter. \u201cHowever, if there is anyone who was involved or witnessed today\u2019s events, and they haven\u2019t made themselves known to Police, we ask that you please contact us via 105 as soon as you can.\u201d The organisers of the FIFA Fan Festival are waiting for further advice from the police before deciding when to open. The Fan Festival was meant to have opened at midday local time. There would be an update at 2pm, the organisers said. Norway is due to play tonight against New Zealand at the world cup opener. The team\u2019s hotel is located 300-400 metres from where the shooting occurred. The team\u2019s captain, Maren Mjelde, said, \u201cWe felt safe the whole time. FIFA has a good security system at the hotel, and we have our own security officer in the squad.\u201d He says five ambulances and four rapid response vehicles, as well as support and command units, were sent to the scene. The head of operations for St John ambulance, Stuart Cockburn, is speaking now. Coster says he is \u201cincredibly proud of the actions our staff took\u201d and that \u201ctheir willingness to go in there and sort it out is outstanding.\u201d There have been \u201cindications of mental health history\u201d in the offender, but, Coster said earlier, there was no evidence he was of high lethal risk. Those shot were shot while on the lower levels of the buildings, Coster says. The injured officer was shot during the exchange of fire while the offender was in the elevator well, he says. The officer is expected to have surgery today. The offender was the subject of home detention, but had an exception to work at the site, Coster said. \u201cThe individual is known for primarily family violence history,\u201d he says. He adds that he believes there were \u201cindications of mental health history\u201d in the offender, but that there was no evidence he was of high lethal risk and that his previous offences did not suggest he posed this kind of threat. The gunman, 24, killed two people before he died, either due to police fire or by shooting himself. Coster is asked whether he knows if the offender was killed in the exchange of fire or shot himself. Coster says that is not known at this time. The individual did not have a firearms license, he was believed to be using a shotgun. Police remain satisfied that there is no risk to the public, says Coster. The four members of the public injured have wounds ranging from moderate to serious, says Coster. The offender has not been formally identified. However they believe he is a 24-year-old male who was employed at the construction site where the shooting occurred. New Zealand Police commissioner Andrew Coster is speaking now in Auckland. He extends his sympathies to the families of those killed. \u201cI\u2019ve had an update from the investigation team\u2026 at 7.22am police received multiple emergency calls,\u201d he says. \u201cPolice were on the scene within minutes.\u201d The offender made his way up through the building site discharging his firearm multiple times. At around 8am the offender was located inside an elevator shaft. The offender fired at police, injuring an officer. \u201cShots were discharged and the offender was later found deceased,\u201d he says. The TYLA Youth Development Trust worked with the gunman in 2017, Jolene Cartwright, the organisation\u2019s co-general manager has told Stuff.NZ. \u201cWe just found out and are still dealing with the situation. Our thoughts go out to everyone involved in the tragic situation that\u2019s unfolded,\u201d Cartwright said. Here is our story on how the shooting has impacted Women\u2019s World Cup players: The New Zealand Herald reports that police at the scene are removing parts of the cordon blocking and that the first public vehicles have been allowed through. The US team, who are also based in an Auckland hotel within walking distance of the incident, are due to front the media later today, with star players Crystal Dunn and Lynn Williams scheduled to appear. Gun violence is a topic that has been addressed in the past by members of the women\u2019s national team, including Megan Rapinoe, who has been vocal in her support of gun control laws in her home country. FIFA has released a statement: FIFA extends its deepest condolences to the families and friends of the victims who lost their lives following the incident which occurred this morning in Auckland, New Zealand, and our thoughts and prayers remain with those who have been injured in this tragic incident. Immediately following the incident, President Gianni Infantino and FIFA Secretary-General Fatma Samoura were in communication with the New Zealand authorities. FIFA has also been in constant contact with the participating teams affected by this incident. FIFA has been informed that this was an isolated incident that was not related to football operations and the opening match tonight at Eden Park will proceed as planned. The opening hours of the FIFA Fan Festival in Auckland city centre will be confirmed in due course. The participating teams in close proximity to this incident are being supported in relation to any impact that may have taken place. We\u2019re expecting to hear from New Zealand Police commissioner Andrew Coster at 1pm local time \u2013 fifteen minutes from now. Australia and New Zealand will open the ninth Women\u2019s World Cup, which is being co-hosted by the two nations ,later today \u2013 despite the shooting near the Norwegian team hotel in Auckland that left three dead and six injured. New Zealand\u2019s Football Ferns will open the tournament as planned at Eden Park in the city against Norway on Thursday at 7pm local time (0700 GMT), in what is likely to surpass the host nation\u2019s previous biggest crowd for an international soccer match. Here is footage of the police operation this morning: Here is a video or New Zealand prime minister Chris Hipkins\u2019s press conference earlier. Hipkins confirmed that a gunman killed two people and injured at least six others, including police, at a building site in Auckland on the day of the opening of the Women\u2019s World Cup: \u201cPolice are reassuring the public that they can continue to come into the CBD,\u201d the New Zealand police have just said on Twitter. \u201cHowever, if there is anyone who was involved or witnessed today\u2019s events, and they haven\u2019t made themselves known to Police, we ask that you please contact us via 105 as soon as you can.\u201d The New Zealand Police have released further information about the shooting. \u201cPolice can confirm an officer has been injured, as well as four members of the public at this stage. The Police officer was transported to hospital in a critical condition, but we can advise his condition has stabilised,\u201d they said on Twitter. \u201cAs we have previously advised this is not a national security risk. Police are liaising with the families of the victims, including that of the deceased, and we have engaged with Victim Support. Support is in place for our officer.\u201d This map shows where the shooting occurred. It is a seven minute walk from the Cloud, where the FIFA Fan Festival \u2013 a place where people can watch match broadcasts together \u2013 is due to take place. Stuff.NZ reports that the organisers of the FIFA Fan Festival are waiting for further advice from the police before deciding when to open. The Fan Festival was meant to have opened a few minutes ago, at midday. There will be an update at 2pm, the organisers said. \u201cAll seems calm, and we are preparing as normal for the match tonight,\u201d Norway captain Maren Mjelde told Norwegian newspaper Verdens Gang while the police operation was underway. Norway plays New Zealand in the opening match of the tournament at Eden Park in Auckland later on Thursday. A construction worker who was at the building when the shootings occurred has spoken to the New Zealand Herald. He said that he hid on one floor of the building before moving towards the top of thr tower. Then a fire alarm sounded, and workers started to walk down the building\u2019s stairs. \u201cAn armed man in a dark jacket came up and shouted for them to get up to the roof or he would shoot them,\u201d the Herald reports. The man said he was shaken, and that he had heard multiple gunshots being fired. The US Soccer team have released a new statement saying: US Soccer extends its deepest condolences to the families of the victims who were killed in the shooting in downtown Auckland today. We are saddened by the inexcusable loss of life to gun violence, and our thoughts are with the people of Auckland/T\u0101maki Makaurau and Aotearoa New Zealand. Auckland Mayor Wayne Brown has spoken about the shooting, Stuff.NZ reports, saying, \u201cWhile the details of the victims have not yet been confirmed, I want to express my condolences to their families. I also want express sympathy for those in the construction industry and commuters who will be feeling on edge following this incident.\u201d Football Australia\u2019s head of marketing, Peter Filopoulos, has said on Twitter that Australia stands with New Zealand. \u201cDeeply saddened by the shocking incident in Auckland. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the victims and their families in these difficult times. As a peace-loving nation, we stand with New Zealand in solidarity. The situation seems to be contained now, thanks to NZ authorities. This incident is unrelated to the Women\u2019s World Cup. Stay safe everyone,\u201d he said. The US Embassy has confirmed that Douglas Emhoff, the husband of US Vice President Kamala Harris, who is leading the presidential delegation to New Zealand to attend the opening ceremony of the World Cup, is safe. Former NZ international player Maia Jackson told the NZ Herald she was nearby when the shooting happened. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty scary actually. So they pushed us to the back of the crowd where we are and we\u2019re just trying to keep sane,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of security and lots of uncertainty.\u201d Here are some pictures following the shooting this morning: New Zealand Football said it was \u201cshocked by the incident\u201d and that New Zealand\u2019s women\u2019s team, the Football Ferns \u201care safe\u201d. Acting Police Superintendent Sunny Patel has given a little more detail about how the shooting occurred, the New Zealand Herald reports. \u201cThe offender has moved through the building site and continued to discharge his firearm. Upon reaching the upper levels of the building, the male has contained himself within the elevator shaft and our staff have attempted to engage with him,\u201d Patel said. \u201cFurther shots were fired from the male and he was located deceased a short time later.\u201d Auckland Central MP Chlo\u00eb Swarbrick says, \u201cDeepest condolences to those who have lost loved ones and to those who experienced this terrifying incident this morning on the construction site. \u201dOur gratitude to our frontline emergency workers who with great skill and care worked to contain the situation and keep the public informed. We will continue to be guided by their expertise.\u201d New Zealand Nationals leader Christopher Luxon says, \u201cWe will know more as the day unfolds - but for now we must do what Kiwis do best: come together and support people who have been affected in this terrible incident.\u201d Norway is due to play tonight against New Zealand at the world cup opener. As we\u2019ve just heard, the team\u2019s hotel is located fairly close to where the shooting occurred. The team\u2019s captain, Maren Mjelde, says, \u201cEveryone probably woke up quite quickly when the helicopter hovered outside the hotel window and a large number of emergency vehicles arrived.\u201d \u201cAt first we didn\u2019t know what was going on, but eventually there were updates on TV and the local media. \u201cWe felt safe the whole time. FIFA has a good security system at the hotel, and we have our own security officer in the squad. \u201dEveryone seems calm and we are preparing as normal for the game tonight. Then we may have to adapt if there are any instructions from the authorities.\u201d Norway Women\u2019s Football Team Head of Communications Halvor Lea has said in a statement that, \u201cTeam Norway lives 3-400 m from the incident, and is not affected. Everything is calm in the Norwegian squad, which is eating breakfast right now. Preparations are going as normal.\u201d Three people were killed, including a gunman, and six injured, in a shooting in downtown Auckland on Thursday morning. The shooting was not politically or ideologically motivated, New Zealand Prime Minister Chris Hipkins said. At least one police officer was among those injured. The shooting occurred as the FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup was due to begin in Auckland on Thursday night, with a match between New Zealand and Norway. Authorities said the tournament would proceed as planned and that there was no threat. \u201cAucklanders and those watching around the world can be assured that the police have neutralised the threat and that they are not seeking anybody else in relation to the incident,\u201d Hipkins said. The gunman was armed with a pump-action shotgun. \u201cHe moved through the building site and discharged his firearm. Upon reaching the upper levels of the building the man contained himself in an elevator and Police engaged with him, shots were fired and he was located a short time later,\u201d Hipkins said. Aucklanders were urged to stay home. \u201cThis is a scary situation for Aucklanders on their Thursday morning commute to work. Please stay at home, avoid travel into the city centre,\u201d Auckland Mayor Wayne Brown said in a tweet. Several streets in Auckland have been cordoned off, all ferry services into the city have been cancelled while buses running through some areas of the will be detoured, authorities said. That press conference is now over. Here is what Hipkins said earlier about the timing of the police arrivals at the scene: This morning at 7.23am a witness called Police to report witnessing a man with a gun shooting in central Auckland at a building on lower Queen Street. At 7.34am Police arrived on the scene and the Armed Offenders Squad was there four minutes later. \u2026 The offender was armed with a pump action shot gun. He moved through the building site and discharged his firearm. Upon reaching the upper levels of the building the man contained himself in an elevator and Police engaged with him, shots were fired and he was located a short time later. Hipkins was at the airport when he heard about the incident, he says, he tried to confirm as much information as he could while there and then made the decision to return to parliament. His initial reaction was concern for anybody was at risk. \u201cI know from my work with them as minister for police the entire [force] feels this,\u201d he says. \u201cWe will all feel that, we will all send our love and support to the New Zealand police who are doing an amazing job,\u201d he says. Hipkins is responding to questions and says that the police and a helicopter arrived within minutes of each other, and could hear gunshots as they arrived. The police commissioner will provide more detail in a briefing from Auckland later today. New Zealand sports minister Grant Robertson has also spoken, and has confirmed the tournament will go ahead as planned. He says that one team\u2019s hotel is located close to where the shooting occurred. New Zealand Prime Minister Chris Hipkins, speaking now after the shooting in downtown Auckland, says the government has been in regular contact with FIFA. The two people killed by the gunman were civilians, Hipkins says. His understanding is that there \u201cwas no political or ideological motive for the shooting\u201d, he says, when asked if it was an act of terrorism. The tournament will proceed as planned, says Hipkins. There is no national security threat. \u201cThis appears to be the actions of one individual.\u201d The incident comes as many football teams were gathering in New Zealand for the Women\u2019s World Cup. The opening match is scheduled for Thursday between New Zealand and Norway. \u201cAucklanders and those watching around the world can be assured that the police have neutralised the threat and that they are not seeking anybody else in relation to the incident,\u201d Hipkins said. \u201cNew Zealanders\u2019 safety and the safety of our visitors is our first priorities.\u201d The man was armed with a pump-action shotgun, moving through the building before enclosing himself in an elevator, at which time shots were heard. The gunman was later found dead. It is unclear whether the gunman shot himself or police shot him. Hipkins has thanked the police for entering the building while the shooting was ongoing. Hipkins confirms that two people have been killed, six have been injured, including police, and the shooter is dead. There is no national security risk, there is no change to New Zealand\u2019s national security level. Prime Minister Chris Hipkins has cancelled a trip to the city of Hamilton, about 120 kilometres (75 miles) south of Auckland, and is on his way back to the national capital Wellington, media reports said.

Collaery\u2019s legal team gave evidence on Thursday to the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor, Grant Donaldson, about their experience in dealing with the secrecy restrictions contained in the National Security Information (NSI) Act, which is designed to safeguard sensitive information during court proceedings. Intelligence agencies believe the law is necessary to prevent sensitive material being exploited by foreign spies, who see court cases as a potential intelligence collection tool, and believe it is appropriately balancing the need for secrecy with the proper administration of justice. Collaery\u2019s legal team told Donaldson that, while they understand the need for the NSI Act, it has fundamental problems and requires significant reform. In a detailed submission earlier this month, they told the inquiry the secrecy restrictions on the case were so severe that Collaery was forced to obtain government approval for his lawyer to view evidence against him, communicate with his legal team in-person in secure rooms chosen by the commonwealth, physically transport documents around the country at exorbitant cost and compose drafts on commonwealth laptop computers at pre-approved locations. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The government was also able to lead \u201ccourt-only evidence\u201d in support of its effort to impose secrecy on the case. That court-only evidence was deemed so sensitive that Collaery and his legal team were never able to see or know about it. Phillip Boulten SC, who acted for Collaery and sits on the Law Council of Australia\u2019s national criminal law committee, said the use of court-only evidence could potentially go further. He suggested that evidence about a defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence \u2013 material that goes to the substantive issues at trial \u2013 could be completely withheld from a defendant and their lawyers under the NSI Act, and shown only to a court or jury. \u201cIt is more than theoretically open to the prosecuting authorities and to the government to want to try to prosecute someone where evidence that goes to the facts in issue is so secret that the accused should not know it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we say there should be a ban on that.\u201d Boulten said defendants could seek a permanent stay to halt the case against them in such cases, citing the unfairness. Donaldson, a watchdog overseeing national security laws, suggested that the argument over a stay \u201cwouldn\u2019t be a very long\u201d one, given the clear unfairness such a scenario would pose to defendants. \u201cAre you talking about evidence that goes before a jury, to which jury has a regard in deciding guilt or innocence, that is not shown to the defendant or defence and they\u2019re not present in court while it\u2019s given?\u201d Boulten replied: \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about. That might be very, very easily solved in a criminal trial. It might not be so straightforward in civil proceedings and it\u2019s certainly not the case in proceedings where they are designed to make orders against somebody.\u201d Earlier, the Human Rights Law Centre and the Law Council of Australia raised serious concerns about the NSI Act and called for significant reform. The HRLC senior lawyer Kieran Pender told the inquiry the laws \u201csignificantly undermined open justice\u201d. Pender made a series of recommendations, including that an independent advocate be appointed in NSI Act cases to ensure someone is in court arguing for open justice. \u201c[The open justice advocate] addresses an all-too-real vice in these cases where secrecy otherwise suits the interests of all of the parties,\u201d he said. The Law Council of Australia said the way the NSI Act was operating represented an \u201cunacceptable restriction on the right to a fair trial, and to a public hearing and the principle of open justice\u201d. The Law Council said the NSI Act effectively allows the government to dictate which lawyers can act for defendants by imposing a security clearance requirement. Lloyd Babb SC, the chair of the Law Council\u2019s national security law working group and the NT\u2019s top prosecutor, said the law is at odds with Australia\u2019s international obligations. \u201cWithout significant amendments, these provisions permit an unjustified interference to a person\u2019s legal right to a legal representative of his or her choosing,\u201d Babb said. \u201cThis is a critical facet of the rule of law and it is protected by Australia\u2019s obligations under international human rights law.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b22368", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jul/20/nhs-consultants-strike-in-england-may-cancel-surgery-for-tens-of-thousands", "primaryCategory": "society", "subCategories": "test", "title": "NHS consultants\u2019 strike in England may cancel surgery for tens of thousands", "lead": "Routine care to come to virtual halt for 48 hours this week and in August after improved pay offer ruled out", "author": "Andrew Gregory Health editor", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 05:00:21", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.231224", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/ff6b1bb2e778ffc2d888005d7e132f5f58eafd3c/0_197_4620_2772/500.jpg", "body": "Tens of thousands of patients in England face surgeries being cancelled this summer with consultants striking for 96 hours, after Steve Barclay ruled out an improved pay offer.

On Thursday Barclay defiantly announced that his offer of a 6% pay rise was \u201cfinal\u201d, meaning four days of chaos and mass cancellations now look inevitable. \u201cI am disappointed the BMA is going ahead with this week\u2019s strike, given the average consultant\u2019s NHS earnings are expected to increase to \u00a3134,000 a year,\u201d he said. \u201cMy door is always open to discuss non-pay issues, but this pay award is final so I urge the BMA to end their strikes immediately.\u201d More than 600,000 appointments, procedures and operations have already been missed, ditched or postponed in eight months of industrial action across the health service. This week alone brought the longest period of industrial action in the history of the NHS by junior doctors. The five-day strike from last Thursday to Tuesday morning resulted in 101,977 appointments and procedures being cancelled, according to NHS England. An even bigger impact was anticipated from consultants going on strike for four days, senior health sources said. That is largely down to two factors. First, consultants won\u2019t be performing any operations themselves. But second, any planned care delivered by junior doctors or other healthcare professionals that requires even remote consultant supervision will also need to be rescheduled. This means a significant amount of planned care involving junior doctors and other health workers, as well as consultants, will be affected, according to people familiar with the matter. The NHS England medical director, Prof Sir Stephen Powis, warned patients this week that mass disruption was expected across the NHS as consultants move to providing just emergency cover. For the next two days, the health service will be able to operate at the level of service usually seen on Christmas Day. Most outpatient appointments and elective surgeries such as hip and knee replacements and cataract removals will be cancelled and will have to be rescheduled for later in the year. The public is still being told to dial 999 in life-threatening emergencies and to use NHS 111 online for other health concerns. GP services and pharmacies will also be running as normal. Barclay on Thursday criticised consultants for going ahead with the strike despite him last week awarding them a 6% salary increase. \u201cI hugely value the work of NHS consultants, which is why we have accepted the independent pay review body recommendations in full, giving them a 6% pay rise this year, on top of last year\u2019s 4.5% increase.\u201d Consultants say they have suffered a 35% drop in the real-terms value of their income since 2008-09 and are seeking \u201cfull pay restoration\u201d. The BMA published a new analysis on Thursday suggesting that consultant pay had fallen behind lawyers, architects and financial advisers over the past 14 years, with cash increases for those professions growing at six times the rate of NHS consultants. The chair of the BMA consultants committee, Dr Vishal Sharma, said: \u201cThis dispute is not just about one year\u2019s pay settlement, it is about the reality of 14 years of consultant pay falling behind, about a loss in our pay in real terms of 35% and the broken pay review system that has allowed this to happen. \u201cThere is absolutely no justification for the wages of some of the country\u2019s most senior doctors to not have kept pace with those of comparable professions. \u201cConsultants will stand on the picket lines today because we are angry and at rock bottom. This government is failing us, failing patients and failing to see ministers have the ability to stop the crisis unfolding in front of their eyes.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b22369", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/20/uk-horticulturalists-moth-friendly-gardens-tatton-park-flower-show", "primaryCategory": "environment", "subCategories": "test", "title": "UK horticulturalists call for more moth-friendly gardens", "lead": "Tatton Park flower show features garden of flowering plants whose heady scents at night attract crucial but \u2018invisible\u2019 pollinators", "author": "Helena Horton Environment reporter", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 05:00:21", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.231244", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/d696d2fdc1062815a004d25b6f8daa71965ffec6/0_14_3508_2105/500.jpg", "body": "Gardens should be as attractive to pollinators at night as they are in the day, horticulturalists have said, as they present a moth-friendly version at a flower show in Cheshire. The RHS nocturnal pollinators experience garden at Tatton Park flower show, which began on Wednesday, showcases flowering plants that produce heady scents at night to attract moths, which a 2020 study found were crucial but \u201cinvisible\u201d pollinators. Many gardeners are optimising their backyards for bees and butterflies, which is also very important, but many do not think about how attractive their gardens are to nocturnal visitors. The garden designer Sharon Hockenhull has filled her Tatton Park entrywith night-scented flowers. She said: \u201cI\u2019ve planted a lot of jasmine. That\u2019s very, very heady. We\u2019ve also got things like evening primrose, and scented stocks because that just smells so heavenly.\u201d Hockenhull added: \u201cAll those beautiful evening scents, which we should all have in our garden space because we can get so much enjoyment out of it \u2013 and so can the moths. I\u2019ve also designed it with a lot of white flowers for that sort of night-time luminosity.\u201d As well as beautiful late summer blooms, the garden features brambles, nettles and other plants commonly classed as weeds, because these are what moths like to lay their eggs on, and also provide food for caterpillars. Hockenhall said: \u201cThey tend to breed in our native plants, and they are more specific as to where they breed than other insects. It\u2019s so important to try to embrace the idea of wild plants in your garden. Bramble is amazing, some caterpillars love nettles, we in the gardening world need to encourage the idea of being more tolerant of these weeds.\u201d She added that gardeners needed to be more accepting of caterpillars that may munch on their plants. \u201cWe need to encourage people to be more tolerant of a few holes here and there in the leaves of their garden plants,\u201d Hockenhull said. \u201cAfter all, it means a caterpillar has visited and that your garden is doing its job for pollinators.\u201d As with all wildlife gardening, a diversity of habitats to appeal to different species is important, and Hockenhall has created a few of these as inspiration for visitors. She said: \u201cThere\u2019s lots of different habitats from trees to hedges to small shrubs. I\u2019ve got a little rockery area because there are some amazing plants for native moths, like heathers and grasses and mosses. We\u2019ve got a lovely perennial border that is full of vibrant colour and is full of nectar. We\u2019ve also got a moisture-retaining area for the garden, to provide a water source for wildlife.\u201d Dr Hayley Jones, an entomologist at the RHS, advises members on how to optimise their gardens for insects. She said the main advice she gave people was to focus on not making their gardens too tidy. \u201cProvide spaces for hiding during the winter. So lots of moths make their pupa just under the top level of the soil or underneath leaf litter in a little crevice. The pupa are normally just very shallowly buried, so you\u2019ve got to have some hiding places for that,\u201d she said. As well as night-flowering plants such as evening primrose and nicotiana for adult moths, Jones said providing food for caterpillars was important: \u201cYou\u2019ve really got to support the caterpillar to really boost their populations.\u201d \u2022 The RHS Tatton Park flower show runs from 19 to 23 July."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b2236a", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/20/extreme-weather-house-martins-britain", "primaryCategory": "environment", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Extreme weather could mean the end of beloved house martins in Britain", "lead": "Long, dry spells with little rain are drying up mud that breeding birds require to build their nests", "author": "Stephen Moss", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 05:00:21", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.231262", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/0fac756fef4d376e7131da0a7071dfbee65db529/0_97_2280_1368/500.jpg", "body": "The house martin is, like its near namesake the house sparrow, inextricably linked with our own lives.

One of the biggest problems facing breeding house martins is mud \u2013 or to be specific, the lack of it. Each year, having returned from their winter residence in Africa, house martins collect soft mud to build their cup-shaped nests beneath the eaves of our homes. Long, dry spells with little or no rain, such as the one we\u2019ve experienced this spring, mean that the pools and puddles where the house martins usually collect this mud have dried up; without mud, the birds will not be able to raise a family. The climate crisis doesn\u2019t just mean warmer weather \u2013 it can also lead to long spells of drought, or conversely heavy rains, which make it hard for these little birds to find the flying insects they need to feed their chicks.

The report, the first independent evaluation of T-levels commissioned by the Department for Education (DfE), is highly critical of the complex teaching and industry placements required during the two-year courses, which are intended as a vocational equivalent to A-levels in England. The Ofsted chief inspector, Amanda Spielman, said there were \u201cteething issues\u201d with T-levels that colleges and employers were working to overcome. \u201cHowever, we saw a range of shortcomings which providers and the Department for Education will want to address,\u201d Spielman said. Ofsted inspected T-level courses and interviewed teachers and students taking subjects such as healthcare and construction. It found that some colleges were struggling to recruit staff qualified to deliver the curriculum, with the high workload making it \u201cparticularly hard to teach everything in the time available\u201d. Ofsted also found that while most students complete their T-level, \u201cmany leave before the end of the course, and the number of students who progress to the second year of T-level courses is low in many providers. In at least one provider, no students progressed from the first year of the T-level course to the second year.\u201d The report concludes: \u201cAt worst, courses are not at all what students expected, and many students reported being misled and ill-informed about their content and structure.\u201d A spokesperson for the DfE said: \u201cWe have already made good progress to address many of the areas highlighted in the report, but we know further action is needed. To support providers and ensure T-level delivery is a success, we are continuing to offer a range of support, including funding to help more businesses to offer industry placement and additional funding for facilities through the T-level capital fund, with \u00a3100m for over 100 projects in the latest wave of funding this month.\u201d Only 10,000 students enrolled in the qualification in 2022-23, with colleges unable to fill courses in several subjects. A new T-level in catering, which was expected to be popular, has been delayed until 2025 after the original awarding organisation pulled out this year. Despite the problems, the government has pushed ahead with funding cuts for rival level 3 qualifications such as BTecs, which are taken by more than 200,000 students each year. James Kewin, the deputy chief executive of the Sixth Form Colleges Association, said Ofsted\u2019s report \u201cis clear that T-levels are not yet the gold-standard, mass-market replacement for BTecs the government believes them to be\u201d. He said: \u201cIt also highlights the dismal record of the T-level transition programme, where the vast majority of students do not actually progress to a T-level, and the associated risk of relying on this initiative as way of boosting T-level participation. Ministers need to drop the rhetoric, face the reality and rethink their plans for qualification reform.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b2236c", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/20/tv-tonight-rosie-joness-depressing-documentary-about-online-hate-speech", "primaryCategory": "tv-and-radio", "subCategories": "test", "title": "TV tonight: Rosie Jones\u2019s depressing documentary about online hate-speech", "lead": "Jones talks to researchers and those on both sides of the trolling.

The Roman general Quintus Fabius Maximus followed a similar approach against Hannibal\u2019s Carthaginians, preferring to tie the enemy down in a long war of attrition rather than confronting them in a pitched battle. At the time, many impatient contemporaries thought both Ali and Fabius had taken leave of their senses. Many were proved wrong. Keir Starmer has neither Ali\u2019s charisma nor Fabius\u2019s military prowess. But it is not entirely an exaggeration to suggest he has a rope-a-dope strategy and an attritional mentality all of his own that carry at least some echoes of these two legends. Nor that this is all straining some impatient supporters to the limit, just as it did at ringside in Kinshasa and doubtless did in the taverns of Ancient Rome. Talk to anyone in the shadow cabinet and they all agree on one thing. The Labour leader is absolutely focused on winning. \u201cTo build a better Britain, we have got to win,\u201d he messaged party members this week. So he will not be tempted into trying a premature knock-out punch or be drawn into a battle before he has solidified his trust with the voters. And he is not going to change. Thursday\u2019s byelections have to be seen in that light. The three contests \u2013 in Selby and Ainsty, Somerton and Frome, and Uxbridge and South Ruislip: all Conservative-held seats \u2013 are the most important electoral test of the second half of this year. Along with three further potential autumn contests \u2013 in Tory-held Mid Bedfordshire and in Tamworth, as well as in the SNP-held Rutherglen and Hamilton West \u2013 they will define the terrain on which next year\u2019s general election contest will be fought. Rightly or wrongly, it is clear Starmer regards victory in these contests as pivotal and as the pre-eminent task, eclipsing all others. Wins would be \u201cpriceless\u201d he said this week. All evidence shows Starmer laser-focused on winning the trust of disaffected voters, and on not scaring off those he needs to win to Labour\u2019s side. Most of these are previous Tory voters, people who supported Boris Johnson in 2019. To vote Labour, they need to trust Starmer with the country \u2013 and, above all, to trust Labour with the still volatile and wounded economy. You can see why this grates so much with many in Starmer\u2019s party. But at the same time, you can see why the strategy makes sense. Labour currently has a clear lead among voters on the key metric of being seen as the best party at handling the economy \u2013 the party is on 25%, to the Tories\u2019 19%. But that lead is modest, only six points, and 25% is itself a small share. For Labour to be confident, it should be higher; self-evidently, there is more work to be done. Last month\u2019s confirmation that the general election will now be fought on new constituency boundaries underscores this need. Fully 585 of the UK\u2019s 650 parliamentary seats will change in some way, many of them radically. The number of MPs from England will increase, while those from Scotland and (in particular) Wales will drop. Southern England and London will gain at the expense of the north. The partisan shift involved in this is likely to be relatively small \u2013 the Tory election expert Lord Hayward thinks there will be a five- to 10-seat advantage to his party \u2013 but the momentum of Britain\u2019s changing electoral geography is hard to deny. We are a changed and changing nation. Seats in which Labour needs to compete to win, mainly but not all in southern and Midlands England, are more than ever the norm. Labour has to work within these realities or shrivel into minority status. It\u2019s a genuinely difficult choice. But it helps explain why Starmer courted a party backlash with his decision not to reverse the Conservatives\u2019 two-child limit on child benefit. The case for reversing it is obvious. Yet amid negligible economic growth, and huge existing demands on government spending, there are also risks in promising higher welfare payments that would require higher taxes or borrowing. The public is clearly in favour of the two-child limit. These choices cannot be wished away. Voters know that. So does Starmer. The byelection results will be an interim verdict on his approach. A three-nil defeat for the Tories has been priced in, as part of government expectation management. We will soon see. A Labour win in Selby and Ainsty would probably be the party\u2019s most spectacular capture from the Tories since Dudley West in 1994, and would be treated by Starmer as a vindication. But his strategy is unlikely to change, even if the Conservatives hang on to Boris Johnson\u2019s old seat in west London, where local issues are important for perhaps the first time in a byelection since Bermondsey 40 years ago. Starmer\u2019s message to his party at the start of the week was full of familiar urgings to win in Selby and Uxbridge. Significantly, he never once mentioned Somerton and Frome. The reality is that Labour is holding the gate open for the Lib Dems\u2019 Sarah Dyke to win the Somerset seat, but without saying so. Tact not pact. Those who think Labour should embrace tactical voting are entitled to feel sore about that hypocrisy. But even the hypocrisy should be understood. Much of it is fuelled by the absolute determination to prevent Jeremy Corbyn being a Labour candidate in 2024. If Corbyn runs as an independent, he can be expelled from the party. If he does not run, he will be history. It is a win-win for Starmer, but Labour tactical voting advocates such as Neal Lawson, of the cross-party campaign organisation Compass, have become collateral damage. \u201cTo govern is to choose\u201d is one of the oldest cliches in the political book. Like all cliches, though, it contains more than a grain of truth. Making tough choices is one of the tests that Labour has to pass. One of the many reasons it lost in 2019 is that it pretended everything on its wish list was possible. Voters knew that was untrue. Success in politics is not a choice between trust and hope. It is a synthesis of the two. Yet it is trust that makes possible a two-term government of the kind that Starmer, surely rightly, envisages. The plain truth is that his government may have to suck up some hard economic times before it can deliver what it wants. Fabius would have understood that. So, surely, would Ali. And so did the early Labour party. The first pamphlet published in 1884 by the Fabian society, itself named after the Roman leader, was pregnantly entitled Why are the Many Poor? On its title page it stated: \u201cFor the right moment you must wait, as Fabius did most patiently, when warring against Hannibal, though many censured his delays; but when the time comes you must strike hard, as Fabius did, or your waiting will be in vain, and fruitless.\u201d That\u2019s just as true today as it was then. It would be remarkable \u2013 and fly in the face of all the evidence \u2013 if Starmer does not realise it.

Sitting in the front row: Donald Trump, the former US president. Also in attendance: extremists and election deniers. On the big screen: a box office hit promoted by followers of QAnon. Trump, who is running for president again, hosted a private screening of Sound of Freedom, a thriller about child sex trafficking, at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, on Wednesday night. The film is not likely to trouble the Oscar judges. But it has been a surprise success in cinemas with both traditional conservatives and the far right. Trump\u2019s seal of approval could give it a boost with such audiences that money cannot buy. Before the screening, the ex-president praised lead actor Jim Caviezel as a \u201cgreat star\u201d who is \u201cdoing very well\u201d and invited his former strategist Steve Bannon \u2013 \u201che can\u2019t stand controversy\u201d \u2013 to address the audience.

Other guests included Kari Lake, a former candidate for governor of Arizona and fervent promoter of the \u201cbig lie\u201d of a stolen election, and Jack Posobiec, who has pushed bogus conspiracy theories such as \u201cPizzagate\u201d, which held that Democrats were running a child sex and torture ring beneath a pizzeria in Washington. Sound of Freedom is based on a true story. It stars Caviezel as Tim Ballard, a controversial former homeland security department agent who tried to rescue children from sex traffickers in Colombia. Both men attended the screening at Bedminster along with producer Eduardo Ver\u00e1stegui. Sound of Freedom\u2019s religious overtones have struck a chord with evangelicals. At one point Caviezel \u2013 who previously played Jesus Christ in Mel Gibson\u2019s The Passion of the Christ \u2013 is asked about his motivations. He replies: \u201cGod\u2019s children are not for sale.\u201d The screenplay never directly references QAnon, a baseless conspiracy theory that asserts Democrats are a cabal of Satan worshippers who traffic children for sex. But Caviezel spoke at a QAnon convention in 2021 and, while promoting the film on Bannon\u2019s podcast, remarked that \u201cthere is a big storm coming\u201d \u2013 a QAnon trope. The film was released on 4 July and beat Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny at that day\u2019s box office, although the Harrison Ford vehicle had already been out for five days, earning more on each of the first three. Still, Sound of Freedom was the second most watched film in North America last weekend behind Tom Cruise\u2019s Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning and is nearing takings of $100m, far more than the $15m it cost to make. Sound of Freedom\u2019s portrayal of child trafficking has drawn criticism from experts. Angel Studios, which made it, acknowledged in a recent blog post: \u201cIt is worth noting that the movie took creative liberties in depicting the different methods of child trafficking.\u201d The film has also become a flashpoint in America\u2019s culture wars. A press release by the Trump campaign last week said: \u201cLiberal media outlets like the New York Times, Los Angeles Times, and the Hollywood Reporter have refused to review the film, while publications like Rolling Stone, Washington Post, CNN, and the Guardian have trashed the film and mocked the millions of movie-goers who bought tickets to screenings.\u201d Sound of Freedom is picking up steam among Republicans normally quick to dismiss Hollywood as a bastion of liberal elites. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas tweeted last week: \u201cWow. Wow. Wow. GO SEE #SoundOfFreedom.\u201d Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, a rival of Trump for the Republican presidential nomination, posted on Twitter on Monday: \u201cI watched Sound of Freedom and WOW. What a powerful film that reveals the horrifying reality that is human trafficking.\u201d Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka has also weighed in. She tweeted last month: \u201c\u2018Sound of Freedom\u2019 sheds light on the harrowing reality of #HumanTrafficking, awakening our collective conscience and inspiring us to take action for those trapped in its dark web.\u201d Ballard himself is a divisive figure. He founded the anti-trafficking group Operation Underground Railroad in 2013. Vice News reported in 2020 that Operation Underground Railroad\u2019s rescue claims contained \u201ca pattern of image-burnishing and mythology-building, a series of exaggerations that are, in the aggregate, quite misleading\u201d. Ballard was appointed by Trump to a federal advisory panel on human trafficking.

It\u2019s a treasured local wildlife site, the only dune habitat in the borough. Meandering paths, made by walkers, are testament to its popularity. One section is temporarily enclosed in a chestnut paling fence, to allow local rarities such as small-flowered cranesbill to recover from excessive footfall. It\u2019s home to signature plants of sand dune communities. There\u2019s sea rocket, whose pale mauve flowers produce inflated pods that act as seed lifeboats, carrying them on coastal currents until they make landfall on a strandline.

Muted pastel colours harmonising with sand, sea and sky. But there\u2019s a party vibe here too, thanks to a well-established international plant community that has spilled over from nearby gardens. Dunes, unstable habitats with mild winter climates, are prone to colonisation by invasive plants from warmer countries. Teacup-sized magenta flowers of Japanese roses flood the dunes with fragrance. Bizarrely, a patch of orange peel clematis, from central China, creeps across the sand, alongside a spectacular display of red valerian, a gaudy denizen of southern European shores that brings a Mediterranean flavour to this often chilly coast. While the botanical purist in me delights at finding the needle-pointed but otherwise unspectacular shoots of native prickly saltwort here, there are plenty who appreciate the riotous display of garden flowers on the beach. A lady walking her poodles beckons to show me a seething mass of bees, meadow brown butterflies and burnet moths visiting the red valerian; nectar- and pollen-feeding insects find them irresistible. As the climate emergency gathers pace, it\u2019s a nailed-down certainty that invasive plants from warmer climates will increase among our native flora, sometimes displacing it. Ultimately, the North Sea is likely to be the final arbiter on the fate of this locally unique dune system; sea level rise and a tidal surge could wash it away overnight. \u2022 Country diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary"}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b22370", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/20/c", "primaryCategory": "environment", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Heavy on the rhetoric, light on facts: campaign against net zero fields familiar tropes | Temperature Check", "lead": "Claiming \u2018woke hysteria\u2019 is driving policy, lobby group Advance Australia makes a series of claims by the usual suspects that are easily debunked", "author": "Graham Readfearn", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 04:13:04", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.231371", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/4adb3304329d6b5b85e8257d3a84b59cda00939a/0_631_3631_2179/500.jpg", "body": "Have you been \u201cinfected by this woke climate hysteria\u201d? Would you like some reheated climate tropes to go with your anti-renewables populist rhetoric? If your answer is yes, then the conservative activist group Advance Australia has a campaign for you. Advance Australia is the group behind one of the most prominent campaigns asking Australians to vote no to an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander voice to parliament in a referendum later this year. The group was accused of running a racist advert in a newspaper, forcing an apology from the publisher. But for months, the same group has been running a campaign attacking and undermining policies to cut Australia\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions to net zero. The campaign \u2013 dubbed \u201cNot Zero\u201d \u2013 is heavy on the rhetoric but light on facts, linking rising energy prices with policies to reach net zero without ever mentioning Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine that pushed up fossil fuel prices and electricity costs in Australia. Instead, the campaign claims all sides of politics are \u201cinfected with this woke climate hysteria\u201d and then offers a set of alternative \u201cfacts\u201d that the \u201cclimate elites don\u2019t want you to know\u201d. Lots of the \u201cfacts\u201d are repurposed tropes, such as the assertion that Australia\u2019s emissions are tiny when compared to China\u2019s (they are, but Australia, like everyone else, has signed international agreements to cut emissions regardless of their size). The impacts of the climate crisis are never mentioned. Alongside a dedicated website and social media posts, data from Facebook owner Meta\u2019s ad library shows Advance Australia spent about $10,000 running a dozen different \u201cNot Zero\u201d adverts on Facebook and Instagram in February and March that were seen about a million times. Clicking on links in the ads sent people to a petition page targeting Liberal leader Peter Dutton. \u2018Net zero nonsense\u2019 The Not Zero Facebook ads included images of various people in an assortment of grumpy poses \u2013 a mum carrying a child, a young woman filling up a car and several people gazing sorrowfully at a power bill \u2013 with the words: \u201cDon\u2019t let their net zero nonsense send you broke.\u201d Conservatives have been desperate to blame net zero policies on rising electricity prices, despite energy analysts saying the causes have been rising international gas and coal prices and the war in Ukraine. Prof Bruce Mountain, director of the Victoria Energy Policy Centre, said the transition to renewable energy would need \u201csignificant investment\u201d but \u201ceven more would be required to sustain fossil fuel production\u201d. Renewables push prices down in the short term because the electricity costs little to produce, Mountain said. The energy from the sun and wind are free for panels and turbines to collect, but coal and gas isn\u2019t free for power plants. \u201cThere seems to be little room to doubt that renewables firmed through storage is the cheapest alternative [to fossil fuel power] even if we ignored emission costs,\u201d Mountain said. Unpopular opinion The campaign relies heavily on material produced by the right-wing thinktank the Institute of Public Affairs \u2013 a group that has long promoted climate science denial. One example is a campaign claim that \u201cmost Australians do not support net zero\u201d \u2013 a claim based on an IPA-commissioned survey of 1,000 people described by polling expert Prof Murray Goot as \u201cadvocacy polling\u201d. Goot has told this column the questions in the IPA\u2019s poll were written in a way that would \u201cencourage responses favourable to the position adopted by the poll\u2019s sponsor\u201d and were presented in a way that would \u201cencourage acquiescence\u201d.\u201d \u201cPolls that encourage responses favourable to a particular position in a debate cannot be considered to fairly represent public opinion,\u201d Goot said. A far larger poll of 15,000 Australians conducted by YouGov for the Australian Conservation Foundation found 70% of Australians thought reaching net zero by 2050 was either doing enough on climate change, or was \u201ctoo little too late\u201d. A Lowy Institute poll says 89% of Australians think climate change is either a \u201ccritical\u201d or \u201cimportant\u201d threat over the next decade. Another Lowy poll says 56% of Australians believe global warming is a \u201cserious and pressing problem\u201d and the country should take significant steps now, even if it involved significant costs. Dr Simon Bradshaw, director of research at the Climate Council, said: \u201cOver the past decade in Australia, multiple, reputable, large national polls have explored the question of support for net zero and climate action. Consistently, this support has been in the majority.\u201d He described the campaign\u2019s fact-sheet as a \u201cridiculous pamphlet that should\u2019ve been printed in Comic Sans\u201d, saying it was a collection of \u201cwell-debunked myths, cobbled together with a laundry list of fundamental scientific and economic inaccuracies\u201d. Not net zero One of the stranger claims in the campaign is that Australia is \u201calready at net zero\u201d \u2013 an assertion from climate science denier and mining figure Prof Ian Plimer, who claims it has \u201cnever been shown that human emissions of carbon dioxide drive global warming\u201d. The claim first surfaced in a column from Plimer in the Spectator and repeated by Plimer on Sky News but later debunked by several experts in a fact check by news agency Australian Associated Press. Plimer\u2019s argument is that if all the natural sinks of CO2 \u2013 such as trees, grasslands and coastal systems \u2013 were included in calculations, then Australia sequesters five times as much CO2 as it emits. Except, international agreements on climate change \u2013 including net zero pledges \u2013 only include changes in the amount of CO2 emitted or sequestered that are caused by humans, such as chopping down trees or burning coal. This applies to all countries, not just Australia. Dr Jamie Cleverley of James Cook University is director of a research network that examines how carbon moves in and out of landscapes. She said Plimer\u2019s claim that Australia absorbed five times more than it emitted was \u201cmisleading\u201d and forgot to include how landscapes and forests also naturally emitted greenhouse gas. Once this was included, she said, Australia\u2019s ecosystems were roughly balanced between CO2 sequestered and emitted. Land-based ecosystems likely sequestered only about a third of the carbon emitted by human activities, she said. No difference? The Not Zero campaign also quotes Bj\u00f8rn Lomborg, a Danish political scientist who has said if every country in the OECD went to net zero today, this would only shave 0.5C off global heating by 2100. Lomborg compared the assumption that all OECD countries remained at net zero to a scenario (known as SSP2) that Carbon Brief has explained would deliver global heating of somewhere between 3.75C and more than 4C \u2013 a result that would probably deliver catastrophic impacts on societies around the globe. But analysis of long-term commitments from all countries by Climate Action Tracker suggests these pledges should keep global heating to about 2C \u2013 well below the levels assumed in Lomborg\u2019s analysis, but also likely disastrous. A 0.5C reduction in heating might appear less dramatic in a world that warmed by 4C, but scientists have said the difference between 1.5C of global heating and 2C is significant. For example, the UN climate panel has said the Arctic Ocean would likely be ice-free one summer per century at 1.5C of warming, but once a decade under 2C. Almost all coral reefs are predicted to be lost at 2C, compared to a 70-90% loss at 1.5C. China and India \u2013 both non-OECD countries \u2013 together make up about a third of all greenhouse gas emissions currently. So what impact will rich countries in the OECD have if they cut their emissions? Bill Hare, the chief executive of Climate Analytics, said if CO2 emissions were held constant from now until the end of the century, this would deliver an extra 1.1-1.8C of global heating \u201cwith the OECD responsible for about a third of this\u201d. \u201cBut countries have committed to reach net zero by about 2050,\u201d Hare said. \u201cThis would reduce the warming from constant emissions by 0.9-1.4C. The OECD would have contributed to 0.3-0.5C of this reduction and non-OECD 0.6-1.1C. \u201cThe OECD reaching net zero CO2 by 2050 would do about a third of the warming reduction from constant CO2 emissions, whereas its share of global GDP is just under 50%.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b22371", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/20/indigenous-voice-to-parliament-mob-first-nations-silence", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Why mob are staying silent on the Indigenous voice to parliament | Chelsea Watego", "lead": "There is a very real demonisation of Blackfullas who dare answer the question of yes with a no, as though it is we who are betraying our people", "author": "Chelsea Watego", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 04:08:48", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.231389", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/9ce25198ed03fecb7b0bb64cce24ce07e1e03f4a/0_0_3543_2127/500.jpg", "body": "When I released my debut book Another Day in the Colony it took me a while to adjust to the white applause for the supposed sophisticated articulation of our oppression while on various festival stages over the past year or so. The writers\u2019 festival circuit isn\u2019t my usual stage. I\u2019m not in the business of selling books to make a living. I wrote a book to make sense of the violence of this world and the work of trying to make a living, of raising a family in this place. This place, that is ours. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019ve always been a writer, as opposed to those orators that move us as a people, those who\u2019ve shaped our movement, in such profound moments in our history. Instead, writing is my weapon of choice. But when I wrote that book, I remember a certain Black man and seasoned performer at such festivals leaned over to me moments before a national television appearance to condescendingly ask \u201cSo Chelsea this is your first book?\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question. It was a statement. To put me in my supposed place. I didn\u2019t realise, despite having been an academic for decades, that I wasn\u2019t considered a writer until I had published a book for white consumption. The saving grace is the occasional writers\u2019 festivals where I get to be considered an actual writer, as a thinker. Not just about race, but to be seen as capable of thinking about the world, much like white authors of fiction and poetry are able to. I enjoy the freedom of being able to speak on running, humour, the craft of writing and you know, just being human. But alas, it didn\u2019t matter what the topic, or the curator, or wherever I appeared, or the joy that I found. There was always that one white person who would ask, \u201cSo what\u2019s your thoughts on the voice?\u201d At first, I hated that question, because I\u2019m not a constitutional lawyer and I felt I was not qualified to answer. I had been told by a Black lawyer, who has since blocked me on Twitter, that I didn\u2019t know enough about constitutional law to have an informed opinion. And then after some appearances I still hated that question, because I remember a senior Black academic at a writers\u2019 festival berating me and any other Blackfullas who dared express scepticism, for not having viewed the Boyer Lectures. \u201cYou haven\u2019t done the readings,\u201d the Black experts insisted. As though the Blackfullas pushing trolleys, the admin officer, the truck driver or the single Black parent trying to survive the violence of the state at every turn were to blame for holding our people back, for not having done their homework. Those who have expressed doubt about the cultural authority of the yes campaign and the emancipatory claims being made have all been accused of being on the same ledger of the \u201creal racists\u201d, ironically by those aligned with mining companies. There is a very real demonisation of Blackfullas who dare answer the question of yes with a no, as though it is we who are betraying our people \u2013 as if we are the ones blowing up sacred sites. At this moment, it is Blackfullas being routinely punished, in their personal and professional lives, for daring to speak freely about a referendum that will supposedly change our lives forever. It is literally the livelihoods of Blackfullas being threatened in private spheres, in the course of responding to those demands to express our views publicly. This is the danger right now. A danger we do not deserve. A danger we did not ask for. A danger we did not bring upon ourselves. I remember Murri academic Dr Lilla Watson insisting that we are not the protagonists as Indigenous peoples in a settler colonial state. Yet here we are: Blackfullas are being forced into refusing to declare a position, to sit on the fence, to stay silent on the voice, or concede to voting yes to avoid the backlash. Because it just isn\u2019t safe, not just \u201cculturally\u201d but literally. American social reformer Frederick Douglass\u2019 seminal speech, \u201cIf there is no struggle, there is no progress\u201d speaks to the dangers of a philosophy of reform, divorced from struggle. He states: \u201cThose who profess to favour freedom and yet deprecate agitation are men who want crops without plowing the ground; they want rain without thunder and lightning. They want the ocean without the awful roar of its many waters.\u201d The yes campaign, in its strategy, reveals the very real dangers associated with enshrining a voice to parliament. To enshrine a voice that in this moment is silencing and domesticating the diverse voices of sovereign Black nations across this continent offers more concern than it does hope for the future. I am not accepting the lie that it\u2019s now or never, or that a seat at their table is the best that\u2019s on offer. I\u2019m not entertaining that what the political left offers is better than the overt racism of the right. What the Black reformers have forgotten is that Indigenous sovereignty, of the unceded kind, can never be reduced to a matter of settler-colonial affiliations of left or right. It\u2019s the settlers, to the left and to the right who remain on the same ledger when it comes to undermining Indigenous sovereignty. If those yes vote evangelists are as committed as they say they are to us having a voice, then Blackfullas should be able to express what we think, we feel and know \u2013 with or without the readings, law degrees, children\u2019s books or whatever. Blackfullas should be able to speak of the limitations of the proposed voice without being cast as intellectually incapable, mentally ill, politically disloyal, professionally inept, deceptive, treacherous and a threat to be contained, complained about, blamed or blocked. But this is the gaslighting and the sorry satire of settler colonialism. Those who claim to support us having a voice are the ones most threatened by the varying voices of Blackfullas in this moment. Even in their knowing that our voice, in terms of our vote, doesn\u2019t count for shit. Settlers meanwhile roam free with their outlandish claims to benevolence or destruction on either side of the campaign. It is not they who are perpetually required to declare and defend their voting intentions at writers\u2019 festivals or wherever else, nor are they being summoned to the principal\u2019s office as a result of such utterances. While the nation muses over whether to vote yes or no to an Indigenous voice to parliament with no actual power, we are witnessing how power actually operates on the lives and livelihoods of Blackfullas in this place right now.

The inmate set to die by lethal injection by 6am on Friday is James Barber. Now 54, he was convicted of the murder of Dorothy Epps, who was 75, in 2001. Maya Foa, joint executive director of Reprieve, a human rights non-profit, told the Guardian: \u201cThis could be one in what has been a string of disastrously botched lethal injection executions in Alabama. \u201cWhat we have seen time and time again in Alabama but also across the US is prisoners repeatedly put through torturous procedures as the state seeks to end their lives. And even for supporters of capital punishment, the idea that people will be tortured should be anathema.\u201d The severity of Barber\u2019s crime is not in question. But Epps\u2019s granddaughter, Sarah Gregory, has spoken of how she came to forgive Barber for a murder he used a hammer to commit, while high on crack, alcohol and painkillers. In autumn 2020, in a letter reported by the Atlantic, Gregory wrote: \u201cI am tired Jimmy. I am tired. I am tired of carrying this pain, hate and rage in my heart. I can\u2019t do it any more. I have to do this and truly forgive you.\u201d Barber wrote back: \u201cReceiving your letter caused me to break down and sob for several long minutes. You sweet wonderful person! I can\u2019t tell you how much that means to me that you have that kind of spirit in you.\u201d The two went on to forge a friendship. Regardless, Alabama aims to put Barber to death. Its recent record is not good. On 28 July last year, it took officials more than three hours to kill Joe Nathan James Jr. On 22 September and 17 November, the executions of Alan Miller and Kenneth Smith had to be abandoned. Foa said: \u201cLethal injection is designed to look like a clean, medical process. But lethal injection executions go wrong all the time. In Alabama, these have been demonstrably, miserably botched executions. Joe Nathan James Jr\u2019s execution took three-and-a-half hours, prison officials repeatedly trying and failing to get access to a vein.\u201d Anti-death penalty campaigners, prominently including Foa and Reprieve, have targeted the supply of lethal injection drugs, forcing states to seek new sources. Foa said: \u201cIt\u2019s really important to note that \u2026 the medicines were never designed to be used for lethal injections. When you use them in this way \u2026 without medical experts involved, buying drugs off the black market, under-regulated processes, guessing all of the provisions that make medicine safe \u2026 then to an extent it is bound to go wrong. \u201cSo Alabama is a case, in the last three executions, that\u2019s pretty staggering. But they did a review of this and then opted to do the same thing again, only to strap the prisoner down for a longer time.\u201d Lawyers for Barber, who this week filed a last-ditch federal appeal, have cited the botched Alabama executions in arguing his killing would violate the eighth amendment to the US constitution, which forbids cruel and unusual punishment. They have also described how John Hamm, commissioner of the Alabama department of corrections, began his internal review in November last year. The review, Barber\u2019s lawyers said in court filings, \u201cwas too brief, perfunctory, and should have been performed by an independent investigatory body\u201d. Nor were any details made public before, on 24 February 2023, Hamm told the Republican Alabama governor, Kay Ivey, the review was complete and \u201cthe department [was] as prepared as possible to carry out death sentences\u201d. Barber\u2019s execution was then scheduled. Denying Barber\u2019s attorneys earlier this month, Emily Marks, a US district judge, said the state had made three \u201cmeaningful changes\u201d to its lethal injections process. Two involved personnel: removing officials involved in botched executions and installing replacements. The other change extended by six hours \u201cthe window in which the state has to carry out Barber\u2019s execution\u201d, to eliminate \u201cunnecessary deadline pressure\u201d. Foa said Alabama was trying \u201cto create a facade and essentially blind the public and the witnesses to what\u2019s really happening in that [execution] chamber. And unfortunately, that masking seems to have passed muster with the courts, who have not yet acknowledged that they think this is cruel and unusual punishment\u201d. Barber has also sought to be executed not by lethal injection but by nitrogen hypoxia, which involves \u201cforcing the inmate to breathe only nitrogen, thereby depriving him or her of the oxygen needed to maintain bodily functions\u201d, and which Alabama has said it wants to use. Marks rejected Barber\u2019s request because he did not choose the method initially and because, pointing to the reason for the request, Alabama is not \u201ccurrently prepared to perform executions\u201d that way. \u201cNo state has yet used that method,\u201d Foa said. \u201cAnd I think states are clinging on to lethal injection in part because they think they can continue to get away with it, because it looks like it\u2019s medical.\u201d Gregory, the granddaughter of Dorothy Epps, told the Atlantic she did not want Barber to be put to death. \u201cI don\u2019t want it to happen,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see it done \u2026 it will be hard. I spent so long believing in \u2018an eye for an eye\u2019 \u2013 I\u2019ve changed.\u201d She also said some relatives did not feel the same way. As lawyers pursued his final appeal, Barber spoke to NBC News. He had \u201cno fear of death\u201d, he said, but \u201ca fair amount of trepidation about the process that they obviously haven\u2019t perfected\u201d.

The strike on Thursday is the first of three in 10 days by RMT members, with two further stoppages on 22 and 29 July, and is taking place during a week-long overtime ban by train drivers in the Aslef union. About 20,000 RMT members at 14 train operators contracted by the Department for Transport in England will be involved in the strike. The stoppage is expected to add to a disrupted peak summer holiday getaway weekend. The strikes in the long-running pay dispute will cut services across the railway, including cross-border trains serving Wales and Scotland. Most train operators will be running reduced timetables that begin later and finish earlier, although there are wide variations in service levels. Engineering work will also compound disruption on the main intercity route, the west coast mainline linking London and Glasgow. Long-distance operators including Avanti West Coast, LNER and GWR will reduce services to roughly hourly trains on the main routes. Others, including Northern, TransPennine Express, Southeastern and Govia Thameslink Railway, will stop services altogether on some lines and to many stations. The Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators, has urged passengers to check schedules through the day for updates, with disruption likely to continue into Friday morning. A spokesperson said the latest strikes would affect \u201cnot only the daily commute of our passengers\u201d but also disrupt the plans of families during the summer holidays, leading to \u201cdisappointment, frustration, and financial strain for tens of thousands of people\u201d. Unions have said they are being pushed into further strikes, with neither industry leaders nor ministers offering to talk since tabling below-inflation pay offers this year. Mick Lynch, the general secretary of the RMT, said he remained \u201cavailable 24/7\u201d for talks, adding: \u201cOur national dispute is about pay job security and working conditions. The recent attack on ticket offices and the threat to de-staff our railways has galvanised a huge groundswell of public support, which we are grateful for. \u201cOur members and our union will not be cowed by rail bosses or government ministers and our dispute will continue until we can reach a negotiated settlement.\u201d Mick Whelan, the general secretary of Aslef, said on Monday: \u201cThe blame lies with the train companies, and the government that stands behind them, which have not made a fair and sensible pay offer to train drivers who have not had [a rise] for four years while prices have soared.\u201d A DfT spokesperson said the government had facilitated pay offers and that unions should allow members a direct vote."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b22374", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jul/20/four-london-underground-phone-kiosks-grade-ii-listed-status", "primaryCategory": "culture", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Four London Underground phone kiosks given Grade II-listed status", "lead": "K8s installed on tube stations between 1968 and 1983 are listed for architectural and historic interest", "author": "Harriet Sherwood Arts and culture correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 04:00:19", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.231446", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/9b94d0a2fc1b952847e93fe9800187e61f460de0/0_134_3000_1800/500.jpg", "body": "Four rare phone boxes on London Underground stations have been given Grade II-listed status by the government for their architectural and historic interest. The phone boxes are among 11,000 K8 kiosks that were installed across the UK between 1968 and 1983. Only about 50 remain, mostly in Hull where they were part of an independent phone network rather than the property of British Telecom. The K8s on tube stations were owned by London Underground and housed an internal phone system for station staff. As such, they were painted different colours to the traditional red phone boxes. The newly listed boxes are at High Street Kensington and Chorleywood, both blue; Chalfont and Latimer, maroon; and Northwick Park, which is white. Tom Foxall of Historic England, the body that recommends listing to the government, said: \u201cThere are very few designs that can be genuinely termed as \u2018iconic\u2019 but the K8 is certainly one of them. Like its predecessors, this kiosk was a defining feature of 20th-century Britain\u2019s physical, technological and cultural landscape. Very few K8s survive, so they certainly need to be cherished and protected.\u201d The K8 was commissioned by the General Post Office, which owned the public phone network in the mid-60s, and designed by the architect Bruce Martin. Unlike the classic dome-topped K2 and K6 boxes, designed in the 1920s by Giles Gilbert Scott, which have architrave moulding and glass panelling, the K8 is minimalist with a flat roof and single large windows. Most of the 11,000 K8s were removed by British Telecom after it was privatised in 1984. They were succeeded by the aluminium-framed KX100, most of which have since been ripped out with the inexorable rise of mobile phones. The four tube station K8s join nine K8s in Hull that were listed earlier this year, giving a total of 23 on the national heritage list for England. Historic England has appealed to phone box enthusiasts to help the search for unrecorded K8s. Lord Parkinson of Whitley Bay, the arts and heritage minister, said: \u201cThis distinctive telephone box design, once a ubiquitous part of daily life in the UK, is now rare to see in our public spaces. I am delighted these remaining examples have been listed so that their design can continue to be admired and enjoyed for years to come.\u201d By 2021, about 21,000 working public phone boxes remained in Britain, from a peak in the mid-90s of about 100,000. More than 6,000 have been converted to other uses, such as community libraries or to house public defibrillators. 96% of UK adults own a mobile phone."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b22375", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jul/20/12795-possessions-barbara-iweins-photographer-every-object", "primaryCategory": "artanddesign", "subCategories": "test", "title": "12,795 possessions!

The project took four years and 12,795 photos later, her task was complete. Now her work is on show at the Cortona on the Move photography festival in Tuscany. The decision came after a divorce and having to move house for the 11th time. \u201cI was exhausted to have all these objects to pack once again. I really wanted to see what it was like \u2013 a houseful of objects. I decided to photograph room by room and drawer by drawer. I was putting Post-its on the drawers because I was scared of photographing the same thing again.\u201d Objects from Iweins\u2019 bathroom The result is an extraordinary inventory of the commonplace, the personal, the irreplaceable and the intimate. No object was too mundane for inclusion \u2013 safety pins, clingfilm, screws, hooks, toilet rolls, hangers, keys, socks, pants and plates all made the cut. Goldorak: \u2018For a long time my mother wondered why I had bruises on my legs. It was simply because I was sleeping with this hard plastic toy\u2019 The brand names are similarly quotidian \u2013 Vanish, Pledge, Cif, Bic, Sudocrem, Dove, Playmobil and Lego. Among so much domestic flotsam are precious items with personal significance, such as a Goldorak toy she was obsessed with as a child, and objects usually kept out of sight in her bedside table \u2013 lubricant, condoms and antidepressants. The cumulative effect of viewing Iweins\u2019 anodyne product shots can be overwhelming, and suggestive of an unchecked consumerism. She concedes that she and her three children are \u201cextremely messy\u201d, and that she has been a collector with an interest in vintage clothing in particular, but she describes her buying habits as otherwise normal. She is probably not the only parent of three children who aspires to a more minimalist lifestyle. Besides her desire to get a measure of just how much stuff she possessed, Iweins was pursuing an interest in consumption and instant gratification. She saw her project as a counter to social media users \u201cposting pictures of their ideal life \u2013 what they\u2019re buying, what they\u2019re eating\u201d. \u201cI wanted to play with it and I thought: \u2018I\u2019m not going to show this ideal recto of an ideal life, I\u2019m going to show the verso, the holes in underwear and stuff like that.\u2019\u201d \u2018I hate cooking, and the kitchen was super-difficult to photograph \u2013 it was really like the most boring thing\u2019 Her commitment to the fullest disclosure introduced difficulties. She had to resist the urge to discard, unphotographed, a vibrator. And it was only with reluctance that she included what she feels is her most unlovable object: \u201ca mould of my teeth. I don\u2019t especially like my teeth, it\u2019s extremely personal, and it\u2019s a horrible mould. But I had to be honest.\u201d Clothes, too, presented problems, especially those she had bought and then forgotten. \u201cWe are hiding stuff that we are buying,\u201d she laments. \u201cEverything is in closets \u2013 that\u2019s the thing.\u201d Perhaps transparent wardrobes might be a solution. \u201cI was rediscovering skirts and thinking: \u2018I haven\u2019t worn this \u2013 it\u2019s really quite nice. Now I\u2019m going to use it and use it.\u2019\u201d \u2018We are hiding stuff that we are buying\u2019 \u2026 Barbara Iweins with some of her object images at Cortona on the Move. Photograph: Guy Lane As her photographic evidence accumulated, Iweins organised and classified her pictures, including by colour, material and frequency of use. She can field her own array of idiosyncratic \u2013 and not always impressive \u2013 statistics: 21% of bathroom objects are metallic, 43% are plastic; 1% of her clothes are purple, a colour she hates. \u201cI noted that 37% of our Playmobil figures are bald. I never used or moved 56% of the objects. I think I\u2019m the only person who knows \u2013 well it\u2019s not very important \u2013 that the dominant colour in my house is blue.\u201d Iweins and her brother once spent months fighting over this \u2018super-ugly\u2019 cup Most significantly, she says, she came to realise that \u201conly 1% of these objects are important: 99% I could get rid of. Most of the objects I really care for are the things I cannot replace.\u201d Perhaps unsurprisingly, once finished, Iweins was able to throw away full bin bags. Similarly, her shopping habits cooled. \u201cThe thing that changed most are the clothes. I think recently is the first time I\u2019ve bought clothes in four years.\u201d Her most treasured belonging is a dahlia, at once delicate and invulnerable, preserved in a jar of formalin. She had seen it in a shop in Amsterdam and her cousin later bought it for her. She is drawn to its permanence. \u201cI\u2019ve had a divorce and I\u2019ve lost a boyfriend to cancer. These objects \u2013 the 1% that are important to me and my children \u2013 I know they are going to be there. I realised \u2013 it\u2019s pathetic, I know \u2013 that you can rely on things.\u201d Accumulating objects, she says, \u201cwas my therapy. There\u2019s so much chaos in the world, and in my head, that the inertia of things \u2013 they are my reference. I know what I am saying is sad, but it\u2019s true.\u201d Dahlia preserved in formalin As an unanticipated benefit of her work, now published as a book called Katalog, Iweins is enjoying a new security. \u201cIt structured my thoughts, organising all the chaos. Before, I was scared that something terrible would happen in my life. Now that there is the book, everything can catch fire and at least I will have this reminder that it existed, that it was there. This project was a consolation in a way.\u201d At the beginning of the process, she says, \u201cI thought it was about overconsumption. And actually, I realised it was more a project about myself.\u201d \u2022 Cortona on the Move international photography festival, Tuscany, runs until 1 October.

The seemingly bizarre nature of some of the fines issued under Public Spaces Protection Order legislation has seen them increase to 13,433 in 2022, up from 10,412 in 2019. More than 150 councils issued at least one penalty in 2022, according to a report. Offences for which people were fined included shouting, which had been banned by four councils, and making noise, which was also banned by four councils. There were 22 restrictions on loitering, seven on busking, 11 bans on swearing or foul language, six on feeding the birds and seven restrictions on rough sleeping or sleeping in a vehicle. The PSPOs, which were introduced in 2014, were intended to clamp down on threatening or violent behaviour. But campaigners say they have been drafted too loosely, meaning they are being used in some areas to restrict activities such as climbing trees, picking up stones and charity collection. One council even banned napping in public. The findings have been revealed by the Manifesto Club, which campaigns for freedom in public spaces and civic life. Josie Appleton, the group\u2019s director and author of the report, said there were \u201cthousands of petty restrictions on almost any conceivable activity in public spaces\u201d. She added that powers \u201cneed to be scrapped or severely reformed, before more innocent people are punished and our public spaces become the private spaces of officialdom\u201d. She also raised concern about how these could affect homeless communities. \u201cThe use of these powers to target those who are homeless amounts to a criminalisation of poverty. Slapping homeless people with fines for begging is as perverse as it is heartless. It is even more worrying that rough sleepers could soon be fined the vast sum of \u00a3500 for begging, sleeping in a public place or looking in bins. The government should be looking to scrap these powers, not extend them and make the problems even worse.\u201d The Local Government association, however, argued that antisocial behaviour, \u201csuch as public drinking, racing in cars, aggressive begging and intimidating behaviour, can ruin people\u2019s quality of life, harm businesses or mean people are scared to visit public places\u201d. They said PSPOs were subject to \u201cscrutiny\u201d and \u201cwill not be suitable or effective in all circumstances, and councils will consider other approaches which may better resolve issues\u201d. The government recently announced plans to increase fines for the violation of a PSPO from \u00a3100 to \u00a3500, and also to allow police forces to introduce the orders. Out of 303 local authorities that responded to a freedom of information request, 266 said that they currently had at least one PSPO in place. Only 10% of councils had never had a PSPO. Rugby council criminalised the climbing of trees, and made it a crime to pick up stones in certain areas. Wiltshire banned the possession of stones or ball bearings \u201ccapable of being launched as a projectile, by a catapult, slingshot or similar item\u201d. A spokesman for Rugby borough council said the council did so \u201cto protect and enhance habitats\u201d at Newbold Quarry Nature Reserve. It is now an offence to have a nap in a park in Rother and Welwyn Hatfield, after both councils made it a crime to sleep in a public place. The report found that councils are creating broad-brush laws that ban people from doing anything that potentially annoys any other person. For example, Southend-on-Sea banned people from \u201cusing bikes in a way that has a negative effect for others\u201d. Southend-on-Sea councillor James Courtenay, said: \u201cThis followed many complaints about reckless cycling and the illegal riding of e-scooters which made it clear this had become a significant frustration and a genuine worry for many people. We\u2019re aware of at least two incidents where young children have been knocked over by people on e-scooters, for example, and the introduction of this has been largely welcomed locally.\u201d The report said: \u201cThe existence of this catch-all power is largely an excuse for lazy and excessive law-making, and has led to some of the worst laws ever to have entered the statute book.\u201d Tim Clement-Jones, a Liberal Democrat peer who has challenged PSPOs, said: \u201cI have raised the issue of PSPOs several times in the House of Lords, but it seems that the problems with this power continue to pile up. The redrafting of the statutory guidance hasn\u2019t worked. The government needs to go back to the drawing board and bring through a properly regulated bylaw power that is not open to such abuse.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 20 July 2023 to add text clarifying that a PSPO in Wiltshire that bans the possession of stones or ball bearings relates specifically to those items \u201ccapable of being launched as a projectile, by a catapult, slingshot or similar\u201d."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b22377", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jul/20/barak-beacon-housing-estate-port-melbourne-eviction-notice-fight-margaret-kelly", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Last resident of Port Melbourne housing estate vows to fight for her home after eviction notice", "lead": "Barak Beacon resident Margaret Kelly says getting formally evicted this week as part of controversial redevelopment was like a \u2018physical blow\u2019", "author": "Cait Kelly", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 03:56:09", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.231502", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/8347690dd45818e7a130a9124293d1f003750c74/0_232_3500_2101/500.jpg", "body": "The last remaining resident of the Barak Beacon estate in Port Melbourne has been given an eviction notice, with the Victorian government preparing to bulldoze the public housing as part of a controversial redevelopment. The Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT) granted Homes Victoria a possession order this week, allowing the department tasked with relocating tenants to forcibly evict Margaret Kelly on 7 August. Kelly, 68, has spent more than a year trying to fight the government\u2019s plan to replace the 89 dwellings with a mix of social, affordable and private housing, which is expected to be completed in 2025. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The redevelopment is part of the government\u2019s big housing build, with the government poised to lease the land to a company that will build, operate and maintain the housing for 40 years. The state government argues the housing in Port Melbourne does not meet current design standards and 300 new dwellings will be built in its place. The government has promised at least a 10% increase in social homes, but the exact number is not known, nor is how many will be split between public and affordable homes. Old tenants will get the first right of return when the redevelopment is completed. But the Greens say the government\u2019s \u201cpublic-private housing program has completely failed\u201d, arguing it is driving an increase in the public housing waitlist and worsening the levels of homelessness. When Kelly moved in to Barak Beacon she was a 43-year-old single mum who had spent years in and out of different homes. The housing estate gave her stability. She raised her son, who now has an international career as a game developer, grew flowers in the garden and watched as her neighbour\u2019s children grew up. She said she was \u201cshattered\u201d to be having to fight to stay in her home. \u201cThis was our safe home,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what it\u2019s been for so many tenants.\u201d Kelly, who received the possession order this week, said the police would have \u201cto carry her out\u201d in August. \u201cIt felt like a physical blow when I got it,\u201d she said. \u201cThe government has made a general statement, that a proportion will be social housing \u2026 but that\u2019s a very different thing from public housing, because it\u2019s run by a private association. \u201cThere are 89 family homes on the property. So that means they will add another 8.9 residences. But they will be small one-bedroom residences, not the family homes that we have here now.\u201d A government spokesperson insisted the land was not being sold off. \u201cWe\u2019re getting on and delivering more than 300 new homes at the site, which includes at least 10% more social housing as well as a mixture of affordable and market rental housing, including some disability accommodation,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cNo land is being sold as part of the Barak Beacon redevelopment, and the government will retain ownership of all new properties.\u201d The leader of the Victorian Greens, Samantha Ratnam, savaged the prospect of \u201cknocking down public homes and booting out residents for the sake of privatisation\u201d during a housing crisis. \u201cThe government\u2019s public-private housing program has completely failed and is the reason we are seeing the public housing waitlist grow, while homelessness worsens,\u201d Ratnam said. \u201cIf other estates are anything to go by, Barak Beacon will be flattened and no homes will be rebuilt for years like we saw at the Walker Estate in Northcote, where the site has laid vacant for five years."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b22378", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/datablog/2023/jul/20/the-climate-crisis-in-four-charts-extreme-weather-heatwaves", "primaryCategory": "environment", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Extreme weather: the climate crisis in four charts", "lead": "As much of the northern hemisphere endures blistering heatwaves and parts of Asia are deluged with rain, a number of climate records are being challenged", "author": "Josh Nicholas", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 03:06:45", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.231520", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/62ebab6b3503d0b871e4a6ccb5f2404ce3403921/0_0_853_512/500.jpg", "body": "The climate crisis is moving into uncharted territory as much of the northern hemisphere endures a blistering heatwave, many countries are deluged with rain, sea surface temperatures reach new heights, and Antarctic sea ice new lows. A number of climate records \u2013 some unofficial \u2013 have tumbled in recent weeks. Many factors have combined for this to happen, including climate change but also the El Ni\u00f1o weather event, and the northern hemisphere summer. \u201cThe northern hemisphere has a lot more land, it means this time of year just tends to be hotter globally than in southern hemisphere\u2019s summer,\u201d says Dr Kim Reid from Monash University. \u201cAnd so this combination of this background warming from global warming, El Ni\u00f1o and the fact that it\u2019s the hottest time of the year for the globe means that we\u2019re just seeing all these records tumbling, all at once.\u201d While the UN\u2019s World Meteorological Organization and the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have both declared a Ni\u00f1o is in place, Australia\u2019s Bureau of Meteorology has so far held back from declaring one, saying the atmosphere is not yet giving the typical signals. The record for global average temperature has been broken a couple of times in the past few weeks, according to a model of average air temperatures at two metres, created by the NOAA. Although, as this data is derived from a model and not direct observation, it is not an \u201cofficial\u201d climate record. The model is based on observational data from weather stations, balloons, satellites and other sources and allows climate scientists to get an idea of the temperature over a wider area and create an average for the entire globe. The chart above shows the global average derived from the model, but maps also show the positive temperature anomalies \u2013 the difference between current temperatures and the long-run average \u2013 spread across much of the Earth\u2019s surface in June. Even as the air temperatures have been elevated, the NOAA models show sea surface temperatures are also higher than in recent decades. Monthly data shows that the temperature anomaly has been positive and on an upward trend for decades. The ocean stores a lot of the excess heat from global heating \u2013 up to 90% in recent decades. \u201cBecause we\u2019ve had La Ni\u00f1a the last few years, a lot of the heat has gone into the ocean,\u201d Reid says. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of been hidden from us at the surface for a bit. And now as we\u2019ve flipped from La Ni\u00f1a into El Ni\u00f1o, a lot of this ocean heat is now rising up to the surface.\u201d While the air and sea surface are seeing greater than average heat, new records are being set for sea ice in Antarctica \u2013 for how little there is. The lack of sea ice extent is continuing a trend \u2013 a new record has been set several times over the past few years. Satellite data from the National Snow and Ice Data Center shows that not only is 2023 a significant outlier, 2022 ended with some of the lowest sea ice extents on record. But the gap to the long-run average for this time of year appears to be getting larger. \u201d But Reid warns that the Earth \u2013 the climate \u2013 is a complex system, with many moving parts. What is happening to sea ice in Antarctica, for instance, also has to do with winds, storms and pressure systems. \u201cWe\u2019ve got, of course, the background climate change, we\u2019ve got the seasonality, the fact that it\u2019s summer, the fact that it\u2019s now El Ni\u00f1o, and then there\u2019s also what we call effects from aerosols. So these are tiny particles like sulphur dust, sea salt, that can reflect incoming solar radiation.

The shooter later died, in circumstances that are unclear. The shooting was not politically or ideologically motivated, New Zealand prime minister Chris Hipkins said. At least one police officer was among those injured during an exchange of fire. The offender was the subject of a home detention sentence, but had an exemption to work at the building site where the shooting occurred, New Zealand police commissioner Andrew Coster said. \u201cThe individual is known for primarily family violence history,\u201d he said. He said there were \u201cindications of mental health history\u201d but that there was no evidence he was of high lethal risk and that his previous offences did not suggest he posed this kind of threat. Police did not identify the gunman, saying only that he was 24 and died after isolating himself in an elevator shaft at the top of the building site. The shooting occurred as the Fifa Women\u2019s World Cup was due to begin in Auckland on Thursday night, with a match between New Zealand and Norway. Players staying in hotels nearby described their experiences as the shooting unfolded. Authorities said the tournament would proceed as planned and that there was no threat. \u201cAucklanders and those watching around the world can be assured that the police have neutralised the threat and that they are not seeking anybody else,\u201d Hipkins said. The gunman was armed with a pump-action shotgun. \u201cHe moved through the building site and discharged his firearm. Upon reaching the upper levels of the building the man contained himself in an elevator and Police engaged with him, shots were fired and he was located a short time later,\u201d the prime minister said. Police said it was safe for members of the public to return to the city centre. \u201cPolice are reassuring the public that they can continue to come into the CBD,\u201d New Zealand police said, with the security cordon lifted several hours after the shooting. The organisers of the Fifa Fan Festival are waiting for further advice from the police before deciding when to open. The Fan Festival was meant to have opened at midday local time.

And at the moment, everything is going to plan. Even the weather is cooperating. On Monday, the Matildas had just started training session at their base in Brisbane when a storm front approached. As the players ran through their drills on the pristine grass of the Queensland Sports and Athletics Centre, the weather remained at bay \u2013 just a few sprinkles troubling the team. Only once the Matildas were done, and defender Alanna Kennedy had stepped inside to speak with the media, did the heavens open. Untroubled by the deluge, Kennedy said the team had always kept faith in Gustavsson\u2019s plan, even during a turbulent 2021 when the Matildas won just three of 16 matches, or mid-last year when they team were trounced 7-0 by Spain. \u201cWe\u2019ve always trusted \u2013 you have to believe and trust in the process,\u201d said the centre-back. \u201cWe know what Tony brings as a coach, we know the plan and the vision,. Sometimes it takes time, and it takes a bit of a teething process, blooding the young players. It\u2019s all coming together now.\u201d Starting on Thursday with the opening match against Ireland, Australia will find out if Gustavsson\u2019s plan survives contact with reality. And what a reality it is: the pressurised cauldron of Australia\u2019s first home World Cup, with the hopes of a nation on the Matildas\u2019 shoulders. If all goes to plan, Gustavsson will be credited with masterminding a sporting triumph \u2013 winning the Women\u2019s World Cup would be on-par with anything that has come before in the pantheon of great Australian sporting moments. But if the Matildas fall short \u2013 and anything less than reaching the quarter-final would be a disappointment \u2013 many will wonder if Gustavsson was ever the right man for the job. Such is the cruel nature of sport, when moments of individual brilliance or a second of misfortune can determine legacies. It might be unfair \u2013 arguably the fruits of Gustavsson\u2019s reign will only become fully apparent later in the decade. But those who live by the sword die by the sword. Gustavsson knows that his reputation rests on how his plan unfolds over the next four weeks. At a final pre-tournament press conference on Wednesday, Gustavsson echoed something that star striker Sam Kerr had said moments earlier. \u201cIn football, you\u2019re only as good as your last result.\u201d The coach smiled, acknowledging the difficulty of juggling short- and long-term ambitions in such a fickle sport. \u201cAfter tomorrow, I\u2019m either going to be a phenomenal coach or the worst coach that has ever coached the Matildas.\u201d When Gustavsson began his tenure at Football Australia in late 2020, at the height of the pandemic, he was presented with a report on the \u201cperformance gap\u201d in Australian women\u2019s football. Crammed with graphs, tables and data, the report contained three difficult truths. Despite a strong core, the Matildas lacked depth \u2013 the worst of the 12 leading nations analysed in the report. As a consequence, the national team was too reliant on key players, increasing injury risk and minimising opportunities to improve depth. And Australia were not playing enough international football, particularly against top-ranked teams. Gustavsson set to work. He brought young talent into the squad, even if it meant losing matches. He rested key players to manage their workload, contributing to the overwhelming defeat to Spain. And he picked a schedule that saw the Matildas consistently play top rivals. Over the past two-and-a-half years, Australia have faced every other team in the top 10. Since Gustavsson took over the Matildas, his team have played 36 matches. They have lost 14 and drawn five. But over the past nine months, the Australians have lost just once. Slowly but surely, the plan is coming together. The final piece of the jigsaw puzzle seemed to fit into place last Friday, when the Matildas beat France in their only World Cup warm-up match. \u201cIt\u2019s thanks to the patience and the belief in the process from everyone,\u201d Gustavsson said afterwards. A mathematics teacher by training, Gustavsson has brought tactical vigour to the team. During matches he prowls the sidelines wearing a headset, so an analyst stationed in the stands \u2013 with a birds-eye view \u2013 can communicate perspective not gleaned at pitch level. Gustavsson is friendly and affable. Unusually, he even eschews defensiveness when addressing criticism of poor performances. But the coach also has a steely edge, a desire to control and plan for every eventuality. Befitting his background, he loves to reel off statistics. After Friday\u2019s match, it was Tony the Maths Teacher at the press conference (he has previously used a whiteboard to explain concepts to the media). \u201cI have some stats here,\u201d he began. Gustavsson proceeded to list some positive statistics: the Matildas five consecutive wins against top European opponents, and six clean sheets in the past eight matches. In other words, the plan is working. But for all the added depth, the experience playing and beating top-ranked international opponents, for all the tactical sessions, Gustavsson knows that there\u2019s a certain je ne sais quoi to winning big tournaments. There is an intangible element, a combination of good fortune and unstoppable momentum, the presence of which is often only discernible in hindsight. After concluding his stats-talk last week, Gustavsson admitted that he had told the team after the win: \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean anything on the 20th [of July] when we\u2019re going to play Ireland.\u201d Whether in the opening match or if the Matildas progress through to the knockout rounds, on each occasion what has come before cannot fully predict what will come next. The Australians will have to find that special ingredient to propel them forward. In the search of the intangible, last week the Matildas backroom staff brought Cathy Freeman into camp. The Sydney 2000 Olympics sensation knows all too well how to succeed with the weight of a nation\u2019s expectations on her shoulders, and agreed to meet with the Matildas to share her wisdom. \u201cIt\u2019s just a crazy, wild ride,\u201d Freeman told the players. \u201cYou\u2019re writing your names in history, ladies.\u201d It was an inspired move to have Freeman speak with the players, imbuing confidence and determination that no amount of tactical analysis can instil. A holistic plan, then, from Gustavsson. \u201cKnowing how much she means for these players, and they shared some of the reasons why behind what they do and what they want to achieve,\u201d the coach said. \u201cIt was only natural to try and get that connection, a personal connection, for them.\u201d Buoyed by the plan, and inspired by Freeman, on Thursday the Matildas get to work. Gustavsson admitted that he and his captain Kerr had paused for a moment on the walk to Wednesday\u2019s press conference at Stadium Australia to take in the moment. \u201cIt felt a bit unreal,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s actually happening tomorrow \u2013 all the prep work that we\u2019ve done for years, all the days of hard work.\u201d It\u2019s time to put the plan to the test."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b2237b", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jul/20/unemployment-rate-falls-to-35-as-the-economy-adds-32600-jobs-in-june-on-latest-abs-figures", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Unemployment rate falls to 3.5% as the economy adds 32,600 jobs in June on latest ABS figures", "lead": "The bureau of statistics labour numbers will be examined closely by the Reserve Bank when it meets on August 1 to consider interest rates", "author": "Peter Hannam", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 01:35:17", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.231573", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/924b91c4705cb7766062a75d9e564d69e48ea844/0_182_5472_3283/500.jpg", "body": "Australia\u2019s employers added 32,600 more jobs last month as the economy maintained its resilience despite a leap in interest rates. Australia\u2019s unemployment rate in June was 3.5%, the Bureau of Statistics said on Thursday. Economists had expected the rate to remain unchanged for the month from May\u2019s 3.6% tally, with a net 15,000 positions added. The ABS revised May\u2019s rate down to 3.5%, not far shy of last October\u2019s 3.4%, the lowest since the mid-1970s. \u201cThe rise in employment in June saw the employment-to-population ratio remain at a record high 64.5%, reflecting a tight labour market in which employment has recently increased in line with population growth,\u201d said Bjorn Jarvis, ABS\u2019s head of labour statistics, noting the economy had now added a million jobs since before the pandemic. The jobs figures along with June quarter inflation numbers due out next Wednesday will be examined closely by the Reserve Bank when its board meets on 1 August to consider extending its July pause in lifting interest rates. The RBA\u2019s 400 basis points of rate increases since May 2022 mark the sharpest tightening of monetary policy in three decades. In minutes of its July meeting noted \u201cspare capacity in the labour market remained near multi-decade lows\u201d, with job vacancies remaining \u201cvery high\u201d. The Australian dollar jumped a quarter of a US cent to 68.25 US cents on the news, implying investors revised higher their expectations for another RBA rate rise. In late afternoon trading, the dollar had strengthened further to be 68.33 US cents. Listed companies, which are sensitive to higher borrowing costs, saw their share prices ease back, trimming the morning\u2019s gain to 0.2%. The ASX 200 benchmark stock index ended flat for the day. Of the jobs tally, the economy added 39,300 full-time positions last month and shed 6,700 part-time roles. A lower participation rate factored into the reduced jobless tally. That rate edged 0.1 percentage point lower to 66.8% from last month\u2019s record high, Jarvis said. For women the participation rate dropped 0.2 percentage points to 62.5%, while the proportion for men, it rose 0.1 percentage point to 71.3% for men. Monthly hours worked increased by 0.3% in June, another sign of the strength of demand for workers. \u201cOver the past 12 months, hours worked increased 4.7%, outpacing the 3% increase in employment,\u201d Jarvis said. Among the states, New South Wales continued to lead the pack. Its jobless rate sank to a record low 2.9% in June from 3% in May. In Queensland the unemployment rate last month sank to 3.6% in June from 3.9% the previous month. Victoria\u2019s was unchanged at 3.7%. David Bassanese, chief economist at Betashares, said the labour market strength \u201cwill pressure\u201d on the RBA to hoist its cash rate higher yet. Consumer price index figures for the June quarter scheduled for release on 26 July may be critical for the decision. \u201cAlthough the sheer size of the employment gains can be partly explained by a strong rebound in labour supply (higher immigration and workforce participation), the impressive aspect of recent labour market reports is that all these newly available workers appear to be easily finding jobs,\u201d Bassanese said. \u201cThe overall strength in employment is also likely to help underpin household incomes, countering some of the impact of higher interest rates on spending power,\u201d he said. Pat Bustamante, a senior Westpac economist, said the labour data showed the market remained \u201cunquestionably strong\u201d. \u201cWhile the forward labour market indices, such as the number of jobs ads or applications per ads, are pointing to a softening in conditions, today\u2019s result shows that pent-up demand is strong enough to generate jobs for Australia\u2019s labour supply that is growing at a record rate,\u201d Bustamante said. \u201cWhen you combine today\u2019s result with the recent wage outcomes including the Fair Work Commission decision for 2023-24, we continue to expect the Reserve Bank to err on the side of caution and hike by another 25 basis point in August,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, as we approach the end of the tightening cycle, all monthly meetings will be live and finely balanced.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b2237c", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2023/jul/20/the-vote-no-pamphlet-referendum-voice-to-parliament-voting-essay-aec-published-read-in-full-annotated-fact-checked", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "The no pamphlet: campaign\u2019s voice to parliament referendum essay \u2013 annotated and factchecked", "lead": "Pamphlets written by politicians and published by the AEC have put the official case for a yes and no vote.

This Voice proposal goes much further. If passed, it would represent the biggest change to our Constitution in our history. It is legally risky, with unknown consequences. It would be divisive and permanent. If you don\u2019t know, vote no. RISKY We all want to help Indigenous Australians in disadvantaged communities. However, this Voice is not the answer and presents a real risk to our system of government. This Voice specifically covers all areas of \u201cExecutive Government\u201d. This means no issue is beyond its reach. The voice would have no right of veto, and would not be binding on the parliament, according to the prime minister, Anthony Albanese. The High Court would ultimately determine its powers, not the Parliament. Incorrect. The referendum amendment clearly says parliament will have the power to make laws with \u201crespect to matters relating to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice, including its composition, functions, powers and procedures\u201d. Legal experts \u2013 including Australia\u2019s former chief justice \u2013 say high court challenges are unlikely and even then, the court cannot change a decision made by parliament. It can only send a matter back for reappraisal. It risks legal challenges, delays and dysfunctional government. Disputed. The federal solicitor general, Stephen Donaghue, in legal advice on the voice, said it would not clog up the courts or slow down government decision-making and \u201cwould not pose any threat to Australia\u2019s system of representative and responsible government\u201d. His advice, released by the government in April, said the voice would \u201cenhance\u201d the system of government and that \u201cno such requirements can be implied\u201d for the government to wait for voice advice. UNKNOWN No details have been provided on how members of the Voice would be chosen or how it would operate. Australians are being asked to vote first before these details are worked out. Australians should have details before the vote, not after. Misinformation. The referendum is a vote to give parliament the enabling power to design the voice. Those details do not belong in the constitution. As the constitutional expert Anne Twomey said in January: \u201cConstitutions are not places where you want to freeze details. It is appropriate to leave it to parliament as this gives greater flexibility to adjust for future needs.\u201d We don\u2019t know how it will work, we don\u2019t know who will be on it, but we do know it will permanently divide us as Australians. Disputed. The government has issued five key principles of the design of the voice that parliament will undertake if a vote is successful. These are: it will provide independent advice to parliament and government; it will be chosen by First Nations people based on the wishes of local communities; it will be representative of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities; it will be empowering, community-led, inclusive, respectful, culturally informed and gender balanced; it will also include youth; it will be accountable and transparent. Some Voice supporters say this would just be a first step to reparations and compensation and other radical changes. So, what would come next? As noted above, advice from the voice would not be binding on parliament. Any proposals for reparations or compensation would need to gain the support of MPs, just as they would if a political party brought them forward now. DIVISIVE Enshrining a Voice in the Constitution for only one group of Australians means permanently dividing our country. All Australians have the right to make representations to parliament, which is guaranteed by the freedom of political communication implied in our constitution. The First Nations voice is simply a permanent one which also addresses systemic and structural disadvantage faced by First Nations peoples since colonisation. It creates different classes of citizenship through an unknown body that has the full force of the Constitution behind it. The constitution already refers to race in section 51 (xxvi) and section 25. In 1967 the Australian people voted in a referendum to allow the commonwealth to make laws for Aboriginal people. This referendum will enable an Indigenous voice, with representatives from local state and regional bodies, to advise parliament on those laws with the aim of improving life outcomes for First Nations people. Many Indigenous Australians do not support this. Two different polls have shown 80-83% of Indigenous Australians support it. PERMANENT Putting a Voice in the Constitution means it\u2019s permanent. We will be stuck with negative consequences. Incorrect. The voice model would be able to be changed by the parliament of the day, exactly the same as any other law. The voice could be removed from or altered within the constitution by a further referendum. TEN REASONS TO VOTE NO 1. THIS VOICE IS LEGALLY RISKY Australia\u2019s Constitution is our most important legal document. Every word can be open to interpretation. Australia hasn\u2019t changed its Constitution since 1977. This would be the biggest change to our democracy in Australia\u2019s history. It is a leap into the unknown. This Voice has not been road tested. There is no comparable constitutional body like this anywhere in the world. Not quite true. While not enshrined in a constitution, Canada has an Indigenous advisory committee. New Zealand has the Waitangi tribunal to oversee the treaty of 1840. Dedicated Maori seats have existed in the New Zealand parliament since 1867. The arctic nations \u2013 Sweden, Finland and Norway \u2013 all have the Saami parliament to advise governments on Indigenous matters. Enshrining a Voice in the Constitution means it is open to legal challenge and interpretation by the High Court. Legal experts don\u2019t agree, and can\u2019t know for sure, how the High Court will interpret such a constitutional change. \u201cI would foresee a decade or more of constitutional and administrative law litigation arising out of a voice...\u201d (Ian Callinan AC KC, former High Court Judge - The Australian, 17/12/2022) This opens a legal can of worms. See notes above. 2. THERE ARE NO DETAILS This is a big decision. However, the Government won\u2019t reveal key details before the vote. We don\u2019t know how it will help disadvantaged communities and close the gap. We don\u2019t know how many members this Voice would have. These details will be decided through normal parliamentary procedures of legislation, and would be able to be altered by the parliament of the day, as conditions need. We don\u2019t know if they would be elected or chosen, or how this would occur. We don\u2019t know how it would make representations or be held accountable. The design principles state that the voice membership would be \u201cselected by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, not appointed by the executive government\u201d. The process would be designed \u201cto suit the wishes of local communities and would be determined through the post-referendum process\u201d. The principles also state members would serve fixed terms to ensure \u201caccountability\u201d, fall within the scope of the National Anti-Corruption Commission and be able to be sanctioned or removed for serious misconduct. These details would only be worked through after Australians have voted. And would be developed in consultation with Indigenous communities. According to the Yes campaign, it \u201cdoesn\u2019t make sense\u201d to have details before the vote: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any sense to do that detailed consultation until we have the support of the Australian people to change the constitution.\u201d (Yes23 Brochure - The Australian, 17/12/2022) This is the wrong way around. You wouldn\u2019t buy a house without inspecting it or a car without test driving it. Yet you are being asked to vote to change our Constitution without details. Australians shouldn\u2019t be asked to sign a blank cheque. See above \u2013 parliament will design the details after the vote, and some design principles have been made public already. \u201cHow can Australians possibly agree to something where we don\u2019t know the detail?\u201d (Senator Kerrynne Liddle, Shadow Minister for Child Protection and the Prevention of Family Violence and Arrernte woman) 3. IT DIVIDES US Enshrining in our Constitution a body for only one group of Australians means permanently dividing Australians. Many Indigenous Australians do not agree with this. Again, two different polls have shown 80-83% of Indigenous Australians support it. \u201cThis Voice will not unite us, it will divide us by race.\u201d (Senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price, Shadow Minister for Indigenous Australians and Warlpiri woman) The constitution already refers to race in section 51 (xxvi) and section 25. In 1967 the Australian people voted in a referendum to allow the commonwealth to make laws for Aboriginal people. This referendum will enable an Indigenous voice, with representatives from local state and regional bodies, to advise parliament on those laws with the aim of improving life outcomes for First Nations people. The attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, denied the bill would introduce race into the constitution. The Nationals leader, David Littleproud, said he didn\u2019t support claims that the voice would \u201cre-racialise\u201d Australia. The former high court chief justice Robert French said the amendment would be \u201ca significant shift away from the existing race-based legislative power that the commonwealth has with respect to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people\u201d. Prof George Williams: \u201cI think the whole race issue is a complete misnomer. Race is a 19th-century concept that has no longer any scientific credibility attached to it. A group has been identified because they\u2019re a unique group within our community.\u201d This goes against a key principle of our democratic system, that all Australians are equal before the law. See notes above. \u201cThe inclusion of the proposed s 129 would mean that we become a nation where, whenever we or our ancestors first came to this country, we are not all equal.\u201d (David Jackson AM KC, former Federal Court Judge - Parliamentary Inquiry Submission, 11/04/2023) Our Constitution belongs to all Australians. Our Parliament is there to represent all Australians. It now includes a record 11 Indigenous Members and Senators. Our national anthem was recently changed to reflect the fact we are \u201cone and free\u201d. By contrast, this Voice would permanently divide Australians, in law and spirit. \u201cWe\u2019re all Australians. And that\u2019s the way it should end up. It shouldn\u2019t be divided by this so called Voice which is going to split this country right down the centre.\u201d (Ian Conway, Central Arrernte Senior Custodian) 4. IT WON\u2019T HELP INDIGENOUS AUSTRALIANS We all want to help Indigenous Australians in disadvantaged communities, to close the gap and achieve reconciliation. However, more bureaucracy is not the answer. There are currently hundreds of Indigenous representative bodies at all levels of government, along with the National Indigenous Australians Agency, which has 1,400 staff. Incorrect. There are not hundreds of Indigenous bodies at levels of government. NIAA is a government department, like Defence or Health. As at 31 December 2021, just 23% of NIAA staff identify as Indigenous. A centralised Voice risks overlooking the needs of regional and remote communities. The voice design principles include each of the states, territories and the Torres Strait Islands, plus specific representatives from remote regions. The Calma-Langton report proposes remote representatives in NSW, NT, Queensland, WA and SA, in addition to other members. \u201cA national voice cannot speak for country.\u201d (Nyunggai Warren Mundine AO, Australians for Unity board member and Bundjalung man) Right now, many voices are crying out for help in tackling devastating social problems in some remote communities. What\u2019s needed is action. \u201cWhat we need in Canberra is ears, not a Voice.\u201d (Senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price, Shadow Minister for Indigenous Australians and Warlpiri woman) 5. NO ISSUE IS BEYOND ITS SCOPE This Voice model isn\u2019t just to the Parliament, it goes much further \u2013 to all areas of \u201cExecutive Government\u201d. That includes all government departments, agencies and other bodies (like the Reserve Bank). The government has many advisory bodies that provide advice, which the government then decides to either act on or not act on. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, in June said \u201cit will simply be an advisory body, just like we have a range of other advisory bodies\u201d. On Tuesday, Albanese said \u201cit\u2019s not binding on the parliament, it has no right of veto\u201d. Decisions in relation to the economy, national security, infrastructure, health, education and more, would all be within its scope. Anne Twomey: \u201cThere is no obligation upon parliament or the executive government to respond to the representations [from the voice] or give effect to them.\u201d In the words of a member of the Government\u2019s Referendum Working Group: \u201cThe voice will be able to speak to all parts of the government, including the cabinet, ministers, public servants, and independent statutory offices and agencies \u2013 such as the Reserve Bank...It can\u2019t shut the voice up.\u201d (Professors Megan Davis and Gabrielle Appleby - The Australian, 1/4/2023) In the words of a constitutional law professor who supports the Voice: \u201cI think it\u2019s fatally flawed because what it does is retain the full range of review of executive action. This means the Voice can comment on everything from submarines to parking tickets\u2026We will have regular judicial interventions.\u201d (Professor Greg Craven AO - Daily Mail, 24/3/2023) Craven has accused the no campaign of being \u201cdeeply misleading\u201d and \u201cdisreputable\u201d by including his quote. He said he is a supporter of the voice and will campaign strongly for a yes vote. Many legal experts have expressed concern about its scope, however their concerns have simply been overlooked. The government altered the proposed wording of the amendment after some legal experts suggested changes. The final wording makes it clearer that parliament would retain power to make laws over the voice\u2019s composition and functions. 6. IT RISKS DELAYS AND DYSFUNCTION The Australian Parliament deals with hundreds of pieces of legislation a year. This Voice\u2019s scope goes beyond Parliament, covering departments, agencies and all areas of \u201cExecutive Government\u201d. How would the Voice handle this? If the Voice is not satisfied with the way it has been consulted, or a decision that is made, it could appeal to the courts. How long would this take? The leading constitutional academic Anne Twomey, a member of the government\u2019s expert legal panel that developed the voice, rebuffed such concerns in April. She said there was \u201cno obligation\u201d for parliament or government to respond to the voice\u2019s representations, to engage in prior consultation, or to wait for representations from the voice before making decisions. Many legal experts have warned this would cause considerable delays in decision making. The federal solicitor general, Stephen Donaghue, on the question of obligations to wait for voice advice, said: \u201cThe text of [the] proposed s129 imposes no such requirements. Further, no such requirements can be implied.\u201d \u201cThe Voice will almost certainly become a lightning rod for protracted debate about a vast array of current issues. Nearly every matter of current concern on the national agenda will be seen as having an Indigenous component of some kind.\u201d (Nicholas Hasluck AM KC, former WA Supreme Court Judge - Parliamentary Inquiry Submission, 16/4/2023) The risk of legal appeals and delays means a risk of dysfunctional government. That is not good for Australia. 7. IT OPENS THE DOOR FOR ACTIVISTS The legal uncertainty and the absence of details raises the question: what comes next? Some Voice supporters are upfront in saying this Voice will be a first step to reparations and compensation and other radical changes. \u201cThis is the first step, it\u2019s a vital step and it puts all the explanation behind it. \u2018Pay the Rent\u2019 for example, how do we do that in a way that is transparent and that actually sees reparations and compensation to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people\u2026?\u201d (Thomas Mayo, Referendum Working Group - SEARCH Foundation speech, 12/2/2020) The Uluru Statement from the Heart says a Voice is a first step, before a treaty and truth telling. By definition, a treaty is an agreement between governments, not between one group of citizens and its government. Incorrect. A treaty is a binding agreement between two or more parties. A treaty sets out the terms of engagement and obligations of all sides to maintain the agreement. New Zealand (Aotearoa), Canada, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Japan, Greenland and the US have all negotiated treaties with Indigenous peoples. A member of the Government\u2019s Referendum Working Group has described \u201ctruth\u201d as \u201cleverage\u201d to lead to \u201cthe abolishment of the old colonial institutions\u201d. The Uluru statement from the heart has called for a sequence: first the establishment of the voice, followed by a Makaratta commission to explore a process of treaty making and truth telling. These processes are a long way from being determined. \u201cIt is a way to further what we need for our people in any negotiations for treaties and for other things like legislation, reform and abolishment of the institutions, the old colonial institutions that harm us.\u201d (Thomas Mayo, Referendum Working Group SEARCH Foundation speech, 12/2/2020) Already, many activists are campaigning to abolish Australia Day, change our flag and other institutions and symbols important to Australians. \u201cIt\u2019s always been #abolishAustraliaDay, changing the date is a cop out.\u201d (Teela Reid, Referendum Engagement Group - Twitter, 24/1/2023) If there is a constitutionally enshrined Voice, these calls would grow louder. This is speculation.The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has publicly ruled out compensation for Indigenous Australians, moving the date of Australia Day and the voice making representations to the Reserve Bank. The Indigenous affairs minister, Linda Burney, has said her priorities for the voice will be health, housing, employment and education. \u201cAustralians need to understand that the Voice will be used to support the demands for recognition of coexisting sovereignty, a Makarrata commission designed to produce a treaty and monetary compensation, and a rewriting of Australian history\u2026 The potential for great irremediable harm to Australian society means the voice should never be incorporated into the Australian constitution\u2026\u201d (Terence Cole AO RFD KC, former NSW Supreme Court Judge - Spectator Australia, 6/4/2023; Parliamentary Inquiry Submission, 19/4/2023) 8. IT WILL BE COSTLY AND BUREAUCRATIC We don\u2019t know how much additional funding would be allocated to this Voice. That\u2019s another detail that would only be determined after the referendum. There are currently hundreds of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander representative bodies at all levels of government. This year, the Government has allocated $4.3 billion for the National Indigenous Australians Agency, which has 1,400 staff. Only 23% of those staff are Indigenous. NIAA is a government department to serve the minister, like health, foreign affairs or education. Under the previous Coalition government, 39% of all grants were being paid out to 589 non-Indigenous corporations, charities and organisations. The current Indigenous Australians minister, Linda Burney, says the voice would help design programs which are more efficient as well as cost-effective. This Agency\u2019s website and corporate plan says: \u201cWe\u2026 ensure Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have a say in the decisions that affect them.\u201d There is no suggestion this Voice will replace any of these. It will operate as one bureaucracy among many. 9. THIS VOICE WILL BE PERMANENT This Voice is not a trial or pilot program. It will not be in legislation that can be reversed. Once it is in the Constitution it won\u2019t be undone. Details of the voice, including its membership and how it interacts with parliament, will be decided through legislation that can be changed by the parliament of the day. The constitutional amendment specifically notes parliament will \u201chave power to make laws with respect to matters relating to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander voice, including its composition, functions, powers and procedures.\u201d Once the High Court makes an interpretation, Parliament can\u2019t overrule it. We will be stuck with the negative consequences forever. Incorrect. Legal experts \u2013 including the former chief justice of Australia \u2013 say the high court cannot change a decision made by parliament. It can only send a matter back for reappraisal. 10. THERE ARE BETTER WAYS FORWARD This referendum is not about simply recognising Indigenous Australians in the Constitution. That can be achieved without tying it to a risky, unknown and permanent Voice. Recognition has the widespread support of Australians. However, this Voice proposal is the problem. There are many Australians who oppose a Voice on principle. The voice came from the Uluru Statement from the Heart, signed by 250 Indigenous leaders, following comprehensive rejection of symbolic recognition by Indigenous people across many years. Others might be willing to consider a less risky Voice option, but the Government has not given you this choice. When previous changes to the Constitution have been proposed, there has been a Constitutional Convention to properly consider options and details. The Uluru statement from the heart, calling for the voice, was delivered in 2017 following the First Nations constitutional convention at Uluru. The attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, has said: \u201cThis bill is the product of a comprehensive and lengthy process to determine the right form of constitutional recognition for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples stretching over more than a decade.\u201d No such process happened here. This process was rushed and heavy-handed. This approach isn\u2019t unifying, or effective. It\u2019s divisive. THIS DECISION IS YOURS This is a very important decision. Unfortunately, the legitimate questions and concerns of many Australians have been dismissed. Fortunately, this referendum won\u2019t be decided by politicians, corporations or celebrities. It will be decided by every Australian. It affects every Australian. If you don\u2019t know, vote no.

Vote Yes for unity, hope and to make a positive difference. Voting YES is about: Recognition \u25a0 Recognising Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in our Constitution and paying respect to 65,000 years of culture and tradition. Listening \u25a0 Listening to advice from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people about matters that affect their lives, so governments make better decisions. Better Results \u25a0 Making practical progress in Indigenous health, education, employment and housing, so people have a better life. The latest data from the Productivity Commission shows few Closing the Gap report targets are on track to be met and, in crucial areas like incarceration and child removals, the gap is getting worse. These are entrenched issues that will take a long time to turn around, whether there is a voice or not. It\u2019s a change only you can make happen. The government could legislate a voice but constitutional enshrinement is something that is called for in the Uluru statement from the heart. Vote Yes to an idea that comes directly from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people themselves: Constitutional Recognition through a Voice. Two different polls have shown 80-83% of Indigenous Australians support it. However, the yes campaign and the Labor government are continuing further outreach to Indigenous communities to explain the concept and the referendum. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said on Monday \u201cthe yes campaign needs to be stronger in putting the case\u201d. What is the Voice: The Voice will be a committee of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who will give advice to the Parliament and Government on issues that affect their community. It will include Indigenous Australians from every state and territory, the Torres Strait Islands and representatives from the regions and remote communities. Members of the Voice will be chosen by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in their local area and serve for a fixed period. The government has not shared a draft of the voice model, and says concrete details about how many people sit on it, how they are selected and how the voice would interact with parliament would be decided first through further consultation with Indigenous communities after the referendum, and then changed or amended over time by the parliament of the day. Why we need it: There are big challenges facing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people: \u25a0 A life expectancy 8 years shorter than non-Indigenous Australians. \u25a0 Worse rates of disease and infant mortality. \u25a0 A suicide rate twice as high. \u25a0 Fewer opportunities for education and training. Clearly, the current approach isn\u2019t working. To close these gaps, find solutions and plan for the future we need to listen to advice from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people about issues affecting their lives and communities. The government has not yet stated how the voice would interact with parliament or government, or how its advice would be delivered or considered. How the Voice will work: The Voice is about advice. When governments listen to people about issues that affect them, they: \u25a0 Make better decisions. \u25a0 Get better results. \u25a0 Deliver better value for money. The Voice will give advice on key issues facing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, from better infant health to improving services in remote areas. Parliament and Government will still be responsible for all laws, programs and funding. Patrick Dodson, Senator for Western Australia, Yawuru Elder: \u201cWhen people on the ground are listened to and engaged, better laws and policies are made. Advice from the Voice will make our decisions and directions more informed and more successful. Recognition in the Constitution will help heal our nation.\u201d THE VOICE: KEY FACTS \u25a0 Idea comes from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. \u25a0 Recognises First Peoples in our Constitution. \u25a0 A committee of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. \u25a0 Gives people a say on issues affecting them. \u25a0 Listening will mean better results \u2013 and better value for money. \u25a0 Representatives from all states and territories, the Torres Strait Islands and remote communities. \u25a0 Will include young people and a balance of men and women. \u25a0 Parliament and Government still responsible for laws, programs and funding. KEEP READING FOR 8 MORE REASONS TO VOTE YES. 1. This idea came directly from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Voting Yes means: \u25a0 Supporting an aspiration put forward by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people over decades. \u25a0 Accepting a proposal backed by over 80% of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The call for a Voice did not come from politicians. In 2017, after many years of work and countless conversations in every part of the country, nearly 250 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander leaders and elders endorsed the Uluru Statement from the Heart. Calling for recognition in the Constitution through a Voice. Asking us to help make practical change in their lives and create better opportunities for their children. Australians from all walks of life, all faiths and cultures, and all sides of politics have given their support to this proposal. Now we can make it a reality. Voting Yes is an act of unity that will bring Australians together. 2. Constitutional recognition for concrete results. Constitutional recognition is a powerful statement that will drive practical change. Voting Yes means: \u25a0 Recognising Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Peoples of Australia. \u25a0 Celebrating and sharing 65,000 years of history. \u25a0 Sending a powerful message to the world about Australia\u2019s unity. \u25a0 Making a practical difference for the future. Generations of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have enriched our nation with their culture and creativity, their knowledge of the land and waters, and their contribution to Australian life. Our ancient continent is home to the world\u2019s oldest living cultures. Recognising this in our Constitution is an inspiring way to celebrate our shared history. Voting Yes is an act of reconciliation that will deliver real results. Many in the no campaign, including the parliamentary Liberal party, say they support constitutional recognition and would strongly support that sole question being put at the referendum. The no campaign\u2019s major message is in opposition to the voice itself, not constitutional recognition. The form of recognition Indigenous Australians are asking us to support is a Voice. A vehicle for practical change. Johnathan Thurston, NRL champion and coach, Gunggari man: \u201cOur young people deserve the chance to be their best. I work closely with schoolkids in the Yarrabah community in Queensland. I\u2019ve seen the obstacles they face. Nobody understands that better than their local community. Giving them a say will mean more of our kids reach their potential. That\u2019s what the Voice is about.\u201d 3. Ensure people have a better life. The Voice is a vehicle to deliver real improvements for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in: \u25a0 Life expectancy. \u25a0 Infant mortality and health. \u25a0 Education and employment. The latest data from the Productivity Commission shows few Closing the Gap report targets are on track to be met and, in crucial areas like incarceration and child removals, the gap is getting worse. These are entrenched issues that will take a long time to turn around, whether there is a voice or not. For a long time, governments with good intentions have spent billions trying to deal with these issues. But they haven\u2019t achieved lasting improvement because they haven\u2019t listened to people on the ground. The current approach is broken and the Voice is our best chance to fix it. No-one thinks the Voice will instantly solve everything - but we will finally have the right approach in place. Here are three examples where listening to Indigenous people has delivered better outcomes IMAGINE THE PROGRESS AUSTRALIA COULD MAKE WITH A VOICE. Listening Works: Better Health Services Community-controlled Aboriginal Medical Services employ local Indigenous people. They run clinics and visit remote areas, providing essential services like child immunisation. In South East Queensland, the local Aboriginal Medical Service and the community worked together to hugely increase the number of annual health checks, from 550 to over 20,000 over 10 years. As part of the national push to increase immunisation rates in Aboriginal communities undertaken by Aboriginal medical services, this would occur within existing systems, without the need for a voice to parliament. Listening Works: Better Results in Education Families and community leaders have been involved in every step of the new Dhupuma Barker school in Arnhem Land, from lesson-planning to uniforms and lunches. Genuine partnership has driven strong school attendance rates and better results. The \u2018Dhupuma Firebirds\u2019 Robotics team recently competed in the VEX International Championships in Texas, the first team from the Northern Territory ever to qualify. Principal Phillip Heath says: \u201cListening to the community is a game-changer in regional and remote education.\u201d Listening Works: Indigenous Rangers There are nearly 2,000 Indigenous Rangers working on country. Rangers care for our environment by working to prevent bushfires, controlling feral pests and improving the health of our rivers. Listening to Indigenous Rangers means sharing in 65,000 years of knowledge and connection to our land and waters. Vote Yes for better results around Australia. Vote Yes to help close the gap. 4. Bring our country together. Voting Yes means: \u25a0 Becoming reconciled with our past and moving to a better future. \u25a0 A change only you can make happen. Australia has come a long way since our Constitution came into effect in 1901. We now rightly celebrate Indigenous Australians and their contributions to our country. At the 1967 referendum, 90% of Australians voted Yes to changing the Constitution, so Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people would be counted in the population in the same way as everyone else. The 1967 referendum gave parliament the power to make laws for Aboriginal people and for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to be counted in the official figures collected in the census. Together we have a chance to take the next step - recognising Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people through a Voice. Other nations with similar histories, like Canada and New Zealand, formally recognised their own First Peoples decades ago. Experience shows there is nothing to fear - and so much to gain. Rachel Perkins, Filmmaker from Alice Springs, Arrernte/Kalkadoon woman: \u201cOur people have spent decades campaigning for the opportunity of a better life. We\u2019ve never been more determined or more united. The Voice is our best shot, let\u2019s take it.\u201d Perkins is also one of the co-chairs of Australians for Indigenous Constitutional Recognition, the board behind the Yes23 campaign. 5. Save money. When governments listen to people, they get better outcomes and use funding more effectively. Aunty Pat Anderson AO, Co-Chair Uluru Dialogues, Alyawarre woman: \u201cWhen you involve people, you make better decisions and the money you spend goes where it\u2019s needed most: to the people on the ground.\u201d Governments from both sides have invested billions in programs that haven\u2019t fixed problems or reached communities. NIAA is a government department, like Defence or Health. As at 31 December 2021, just 23% of NIAA staff identify as Indigenous. Under the previous Coalition government, 39% of all grants were being paid out to 589 non-Indigenous corporations, charities and organisations. A Voice will help us listen to locals and save money. We\u2019re all better off when governments don\u2019t waste taxpayer money on things that aren\u2019t working. 6. The time is now. The idea of a Voice has been decades in the making. Many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have put in a great deal of hard work and goodwill. Constitutional recognition has been on the agenda in various forms for decades, including in the 1999 referendum question concerning a preamble to the constitution under the Howard government. Voting No means nothing will change. It means accepting we can\u2019t do better. Don\u2019t risk more of the same: \u25a0 Worse life expectancy. \u25a0 Worse results in education and employment. \u25a0 Worse outcomes in health. Vote Yes to break this cycle and unite our nation. Eddie Betts, Adelaide and Carlton AFL legend, Gubrun, Wirangu/Kokatha man: \u201cI know the Voice won\u2019t fix everything overnight but I feel like it\u2019s the opening of a pathway to make sure we are included and respected in decision-making on issues that impact us.\u201d 7. Practical advice that works. The Voice will advise on practical steps to improve Indigenous health, education, employment and housing. Putting the Voice in the Constitution gives it stability and independence, now and into the future. This means the Voice can give frank advice, without getting caught up in short-term politics. We can\u2019t solve all the challenges Indigenous Australians face overnight. We need action now, as well as planning for the long term. That\u2019s why we need a Voice that can\u2019t be abolished with the stroke of a pen. Legal experts have made it clear that the Voice will not have the power to prevent, delay or veto laws or decisions. The Voice is about advice. 8. Making government work better. Voting Yes means: \u25a0 Government getting better advice and delivering better outcomes. \u25a0 An addition to the Constitution backed by the experts. Senior lawyers and former High Court Judges have been part of this process. What the Legal Experts Say: \u25a0 Constitutionally and legally sound. \u25a0 Will enhance our system of government. \u25a0 No veto power \u2013 Parliament and Government have final sign-off. For details see the Advisory Report on the Constitution Alteration (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice) 2023. Robert French AC, Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia 2008-2017 and Geoffrey Lindell, Emeritus Professor of Law, University of Adelaide: \u201cThe Voice is a big idea but not a complicated one. It is low risk for a high return\u2026 The Voice will provide a practical opportunity for First Peoples to give informed and coherent and reliable advice to the Parliament and the Government.\u201d - Joint Opinion Piece, Australian Financial Review, 4/2/2023. Now it\u2019s up to us. Evonne Goolagong Cawley AC MBE, former tennis world number one, Wiradjuri woman: \u201cVoting Yes is a chance for all Australians to celebrate the contribution Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have made to our country and to help the next generation chase their dreams. Let\u2019s grab this moment with both hands.\u201d Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have given us a once-in-a-generation chance. We can vote Yes to be part of a great unifying moment that will bring about a better future. We can vote Yes to: \u25a0 Do the right thing by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. \u25a0 Give people a say on issues that affect them. \u25a0 Make a practical difference that improves lives. Let\u2019s vote Yes for recognition, listening and better results. Let\u2019s vote Yes to ensure Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people live better lives with more opportunities for their children. In a spirit of unity, let\u2019s vote Yes together. This article was updated on 20 July 2023 to indicate that recognition was on the agenda from at least 1999. In 2008 Kevin Rudd was in power not John Howard."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b2237e", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jul/20/indigenous-voice-to-parliament-no-campaign-kerry-obrien-racists", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Kerry O\u2019Brien says Indigenous voice no campaign\u2019s conduct has been an \u2018open invitation to racists\u2019", "lead": "Former ABC host says language used by Peter Dutton has been \u2018cowardly\u2019", "author": "Miles Martignoni and Phoebe McIlwraith", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 01:08:22", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.231629", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/2ca9e9f6d2e09dcd34ab92098c0015f39640d2d5/0_126_2400_1440/500.jpg", "body": "The conduct of the official Indigenous voice no campaign has been an \u201copen invitation to racists\u201d, according to Kerry O\u2019Brien.

In its recently released consultation paper, the review asked \u201cWhat contributes to poor performance?\u201d Its first answer? \u201cAustralia\u2019s schools are highly segregated along socio-economic lines.\u201d The review stated that Australia has one of the most socially segregated school systems in the OECD; concentrations of disadvantage are increasing; and this is harming student learning outcomes. It pointed to evidence that a child from a disadvantaged family who attends a school surrounded by similarly disadvantaged peers will be three years of learning behind a child from the same background who attends an advantaged school. This finding is not new. In fact, the Gonski review said exactly the same thing. So has the Australian Council for Educational Research and many education researchers. And when you think about it, the reasons are obvious. In a classroom where most of the children are from disadvantaged backgrounds, there will likely be a much greater demand on teacher time and therefore less individualised attention. Behavioural issues and low student engagement tend to reduce time on task, and make it harder to create a strong culture of learning. This all shapes how lessons and units are designed, and academic subjects are less likely to be offered. It all takes a toll on teacher morale, hence these schools find it much more challenging to recruit and retain teachers. Why does Australia have a highly socially segregated school system? Because we have an internationally unique dual system of schools \u2013 some public, free and inclusive, and others private, fee-charging and exclusive. They all get public funding, but ever-increasing fees inevitably restrict the access of low-income families to the private schools. Additionally, selective enrolment practices in a variety of schools exclude low-achieving students, while resource advantages enable some schools to attract high-performing students. To make matters worse, governments have chosen to provide much greater funding increases to nongovernment schools. This gives private schools a huge marketing advantage, allowing them to advertise smaller class sizes and flashy facilities, and lure those who can afford the fees away from the public system. At the other end, the overwhelming majority of disadvantaged students are lumped together, producing all the problems policymakers know too well. But it doesn\u2019t have to be like this. If you walk into a Catholic school in Ontario, Canada, you will find that it is as Catholic as any Australian Catholic school in terms of its curriculum, ethos and governance. But it will also be as public as any Australian public school in that it is free and it enrols students on an inclusive basis. Because all schools are fully publicly funded and don\u2019t charge fees, Canada\u2019s schools are much more socioeconomically mixed. Canada consistently outperforms Australia in standardised tests. Disadvantaged Canadian students express a much stronger belonging at school and more optimism about their future than their Australian counterparts. In other words, Canada offers an example of a better, fairer system where social disadvantage is much less concentrated \u2013 and schools are more focused on lifting the achievement of the students they have than on attracting the custom of the most able and advantaged. We propose a similar common framework for all Australian schools. In return for public funding, all schools should meet corresponding public obligations. All schools, government and nongovernment alike, would be fully funded on a needs basis but prohibited from charging fees or applying selective enrolment practices other than to preserve their special religious or educational ethos. In other words, we can balance choice and fairness. If debates about schools in Australia are any guide, such a proposal might seem impossible. After all, we\u2019ve long believed that funding private schools creates a saving for the taxpayer. But many private schools receive more taxpayer funding than equivalent public schools. It would only require modest additional expenditure to meet the total cost of fully funding all nongovernment schools. However, our proposal will require a significant amount of good faith and mutual trust in a space where there has not been an abundance of either. A good first step would be for Australian governments to explicitly articulate a clear, contemporary rationale for our dual system of public funded schools. This rationale should define the goals of our present approach, how they can be balanced and how they should be measured. After all, if the goal of public funding of private schools is to increase choice then why do fees keep increasing far in excess of inflation? If the goal is to save taxpayers money, then why do many private schools receive more taxpayer funding than comparable public schools? If the goal is to lift all schools, why is that not happening? And why do we allow social segregation to widen the achievement gaps. Defining and measuring our goals is the first step to acknowledging that we are not achieving them. Once we have done that, we will be in a better position to move towards a system that is more fair, provides more genuine choice and enhances equity, effectiveness and achievement at the same time. \u2022 Tom Greenwell and Chris Bonnor are co-authors of Choice and Fairness: A Common Framework for all Australian Schools published by Australian Learning Lecture, and Waiting for Gonski: How Australia failed its schools"}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b22381", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/19/trump-investigation-three-federal-crimes-january-6", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Trump under investigation for civil rights conspiracy in January 6 inquiry", "lead": "Federal prosecutors say they have evidence to charge Trump with three crimes over efforts to overturn 2020 election", "author": "Hugo Lowell in Washington", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 00:44:16", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.231683", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/999d6f0613ea0ea03769c72bb4d44c7e5f37733c/0_236_4204_2523/500.jpg", "body": "Federal prosecutors investigating Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the 2020 election results have evidence to charge the former president with three crimes, including section 241 of the US legal code that makes it unlawful to conspire to violate civil rights, two people familiar with the matter said. The potential charges detailed in a target letter sent to Trump by prosecutors from the office of special counsel Jack Smith, who also charged Trump with retaining classified documents last month, was the clearest signal of an imminent indictment. Prosecutors appear to have evidence to charge Trump with obstruction of an official proceeding and conspiracy to defraud the United States based on the target letter, two statutes that the House select committee examining the January 6 Capitol attack issued criminal referrals for last year. The target letter to Trump identified a previously unconsidered third charge, the sources said. That is section 241 of title 18 of the US code, which makes it unlawful to conspire to threaten or intimidate a person in the \u201cfree exercise\u201d of any right or privilege under the \u201cConstitution or laws of the United States\u201d. The statute, enacted to protect the civil rights of Black voters targeted by white supremacy groups after the US civil war, is unusual because it is typically used by prosecutors in law enforcement misconduct and hate crime prosecutions, though its use has expanded in recent years. What the potential charges means for Trump is unclear. Prosecutors have been examining various instances of Trump pressuring officials like his former vice-president Mike Pence, but Trump\u2019s efforts to obstruct the transfer of power could also be construed as conspiring to defraud voters more generally. The other two statutes, meanwhile, suggest a core part of the case against Trump is focused on the so-called fake electors scheme and the former president\u2019s efforts to use the fake slates in a conspiracy to stop the congressional certification of Joe Biden\u2019s election win on 6 January 2021. The target letter did not cite any seditious conspiracy, incitement of insurrection or deprivation of rights under color of law \u2013 other areas for which legal experts have suggested Trump could have legal risk. A spokesperson for the Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment about the contents of the target letter, though a senior adviser to Trump did not dispute that section 241 was listed when reached late on Tuesday night. The New York Times also reported the inclusion of the statute. Trump, who is facing unprecedented legal peril as he leads the pack of candidates for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, called the target letter \u201cHORRIFYING NEWS\u201d in a post on his Truth Social platform, where he first disclosed the development. Last year, the House select committee that investigated the Capitol attack concluded that Trump committed multiple crimes in an attempt to reverse his 2020 defeat to Joe Biden, including conspiracy to defraud the United States and obstruction of an official proceeding. The committee issued symbolic criminal referrals to the justice department, although at that point the justice department had since stepped up its criminal investigation with the addition of new prosecutors in spring 2022 before they were folded into the special counsel\u2019s office. House investigators also concluded that there was evidence for prosecutors to charge Trump with conspiracy to defraud and obstruction of an official proceeding. They also issued referrals for incitement of insurrection, which was not listed in the target letter. Should prosecutors charge Trump in the federal January 6 investigation, the case could go to trial much more quickly than the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case \u2013 before the 2024 election \u2013 because pre-trial proceedings would not be delayed by rules governing national security materials. Trump was charged last month for retaining national security materials and obstructing the government\u2019s efforts to retrieve them. Trump and his co-defendant, his valet Walt Nauta, who was charged with conspiring to obstruct and making false statements to the FBI, have both pleaded not guilty. The target letter to Trump comes weeks before the Fulton county district attorney, Fani Willis, is expected to charge Trump and his allies for their efforts to overturn the 2020 election results in the state of Georgia, the Guardian has previously reported."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b22382", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jul/20/senior-public-servant-kathryn-campbell-suspended-without-pay-after-robodebt-findings", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Senior public servant Kathryn Campbell suspended without pay after robodebt findings ", "lead": "Royal commission found the former head of the Department of Human Services was responsible for department that had established \u2018an unlawful program\u2019", "author": "Paul Karp , Daniel Hurst and Amy Remeikis", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 00:21:15", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.231701", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/7c83b87a04eefa5bda6711ec75289e7acbcbead3/0_0_3606_2164/500.jpg", "body": "Senior Department of Defence official Kathryn Campbell has been suspended without pay in the wake of the royal commission report into robodebt. The Canberra Times reported, and Guardian Australia has independently confirmed, that Campbell was suspended without pay, effective Monday 10 July \u2013 three days after the royal commission report was tabled. The royal commission report said Campbell, a former head of the Department of Human Services, had been \u201cresponsible for a department that had established, implemented and maintained an unlawful program\u201d. But Campbell \u201cdid nothing of substance\u201d when exposed to information that brought to light the illegality of income averaging, the report said, and \u201cfailed to act\u201d when presented with opportunities to obtain legal advice. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup On Thursday the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, told ABC Radio he would not \u201ccomment on individual cases in detail\u201d because of \u201cprocesses in place\u201d but confirmed Campbell had been suspended without pay. Albanese said the royal commission was \u201cvery clear about failings\u201d in the Morrison government and the bureaucracy. \u201cIt\u2019s appropriate that there be a response to that.\u201d The Department of Defence has previously declined to comment on Campbell\u2019s future as a senior adviser on Aukus projects. The Albanese government appointed Campbell to a $900,000-a-year job in June 2022 to oversee Aukus, maintaining the top-tier salary package she earned as chief of the foreign affairs department, despite her no longer managing any people in the new role. Questioned about that appointment at Senate estimates in May, the foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, said that evidence at the royal commission had been \u201cquite substantial\u201d and gone \u201cbeyond what we might have envisaged\u201d. Independent MPs had called on Campbell to consider her future following the robodebt reports findings, while the government came under pressure to act. Asked about the fate of public servants including Campbell after the royal commission report was released, Albanese said: \u201cAgency heads are of course empowered to take immediate action, pending further investigations, and I am very confident that they will.\u201d The royal commission report found Campbell knew of both the intended use of income averaging in the robodebt program and advice from the Department of Social Services that legislative change was needed, but did nothing to change the policy proposal that went to government. It found she did so because she knew Scott Morrison wanted to \u201cpursue the proposal and that the government could not achieve the savings\u201d that were promised without income averaging. Campbell has not responded to media requests for comment after the royal commission report, but at the hearings Campbell defended her handling of the matter and said she had assumed the scheme was lawful despite earlier advice raising serious questions. During questioning at the royal commission, Campbell said: \u201cI have never been in a department that sought to mislead. And I have never been involved in an operation that has sought to mislead the government.\u201d The report said: \u201cIn oral evidence, Ms Campbell accepted that the NPP [new policy proposal] was apt to mislead cabinet. \u201cShe contended that her failure to eliminate its misleading effect was an \u2018oversight\u2019. That would be an extraordinary oversight for someone of Ms Campbell\u2019s seniority and experience.\u201d Commissioner Catherine Holmes concluded that \u201cthe weight of the evidence instead leads to the conclusion that Ms Campbell knew of the misleading effect of the NPP but chose to stay silent\u201d. In a sealed chapter the robodebt royal commission made referrals for possible civil action and criminal prosecution to the Australian federal police, the National Anti-Corruption Commission, the heads of agencies who employ public servants, the Australian Public Service Commission and professional conduct bodies for lawyers. A panel including the secretaries of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Attorney General\u2019s Department and APS commissioner Gordon de Brouwer will develop advice for government on how to respond to adverse findings about public servants.

US and Korean officials identified the soldier as Private 2nd Class Travis King, according to CBS News. King, 23, was being held in custody by South Korea at the airport in Incheon, near Seoul, and in the process of being expelled when he fled. After passing through airport security, he unexpectedly joined a tour group to the Korean border village of Panmunjom, a popular tourist spot inside the 248km-long (154-mile) demilitarized zone, or DMZ. A member of the tour later told CBS News that King, who was reported to be in civilian clothes, gave \u201cout a loud \u2018ha ha ha\u2019 and just runs in between some buildings\u201d. Pentagon officials said that UN Command security forces who had been escorting the tour group chased King, who is from Racine, Wisconsin, but could not catch him. Adm John Aquilino, the head of US Indo-Pacific Command, confirmed that an army private \u201cmade a run across the demilitarized zone in the Joint Security Area. He was picked up by the North Koreans,\u201d according to NBC News. The US defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, said during a news conference on Tuesday that King had entered North Korea \u201cintentionally and without authorisation\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot that that we\u2019re still trying to learn, but what we do know is that one of our service members who was on a tour willfully and without authorisation crossed the military demarcation line,\u201d Austin told Pentagon reporters. Austin said King was probably now in North Korean custody. A US state department spokesperson said that the department \u201chas not reached out to the North Koreans or other governments\u201d on the matter. Adam Smith, a senior Democrat on the House armed services committee, told CNN that North Korea\u2019s detention of a US soldier posed a serious diplomatic problem since the US and North Korea do not maintain diplomatic relations. \u201cIf a US soldier is held in North Korea, our priority must be securing his return,\u201d Smith said. A tourist from New Zealand who was in King\u2019s group told the Associated Press that upon the end of their tour, their group was \u201csort of milling around\u201d while being watched by both South Korean and American soldiers. The tourist said soldiers on the North Korean side seemed to be inside a building. She then noticed a man \u201crunning what looked like full gas towards the North Korean side\u201d. It is not clear that King, 23, who was scheduled to return to Fort Bliss, Texas, wants to return to US soil. He was released from two months\u2019 detention on assault charges, including damaging a police car, on 10 July and could face additional military disciplinary actions and discharge from the service on his return to the US, according to the Associated Press. King\u2019s uncle Carl Gates told the Daily Beast that the soldier was \u201cbreaking down\u201d over a family tragedy. Gates explained that his son, King\u2019Nazir, had struggled with a rare genetic condition, SPTLC 2, before dying from the disease in February aged six. \u201cWhen my son was on life support, and when my son passed away \u2026 Travis started [being] reckless [and] crazy when he knew my son was about to die,\u201d Gates said. \u201cIt seemed like he was breaking down. It affected Travis a lot.\u201d His family described King as a quiet loner who did not drink or smoke and enjoyed reading the Bible. \u201cI can\u2019t see him doing that intentionally if he was in his right mind,\u201d King\u2019s maternal grandfather, Carl Gates, told the Associated Press. \u201cTravis is a good guy. He wouldn\u2019t do nothing to hurt nobody. And I can\u2019t see him trying to hurt himself.\u201d A US army spokesman said King was a cavalry scout in the First Armored Division who had joined the service in January 2021, according to CNN. His service awards include the national defense service medal, the Korean defense service medal and the overseas service ribbon. King\u2019s mother, Claudine Gates, told ABC7 she was \u201cshocked\u201d by the news. \u201cI can\u2019t see Travis doing anything like that,\u201d Gates told the network, adding that she heard from her son several days ago and he told her that he would be returning to his base in Fort Bliss. King seems to be the first US soldier to defect to North Korea since 1962, when James Dresnok, who was facing court-martial for taking an unauthorized overnight leave, walked across the heavily fortified border to the North. This apparent defection presents a headache for US officials, and comes amid tense relations between the two Koreas, and between Washington and Pyongyang. On Tuesday, the USS Kentucky, a nuclear-powered submarine, arrived at South Korea\u2019s Busan naval base. Adm Aquilino said the visit was a \u201ccritical\u201d demonstration of US power, according to NBC News. \u201cWe assure our allies and partners often, and this is just one of those demonstrations,\u201d he said. Sean Timmons, with Tully Rinckey, a law firm that specializes in military legal cases, told the Associated Press that if King was trying to present himself as a legitimate defector fleeing either political oppression or persecution, it would be up to North Korea\u2019s leadership to decide if he can stay. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be up to the whims of their leadership, what they want to do,\u201d Timmons said."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b22384", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/20/australia-us-aukus-military-defence-equipment-priority-access-export-control", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Australia to gain priority access to US military equipment under Washington proposal", "lead": "Aukus requests would be handled faster than almost all applications \u2018other than from Taiwan and Ukraine\u2019", "author": "Daniel Hurst Foreign affairs and defence correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 00:00:14", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.231744", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/40c028b337a53b76b350a5e44b36a8e34c9ded4b/0_174_2103_1262/500.jpg", "body": "Australian requests for US military equipment would be handled faster than almost all applications \u201cother than from Taiwan and Ukraine\u201d under a proposal before the US Senate.

The report would provide a \u201cdetailed explanation of the military and strategic benefit provided by the improved access provided by naval bases of Australia\u201d. It would include \u201ca detailed assessment of how Australia\u2019s sovereign conventionally armed nuclear attack submarines contribute to United States defense and deterrence objectives in the Indo-Pacific region\u201d. Kurt Campbell, the White House Indo-Pacific coordinator, told a thinktank last month: \u201cWhen submarines are provided from the United States to Australia, it\u2019s not like they\u2019re lost. They will just be deployed by the closest possible allied force.\u201d However, the Australian government has repeatedly said it will maintain sovereign control of the submarines, including at least three Virginia-class submarines that it will buy from the US in the 2030s. While Aukus has bipartisan support in the US, it remains unclear what version of the legislation will make it to the president\u2019s desk for signing. Menendez said his amendment \u201cstreamlines the export of US military technology, while ensuring that technology is safeguarded from adversarial espionage\u201d. \u201cI look forward to working with my colleagues in both the Senate and House to pass this bill which will cement the Aukus partnership for decades to come,\u201d he said in a statement last week. Aukus will be on the agenda when Blinken and the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, travel to Australia for annual talks with foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, and defence minister, Richard Marles. The meeting will be held in Brisbane late next week. Marles and Austin are due to travel to north Queensland afterwards to watch troops participating in the Talisman Sabre exercise. Marles told ABC TV on Wednesday there had been \u201ca significant move forward in terms of force posture initiatives in Australia\u201d, including the planned rotation of US submarines in Western Australia from 2027."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b22385", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jul/19/tesla-q2-2023-earnings-production-report-elon-musk", "primaryCategory": "technology", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Tesla beats Wall Street expectations to produce record number of vehicles", "lead": "Report comes amid concerns Elon Musk, who owns SpaceX, Neuralink and Twitter, is spread too thin", "author": "Kari Paul", "datePublished": "2023-07-19 23:44:30", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.231762", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/8617036ff530d89ef9f4fba25c2366c10b636ddc/0_0_7488_4495/500.jpg", "body": "Tesla narrowly beat Wall Street expectations in the second quarter of 2023, but shares began to fall in after hours trading following an earnings call that offered shareholders little reassurance surrounding Tesla\u2019s promised Cybertruck release and other production concerns. Revenue for the quarter topped $24.97bn compared with analyst predictions of $24.7bn. The report comes after Tesla slashed costs for its most popular vehicle models and drove a major increase in sales. Earnings were $0.91 a share compared with estimates of $0.79. Investors were closely watching Tesla\u2019s gross margins, monitoring if they were negatively affected by the company\u2019s move to decrease consumer prices. The gross margin for the quarter was at 18.2% \u2013 representing a four-year low for Tesla but still higher than analyst expectations of 17.5%. \u201cDespite lower car prices, the company managed to mitigate the already-expected decline in margins, showcasing Elon Musk\u2019s adeptness at steering the company through both prosperous and challenging times,\u201d said Thomas Monteiro, a senior analyst at financial analysis site Investing.com. Tesla produced 460,211 Model 3 compact cars and Model Y sport-utility vehicles \u2013 its mass-market models \u2013 compared with 345,988 in the same quarter last year and 19,489 deliveries of its Model S and Model X premium vehicles, compared with 16,411 at the same time last year. Tesla shares initially rose marginally in after-hours trading following the promising report. But investors, who have been anxious for updates about Tesla\u2019s Cybertruck model, may have been underwhelmed by executive responses about the sci-fi-inspired vehicle on the call. The truck was announced in 2019 and has yet to reach the market. Earlier this week, Tesla posted an image on social media celebrating \u201cthe first Cybertruck built at Giga Texas!\u201d But Musk said on the call that the company had only produced a \u201crelease candidate\u201d model of the Cybertruck and that the vehicle is still in \u201ctooling\u201d phase. Musk reiterated that the model was on track for initial deliveries in 2023 and \u201chigh volume\u201d distribution in 2024. As is typical with Tesla earnings calls, Musk rattled off a number of lofty goals. In addition to stating the Cybertruck would be released by the end of the year, he said he saw a path to a \u201cfive or 10 times increase in valuation of Tesla\u201d over time. He promised Tesla\u2019s self-driving technology would be \u201c10 times \u2013 possibly 100 times \u2013 safer than a human driver\u201d. He also said Tesla was in talks with a major automaker about licensing the company\u2019s full self-driving technology. \u201cThis is a big deal,\u201d he said in a follow up tweet about the announcement. Such a move would not be unprecedented, as Nissan, Ford and GM have partnered with Tesla to share the company\u2019s electronic vehicle chargers in the past year. Musk argued that Tesla\u2019s artificial intelligence capabilities would create a full self-driving vehicle technology that would be difficult to compete with, opening the market for AI-focused partnerships. With shares falling in after-hours trading, it seems that participants on the call were perhaps not won over by Musk\u2019s promises. Shareholders have previously expressed concern that Musk, who also owns SpaceX, Neuralink and Twitter, is stretched too thin in his leadership role. Musk announced the creation of yet another company this month, xAI, which he described as a \u201cpro-humanity\u201d artificial intelligence firm that will develop technology to be integrated at both Twitter and Tesla. AI was a large focus of the earnings call, after Tesla said in its Wednesday report that to reach its goal of fully-autonomous vehicles, it must develop \u201cfour main pillars\u201d at scale: \u201cextremely large real-world datasets, neural net training, vehicle hardware and vehicle software\u201d. In keeping with this goal, the company said it was starting production of Dojo \u2013 its neural net training computer that Musk first announced in 2021. Musk said in the call on Wednesday he anticipates Tesla will spend more than $1bn in the next year on Dojo, adding to concerns about the company\u2019s expenditures and its gross margin."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b22386", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/19/watch-matildas-vs-ireland-live-stream-womens-world-cup-2023-australia-where-when-27-july-how-to-what-time-tv-channel-7-full-schedule-streaming-7plus-every-game-optus-sport-fixtures", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "How to watch Matildas vs Ireland game tonight: where and what time to live stream matches at the Women\u2019s World Cup 2023 in Australia", "lead": "Everything you need to know about the 2023 Women\u2019s World Cup, including where to follow Australia\u2019s games live and what time they kick off", "author": "Jo Khan", "datePublished": "2023-07-19 23:25:56", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.231781", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/17f5d3052765c23ef7cc86130e26f153ada79825/0_376_6000_3600/500.jpg", "body": "It has been a long wait since Australia and New Zealand were announced back in 2020 as co-hosts for the 2023 Women\u2019s World Cup, but the tournament is finally about to kick off. With the opening ceremony and first game taking place in Auckland today before the Matildas kick off their campaign in Sydney tonight, here is how you can follow the tournament in Australia. When and where is the Women\u2019s World Cup? Sticking with the standard mid-year time slot \u2013 albeit in the middle of the southern hemisphere\u2019s winter \u2013 the ninth iteration of the women\u2019s tournament runs from 20 July to 20 August. But more importantly, it\u2019s here, on Australian soil. Despite the exciting prospect of watching games in person, the real benefit of winning hosting rights is not having to disrupt your circadian rhythm in order to follow it. No more dragging yourself bleary-eyed out of bed at 3am to watch an international football match. You may, of course, find yourself a little shabby the next morning depending on the result from the night before. Previous Women\u2019s World Cups have been held in summer or autumn but this year\u2019s competition is in the middle of winter. However, the impact of wintery conditions is going to vary across the nine host cities. This World Cup has a big geographical spread of locations, stretching from Perth in Western Australia to Hamilton on New Zealand\u2019s north island. In July last year Brisbane experienced an average daily maximum of 20C, whereas that was 14C in Melbourne. There are six stadiums in Australia and four in New Zealand across nine cities. Proceedings will start at Eden Park in Auckland with the opening ceremony at 5pm AEST on 20 July, immediately after which co-hosts New Zealand will get the ball rolling against Norway. The Matildas take on Ireland at Stadium Australia later that evening. It is the first edition of the tournament to feature 32 nations, resulting in a total of 64 matches. When are the Matildas\u2019 Group B fixtures and what time do they kick off? Australia v Ireland \u2013 20 July, 8pm AEST, Stadium Australia, Sydney Australia v Nigeria \u2013 27 July, 8pm AEST, Brisbane Stadium Australia v Canada \u2013 31 July, 8pm AEST, Melbourne Rectangular Stadium If the Matildas finish first or second in their group they will move through to the knockout stages of the tournament, playing their round of 16 match on 7 August. The quarter-finals are scheduled for 11 and 12 August and the semis 15 and 16 August. We\u2019ve outlined Their potential pathway to lifting the trophy here, and you can find all the details about who is playing in our team guides and player guides. The Matildas face a tricky path if they are to go all the way to the final on 20 August. How can I watch and follow the Women\u2019s World Cup in Australia? The Guardian will have extensive coverage of the tournament, including minute-by-minute live blogs of every single one of the 64 games, plus match reports, player ratings, analysis, features, day-to-day news, regular episodes of the Women\u2019s Football Weekly podcast throughout the tournament and twice-weekly Moving the Goalposts newsletters. The Guardian also has in-depth guides to every team, including the Matildas. If you want to watch the football on a screen, Seven will be broadcasting 15 \u201ckey matches\u201d \u2013 including all Matildas games \u2013 on free-to-air TV and on their streaming platform 7plus. Optus Sport is where you will find all 64 matches, but for a fee. A free account will get you match highlights, scores and news, but a paid plan is required to access live matches and replays. Monthly plans start at $6.99 for Optus customers, and $24.99 for everyone else. Missed out on a ticket? You can still watch live and free at fan sites All nine host cities in Australia and New Zealand will have live sites that will screen matches. The sites, called Fifa Fan Festivals, will be open at different times depending on the fixtures and are free to visit. Local councils are planning to hold live screenings.

On Wednesday, British diplomats requested that the European Council president, Charles Michel, \u201cclarify\u201d the bloc\u2019s position.

In a move welcomed by bereaved families who have fought for the law to be changed, the proposals announced on Thursday will seek to lengthen the prison sentences for abusers who kill by creating a new aggravating factor for murder at the end of a relationship. An independent review of domestic homicide sentencing by Clare Wade KC published in March found that sentencing does not take into consideration that many domestic murders happen after years of abuse. There will also be additional protection for women who kill abusers, with the introduction of a mitigating factor for cases where the perpetrator has been subjected to a campaign of controlling behaviour. The government is also seeking to increase the minimum sentence for murders inside the home which use a weapon found at the scene. Currently, if a killer uses a weapon found in the home the tariff is 15 years, while a woman murdered in a park by a weapon brought from elsewhere would get 25 years. Research shows that around one in four homicides are committed by a current or former partner or relative. \u201cMurder is murder. Nobody has a right to take somebody else\u2019s life. So why do we have these different sentencing starting points?\u201d said Carole Gould, whose 17-year-old daughter Ellie was killed by another sixth-former the day after she ended their relationship in 2019. Gould who campaigns as part of Killed Women, a campaigning organisation led by families of women killed by men, added: \u201cAfter five years of feeling like we\u2019re getting nowhere, this feels like a big leap forward.\u201d The government is also asking the the Law Commission to review the use of defences in domestic homicide cases and whether the law sufficiently recognises when a victim of domestic abuse acts in self-defence. The Wade review suggested the use of defences \u2013 such as the partial defences of \u201closs of control\u201d and \u201cdiminished responsibility\u201d \u2013 in domestic homicide cases are more successful when used by men rather than women. The news was welcomed by Hetti Barkworth-Nanton, the best friend of Joanna Simpson, who was killed by her estranged husband Robert Brown, a British Airways captain, in 2010. Brown was acquitted of murder in May 2011, having admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility, which would not have been possible if the proposed changes were in place, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s often said that there should be no excuse for domestic abuse and these new reforms will ensure that,\u201d said Barkworth-Nanton, co-founder of the Joanna Simpson Foundation which is campaigning to keep Brown behind bars. \u201cWe are by no means across the line and we will continue to campaign and lobby the lord chancellor to ensure substantive changes will happen and quickly.\u201d Previously the government announced a public consultation on making a history of abusive, coercive or controlling behaviour or use of excessive violence, known as overkill, aggravating factors in sentencing decisions for murder. The lord chancellor and justice secretary, Alex Chalk KC, said: \u201cCowards who murder their partners should face the full force of the law. Our reforms will give judges the power to punish murderers for the added pain and trauma they inflict through \u2018overkill\u2019 as well as ensuring that those who coercively control their victims or kill them at the end of a relationship face longer behind bars.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b22389", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jul/20/tiktok-is-the-most-popular-news-source-for-12-to-15-year-olds-says-ofcom", "primaryCategory": "technology", "subCategories": "test", "title": "TikTok is the most popular news source for 12 to 15-year-olds, says Ofcom", "lead": "Algorithm-driven viral video app overtakes YouTube and Instagram as most used single source of news for young teenagers", "author": "Hibaq Farah UK technology reporter", "datePublished": "2023-07-19 23:01:13", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.231836", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/b5eebaa43c58baf1a7048cd992dd5a7cbca666b8/0_85_3000_1802/500.jpg", "body": "TikTok has become the most popular news source for 12 to 15-year-olds, according to the UK\u2019s communications watchdog.

TikTok\u2019s popularity is driven by a powerful algorithm which curates what people see on their screen, as well as an effective search function that has made the app a captivating platform for young \u2013 as well as older \u2013 users.

Ofcom found that 16 to 24-year-olds are 30% more likely to consume news via social media on their phones than adults and are more likely to consume news online than adults. The study showed that young people in this age group are also less likely to head to traditional news websites (6% v 26%) when compared with adults and are more likely to head to social media. For instance, Instagram is the most used single news source for young people at 44%, though BBC One was tied with Facebook at 33%. The study also showed that TikTok as a news source has become more popular among adults, with one in every 10 adults using it to keep up with news \u2013 overtaking BBC Radio 1 and Channel 5 for the first time. For adults, the study revealed that broadcast TV news is the most popular source, used by 70% of UK adults. BBC One remains the most used news single source across all platforms, followed by ITV.

The Royal Institute of British Architects has created the new prize to encourage architects to pour their creativity into refurbishing existing buildings, rather than demolishing them in favour of new-build. If developers replace an existing building with a new one, vast amounts of CO2 are created to make the bricks, cement and steel for the replacement. If instead they can reshape the interior of the existing building while keeping the shell intact, emissions are greatly reduced. The shortlist for the Reinvention prize is: Holborn Community Association in London, where a cramped inner London site was transformed; Houlton School in Rugby, a former historic radio station turned secondary school; Museum of the Home in London, a repurposing of a building previously scheduled for demolition; and University of Wolverhampton School of Architecture and Built Environment where old buildings were revitalised to form part of a modern campus. The award is recognition of a new trend. So far, architects have mainly focused on operational carbon \u2013 the pollution caused from heating and powering a building. Knocking down a building with poor insulation and replacing it with a more energy-efficient newbuild property may seem an obvious improvement. But the new-build causes large amounts of carbon embodied in the fabric, thereby undermining the green credentials of the replacement. This is especially true if architects achieve high values of heat and energy conservation in the new-build by using materials with high embodied carbon \u2013 such as steel and cement. The ideal project, according to Riba\u2019s new thinking, is to take an old, leaky building and improve its operational performance by using low-carbon materials such as timber, which actually locks up carbon for the future as the trees grow. Experts have now produced a pyramid of carbon intensiveness for materials, with aluminium at the top and natural materials such as wood at the bottom. The new prize was championed by outgoing Riba president, Simon Allford, who said: \u201cWe have a collective responsibility as architects to minimise our impact on the planet\u2019s resources and maximise the societal and economic benefits of our work. The inventive reuse of buildings is critical to reducing carbon emissions and, whilst often not the simplest solution, requires exceptional creativity and vision \u2013 I look forward to seeing some inspiring examples in due course.\u201d The UK government is lagging on obliging firms to calculate embodied carbon. Holland imposed a duty on developers to declare it in their building data in 2013. France followed in 2021. The UK is considering including it in building regulations for 2025. Marion Baeli from architects Studio PDP said the profession was struggling to adjust to the latest thinking on energy in buildings. She said: \u201cPeople have leapfrogged from the old situation of not taking any notice of energy related to buildings. Now they have become so carbon-literate and missionary about the operational emissions of a building that they are not focused on the really important aspect \u2013 the material. \u201cAnd there\u2019s another problem. Some architects aren\u2019t worrying too much about energy use in buildings because the grid will soon be zero-carbon, so the architects can wash their hands of the problem. \u201cThat just isn\u2019t right. We need to be making sure that the energy use over the life of the building needs to be best possible. Buildings will be emitting for decades \u2013 and we need to take pressure off the grid which will be used for factories and cars and heating.\u201d Roger Harrabin is former BBC Environment Analyst and was a judge on the Reinvention award.

The best lines include Lisbon-Porto and Madrid-Barcelona for domestic travel, and Berlin-Prague, Zurich-Vienna and Prague-Budapest for international travel. None of the top international train lines involved the UK, France, Spain or Italy. Overall, the study was \u201cwell done\u201d and considered complexities in the system such as the time of booking, said Stefan G\u00f6ssling, a professor at Linnaeus University in Sweden who has studied flight emissions. \u201cThat said, the findings do not come as a surprise, as air transport is highly subsidised.\u201d In Europe, airlines pay no taxes on kerosene and little tax on tickets or VAT. Their emissions are only priced for flights within Europe \u2013 at a level below the social cost of carbon. A study published earlier this month by Transport and Environment, a green campaign group, found European governments lost out on \u20ac34.2bn from poor taxation on aviation in 2022. The \u201ctax gap\u201d is set to rise to \u20ac47.1bn in 2025, the report found. \u201cIn short: if you fly, you are subsidised; if you take the train, you are punished by higher prices \u2013 as well as the fact that the journey is often longer,\u201d said G\u00f6ssling. The aviation industry is responsible for about 2.5% of global carbon pollution but releases other gases that heat the planet further. A study co-authored by G\u00f6ssling found only 11% of the world flew in 2018, and at most 4% flew abroad. The International Energy Agency, a Paris-based organisation led by the energy ministers of mostly rich countries, has called on policymakers to \u201ctax aviation according to impact, acknowledging that only a minority of the world flies\u201d. It has also recommended they scale up sustainable aviation fuels. Greenpeace demanded that governments introduced \u201cnational, simple and affordable climate tickets\u201d. In 2021, Austria started to sell such a ticket that covered all public transport in the country for the price of \u20ac3 a day. In 2020, Luxembourg became the first country in Europe to provide free public transport. Campaigners also called for the phase-out of airline subsidies. \u201cPlanes pollute far more than trains, so why are people being encouraged to fly?\u201d said Limousin."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b2238c", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jul/20/defence-department-stonewalled-foi-requests-on-politicians-use-of-raaf-vip-jet-fleet-says-greens", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Defence department \u2018stonewalled\u2019 FoI requests on politicians\u2019 use of RAAF VIP jet fleet, says Greens ", "lead": "Morrison government stopped releasing reports on MPs\u2019 use of business jet fleet in 2021, citing unspecified security concerns", "author": "Christopher Knaus", "datePublished": "2023-07-19 23:00:13", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.231894", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/9363e02bc55ba1e53edaa715f1edfcd83fac8d44/795_806_2029_1218/500.jpg", "body": "Australia\u2019s defence department has \u201cstonewalled\u201d freedom of information requests about politicians\u2019 use of its taxpayer-funded VIP jet fleet, prompting a scathing intervention from the information commissioner. In 2021, the former government decided to stop publishing six-monthly reports about politicians\u2019 use of the RAAF business jet fleet, citing unspecified security concerns. The decision, made suddenly and without proper explanation, means the public is blind to how MPs are using the exorbitantly expensive fleet to ferry themselves around the country. It also ended a longstanding practice in place since October 1967, after the so-called \u201cVIP Affair\u201d nearly brought down then prime minister Harold Holt and minister for the air, Peter Howson. Since then, the reports have helped expose the way MPs on both sides of politics have used the VIP flights for questionable purposes, including their use to attend Labor and Liberal party fundraisers, the Melbourne Cup, or between capital cities when normal commercial flights are readily available. The records have also been used to reveal how taxpayers are paying hundreds of thousands of dollars for so-called \u201cghost flights\u201d, where empty private jets are dispatched at enormous expense simply to pick up politicians and return them to Canberra in place of commercial airline travel. The Labor government has so far declined to say whether it will resume publishing the reports on the jet fleet\u2019s use, pointing to an ongoing security review by the defence department, Australian Federal Police, and the department of finance, which began in 2021. The Greens senator David Shoebridge requested details about the aircraft\u2019s use through freedom of information laws last month. The department repeatedly asked for more time to respond to his request, blaming, among other things, the inability of its IT system to produce the information. Shoebridge gave the department repeated extensions, until it went to the information watchdog, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner, to make another request for more time. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup In a decision on 10 July, the OAIC was scathing of the department\u2019s approach to the FoI and ordered that it meet its original statutory deadline for responding to the request, which was 2 July. The OAIC found the FoI request was simple and there was \u201climited available evidence\u201d of defence doing anything to process it. \u201cThe FoI applicant\u2019s request does not appear particularly complex, based on the limited range and number of documents captured by the request and the limited evidence of any technical or practical challenges involved in the processing of the request,\u201d the OAIC\u2019s ruling found. \u201cIn declining this extension, I have also considered the limited available evidence of work undertaken by The Department to process the FoI request to date and limited explanation as to the steps involved, to finalise the request.\u201d The department is yet to act on the OAIC\u2019s decision, nine days later. Shoebridge accused the department of stonewalling. He said the case was a clear demonstration of how flaws with Australia\u2019s FoI system were harming government transparency and questioned how defence was allowed to repeatedly breach statutory deadlines and obligations without any consequence. \u201cThis is information that used to be routinely disclosed but has now, for an unstated reason, become a state secret,\u201d he said. \u201cI understand that this information about extremely costly RAAF flights for members of parliament can sometimes be politically embarrassing, but that must not be the test for failing to disclose. \u201cIt seems pretty clear that it\u2019s politics, not some pretend excuse about IT, that\u2019s delaying the release. To be honest if the RAAF\u2019s IT system can\u2019t punch out a straightforward data report on special purpose flights then heaven help us if it needs to deal with a serious conflict.\u201d The defence department was approached for comment but did not respond by deadline. Defence has also ceased providing details of the flights, thought to cost roughly $4,600 an hour, to the independent expenses watchdog, which has a role in recovering money from the travel budgets of individual MPs where flights are misused."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b2238d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/19/carlee-russell-update-alabama", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Carlee Russell case: Alabama police unveil new details as investigation continues", "lead": "Police say no reports of child wandering along I-495 as questions abound over woman who went missing for 48 hours last week", "author": "Edwin Rios and Edward Helmore", "datePublished": "2023-07-19 22:54:02", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.231931", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/d0d7aff008975e3f89ea9148c2795375dc835eaa/0_84_2506_1504/500.jpg", "body": "On Wednesday, the police chief in Hoover, Alabama, unveiled new details that Carlethia \u201cCarlee\u201d Russell, a 25-year-old Black nursing student, gave to detectives the day she was interviewed, as police continue to investigate what happened after she reportedly vanished for 48 hours. Russell reportedly told police that she had seen a child walking along the side of the road, called 911 as she checked on the child, and screamed when a man allegedly forced her into a car. The revelations, made at a press conference, came two days after Russell\u2019s parents told NBC News in a written statement that they believed Russell had been taken the night of her disappearance and called on police to \u201cpursue\u201d her alleged abductor. The Hoover police chief, Nicholas Derzis, cast doubt on the possibility of an abduction, telling reporters that \u201cwe have no reason to believe that there is a threat to public safety related to this particular case\u201d. He emphasized that police were still investigating what happened during Russell\u2019s disappearance. At 9.34pm on 13 July, Russell called 911 dispatch to report that a child was wandering on the side of I-495, and called her sister-in-law to make a similar claim. During that call, it was later claimed, Russell disappeared. Russell\u2019s disappearance set off a frantic two-day search that captured international attention. Her boyfriend, Thomas Latrell Simmons, said on Facebook that Russell had been \u201cfighting for her life for 48 hours\u201d after she allegedly fended off at least one abductor. In a statement, Russell\u2019s mother, Talitha Robinson, said that a relative had heard Russell scream while on the phone with her, noting that all she heard after that was background noise from the interstate. Police later found Russell\u2019s phone on the ground near her vehicle, and her purse with an Apple Watch inside the vehicle. \u201cThere were moments when she physically had to fight for her life, and there were moments when she had to mentally fight for her life,\u201d Talitha Russell told NBC News. \u201cShe made it back.\u201d Derzis, Hoover\u2019s police chief, noted in Wednesday\u2019s press conference that Russell\u2019s 911 call was the \u201conly report of a child on the interstate despite numerous vehicles passing through the area\u201d at the time. Analysis of her cellphone showed that Russell traveled 600 yards, the equivalent of six football fields, when she was in her car following the child she said had been on the road. \u201cTo think that a toddler barefoot that could be three or four years old could travel six football fields without getting in the roadway without crying \u2026 it\u2019s very hard for me to understand,\u201d Derzis said. Derzis also relayed internet searches that Russell made on her cellphone leading up to her disappearance on 13 July. The searches, shown between the early morning of the day she disappeared and the afternoon, included \u201chow to pay for an Amber Alert\u201d, \u201chow to take money from a register without being caught\u201d, a one-way ticket from Birmingham to Nashville, and queries about the movie Taken, which details a CIA agent\u2019s attempts to rescue his daughter from an abduction. The mystery deepened when Russell returned to her home on Sunday night and someone called police to say she was \u201cunresponsive but breathing\u201d, per AL.com. But when emergency personnel arrived, Russell was up and talking. Neighborhood surveillance video reportedly captured Russell walking home. Derzis said that Russell told detectives she had escaped from her alleged captors, run through woods and emerged near her residence. When police interviewed her, they noted that Russell, who had a tear in her shirt, had a \u201csmall injury to her lip\u201d and claimed that \u201cher head was hurting\u201d, Derzis told reporters. He added that police had met with Russell\u2019s parents \u201con several occasions\u201d but that her parents told police that Russell has so far declined to do a second interview \u201cbecause of the trauma of the incident\u201d. \u201cHer parents are believing what their daughter is saying,\u201d Derzis said. When asked by reporters whether Russell had a history of mental illness, Derzis said \u201cnot that I\u2019m aware of\u201d. He noted that traffic footage showed Russell getting out of her vehicle on the interstate, but after that, only Russell knew what happened. \u201cThere are many questions left to be answered,\u201d he said. \u201cBut only Carlee can provide those answers.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b2238e", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jul/19/private-equity-ownership-of-health-services-care-review-higher-costs", "primaryCategory": "business", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Private equity ownership of health services can worsen care, review says", "lead": "Large-scale global study also suggests buyouts associated with higher healthcare costs", "author": "Andrew Gregory Health editor", "datePublished": "2023-07-19 22:30:12", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.231949", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/988e58e86fff9d773b8f92ae5fc7c8dc994a360d/0_530_7952_4774/500.jpg", "body": "Private equity takeovers of health services worldwide are associated with worse quality of care and higher costs, according to the largest study of its kind. In the past decade, private equity firms have increasingly invested in, acquired and consolidated healthcare facilities. Globally, healthcare buyouts have exceeded \u00a3157bn since 2021 alone. Despite much speculation, evidence about the impact of this rapidly growing global trend has been lacking. Now a systematic review of private equity healthcare service takeovers across eight countries including the US, UK, Sweden and the Netherlands provides it. Private equity (PE) ownership of healthcare services including hospitals and nursing homes is linked to a harmful effect on cost and quality of care, suggests the review published in the BMJ medical journal. The authors of the review, which was led by the University of Chicago, said: \u201cThe most unequivocal evidence points to PE being associated with an increase in healthcare costs. Evidence across studies also suggests mixed impacts of PE ownership on healthcare quality, with greater evidence that PE ownership might degrade quality in some capacity rather than improve it.\u201d No consistently beneficial effects of private equity ownership were identified, the researchers said. \u201cThe current body of evidence is robust enough to confirm that PE ownership is a consequential and increasingly prominent element in healthcare, warranting surveillance, reporting and possibly increased regulation,\u201d they wrote. The researchers identified 1,778 studies, of which 55 met the inclusion criteria. They looked at the impact of private equity takeovers on costs, quality of care and health outcomes. Nine of 12 studies revealed higher costs to patients or the funders of healthcare at services owned by such firms, three found no differences, and none showed lower costs. Private equity ownership was also associated with a mixed to harmful impact on healthcare. Of 27 studies that assessed quality of care, 12 found harmful effects, three found beneficial, nine found mixed \u2013 some measures declined, some improved \u2013 and three were neutral. Health outcomes showed beneficial and harmful results, but the volume of studies for this measure was too low for any definitive conclusions to be drawn. Cat Hobbs, the director of the public ownership campaign group We Own It, said: \u201cThis important new study is sadly no surprise. When vital services are privatised, patients get the worst of both worlds: higher costs for worse quality care. \u201cPrivate equity firms will always put their duty to make a financial return first \u2013 that\u2019s their job. But these incentives are in direct conflict with the public good. Healthcare is not just another investment opportunity. It\u2019s a crucial public service which we all need at some point in our lives.\u201d She added: \u201cPrivate equity ownership in the healthcare sector is on the rise fast, and the public need to know the risks it poses to care quality and access.\u201d David Rowland, the director of the Centre for Health and the Public Interest, a thinktank, said regulators and politicians needed to \u201cget a grip\u201d of how private equity takeovers impact healthcare. He said: \u201cHow one makes the sizeable returns which these private equity funds require from providing care to a child with learning difficulties, for example, is a question which is never asked either by regulators or politicians. But it is clear from this research that squeezing profit from these types of services can put patients and vulnerable people at risk.\u201d Dr Tony O\u2019Sullivan, the co-chair of the campaign group Keep Our NHS Public, said the review provided a \u201cscreamingly obvious piece of evidence\u201d. Policymakers must prioritise public funding and provision of healthcare if they are to avoid \u201cdamaging\u201d consequences for patients, he said."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b2238f", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/19/newcastle-to-snap-up-harvey-barnes-from-leicester-for-38m", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Newcastle to snap up Harvey Barnes from Leicester for \u00a338m", "lead": "Harvey Barnes is set to join Newcastle from Leicester after the two clubs agreed a \u00a338m deal", "author": "Jacob Steinberg", "datePublished": "2023-07-19 21:56:11", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.231967", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/5d6e5815f6437e309ae237fc079bb38a5728f0d5/0_296_5439_3263/500.jpg", "body": "Newcastle are set to sign Harvey Barnes after agreeing a \u00a338m deal with Leicester for the winger.

New York\u2019s Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) board voted to increase the base fares for subways and buses to $2.90 by late August during a Wednesday meeting, the New York Times reported. It is the first time the price of base fares have increased in eight years for the country\u2019s largest public transportation system, as the state-run corporation navigates decreased ridership and shaky finances. The latest price increase of base fares was announced in May, as the MTA board forwarded the proposal in an attempt to boost revenue by 4%, the New York Daily News reported. Transit ridership fell by as much as 90% in 2020, Bloomberg News reported. While ridership has been steadily increasing to the pre-pandemic average, the MTA is still saddled with billions of dollars in debt, expected to hit $52.7bn by 2028. As of May 2023, the country\u2019s eight largest transit systems face a collective budget shortfall of about $6.6bn through the 2026 fiscal year, Bloomberg reports. Several US cities have proposed or implemented fair hikes for their public transportation systems to increase revenue lost as commuting declined during the Covid-19 pandemic, the Washington Post reported. San Fransisco\u2019s Bay Area Rapid Transit (Bart) fares will increase by 11% over two years as the transit system navigates a budget shortfall amid decreased ridership during the pandemic, SFGate reported.

Meanwhile, other cities have eliminated fares, providing free transportation for all riders regardless of income. In Kansas City, buses are fare-free through 2023. Boston has been experimenting with a similar initiative, eliminating fares for some bus lines. In New York, reaction to the announcement has been sharp on social media, as users decried the increase. One user noted that the higher fare would increase the costs of the daily commute to work: \u201c$6 just to get to and from work!\u201d Other users remarked that they were not seeing any improvements with the MTA\u2019s transit system \u2013 such as installing air conditioning on train platforms \u2013 despite the rising cost of using it. \u201cIs the extra $.15 a surcharge for the extra rats?\u201d tweeted one user. Danny Pearlstein, policy and communications director at the Riders Alliance, said the fare hike isn\u2019t necessarily a surprise in New York given the rising costs of many goods and services. The increase was also foreordained in New York\u2019s state budget, he added. But Pearlstein noted that the increase is still felt by riders, especially low-income passengers. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t take the sting out of it for New Yorkers struggling to make ends meet,\u201d said Pearlstein, whose organization is campaigning for New York to expand its Fair Fares program, an initiative that provides subsidized transit fare to low-income New Yorkers. \u201cWe\u2019re calling on Mayor Adams to expand eligibility as much as possible to make the most of New York\u2019s investment in transit equity,\u201d he said."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b22392", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/19/met-police-apologised-daniel-morgan-murder-corruption", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "subCategories": "test", "title": "After 36 years the Met has apologised for failings in the Daniel Morgan murder case.

No one has been convicted of his murder. Over the 36 years since the murder, Daniel\u2019s family have had to endure nine commissioners of the Metropolitan police, culminating in the present incumbent, Sir Mark Rowley. For Daniel\u2019s family, each of these predecessors of the present commissioner came to represent the consistent failure of courage and integrity among the highest ranks in the Met, in the face of the corruption and criminality that has served to protect those responsible for the murder from justice. No family should have to go through what this family have suffered. No family should have to find, as they did, their confidence betrayed by those to whom we should be able to turn for help. No family should be cut adrift as they were \u2013 and left to fend for themselves in the face of the most serious criminality imaginable. No family should have to bear the immense cost they have paid in terms of their health \u2013 mental and physical. Above all, no family should be left to find, as they have, that they are no longer able to place their trust in the police, the state or any other form of authority. It is only right that the commissioner should be obliged to admit the Met\u2019s liability, and acknowledge how Daniel\u2019s family has been torn apart by the way in which the leadership of the organisation and its officers have chosen to conduct themselves. It is right that the Met should finally accept the fact of the \u201ccycle of corruption, professional incompetence and defensiveness that has repeated itself over and over again\u201d. It is right that there should be an admission of the harm done \u2013 to the family and to the public at large \u2013 by the way in which the Met has \u201cprioritised its reputation at the expense of transparency and effectiveness\u201d. Over and above any admission of liability or apology, however, what the Met owes the family of Daniel Morgan \u2013 what all of us owe this family \u2013 is a debt of gratitude for helping to expose the sickness at the heart of the organisation. It\u2019s a sickness this family has had to live with over the decades, where a perceived need to protect the organisation from reputational damage has served only to nurture a culture of impunity among its officers; a sickness that was recognised and identified as \u201cinstitutional corruption\u201d in the Daniel Morgan independent panel report in 2021, and acknowledged now by the commissioner as \u201cmultiple and systemic failings\u201d. Whether and how Rowley and his senior leadership team choose to face up to that sickness and to translate the words of his apology into reality \u2013 to find the courage and the integrity to do so \u2013 is, to put it bluntly, his challenge and his problem. The family of Daniel Morgan have already done more than can reasonably be asked of them. In this context, we might ask: what is it that has kept this family going, through thick and thin, trying to get the Met to do its job in their search for some semblance of justice? How did they keep going when the Met kept failing them over and over again? It is, perhaps, precisely because of who they are, because of their courage and their character, that they insisted upon their entitlement to place their confidence in the Met. They did so again and again, even after that trust was betrayed. That is perhaps why their sense of betrayal was all the more overwhelming. Three generations of this family have already suffered from the inexcusable failure of the Met\u2019s leaders to do what was required over the past three and a half decades. They do not want this burden to be passed on to the coming generations of their family. They want to be able to get on with their lives at long last.

The figures come as strikes from writers and actors have hit the industry \u2013 the first time both unions have walked out since the 1960s. \u201cThis strike is not the outcome that we wanted,\u201d co-chief executive Ted Sarandos said. He said the company hoped to reach an agreement \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d Announcing its latest quarterly finances, Netflix said it had made a profit of $1.8bn over the quarter on revenues of $8.3bn. Analysts had expected Netflix to add around 2m new households over the last three months as people who had shared the service for free opted to pay for their own accounts. Netflix now has 238m subscribers globally. The strike over pay and the use of artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to profoundly affect the industry over the coming months, pausing new seasons of global hits including streaming shows House of the Dragon and The Last of Us and movies including Gladiator 2 and Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part Two. Some analysts have argued that Netflix is better positioned than its traditional media peers to weather the strike. Last year the company lost subscribers for the first time in its history. It has since begun to pick up subscribers again and at the start of the year announced a crackdown on password sharing. According to the company, more than 100m households have been participating in password sharing. This week Deutsche Bank analysts predicted that an increase in \u201cpaid sharing\u201d would boost Netflix\u2019s revenues through 2023 and that the company would also benefit from its backlog of programming, its international audience and its ability to generate hits from overseas \u2013 such as Squid Game and Money Heist. \u201cVirtually all of the headwinds plaguing the traditional TV focused media companies are tailwinds for Netflix,\u201d Deutsche Bank wrote in a note to investors. Netflix has also moved to broaden its income stream, introducing an ad-supported subscription after last year. On Tuesday the company announced it was dropping its cheapest commercial-free monthly plan in the US and the UK, in a push to get more sign-ups for its ad-supported option. The plan had cost $9.99 in the US and \u00a36.99 in the UK and restricted subscribers to streaming HD content on only one device at a time.

Wootton is facing allegations he used a pseudonym to secretly offer current and former Sun colleagues tens of thousands of pounds in return for sexual material Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News UK asked staff to contact its most senior lawyer if they have any information regarding the claims. They promised that all information would be treated in confidence, offered counselling services to anyone affected, and asked employees not to talk to journalists while inquiries were under way. Employees were told: \u201cThe matters reported are obviously very serious and include allegations that certain actions of Mr Wootton may have affected some members of staff at the Sun.\u201d A source at News UK said the company had also employed external legal counsel to advise and assist with its investigation. Wootton also writes a regular column for MailOnline, which usually appears on Mondays and Thursday. The company has said it is looking into the allegations against the presenter and would not comment on whether it would continue to publish his writing. Wootton remains on air at GB News, where he delivered a six-minute monologue responding to the claims on Tuesday night. He admitted \u201cerrors of judgment in the past\u201d while telling viewers he was the victim of a \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d driven by \u201cdark forces\u201d intent on shutting down GB News. The presenter denied any illegal behaviour but he did not directly address whether he had ever sent emails using the name Martin Branning. It is claimed that this pseudonym was used during Wootton\u2019s time at the Sun to approach many serving and former Sun employees with the offer of five-figure sums in return for performing sex acts on camera. The Guardian has spoken to seven current and former Sun employees who say they received emails from Martin Branning \u2013 understood to be a portmanteau of EastEnders characters Martin Fowler and Max Branning. All claim they were offered large sums of money in return for pictures. Wootton\u2019s ex-boyfriend has publicly linked the TV presenter to the Branning pseudonym and Byline Times has also quoted an anonymous former colleague who claimed Wootton had acknowledged his involvement. Wootton has not denied the allegation. The Guardian has not been able to independently establish the link between Branning and Wootton. Wootton confronted the claims head-on on Tuesday night, blaming an ex-boyfriend with an axe to grind and suggesting social media and \u201ccancel culture\u201d had amplified the allegations. The GB News host used his show to warn that \u201crevolting blogs that eschew basic journalism standards\u201d are destroying democracy: \u201cI have been thinking much about the current state of social media, where any allegation can be made in an attempt to get someone cancelled but it is impossible to defend yourself against thousands of trolls.\u201d He said: \u201cI, like all fallible human beings, have made errors of judgment in the past. But the criminal allegations being made against me are simply untrue.\u201d He said: \u201cI mean who doesn\u2019t have regrets? Should I be cancelled for them many years later? Or do you accept that I have learned and changed?\u201d He also urged people to ignore the \u201ccesspit\u201d of Twitter: \u201cSocial media has become a race to the bottom. Pile-ons are now the way to cancel a person. Our country is better than that, we must be \u2013 that\u2019s why GB News exists.\u201d Sources at GB News told the Guardian they felt like there was an \u201cuncomfortable\u201d atmosphere around Wootton\u2019s 9pm show, after the presenter decided to directly address the allegations head on. But he also received supportive feedback from GB News viewers \u2013 and some Conservative MPs \u2013 after his suggestion the allegations were part of a leftwing political campaign.

Not surprised that it has worked so well, or badly, but that it has happened at all. He stares down at his hands, his bat, as though his body has betrayed him, like a rider might look down at a backfiring motorbike or an ill-tempered horse. There is Smith the vessel and Smith the occupant, acting out the concept of dualism for a live studio audience. That was Smith in Manchester yesterday. His first ball of the fourth Ashes Test was unremarkable: short without menace, one to watch sail by. Instead Smith heaved at it, a circular dragging movement like he was halfway down the Amazon and trying to sling a large python over the side of a small boat. Had the bowling been express, that shot might have carried for six. At the gentler pace of Chris Woakes, it was only going to land at deep square leg. A fielder was waiting, but by some stroke of luck Mark Wood was a dozen metres in from the rope, the ball clearing him for four. Smith looked at his hands: what have you done? The appearance of Bizarro Smith is not something new. Those innings bob up. Lord\u2019s at 2019 is the best-known example, after being hit in the neck by Jofra Archer, when Smith returned to the ground to smear three boundaries, leave a straight ball on its way to middle stump, review the lbw and then walk off before the result came in. But you could take Dharamsala 2017, the fourth match of a tough series, when Smith reckoned he had three hours of concentration left in him and laid waste to the fast bowlers early in his 111. You could take Old Trafford 2019, the second innings after his double century, when Smith twitched and quirked and flayed his way to 82 declaration runs. Take Delhi earlier this year, when a player who never plays the sweep played the sweep, missing the length and trapped lbw. Some rash of similar shots from his teammates had infected his system, and again he walked off in bewilderment, trying to figure how the virus had taken hold. In Manchester this time, the first shot was not anomalous. This was a Bizarro Smith day. The back-foot square punch to a wide ball from Stuart Broad, an absurd degree of difficulty at the top of the bounce with hands so far from body. The over of five dot balls from Jimmy Anderson carefully faced, before throwing a cut shot at the sixth so wide that the toe of the bat sent it past gully. The walk across his stumps, then still making sweet contact with a yorker outside leg stump. He was 33 off 34 balls at lunch. Those hands were making their own decisions. The thing is, not-Smith is also a version of Smith, one that may be contradictory to the rest but emerges often enough to be a part of the whole. Previously it has mainly emerged when Smith is overtaxed and overtired, or yes, concussed. His career peaks were built on prodigious levels of concentration, something that needed more than a few days between matches to recharge. Smith these days seems to find that concentration harder to access. He did so for his century in the World Test Championship final, calmly harvesting runs in ones and twos to the leg side at the Oval. He did during his hundred this series at Lord\u2019s, playing tight to the stumps and taking most of his boundaries straight down the ground. Both were all about control. Across this series, his immense Ashes record has kept swelling. After Smith\u2019s 41 in this innings, Donald Bradman is the only visiting player with more Test runs in England. Smith has gone past Viv Richards and Allan Border for a current tally of 2105. He passed Border\u2019s mark for all Ashes runs during the previous match, and on 3269, only Jack Hobbs and Bradman have more. All the same, it\u2019s not like Smith has been ploughing through this series in the way that he did at his best. He hasn\u2019t seemed quite right for some time. In this English season we have seen him get out trying to slog Ravindra Jadeja and Moeen Ali. We have seen a rare instance of him getting out lbw to seam bowling twice in a series. Wood added the second of those in this current match. The runs have come in drips and spurts rather than a stream. It\u2019s understandable. Smith is 34 and has been a long time at the top. Few have operated at higher mental intensity, and that or pure physical reflex can fade. The laser precision of Smith\u2019s hand-eye coordination only needs to have dipped a fraction for his old technique of stepping across his stumps to become fallible. It has already been a long series. If we see Bizarro Smith when regular Steve gets tired, then the question with three innings to play is what Steve has left in the tank."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b22398", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/19/secret-invasion-recap-episode-five-the-tv-equivalent-of-treading-water", "primaryCategory": "tv-and-radio", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Secret Invasion recap episode five \u2013 the TV equivalent of treading water", "lead": "We found out about Gravik\u2019s grand plan, watched Olivia Colman\u2019s character shoot someone \u2013 and yet something was missing.

Only a few, G\u2019iah assured him: Cull Obsidian, Flora colossus (Groot\u2019s species) among them, but he was really looking for something called the harvest. \u201cThe harvest?\u201d replied Fury. looking worried, before getting up and saying he was off to Finland. G\u2019iah, meanwhile, was on her way to see Priscilla (Charlayne Woodard) who could help organise a Skrull funeral for Talos. Falsworth tracked down Dr Rosa Dalton (Katie Finneran), the scientist we saw briefly earlier in the series working on the Super-Skrull machine in New Skrullos. Falsworth was one step ahead, as usual, and after having her man Nigel torch Dalton\u2019s lab, delivered the line of the episode as Dalton\u2019s Skrull husband, Victor (Mark Bazeley), held a gun to his wife\u2019s head, saying he\u2019d rather kill her than betray Gravik. \u201cOh I don\u2019t doubt you for a moment. The males of my species are very similar. If they\u2019re not busy gaslighting you they\u2019re threatening you with murder. It\u2019s what all the podcasts are about.\u201d Falsworth then calmly drew her pistol and shot Victor in the head. G\u2019iah arrived at Fury\u2019s house to meet Priscilla and I couldn\u2019t help but think they trusted each other\u2019s identity a bit too quickly. \u201cYou\u2019re the one they sent to kill me?\u201d Scilla asked. The next time we saw them, they were building a funeral pyre with Talos\u2019s body on the top and talking about how he didn\u2019t like pageantry. That snake Rhodey, meanwhile, was doing his best to talk President Ritson into blowing up New Skrullos which, of course, lies on Russian soil. \u201cEngland is 100% behind us,\u201d he said (which I assume meant Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales were dead against it? Come on, Marvel, England and the UK are not synonymous), while Ritson mumbled something derivative about a strike on Russian soil meaning world war three. \u201cBetter a war than an extinction,\u201d said Rhodey. It was nice to see O-T Fagbenle return as \u201cThe Agent\u201d Rick Mason, the character we first saw on screen in Black Widow, providing Natasha with all the things a super-stealthy assassin type might need. He was on hand again here with a private jet to take Fury to his scheduled meeting with Gravik, who said he\u2019d call the whole thing off if Fury brought him the harvest. We still didn\u2019t know at this point what the harvest was. Back in the Furys\u2019 beautiful home, Scilla explained why she loves her house so much and revealed a lot more about her seemingly blissful life with Fury than she previously had done. A bit more of this might have helped explain how she had lived a lie for all those years. But just as she was getting to the point, a bullet ripped through her tea tray and we were off, into the episode\u2019s most exciting scene as G\u2019iah and Scilla took care of a wave of armed bad guys sent to kill them. I was hoping for a good few minutes more of that. 294km from the Russian border Fury made his way through passport control in Finland and was picked up by a waiting Sonya Falsworth. They swapped a bit of intel, and the bombshell that every Avenger dropped a bit of blood in the battle at the end of Endgame \u2013 \u201ceven Carol Danvers\u201d \u2013 and that people were sent to the battleground in the aftermath to collect that DNA. People \u2026 with abilities. People like \u2026 Gravik. And so the harvest isn\u2019t a super rare pressing of the Neil Young masterpiece, but a collection of DNA samples from the most powerful beings in the universe. Standing by his fake graveside, Falsworth asked a valid question: \u201cFury, why haven\u2019t you called any of your special friends down?\u201d to which he replied: \u201cThis is personal. We can\u2019t keep depending on these superheroes to swoop in and save our asses,\u201d which I think is code for: \u201cThe reasons are budgetary, Sonya, do you know how much it costs to get Hemsworth or Larson these days?\u201d The Bible inscription on his tombstone, about there being no greater love than laying down your life for your friends from John 15:13, makes me think we might be about to witness the last stand of Nick Fury. Overall It was fine \u2026 a little like the series as a whole. Decent performances, solid-enough plot but there\u2019s just something missing. The plot moves between locations too quickly, the character interaction is on the weak side and the action scenes, while consummate and exciting, are far too short. This episode felt like treading water until next week\u2019s finale. Running out of storyline before the end is unforgivable. I feel total redemption is impossible, but please, episode six, give us something. Notes and observations I\u2019m still a big fan of Gravik\u2019s Welsh accent. He\u2019s thoroughly evil, yet I still want him to record an audiobook. I\u2019d say he\u2019s about half a pint of Brains away from calling someone \u201cbutty\u201d. This isn\u2019t Tony Curran\u2019s first appearance in the MCU. He appeared as Bor, Odin\u2019s father, in Thor: The Dark World, and was the person who hid the aether from Dark Elf Malekith. He also starred as Irish mobster Finn Cooley in the second series of Daredevil, where he crossed paths with The Punisher. The name on Fury\u2019s fake passport in Finland was Johannes Kerhonen. The only Kerhonen I can find related to Marvel was a stunt performer in The Incredible Hulk called Henry Kerhonen. We saw Fury\u2019s fake grave in Finland, but the first fake grave of his was seen at the end of Captain America: The Winter Soldier. He says he has them all over the place, but will his next grave be real? The song playing in Falsworth\u2019s car when she picked Fury up from the airport was Audacity by Stormzy feat Headie One. What did you think? Are you looking forward to next week\u2019s finale? Do you think Nick Fury is going to meet his end?

Tuck played 173 games for Richmond Football Club between 2004 and 2013, and later had a brief boxing career, from 2015 to 2017. He killed himself at the age of 38 in July 2020. After his death, he was found by the Australian Sports Brain Bank to have suffered from severe chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), the debilitating degenerative brain disease caused by repeated head trauma and increasingly linked to long-term exposure to contact sports. It can only be definitively diagnosed after death. In his opening remarks at the Victorian coroner\u2019s court on Wednesday, coroner John Cain said that much of the inquest would focus on head trauma in Australian rules football and in boxing, and the opportunities to reduce or minimise the risk of it. \u201cThe inquest is not about blaming individuals. It\u2019s not about finding guilt or liability. My intention is to search for answers, to better understand the prevention opportunities,\u201d Cain told the court. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Dr Robert Cantu gave expert evidence by video-link to the first hearing of the inquest. Cantu is an internationally renowned neurosurgeon and expert in CTE. Cantu said that after reviewing hundreds of documents provided to the court by the AFL, the sport appeared to him to be doing \u201ca very fine job\u201d in managing concussion, in part due to its reference and adherence to the global consensus statements on concussion in sport. Cantu is a member of the international Concussion in Sport Group that compiles these statements, and has been so since its first meeting in 2001. Cantu told the court, however, that there was a \u201cmissed opportunity\u201d for the AFL to focus on prevention of CTE and long-term damage in players from the cumulative effects of both concussion and sub-concussive trauma; that is, the jolts and blows that cause damage to the brain but don\u2019t result in clinical symptoms. \u201cThere was really no mention of CTE and no focus on the effects of repetitive head trauma, and that is something that is a missed opportunity. Since we know that the risk for CTE is related to cumulative head hits, every effort ought to be directed towards reducing the number of hits that one takes over the course of a career,\u201d Cantu said. He referred to the \u201cdramatic reduction in total head impacts\u201d \u2013 an estimated reduction of more than 60% \u2013 accomplished by the American NFL through only allowing less than one full contact practice per week during the season and none at all in the off-season. Severely restricted full-contact training would also be appropriate for amateur, junior and community football codes, Cantu said. Central to the scope of the inquest into Tuck\u2019s death are questions about the connections that might be established between head injuries sustained by Tuck during his football career, his boxing career, and his diagnosis of CTE, and what connections there might have been between CTE and his death. The former player\u2019s widow, Katherine Tuck, had first reported worrying changes in her husband\u2019s behaviour from as early as 2006, with his first neurological assessments occurring in 2008, due to him reporting dizziness and forgetfulness, the court heard. His mental health episodes escalated in severity over the last decade of his life, resulting in multiple admissions to hospital as a psychiatric inpatient. Cain apologised to Tuck\u2019s family for the timing of the hearing, noting that the inquest was opening the day before the three-year anniversary of Tuck\u2019s death. However, Cain said, the timing of the hearing did \u201cput in sharp focus\u201d the importance of the hearing and the imperative to avoid any further delay. The inquest has hit numerous snags over the past three years. The first appointed coroner, Simon McGregor, recused himself in March 2021 because his brother works for the AFL Players\u2019 Association, which had referred Tuck to mental health services. Cain then took carriage of the investigation. The inquest was delayed again in October last year to give the AFL time to finalise their report into the work of their former concussion advisor, Dr Paul McCrory. In April, Katherine Tuck said she would no longer take any further part in the inquest, citing \u201cgrave concerns\u201d about the scope of the inquiry and its ability to deliver \u201ca just outcome\u201d. The inquest continues."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b2239a", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2023/jul/19/trump-jan-6-investigation-biden-2024-election-kennedy-covid-live-updates", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Judge rejects Trump bid to move hush money case to federal court as legal challenges gather pace \u2013 as it happened", "lead": "This blog is now closed.

The letter mentions three federal statutes: conspiracy to commit offense or to defraud the United States, deprivation of rights under color of law, and tampering with a witness, victim or an informant, according to several sources, citing sources familiar with the matter. Donald Trump sought to downplay his legal challenges while railing against special counsel Jack Smith and the justice department, after announcing he had received a letter naming him as the target of the DoJ\u2019s investigation into efforts to overturn the 2020 election. \u201cI didn\u2019t know practically what a subpoena was and grand juries. Now I\u2019m becoming an expert. I have no choice,\u201d he said on Tuesday night. Trump could face a new indictment as early as the end of the week. A federal judge has rejected Donald Trump\u2019s request for a new trial in a civil case brought by E Jean Carroll, where a jury found that he sexually abused her and awarded her $5m in damages. US district judge Lewis Kaplan in Manhattan ruled that the jury did not reach a \u201cseriously erroneous result\u201d and that the 9 May verdict was not a \u201cmiscarriage of justice\u201d. A judge rejected Donald Trump\u2019s bid to move his hush money criminal case to federal court, ruling that the former president had failed to meet a high legal bar for changing jurisdiction. The decision sets the stage for Trump to stand trial in state court in Manhattan as early as next spring, overlapping with the 2024 presidential primary season. Allies of Florida governor and Republican presidential candidate Ron DeSantis are reportedly pressing for a shake-up of his campaign amid financial pressure and flagging poll numbers. His campaign manager, Generra Peck, is \u201changing by a thread\u201d, according to a DeSantis donor who is close to the campaign, after fewer than 10 staffers were laid off last week. Robert Kennedy Jr, a long-shot Democratic candidate for US president, has a long history of racism, antisemitism and xenophobia, and should be denied a national platform, according to a damning report seen by the Guardian. Half a dozen House Republicans would reportedly support a measure to censure George Santos, the Republican congressman whose r\u00e9sum\u00e9 has been shown to be largely fabricated and who has pleaded not guilty to 13 counts of fraud, money laundering and theft of public funds. The Republican-led House in Alabama approved a new congressional map that would increase the percentage of Black voters \u2013 but not by enough, said Black lawmakers who called the map an insult to Black Alabamians and the supreme court. Wesleyan University announced it would end legacy admissions, after the supreme court struck down affirmative action in the college admission process last month. A small number of schools have ended the practice of legacy admissions, including Johns Hopkins, MIT and Amherst college. The department of justice said that it is assessing the situation by the Texas-Mexico border following \u201ctroubling reports\u201d that have emerged over Texas troopers\u2019 treatment of migrants. The Republican-led House in Alabama approved a new congressional map on Wednesday that would increase the percentage of Black voters \u2013 but not by enough, said Black lawmakers who called the map an insult to Black Alabamians and the supreme court. The House of Representatives voted 74-27 to approve the GOP plan, which came after a supreme court opinion last month found lawmakers previously drew districts that unlawfully dilute the political power of its Black residents in violation of the Voting Rights Act. The bill now moves to the Alabama Senate. While Black people make up about 27% of Alabama\u2019s population, only one of the state\u2019s seven districts is majority-Black. The GOP plan does not establish the second majority-Black district sought by plaintiffs who won the supreme court case, instead it increases the percentage of Black voters to 42% in the district, AP reported. Representative Barbara Drummond, speaking during the floor debate, said: This is really a slap in the face, not only to Black Alabamians, but to the supreme court. \u201cOnce again, the state decided to be on the wrong side of history,\u201d Representative Prince Chestnut said. Once again the (Republican) super majority decided that the voting rights of Black people are nothing that this state is bound to respect. And it\u2019s offensive. It\u2019s wrong. Half a dozen House Republicans would reportedly support a measure to censure George Santos, the Republican congressman whose r\u00e9sum\u00e9 has been shown to be largely fabricated and who has pleaded not guilty to 13 counts of fraud, money laundering and theft of public funds. House Democrats unveiled a resolution on Monday to formally reprimand Santos for blatantly lying to voters about his life story. Mike Lawler, Nick LaLota, Anthony D\u2019Esposito, Marc Molinaro, Nick Langworthy, and Max Miller have all said that they would support the Democrats\u2019 resolution, according to an Axios report. With Republicans holding a 10-seat House majority, it could take as few as five GOP defections for the measure to pass. A banal dystopia where manipulative content is so cheap to make and so easy to produce on a massive scale that it becomes ubiquitous: that\u2019s the political future digital experts are worried about in the age of generative artificial intelligence (AI). In the run-up to the 2016 presidential election, social media platforms were vectors for misinformation as far-right activists, foreign influence campaigns and fake news sites worked to spread false information and sharpen divisions. Four years later, the 2020 election was overrun with conspiracy theories and baseless claims about voter fraud that were amplified to millions, fueling an anti-democratic movement to overturn the election. Now, as the 2024 presidential election comes into view, experts warn that advances in AI have the potential to take the disinformation tactics of the past and breathe new life into them. AI-generated disinformation not only threatens to deceive audiences, but also erode an already embattled information ecosystem by flooding it with inaccuracies and deceptions, experts say. Read the full story here. A judge has rejected Donald Trump\u2019s bid to move his hush money criminal case to federal court, ruling that the former president had failed to meet a high legal bar for changing jurisdiction. US district judge Alvin Hellerstein\u2019s decision sets the stage for Trump to stand trial in state court in Manhattan as early as next spring, overlapping with the 2024 presidential primary season, AP reported. Manhattan prosecutors charged Trump with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to hide reimbursements made to his then fixer, Michael Cohen, for his role in paying $130,000 to the adult film star, Stormy Daniels, ahead of the 2016 presidential election. Trump\u2019s lawyers had argued that the case should be moved from New York state court to federal court because he was being prosecuted for an act under the \u201ccolor of his office\u201d as president. Judge Hellerstein scoffed at the defense claims, finding that the allegations pertained to Trump\u2019s personal life, not presidential duties that would have merited a move to federal court. He wrote in a 25-page ruling: The evidence overwhelmingly suggests that the matter was a purely a personal item of the President \u2013 a cover-up of an embarrassing event. Hush money paid to an adult film star is not related to a President\u2019s official acts. It does not reflect in any way the color of the President\u2019s official duties. The Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, refused to weigh in on whether Donald Trump should face charges over the January 6th insurrection. Arkansas governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders has also reportedly developed a relationship with her former boss Donald Trump\u2019s rival, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. Sanders attended a retreat with prominent DeSantis donors last year, and Axios reports that she has become close to DeSantis\u2019s wife, Casey, since their experiences with cancer in recent years. One senior Republican told the news website: Sarah reached out to Casey during her treatments and the same thing happened when Sarah had her experience. Sanders, 40, is the country\u2019s youngest governor and her allies believe she is positioning herself for a possible presidency run in 2028 or 2032, the report says. Tensions between Donald Trump and his former press secretary, Arkansas governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders, have grown over her neutrality in the 2024 Republican presidential primary, according to an Axios report. The report outlines how Sanders\u2019s team told the Trump campaign that she wouldn\u2019t make endorsement until after her first legislative session in Arkansas. That session ended in May. Sanders is among several Republicans who have so far stayed neutral in the presidential primary, but Trump sees her in a different category because he hired her to be his press secretary and endorsed her when she ran for governor in 2021, the report writes. Trump reportedly asked Sanders for her endorsement in a phone call earlier this year and she declined, according to the New York Times. Trump denied the report in March, writing: I never asked Sarah Huckabee Sanders for an endorsement. I give endorsements, I don\u2019t generally ask for them. With that being said, nobody has done more for her than I have, with the possible exception of her great father, Mike! Three weeks after the NYT story was published, Mike Huckabee, Sanders\u2019s father, publicly endorsed Trump on his TV show. Donald Trump has reportedly been seething about the potential new indictment, as he reached out to his top allies to strategize how they could help defend him against potential criminal charges over his effort to overturn the 2020 election. Trump spoke with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and House GOP conference chair Elise Stefanik, according to sources, CNN reported. The former president\u2019s call with Stefanik, who leads the House GOP\u2019s messaging efforts, was described as a \u201clong conversation\u201d where the two went over plans to go on the offense on alleged weaponization of the federal government, the report says. Trump asked things like \u201cCan you believe this?\u201d and used vulgarities to vent his displeasure, Politico reported. Donald Trump\u2019s rivals have largely shied away from criticizing his legal woes, with most of the Republican presidential candidates choosing instead to portray the former president\u2019s pending prosecution as a perversion of justice. Besides Chris Christie and Asa Hutchinson, who have long made clear their view that Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the 2020 election should disqualify him from reelection, there was no discernible movement within the former president\u2019s party against him, according to a NBC report. \u201cThis could be different,\u201d said Terry Sullivan, who served as campaign manager for Florida Senator Marco Rubio\u2019s 2016 GOP presidential bid. Now that being said, Mission Impossible 9 could be different than the first eight Mission Impossibles, but it\u2019s unlikely. It\u2019s likely to end the same way the first eight did. Trump\u2019s rivals boxed themselves in on the former president, the January 6 insurrection and the criminal charges against him, the report continues. That won\u2019t change unless there\u2019s a massive shift in opinion among Republican primary voters, and Trump\u2019s most prominent rivals are in no position to try to lead such a movement because they already have weighed in on the indictments and Jan. 6. A group of 200 lawmakers said they have agreed not to intervene if UPS workers go on strike, Reuters reports. The world\u2019s biggest package delivery firm and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters have until midnight on 31 July to reach a contract deal covering some 340,000 workers that sort, load and deliver packages in the United States. \u201cWe are hopeful that both sides can negotiate in good faith and reach a consensus agreement,\u201d the lawmakers said, adding if no deal is reached they have committed to respect the rights of workers \u201cto withhold their labor and initiate and participate in a strike.\u201d UPS workers are currently calling for better pay, more full-time jobs and better workplace health and safety conditions. Despite UPS tentatively agreeing to make Martin Luther King Jr Day a holiday and to install ACs in more of its trucks as temperatures rise, the union for UPS workers said that the company had not agreed to all of its demands. Should a strike happen, Bloomberg estimates that the company could lose a staggering $170m a day. For further details on how likely a UPS workers strike is, click here: The department of justice said that it is assessing the situation by the Texas-Mexico border following \u201ctroubling reports\u201d that have emerged over Texas troopers\u2019 treatment of migrants. Speaking to CNN, DoJ spokesperson Xochitl Hinojosa said, \u201cThe department is aware of the troubling reports, and we are working with DHS and other relevant agencies to assess the situation.\u201d Earlier this week, the Houston Chronicle reported email exchanges between a trooper and a superior over alleged mistreatment of migrants crossing the border. The emails alleged that officers working along the border have been ordered to push small children and nursing babies back into the Rio Grande, and have also told to not give water to migrants, despite scorching temperatures. \u201cDue to the extreme heat, the order to not give people water needs to be immediately reversed as well,\u201d the trooper wrote, adding, \u201cI believe we have stepped over a line into the inhumane.\u201d A statement released by Abbott\u2019s office on Tuesday pushed back against the allegations, saying: \u201cNo orders or directions have been given under Operation Lone Star that would compromise the lives of those attempting to cross the border illegally.\u201d Amid speculation about whether or not Rudy Giuliani has \u201cflipped\u201d on Donald Trump in the federal investigation of the former president\u2019s election subversion and incitement of the January 6 attack on Congress, one former Trump White House insider had a somewhat\u2026dry response. The former New York mayor turned Trump adviser and lawyer might have turned on his boss \u201cCause they don\u2019t have happy hour up the river\u201d, the former insider said in a message viewed by the Guardian. Reports of Giuliani\u2019s fondness for alcohol are legion. \u201cUp the river\u201d is, according to Collins dictionary, an American idiom meaning to be sent \u201cto or confined in a penitentiary\u201d. Speculation about Giuliani flowered on Tuesday after Trump announced that he had received a letter naming him as a target in the investigation led by the special counsel Jack Smith. CNN said Giuliani \u201cdid a voluntary interview with special counsel investigators several weeks back\u201d and \u201chis lawyer does not expect him to be charged\u201d. That lawyer, Ted Goodman, said: \u201cAny speculation that Mayor Rudy Giuliani \u2018flipped\u2019 against President Donald Trump is as false as previous lies that America\u2019s Mayor\u201d \u2013 Giuliani\u2019s post-9/11 nickname \u2013 \u201cwas somehow a Russian Agent. \u201cIn order to \u2018flip\u2019 on President Trump \u2013 as so many in the anti-Trump media are fantasising over \u2013 Mayor Giuliani would\u2019ve had to commit perjury, because all the information he has regarding this case points to President Trump\u2019s innocence.\u201d Many observers pointed out that Giuliani, whose law licenses have come under review arising from his work for Trump, may not be out of the woods on the other investigation of Trump\u2019s election subversion, in Fulton county, Georgia. Some further reading: The letter identifying Donald Trump as a target in special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s investigation into the January 6 insurrection could mean that the former president face a new indictment as early as the end of the week. \u201cA third indictment appears to be forthcoming,\u201d Brookings Institution senior fellow Benjamin Wittes posted on the Lawfare blog, adding: It\u2019s reasonable to expect the grand jury to act as early as the end of this week. The Republican governor of New Hampshire, Chris Sununu, has announced he will not be running for re-election next year. Wesleyan University announced it would end legacy admissions, after the supreme court struck down affirmative action in the college admission process last month. In a statement on Wednesday, university president Michael Roth said legacies \u2013 a practice that favors relatives of alumni \u2013 had played a \u201cnegligible role\u201d in the school\u2019s admission process for many years. He added: Nevertheless, in the wake of the recent Supreme Court decision regarding affirmative action, we believe it important to formally end admission preference for \u2018legacy applicants\u2019. Relatives of Wesleyan alumni will continue to be admitted to the school \u201con their own merits\u201d, Roth said. Legacy admissions came under fire after the nation\u2019s highest court ruled that schools could not give preferential treatment to applicants based on race or ethnicity. A small number of schools have ended the practice, including Johns Hopkins, MIT and Amherst college. News that Donald Trump may imminently face another indictment drew shrugs from some Republicans and a muddled response from his rivals, according to a New York Times report. The former president\u2019s indictments, past and pending, are becoming the background music of the 2024 presidential campaign, the paper writes. At one Republican congressional fund-raising lunch on Tuesday in Washington, the news of a likely third Trump indictment went entirely unmentioned, an attendee said. Some opposing campaigns\u2019 strategists all but ignored the development. E Jean Carroll\u2019s lawyer, Robbie Kaplan, has released a statement following the judge\u2019s decision to deny Donald Trump\u2019s request for a new trial. The statement reads: Now that the court has denied Trump\u2019s motion for a new trial or to decrease the amount of the verdict, E Jean Carroll looks forward to receiving the $5 million in damages that the jury awarded her in Carroll II. \u201cCarroll II\u201d is how lawyers in the case refer to the May lawsuit that resulted in a jury finding Trump liable for sexually abusing and defaming the writer and awarded her $5m in damages. Donald Trump sought to downplay his legal challenges while railing against special counsel Jack Smith and the justice department, after announcing he had received a letter naming him as the target of the DoJ\u2019s investigation into efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Trump, headlining a Republican county meeting in eastern Iowa on Tuesday night, attacked federal investigators as he tried to make light of what could be his third criminal indictment since March. He said: I didn\u2019t know practically what a subpoena was and grand juries. Now I\u2019m becoming an expert. I have no choice. Trump also taped an interview on Tuesday night with Fox News host Sean Hannity, who opened the town hall event by saying that the former president didn\u2019t seem to be bothered by \u201cnever-ending attacks\u201d. \u201cIt bothers me,\u201d Trump replied, adding: It\u2019s a disgrace what\u2019s happening to our country. The letter to Donald Trump by special counsel Jack Smith identifying him as a \u201ctarget\u201d in the justice department\u2019s investigation into the January 6 insurrection listed the federal statutes under which the former president could be charged, according to multiple reports. Trump announced on Tuesday morning that his attorneys handed him a letter from Smith as he was having dinner on Sunday night. Posting to his Truth Social website, Trump wrote: Deranged Jack Smith, the prosecutor with Joe Biden\u2019s DOJ, sent a letter \u2026 stating that I am a TARGET of the January 6th Grand Jury investigation, and giving me a very short 4 days to report to the Grand Jury, which almost always means an Arrest and an Indictment. The letter indicates that a new indictment of the former president could be imminent. It mentions three federal statutes: conspiracy to commit offense or to defraud the United States, deprivation of rights under color of law, and tampering with a witness, victim or an informant, according to ABC and the Wall Street Journal, citing sources familiar with the matter. The context surrounding the statutes cited in the target letter is unclear, and their citation in the letter does not necessarily mean that Trump will be charged with related counts. There are no additional details in the letter and it does not say how Smith\u2019s office claims Trump may have violated the statutes listed, sources told ABC. Allies of Florida governor and Republican presidential candidate Ron DeSantis are pressing for a shake-up of his campaign amid financial pressure and flagging poll numbers. DeSantis has reduced campaign staff as his campaign has struggled to meet fundraising goals, as he lags substantially in second place behind former president Donald Trump. Fewer than 10 staffers were laid off last week, according to an anonymous staffer, reported Politico. His campaign manager, Generra Peck, is also \u201changing by a thread\u201d, according to a DeSantis donor who is close to the campaign, reported NBC. Some allies have communicated that they want DeSantis to fire Peck or demote her, according to two other sources. One donor told the news channel: It is the chatter among donors, and it extends beyond the first rung of the bundler class. Money people are losing confidence quickly. It\u2019s time for that kind of change. It\u2019s time for a shake-up at the top. The idea that more shake-ups within the campaign is widely held among Republicans, according to conversations NBC had with strategists and donors. Even in DeSantis\u2019s home state of Florida, Trump still has a 20-point lead over the governor, according to a recent Florida Atlantic University poll. Wisconsin\u2019s top elections administrator was interviewed this spring by federal investigators as part of the special counsel\u2019s probe into the 2020 election, NBC reported. Meagan Wolfe, the Wisconsin elections commission administrator, answered questions from the FBI and justice department officials in person in April, according to her spokesperson. Election leaders in Wisconsin\u2019s two largest cities, Milwaukee and Madison, have also spoken with investigators as part of the justice departments probe. Investigators working for special counsel Jack Smith have interviewed officials from all seven battleground states targeted by Donald Trump and his allies as they sought to overturn the 2020 election results, according to CNN. In a 59-page decision rejecting Donald Trump\u2019s request for a new trial in a civil case brought by E Jean Carroll, a federal judge said the jury\u2019s May verdict was not seriously erroneous or a serious miscarriage of justice. \u201cThere is no basis for disturbing the jury\u2019s sexual assault damages,\u201d US district judge Lewis Kaplan in Manhattan wrote in his ruling. And Mr. Trump\u2019s arguments with respect to the defamation damages are no stronger. Carroll\u2019s lawsuit, filed in 2022, said Trump raped her in a dressing room at the Bergdorf Goodman department store in New York in the mid-1990s, and defamed her by denying it happened. On 9 May, a jury found Trump had sexually abused Carroll. The former president\u2019s lawyers said the jury\u2019s $2m award for the sexual abuse portion of the verdict was \u201cexcessive\u201d because the jury had found that Carroll was not raped. Judge Kaplan ruled: The definition of rape in the New York Penal Law is far narrower than the meaning of \u2018rape\u2019 in common modern parlance, its definition in some dictionaries, in some federal and state criminal statutes, and elsewhere. The finding that Ms. Carroll failed to prove that she was \u2018raped\u2019 within the meaning of the New York Penal Law does not mean that she failed to prove that Mr. Trump \u2018raped\u2019 her as many people commonly understand the word \u2018rape.\u2019 Indeed, as the evidence at trial recounted below makes clear, the jury found that Mr. Trump in fact did exactly that. The reality of conducting pre-trial proceedings under Cipa is that Cannon\u2019s trial date still has the potential to be pushed back. In the prosecution of former NSA analyst Reality Winner, the trial date was delayed multiple times during the discovery phase. The consequences of an extended delay could be far-reaching. If the case is not adjudicated until after the 2024 election and Donald Trump is re-elected, he could try to pardon himself or direct the attorney general to have the justice department drop the case. Ahead of the pre-trial conference, Trump\u2019s lawyers Todd Blanche and Chris Kise argued in court filings that Cannon should not bother setting a tentative trial date until the major pre-trial motions were finished because they could not know how long classified discovery might take. The Trump legal team also claimed that going to trial before the 2024 presidential election \u2013 prosecutors have outlined a schedule for a trial date in December \u2013 would be unrealistic because of supposed challenges in selecting an impartial jury. In their reply last week, prosecutors took aim at Trump\u2019s arguments for an indefinite delay, rejecting the claims that the charges touched on novel legal issues or that the discovery process was uniquely complex. \u201cThe defendants are, of course, free to make whatever arguments they like for dismissal,\u201d the prosecutors wrote. \u201cBut they should not be permitted to gesture at a baseless legal argument, call it \u2018novel,\u2019 and then claim the court will require an indefinite continuance.\u201d The filing took particular issue with the Trump\u2019s lawyers\u2019 suggestion that any trial should be delayed until after the 2024 election because of the supposed difficulty in selecting an impartial jury. Prosecutors wrote: To be sure, the government readily acknowledges that jury selection here may merit additional protocols (such as a questionnaire) that may be more time-consuming than in other cases, but those are reasons to start the process sooner rather than later. In response to pointed questions from US district court judge Aileen Cannon, prosecutors seemed to acknowledge that their timetable for a December trial date was aggressive, although Cannon also separately told Trump\u2019s lawyers she could not indefinitely postpone setting a trial date as they had requested. Trump was charged last month with retaining national defense information, including US nuclear secrets and plans for US retaliation in the event of an attack, which means his case will be tried under the rules laid out in the Classified Information Procedures Act, or Cipa. The statute was passed in the 1980s to protect the government against the \u201cgraymail\u201d problem in national security cases, a tactic in which the defense threatens to reveal classified information at trial, betting that the government would prefer to drop the charges rather than risk disclosure. While Cipa established a mechanism through which the government can safely charge cases involving classified documents, the series of steps that has to be followed means it takes longer to get to trial compared with regular criminal cases without national security implications. Trump and his valet, Walt Nauta, have pleaded not guilty. The pair are currently co-defendants, though Nauta\u2019s lawyer Stanley Woodward said \u2013 in arguing for an indefinite postponement \u2013 he might move to \u201csever\u201d and seek a standalone trial for his client after reviewing the discovery. The federal judge presiding over Donald Trump\u2019s classified documents case signaled that she could delay the trial until 2024, appearing inclined to find that the matter was sufficiently complex after hearing arguments from prosecutors and the former president\u2019s lawyers on Tuesday. The US district court judge Aileen Cannon did not rule from the bench on a timetable during the roughly two-hour pre-trial conference at the courthouse in Fort Pierce, Florida, and concluded the hearing by saying she would enter a written order at a later date. Prosecutors in the office of special counsel Jack Smith, who is overseeing the documents case and the investigation into Trump\u2019s efforts to obstruct the transfer of power, had asked Cannon last week to reject Trump\u2019s suggestion to postpone the trial until after the 2024 election. The dueling requests from Trump and the justice department present an early test for Cannon, a Trump appointee who is under heightened scrutiny for issuing favorable rulings to the former president during the criminal investigation, before they were overturned on appeal. Cannon appeared skeptical of arguments from both sides at the hearing, telling prosecutors she was unaware of any trial involving classified information that went to trial in six months and telling Trump\u2019s lawyers that the 2024 election would not factor into her scheduling decisions. The judge said at issue was whether the documents case was sufficiently \u201ccomplex\u201d \u2013 because of novel legal issues and the volume of discovery materials that prosecutors will turn over to the defence \u2013 to warrant a timetable that would delay pre-trial proceedings beyond December. Former Arizona Governor Doug Ducey, who Donald Trump pressured to overturn the 2020 election, has been cooperating with special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s investigation into the January 6 insurrection, NBC reported. A spokesperson for Ducey yesterday confirmed that Smith\u2019s team had contacted the former governor. \u201cYes, he\u2019s been contacted. He\u2019s been responsive, and just as he\u2019s done since the election, he will do the right thing,\u201d they told CNN. Trump narrowly lost Arizona to Joe Biden by less than 11,000 votes. In a phone call after his defeat, Trump tried to pressure Ducey to find fraud in the state\u2019s election results that would help him overturn his loss, according to sources. Trump also reportedly repeatedly asked his vice president, Mike Pence, to call Ducey and prod him to find evidence to substantiate Trump\u2019s claims of fraud. Pence called Ducey several times to discuss the election, according to sources. Women who sued Texas after saying they were denied abortions despite serious risks to their health are headed to court on Wednesday as legal challenges to abortion bans across the US continue a year after the fall of Roe v Wade. The Texas case is believed to be the first brought by women who were denied abortions since the right to an abortion in the US was overturned, according to the Center for Reproductive Rights, which is representing them. The case before a Texas judge in Austin does not seek to reverse the state\u2019s abortion ban, which is one of the strictest in the country. It instead asks the court for clarity on when exceptions are allowed in Texas, where the women say they were told they could not end their pregnancies even though their lives and health were in danger. One woman had to carry her baby, who was missing much of her skull, for months, knowing she would bury her daughter soon after she was born. Others had to travel out of state to receive medical care for pregnancy-related complications after doctors recommended an abortion. Texas doctors who perform abortions risk life in prison and fines of up to $100,000, leaving many women with providers who are unwilling to even discuss terminating a pregnancy.

Democratic presidential hopeful Robert F Kennedy\u2019s Jr\u2019s wife, Emmy-nominated actor Cheryl Hines, has not publicly commented on her husband\u2019s claim that Covid-19 was \u201cethnically targeted\u201d to \u201cattack Caucasians and Black people\u201d. A spokesperson for the Curb Your Enthusiasm star told the Daily Beast that Hines had received too many \u201cdaily requests\u201d to weigh in on her husband\u2019s comments. The spokesperson instead directed the website to a New York Times profile of Hines published last month, in which she paused for nearly a minute and had no \u201cclear answer\u201d when asked how she and her husband diverge politically. Hines told the paper: I support Bobby and I want to be there for him, and I want him to feel loved and supported by me. And at the same time, I don\u2019t feel the need to go to every political event, because I do have my own career. Hines has publicly disowned her husband\u2019s remarks at least once before. In January 2022, Kennedy went so far as to compare the US under lockdown to Germany under the Nazis, telling a rally in Washington: Even in Hitler\u2019s Germany, you could cross the Alps to Switzerland. You could hide in an attic like Anne Frank did. Hines posted on Twitter that Kennedy\u2019s views were \u201cnot a reflection of my own\u201d, adding that \u201cwhile we love each other, we differ on many current issues.\u201d As the son of former attorney general Robert Kennedy, and nephew of former president John F Kennedy, Robert Kennedy Jr has caused one of America\u2019s most storied political dynasties with his toxic views. In 2019 three relatives wrote an opinion column for the Politico website condemning his anti-vaccine advocacy, which they held partially responsible for a measles outbreak. The Congressional Integrity Project contends that Kennedy is a \u201cRepublican stooge\u201d who is being embraced by the far right in an attempt to damage Joe Biden. He has become a regular guest on Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Fox News and other rightwing outlets. Far-right provocateurs Roger Stone, Steve Bannon, Alex Jones and Michael Flynn have praised him. Now Republicans have invited Kennedy to Congress. On Thursday he is due to address the House of Representatives\u2019 select subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government during a hearing to examine \u201cthe federal government\u2019s role in censoring Americans\u201d. The panel is chaired by Trump loyalist Jim Jordan, who has been criticised for launching bogus investigations into Biden. Kyle Herrig, executive director of Congressional Integrity Project, said: Giving RFK Jr a platform to spread dangerous conspiracy theories and xenophobic and antisemitic rhetoric is a new low for Jim Jordan \u2013 and that says something. Jim Jordan should stop the charade and disinvite RFK Jr immediately. Allowing this hearing to go forward is shameless and beyond the pale. Maga Republicans desperation is on full display this week, proving once again that they have no credibility to conduct legitimate investigations. A federal judge has rejected Donald Trump\u2019s request for a new trial in a civil case brought by E Jean Carroll, where a jury found that he sexually abused her and awarded her $5m in damages. US district judge Lewis Kaplan in Manhattan ruled on Wednesday that the jury did not reach a \u201cseriously erroneous result\u201d and that the 9 May verdict was not a \u201cmiscarriage of justice\u201d. Carroll\u2019s lawsuit, filed in 2022, said Trump raped her in a dressing room at the Bergdorf Goodman department store in New York in the mid-1990s, and defamed her by denying it happened. Trump\u2019s lawyers had argued that the jury\u2019s $2m award for the sexual abuse portion of the verdict was \u201cexcessive\u201d because the jury had found that Carroll was not raped, and that the conduct Carroll alleged did not cause any diagnosed mental injury. The federal judge overseeing Donald Trump\u2019s classified documents case on Wednesday denied the proposed protective order for discovery materials submitted by prosecutors because both sides had not sufficiently discussed the matter. The protective order is needed for prosecutors in the office of special counsel Jack Smith to start making the classified documents that they intend to use at trial available to Trump\u2019s team in discovery. Trump was charged last month with retaining classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago club, including US unclear secrets. As a result, his trial will take place according to the rules set out in the Classified Information Procedures Act, or Cipa. The denial by the US district court judge Aileen Cannon of the protective order \u2013 required under Section 3 of Cipa \u2013 will add another delay to pre-trial proceedings. The complex procedures in Cipa, which exist to protect against the defense threatening to suddenly reveal classified information at trial, means the pre-trial phase takes longer compared to standard criminal cases. Legal experts had always expected Trump to object to the protective order because his team wants to delay until after the 2024 election in the hope that the matter becomes moot if he wins re-election, but for the judge to deny the protective order is unusual. For years, the Congressional Integrity Project\u2019s document says, Robert Kennedy Jr has targeted a particularly dangerous form of vaccine denial at Black people. In 2021 at the height of the Covid-19 vaccination campaign, he released Medical Racism, a film that promoted disproven claims about the dangers of vaccines and explicitly warned communities of color to be suspicious of \u201csinister\u201d vaccination campaigns. Several doctors and experts who participated in the film later denounced it and said they felt used and misled about the message of the documentary. Richard Allen Williams, founder of the Association of Black Cardiologists, called Children\u2019s Health Defense \u201cabsolutely a racist operation\u201d particularly dangerous to the Black community. In 2017, as a measles outbreak devastated Minnesota\u2019s Somali-American community due to low vaccination rates, Kennedy continued to push his false claims that \u201cscience and anecdotal evidence suggest that Africans and African Americans may be particularly vulnerable to vaccine injuries including autism\u201d. In a 2020 interview, Kennedy asserted without evidence that \u201cPeople with African blood react differently to vaccines than people with Caucasian blood. They\u2019re much more sensitive.\u201d The following year, amid the Covid-19 pandemic, Kennedy recorded a webinar encouraging Black people to be skeptical of vaccines, claiming: \u201cThere has been abundant evidence... beyond any dispute that Blacks are disproportionately harmed by vaccine injury,\u201d adding: Blacks react completely differently to vaccines ... we now know it\u2019s just one huge experiment on Black Americans, and they know what is happening and they are doing nothing. Read the full story here. Robert Kennedy Jr, an environmental lawyer, is running against Joe Biden in the Democratic presidential primary and has drawn big and enthusiastic crowds and polled as high as 20%. But the Congressional Integrity Project\u2019s document argues that Kennedy\u2019s recent comments about Jewish and Chinese people, which were quickly hailed by neo-Nazis and Holocaust deniers as \u201c100% correct\u201d, were not an aberration but fitted a long pattern. Earlier this summer Kennedy touted a meeting with Ice Cube, a rapper who issued bizarre antisemitic tweets, and publicly defended musician Roger Waters, who was embroiled in controversy after donning a costume intended to evoke Nazi attire at a concert in Germany. The report says Kennedy has also repeatedly promoted and praised fringe online broadcaster James Corbett, a Sandy Hook and 9/11 conspiracy theorist who has claimed that \u201cHitler and the Nazis were 100% completely and utterly set up\u201d. Kennedy has often allied himself with National of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, who regularly unleashed tirades about alleged Jewish control of media and government. Kennedy met Farrakhan at his Chicago home in 2015, with Farrakhan later tweeting that they discussed \u201ca vaccine that is designed to affect Black males\u201d. The Project details how Kennedy himself has frequently invoked Nazi Germany when pushing debunked theories about vaccines. He put out a video that showed infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci with a mustache reminiscent of Adolf Hitler and used the word \u201cholocaust\u201d to describe children he believes were hurt by vaccines in 2015. Last year, at a Washington rally organized by his group Children\u2019s Health Defense, Kennedy complained that people\u2019s rights were being violated by public health measures that had been taken to reduce the number of people sickened and killed by Covid-19. He said: Even in Hitler\u2019s Germany, you could cross the Alps to Switzerland. You could hide in an attic like Anne Frank did. He later apologised. Robert Kennedy Jr, a long-shot Democratic candidate for US president, has a long history of racism, antisemitism and xenophobia, and should be denied a national platform, according to a damning report seen by the Guardian. Kennedy, who provoked anger last week when he was filmed falsely suggesting that the coronavirus could have been \u201cethnically targeted\u201d to spare Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese people, is due to testify at the US Capitol in Washington on Thursday. The Congressional Integrity Project, a political watchdog, called for Republicans to disinvite Kennedy after releasing a report that details his meetings with and promotion of racists, antisemites and extremist conspiracy theorists. \u201cKennedy embraces virtually every conspiracy theory in existence,\u201d the report states. His horrific antisemitic and xenophobic views are simply beyond the pale, and he has frequently met with and promoted antisemitic conspiracy theorists. Kennedy\u2019s anti-vaccine conspiracies go back decades and have had deadly real world consequences. Good morning, US politics blog readers. The youngest sister of Democratic presidential hopeful Robert Kennedy Jr has joined other members of the Kennedy family in denouncing his claim that Covid-19 was engineered to target some ethnic groups and spare others. In a video published over the weekend, Kennedy Jr was heard saying the virus was \u201ctargeted to attack Caucasians and Black people\u201d while at a recent dinner in New York City. His remarks, also alleging development by China of viruses as a bioweapon, drew accusations of racism and antisemitism and were widely condemned by Kennedy\u2019s relatives and across the Democratic party. Rory Kennedy, the youngest child of the late Robert F Kennedy and a documentary film-maker, told the Guardian on Thursday: My feelings about my brother Bobby\u2019s recent statement regarding Covid and ethnic targeting are very much aligned with my brother Joe, sister Kerry, and nephew Joe III \u2013 all of whom I admire for speaking out against him. There is a great deal of hate in the world and remarks like Bobby\u2019s only serve to fuel that hate. Such conspiracy mongering not only creates more divisiveness, it actually puts people\u2019s lives in danger. Her remarks came after her sister, Kerry Kennedy, described their brother\u2019s comments as \u201cdeplorable and untruthful\u201d, adding: His statements do not represent what I believe or what Robert F Kennedy Human Rights stands for, with our 50+ year track record of protecting rights and standing against racism and all forms of discrimination. Her rebuke was echoed by the Democratic former Massachusetts congressman Joe Kennedy III, nephew of Robert Kennedy Jr, who said his uncle\u2019s comments were \u201churtful and wrong\u201d. Close Kennedy family members weighing in reflects the growing outrage at the words of the businessman who is challenging Joe Biden for next year\u2019s Democratic presidential nomination. Here\u2019s what else we\u2019re watching today: A federal judge is set to hear a challenge to an asylum rule that is a key part of the Biden administration\u2019s immigration policy. Two IRS whistleblowers who claim the justice department improperly interfered with the years-long investigation into Hunter Biden will testify in front of the House oversight committee. 9am: The House will meet before recessing.

Passengers on a Delta flight scheduled to leave Las Vegas on Monday are sounding the alarm on the dangerous conditions inside their plane. The plane was sitting on the tarmac and did not have air conditioning, leaving those inside vulnerable to the scorching heat. In a joint effort with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Vermont\u2019s state government is working quickly to begin the recovery process from last week\u2019s floods that left a trail of destruction. President Joe Biden declared the Vermont floods a major disaster on 11 July, releasing federal funding to eligible affected individuals. Jennifer Morrison, Vermont\u2019s commissioner of the department of public safety, has provided an update on rescues across the state following last week\u2019s devastating floods. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Morrison said that 211 people were rescued from homes, vehicles, trees, a floating hot tub wedged in a tree and a floating dumpster. The extreme heat in the northern hemisphere is putting an increasing strain on healthcare systems, hitting those least able to cope the hardest, the World Health Organization said Wednesday. The WHO said the heat often worsens pre-existing conditions, saying it was particularly concerned about those with cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and asthma. High-water rescue crews pulled people from flooded homes and vehicles in Kentucky on Wednesday, where waves of thunderstorms prompted flash flood warnings. A search continued for two children swept away after torrential rains in the north-east. Egypt will face regular power cuts until the middle of next week as the government limits consumption of gas during a heatwave, the cabinet said on Wednesday. Reuters said residents have reported power cuts in several areas in Cairo this week as temperatures have risen above 40C during a heatwave that has affected southern Europe and north Africa. A few weeks after saying it will curb its low emission zone (LEZ), the new rightwing coalition government in the Spanish city of Valladolid is calling on people to stop using private cars due to high levels of ozone contamination. Hot air from a heatwave affecting southern Europe has caused levels of ozone in the atmosphere to exceed the trigger for calls for less car use for a third consecutive day on Tuesday, the mayor\u2019s office has said in a statement. Coastal waters around Spain have hit a record high temperature for this time of the year, the national weather office said on Wednesday as the country remained on alert due to a heatwave. The average temperature of the water off Spain in mid-July reached 24.6C (76.3F), 2.2C higher than the average for the season, according to the weather office Aemet. As parts of Europe are experiencing a severe heatwave, protesters in Scotland have blockaded two oil sites and claim they aim to \u201cshut down the Scottish oil industry\u201d. PA Media reports that climate activists are present at the Ineos refinery in Grangemouth, on the the Firth of Forth, and the Nustar Clydebank oil terminal in West Dunbartonshire. Greek meteorologists are warning that the worst is still to come as the country braces for a second heat wave in as many weeks. While gale-force winds, which have been fanning fires, are expected to subside climatic conditions that are both extremely hot and dry will ensure that the danger of wildfires persists. That\u2019s it from me, Maya Yang, as we wrap up the blog for today. Thank you for following along. US climate envoy John Kerry has stressed the climate crisis was not just a \u201cbilateral issue\u201d between China and the US but a \u201cuniversal threat to humankind\u201d. Kerry spoke at a press conference during a China visit aimed at reviving climate talks between the two countries. Kerry has been in Beijing since Sunday in an effort to mend ties between the two nations whose climate talks were suspended following a Taiwan visit by Nancy Pelosi in 2022. On Wednesday, Kerry told reporters: President Biden believes, as I think of the world does, that the climate crisis is a universal threat to humankind. And we all have a responsibility to deal with it as rapidly as we can. And we hope we will leave other issues aside. The talks between the US and China are significant because both nations are the world\u2019s biggest emitters of greenhouse gases. Kerry said more meetings with China would take place before COP28 in Dubai in November. Here are images coming through the newswires of the heatwave across the world: Nasa announced leaders and climate experts will meet on Thursday to discuss the extreme weather events. Participants include Nasa administrator Bill Nelson, chief scientist and senior climate adviser Kate Calvin, the Ocean Ecology Laboratory and Goddard Space Flight Center\u2019s chief Carlos Del Castillo, and others. The agency said: From wildfires raging across North America, flooding in the Northeast, heatwaves across the Southwest, and a record hot June, millions of Americans are experiencing the effects of extreme weather, and Nasa is tracking all of it. The heat in the south-west doesn\u2019t seem to be letting up. The region will continue to experience \u201coppressive heat\u201d well into next week, according to the National Weather Service. In other extreme-heat related news, passengers on a Delta flight scheduled to leave Las Vegas on Monday are sounding the alarm on the dangerous conditions inside their plane. The plane was sitting on the tarmac and did not have air conditioning, leaving those inside vulnerable to the scorching heat. One passenger said it reached 111F inside the plane. At least one person was carried off the plane in a stretcher and it was also reported one woman put on an oxygen mask, while others fainted. Passenger Krista Garvis told ABC13, \u201cIt\u2019s just traumatizing at this point.\u201d Garvis said flight crew told passengers over loudspeaker that they had the option of getting off the plane but that they wouldn\u2019t get another flight for days. Delta Airlines is investigating the incident. With millions of Americans having been under extreme heat alerts over the past few weeks, authorities have also urged pet owners to take caution when bringing their pets outside. \u201cWhen the air temp is 86F, the asphalt temp is 135F. To find out if the ground is too hot for your pet, place your hand on the pavement for 10 seconds. If it\u2019s too hot for you, it\u2019s too hot for your pet!\u201d the Federal Emergency Management Agency said on Wednesday. Dehydration signs to look for in dogs include dark urine, lack of skin elasticity, dry, sticky gums and dry nose, as well as sunken and dry eyes. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has warned motorists to avoid flooded areas while driving as devastating floods sweep across the US. \u201cFlooded waters can seem shallower than they are from a distance \u2014 don\u2019t put your vehicle or your life in danger,\u201d Fema tweeted. In a joint effort with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Vermont\u2019s state government is working quickly to begin the recovery process from last week\u2019s floods that left a trail of destruction. President Joe Biden declared the Vermont floods a major disaster on 11 July, releasing federal funding to eligible affected individuals. Fema assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the disaster. Some 331 personnel from Fema are working in Vermont, and 1,980 homes and 144 businesses have been visited by the agency to offer assistance. Vermont governor Phil Scott said those figures are dynamic and only broadly representative of the total damage. The full extent of the impact is yet to be determined, said Scott as he called on Congress for help. We don\u2019t know the total impact, but we\u2019re getting closer \u2026 This is nothing that we can do on our own. Commissioner Emily Hawes, for Vermont\u2019s department of mental health, emphasized the importance of self-care in the wake of a traumatic natural disaster. Our homes roadways and businesses both large and small, have sustained damages that will leave a lasting mark on our communities. Moreover, there are invisible damages. The toll this has taken \u2013 on our neighbors whose lives have been upended, on our brave emergency and essential workers and volunteers dedicating their time to piecing our communities back together. As we come together to rebuild what was damaged and loss, I want to emphasize the importance of prioritizing the well being of our communities. This means addressing the crucial impact of natural disasters on our mental health. Hawes told those affected by the floods can visit https://mentalhealth.vermont.gov/flood to find support. Jennifer Morrison, Vermont\u2019s commissioner of the department of public safety, has provided an update on rescues across the state following last week\u2019s devastating floods. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Morrison said that 211 people were rescued from homes, vehicles, trees, a floating hot tub wedged in a tree and a floating dumpster. The rescues were conducted by boats or by rescuers wading across deep waters, she said, adding that 127 were conducted in the first two days of the flooding. So far, only one death has been recorded. Additionally, 18 animals were transported or rescued from homes and vehicles. Morrison went on to urge residents to continue exercising caution, saying: I want to remind everyone that many injuries and deaths related to a disaster happen after the acute emergency and during the cleanup and recovery phase. Please exercise caution as you go about cleaning up and drying out our residential and business buildings. Household debris has nails, sharp edges and other hazards. Please remember that our waterways have significant debris in them and unusually strong currents. It is not business as usual yet for recreation on around our rivers, streams and lakes. The extreme heat in the northern hemisphere is putting an increasing strain on healthcare systems, hitting those least able to cope the hardest, the World Health Organization said Wednesday. The WHO said the heat often worsens pre-existing conditions, saying it was particularly concerned about those with cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and asthma. The WHO chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said: Extreme heat takes the greatest toll on those least able to manage its consequences, such as older people, infants and children, and the poor and homeless. It also puts increased pressure on health systems. Exposure to excessive heat has wide-ranging impacts for health, often amplifying pre-existing conditions and resulting in premature death and disability. He said the WHO was working with the World Meteorological Organization, its fellow Geneva-based UN agency, to support countries in developing hot-weather action plans to coordinate preparedness and reduce the impacts of excessive heat on health, according to AFP. High-water rescue crews pulled people from flooded homes and vehicles in Kentucky on Wednesday, where waves of thunderstorms prompted flash flood warnings. A search continued for two children swept away after torrential rains in the north-east. The national weather service estimated that as much as 10 inches (25cm) of rain could fall in the area where Kentucky, Illinois and Missouri meet at the convergence of the Mississippi and Ohio rivers. Atmospheric scientists say the global warming responsible for unrelenting heat in the south-west also is making this kind of extreme rainfall a more frequent reality, because clouds hold more moisture as the temperature rises, resulting in more destructive storms, AP reports. There were several reports of people being rescued from high water surrounding homes and vehicles in the Mayfield and Wingo areas early Wednesday, according to Keith Cooley, a senior forecaster with the weather service in Paducah, Kentucky. He called it a \u201clife-threatening situation\u201d because so much rain fell in such a short time. Egypt will face regular power cuts until the middle of next week as the government limits consumption of gas during a heatwave, the cabinet said on Wednesday. Reuters said residents have reported power cuts in several areas in Cairo this week as temperatures have risen above 40C during a heatwave that has affected southern Europe and north Africa. Egypt has an electricity supply surplus after rapidly expanding capacity over the past decade but demand for power, much of it generated by natural gas, rises in the summer as people use more air conditioning. Authorities had begun load shedding, or planned power cuts, after pressure in the gas network fell due to increased consumption, the cabinet cited the prime minister, Mostafa Madbouly, as saying. He said: We are currently in a period of temporary load shedding until the network returns to normal pressures. Just Stop Oil campaigners have marched in Parliament Square in London, as temperatures soar and heatwaves intensify across other parts of Europe. Supporters demand that the UK government \u201cimmediately halt all new licences for fossil fuels\u201d. The campaign group tweeted: \u201cHow many more must die of heatwaves, floods, crop failure?\u201d A few weeks after saying it will curb its low emission zone (LEZ), the new rightwing coalition government in the Spanish city of Valladolid is calling on people to stop using private cars due to high levels of ozone contamination. Hot air from a heatwave affecting southern Europe has caused levels of ozone in the atmosphere to exceed the trigger for calls for less car use for a third consecutive day on Tuesday, the mayor\u2019s office has said in a statement. It said: Combustion vehicles emit pollutants which contribute significantly to the formation of ozone in the atmosphere. It is important that the use of combustion vehicles for private transport is reduced as much as possible so as not to trigger more restrictive measures. Reuters reported that Valladolid\u2019s new coalition government of the conservative People\u2019s party (PP) and far-right Vox, which took power in May after local elections, said it would reduce the city\u2019s LEZ, arguing that Valladolid had low pollution levels. Water management has become a key focus in campaigns ahead of Spain\u2019s general election on 23 July, as a prolonged nationwide drought leaves parts of the south parched and forces farmers and industries to compete for the increasingly scarce resource. Reuters reports that the conservative People\u2019s party, which is leading polls, has promised to pump billions of euros into water infrastructure, as the climate crisis generates hotter summers and drier winters. Coastal waters around Spain have hit a record high temperature for this time of the year, the national weather office said on Wednesday as the country remained on alert due to a heatwave. The average temperature of the water off Spain in mid-July reached 24.6C (76.3F), 2.2C higher than the average for the season, according to the weather office Aemet. AFP reports the figure \u201cfar exceeds\u201d the previous records of 24C hit in 2015 and 23.7C in 2022, and was \u201cunprecedented\u201d for mid-July since current records began in 1940. This situation is even more worrying since the summer is far from over, said Rub\u00e9n del Campo, an Aemet spokesperson. \u201cThere is still room for the sea to warm even more,\u201d he added, referring to Spain\u2019s southern Mediterranean as well as northern Atlantic waters. Temperatures in some spots of Spain\u2019s Mediterranean south-eastern waters have already hit 28C. Helena Smith is in Athens for the Guardian, and reports that the EU has weighed in with help to combat wildfires in Greece, dispatching four Canadair water bombers as the battle to douse blazes that have raged around Athens intensified. AP specifies that three firefighting teams from Poland, Romania and Slovakia are due in Greece on Thursday, while Israel has pledged two firefighting aircraft, adding to the four planes from Italy and France already operating outside Athens. Read Helena Smith\u2019s latest report from Athens here: EU sends water bombers to help fight wildfires around Athens As parts of Europe are experiencing a severe heatwave, protesters in Scotland have blockaded two oil sites and claim they aim to \u201cshut down the Scottish oil industry\u201d. PA Media reports that climate activists are present at the Ineos refinery in Grangemouth, on the the Firth of Forth, and the Nustar Clydebank oil terminal in West Dunbartonshire. The campaign group posted on Twitter: \u201cGrangemouth supplies 90% of Scotland\u2019s oil. We have stopped oil leaving this site, as well as Nustar Terminal in Clydebank. We have no plans to stop. \u201cGroups of people are currently occupying pipework and a fuel silo and blockading terminal gates, while another group has immobilised a car park full of tankers at the Grangemouth facility. No fuel can leave the sites while they are occupied. \u201cThe action is the first in a sustained series of actions, in which the group has vowed to shut down the Scottish oil industry.\u201d The news agency reports that police have been called to both sites. Here are some of the latest images sent to us from Greece, where authorities are battling wildfires. Lorenzo Tondo, the Guardian\u2019s southern Italy correspondent, reports: Temperatures in Sicily hit almost 47C on Wednesday amid the fierce heatwave stretching across the Southern Europe. The peaks were recorded in the area between Mazara del Vallo in the province of Trapani and Sciacca in the province of Agrigento, according to data released by ilMeteo.it and reported by Italy\u2019s Ansa news agency. The Sicilian Federation of Hospitals has called for more home assistance for older people as many cannot leave their houses because of the heat and with health facilities reporting a 20-25% increase in the numbers arriving at emergency units across the country. Sicily\u2019s heatwave is set to be measured against its own record of 48.8C registered in 2021, which is officially considered the highest recorded temperature in Europe. On 17 July, the United Nations\u2019 World Meteorological Organization (WMO) announced that the 48.8C (119.8F) recorded on the monitoring station in Syracuse, Sicily, in 2021 had been verified as the European high-temperature record, against which the current heatwave will be measured. It said: \u201cA committee of experts has verified the accuracy of the temperature reading, but has not yet published the full report. It is possible that this record may be broken in the coming days as the heatwave intensifies.\u201d In South Korea, heavy rain has pummelled central and southern regions since last week. Fourteen deaths occurred in an underpass in the city of Cheongju, where more than a dozen vehicles were swamped on Saturday when a river levee collapsed. In the south-eastern province of North Gyeongsang, 22 people died, many as a result of landslides and swirling torrents, Reuters reports. Zookeepers are also helping animals keep cool with frozen food at the Rome zoo in Italy. I\u2019m sure it is a welcome reprieve from the heat! Authorities in North Macedonia extended a heat alert with predicted temperatures topping 43C, while Kosovo also issued heat warnings, according to AP. Here are some images from the wires showing how people in Beijing are coping in the heat. Many are seen wearing hats to ward off the sun and some have resorted to covering their faces entirely. People in Beijing are sweltering under crippling summer heat on Wednesday as China\u2019s capital kept up a record-breaking streak of four weeks of highs above 35C. The extreme temperatures forced delivery drivers to seek refuge under bridges, residents covered their faces and arms in protective clothing and tourists clasped mini electric fans outside the Forbidden City, AFP reports. Beijing broke a 23-year-old record on Tuesday with 27 consecutive days of temperatures above 35C, the China meteorological administration said. The temperature recorded by Beijing\u2019s benchmark weather station in its southern suburbs soared higher still on Wednesday afternoon to 36.3C. \u201cIt feels like this year is hotter than ever,\u201d Han Weili, a delivery driver, told AFP. The Beijing government has urged elderly people to stay indoors and children to shorten outdoor playtime to reduce exposure to the heat and ground-level ozone pollution, a major component of the smog blanketing the city. Further evacuations were ordered in Greece on Wednesday as wildfires raged near the capital after a second heatwave hit the country, following days of record-high temperatures that baked southern Europe. In a round-the-clock battle to preserve forests, industrial facilities, and homes, evacuations continued for a third day along a highway connecting Athens to the southern city of Corinth, AP reports. Temperatures in southern Greece are expected to reach 44C by the end of the week, in the second heatwave to hit Europe\u2019s Mediterranean south in two weeks \u2013 prompting a renewed warning against extreme summer heat. The UN\u2019s World Meteorological Organization said preliminary global figures showed the month of June to be the hottest on record. The WMO secretary general, Petteri Taalas, said: The extreme weather, an increasingly frequent occurrence in our warming climate, is having a major impact on human health, ecosystems, economies, agriculture, energy and water supplies. This underlines the increasing urgency of cutting greenhouse gas emissions as quickly and as deeply as possible.\u201d At least 11 labourers were killed and five others injured on Wednesday when a wall collapsed during heavy monsoon rains on the outskirts of Pakistan\u2019s capital. Pakistan receives heavy \u2013 often destructive \u2013 rains during its annual monsoon season, which is crucial for agriculture and water supplies. However, studies show global heating is making extreme rain and catastrophic flooding, like the type that devastated Pakistan last year, more likely. The men were crushed to death as they slept in tents next to the bridge that they were constructing in Islamabad. The administration official Nehel Hafeez told AFP: So far the dead bodies of 11 labourers have been recovered while five others have been injured in the incident. The incident took place about 6.20am (0120 GMT) this morning after last night\u2019s heavy rains. Last year, Pakistan was lashed by unprecedented monsoon rains over the summer that put a third of the country underwater, damaging 2 million homes and killing more than 1,700 people. At least 60 people have died in weather-related incidents across Pakistan since the end of June, according to AFP. A satellite recording captured the wildfires spreading over Greece and Turkey on Tuesday. The European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) is monitoring the wildfires, which it says supports wildfire management. The Guardian\u2019s Miles Brignall has put together some advice about what rights people with plans to travel across Europe have, given the sweltering temperatures and wildfires sweeping across the continent. Click the link below to read more: Europe heatwave: what should you do about travel plans across the continent? In Madrid, Spain, digital thermometers read temperatures above 40C, with some areas recording temperatures of 43C on 18 July 2023. However, it is worth noting that the readings on street thermometers may differ slightly from the official highest temperature in each area. An area of high pressure, named Cerberus after the underworld monster from Dante\u2019s Inferno, is making its way across the country, leading 13 of the 17 autonomous communities to be categorised as either extreme risk (red alert), significant risk (orange alert) or (yellow alert). Patrick Galey, senior investigator at the international NGO Global Witness, has released a statement on the current global heatwave in which he says fossil fuels are the biggest contributing factor. Galey said: Fossil fuels are by far the largest contributor to the climate change that is supercharging these deadly heatwaves, summer after summer. With hundreds of millions of people affected globally by extreme heat, we must remember the main driver of such temperature extremes: fossil fuels. Burning oil, gas, and coal for energy accounts for over 75% of global greenhouse gas emissions and nearly 90% of all carbon dioxide emissions, which trap the sun\u2019s heat leading to the crop-withering and life-threatening heatwaves such as Cerberus and Charon currently baking southern Europe. Instead of naming each heatwave after characters from the mythical underworld, perhaps we can start naming them after the oil and gas giants, who last year banked record profits and whose business plans are making unbearable hot spells more frequent, more intense, and longer lasting. Greece\u2019s prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, is expected to visit the national operations\u2019 centre today to be briefed over the wildfires sweeping across the country. The fire risk hazard was high throughout Greece and a second heatwave was forecast to start on Thursday. Kostas Tsigas, head of the fire brigade officers association, told Greece\u2019s Skai TV: Conditions are extreme, and are likely to be so for another week The blaze, which broke out on Monday in the region of Dervenochoria, about 30km (20 miles) north of Athens, spread rapidly as it was fanned by erratic winds and reached Mandra on Tuesday, burning houses and forcing people to flee, Reuters reports. A public health group has recommended the introduction of siestas in Germany as temperatures soar in a sizzling summer heatwave. Johannes Niessen, the head of the BVOeGD public health officers association, said Germans should follow the habits of people in the hotter climes of southern Europe, Reuters reports. In an interview published by the RND media network on Tuesday, Niessen said: Get up early, work productively in the morning, and take a siesta at midday. People are not as efficient in strong heat as they are otherwise. Moreover, bad sleep in the absence of cooling in the night leads to concentration problems. While Germany has escaped the kind of temperatures that hit southern Europe this week, it has sweltered in the mid-30s celsius, with Bavaria experiencing the country\u2019s record high so far at 38.8C. German health minister Karl Lauterbach said a siesta was \u201ccertainly no bad proposal\u201d but employers and workers should negotiate this together. The BDA employers association was open to the siesta proposal, saying that more flexible working hours could enable employees to take longer midday breaks if it suited both parties. Niessen also called for \u201csufficient fans and lighter clothing, even if the attire rules for an office don\u2019t allow it\u201d. He added: A cold foot bath under the desk would be another option to stay cool while working from home. AFP news agency tweeted this heat map, showing predicted temperatures in Asia from the global deterministic prediction system on 18 July, 6:00 GMT. Lorenzo Tondo, the Guardian\u2019s southern Italy correspondent Electricity consumption reached a 2023 record on Tuesday afternoon as people turned on fans and ramped up the air conditioning to cope with the heatwave Italy is enduring, grid operator Terna has said. The health ministry issued red weather alerts for 20 of the country\u2019s 27 main cities on Tuesday, with the number expected to rise to 23 on Wednesday. People currently don\u2019t have many alternatives but to stay at home and turn on the air conditioning. As a result, consumption stood at 57.85GW at 2.45pm local time, just short of the 58.72GW forecast by Terna. Forty-five minutes earlier, at 2pm, consumption stood at 57,21GW and at 2.15pm it stood at 57.47GW. Temperatures in Rome hit 41.8C on Tuesday, breaking the previous record of 40.7C set in June 2022. Sicily reached about 41C and there were highs of 45C in Sardinia. Hospitals across the country have seen a sharp rise in the number of people seeking emergency care for heat-related illnesses. Extreme heat has been forecast across the globe again on Wednesday, as wildfires raged and health warnings were in place in parts of Asia, Europe and North America. Firefighters battled blazes in parts of Greece and the Canary Islands, while Spain issued heat alerts and some children in Italy\u2019s Sardinia were told to stay away from sports, AFP reports. From California to China, authorities warned of the health dangers brought by searing temperatures, urging people to drink water and shelter from the sun. \u201cYou can\u2019t be in the street, it\u2019s horrible,\u201d said Lidia Rodriguez, 27, in Madrid. Temperature records tumbled around the world, with new heat streaks set in China and the US, and fresh highs in France. Beijing broke a 23-year-old record with 27 consecutive days of temperatures above 35C, forecasters said. Phoenix broke a similar record, in place for 49 years, with its 19th consecutive day of temperatures of 43.3C or higher, weather officials said. In southern France, a record 29.5C was recorded in the Alpine ski resort of Alpe d\u2019Huez, while 40.6C had been recorded for the first time in Verdun in the foothills of the Pyrenees. In a stark reminder of the effects of global warming, the UN\u2019s World Meteorological Agency (WMO) said the trend showed \u201cno signs of decreasing\u201d. \u201cThese events will continue to grow in intensity, and the world needs to prepare for more intense heatwaves,\u201d John Nairn, a senior extreme heat adviser at the WMO told reporters in Geneva. Kim Willsher, the Guardian\u2019s Paris correspondent France\u2019s weather service M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France put nine departments in the south-east on high heatwave alert on Wednesday. The departments are the Vaucluse, the Var, Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, Alpes-Maritimes, the H\u00e9rault, Gard, Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne as well as the Mediterranean island of Corsica. In its alert, M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France said it had recorded high overnight temperatures including 26C in Montpellier and B\u00e9ziers, and 25C in Marseille and Nice at 5am local time. French meteorologists have a specific term for heatwave, canicule. This is when high temperatures are recorded day and night over a period of three consecutive days. The temperature required to spark a canicule alert depends on the geographic area. The nine departments are now on orange alert and if temperatures continue to rise for three consecutive days, this could change to red alert. France has launched its national heatwave alert, introduced after high temperatures across the country in August 2003 caused the death of almost 15,000 people in two weeks. The temperature in Paris between 4 and 12 August 2003 was above 36C for nine consecutive days \u2013 reaching a record 39.5C at the hottest, and did not drop below 20C during the nights. Helena Smith, the Guardian\u2019s correspondent in Greece, Turkey and Cyprus, reports from Athens Greek meteorologists are warning that the worst is still to come as the country braces for a second heat wave in as many weeks. While gale-force winds, which have been fanning fires, are expected to subside climatic conditions that are both extremely hot and dry will ensure that the danger of wildfires persists. The leading Greek weatherperson Theodoros Yiannaros told state-broadcaster ERT this morning: Although the winds will recede from tomorrow [Thursday] this doesn\u2019t mean that the danger of fires will lessen. There will be a drop in danger perhaps tomorrow but during the weekend the risk will be very high \u2026 difficult times are ahead of us. Temperatures are predicted to exceed 43C on Sunday, forecast to be a day hotter than any other so far this year. Weather conditions are being likened to 2021 when Greece was hit by some of the worst forest fires in living memory. Here are some more images from the wires of the wildfires that swept through forestland and towns north-west of Athens for a second day. The fires forced the evacuation of more than 1,000 children close to a Greek seaside resort. Tourists flocked to China\u2019s scenic Flaming Mountains to experience searing high temperatures amid punishing heatwaves that have scorched much of the northern hemisphere. Wearing broad-brimmed hats and umbrellas for added protection, tourists took selfies by a 12-metre-tall thermometer that displayed a real-time surface temperature of 80C (176F), Chinese state television showed on Wednesday. Each summer, curious tourists gather at the Flaming Mountains on the northern rim of the Turpan Depression in Xinjiang to admire their corrugated slopes of brown-red sandstone and feel the super-charged heat emanating from the ground. In recent days, temperatures in Xinjiang and other parts of Asia have shattered records. On Sunday, a remote township in the Turpan Depression registered a maximum temperature of 52.2C, smashing China\u2019s national record of 50.3C that was also set in the basin in 2015. On that day, the oasis city of Turpan west of the Flaming Mountains recorded temperatures of more than 45C at 31 local weather stations, with five of them breaking above 50C, according to state media on Wednesday. Reuters Here\u2019s some pictures of people trying to cope with the heatwave, including a man trying to cool off in Rome on Tuesday, when temperatures topped 40C (104F). Red alerts for high temperatures have been issued for most of Italy. And in Phoenix, Arizona, a woman drinks a bottle of water while walking in \u201cThe Zone\u201d, a vast homeless encampment where hundreds of people reside, during a record heatwave in the US state \u2013 the 19th day of temperatures of at least 110F (43.3C) Tuesday marked the 19th day the city of Phoenix has been subjected to temperatures of at least 110F (43.3C) \u2013 the longest stretch of time spent in such brutal heat \u2013 as record-breaking summer weather continues to affect millions in the US and around the world. The American city, which is the fifth biggest in the country, with a population of about 1.6 million that is expected to grow in the coming years, often ranks as the hottest or one of the hottest. But pushing into new territory comes with amplified risks to human health, especially for those forced to endure the extreme conditions for longer periods of time. The previous record of 18 days at that temperature threshold was set in the city in 1974. Read more: Family of Texas inmates call for air conditioning A heatwave that has pushed temperatures well above 37.8C (100F) across much of Texas this summer has led family members of inmates calling for lawmakers to ensure that all of the state\u2019s prisons are fully air conditioned. \u201cThey\u2019re cooking our inmates in the Texas prison system,\u201d said Tona Southards Naranjo, who believes the death last month of her son, Jon Southards, was caused by excessive heat in his prison, the Estelle Unit in Huntsville. Naranjo was one of more than 60 people who attended a rally outside the Texas Capitol on Tuesday. Advocates and others have been highly critical of the lack of air conditioning in the nation\u2019s largest prison system, alleging temperatures that often exceed 49C (120F) inside Texas prisons in the summer have been responsible for hundreds of inmate deaths in recent years. Only about 30% of Texas\u2019s 100 prison units are fully air-conditioned, with the rest having partial or no air conditioning. Texas has more than 128,000 inmates. However, the Texas Department of Criminal Justice(TDCJ) says there have been no heat-related deaths in the state\u2019s prisons since 2012. Officials are still investigating what caused Jon Southards\u2019s death, said Amanda Hernandez, a TDCJ spokesperson. At least eight other inmate deaths in recent weeks that advocates allege are heat-related were either due to cardiac arrest or other medical conditions, Hernandez said. The cause of some are still under investigation. Staff at the Acropolis, Greece\u2019s top tourist attraction, and other ancient sites in the country will stop work for four hours a day from Thursday in protest at working conditions during a heatwave, their union said. Access to the Unesco-listed Acropolis had already been restricted for three days by the authorities from last Friday, but the measures were lifted on Monday as the thermometer dropped ahead of a new heatwave predicted from Thursday. \u201cGiven the problems we have faced \u2026 in recent days, measures have been unanimously decided to protect the health of the security staff \u2026 as well as visitors,\u201d the PEYFA union said. Temperatures have surpassed 45C (113F), according to the union. The Acropolis, which has had a major rise in visitor numbers in recent months, is normally open from 8am to 8pm every day, but the work stoppage will operate from 4pm. The authorities have in recent days taken measures to help visitors cope, with tens of thousands of bottles of water handed out and sunshades erected. Two wildfires swept uncontrolled through forestland and towns north-west of Athens for a second day on Tuesday, Reuters reports, forcing more residents to flee their homes as authorities fought to stop the flames reaching an area with oil refineries. One of the fire fronts stretched over 8km (five miles), according to witnesses and officials, burning homes and cars around the area of Mandra, west of the capital, which was blanketed by dense smoke. \u201cWe are living a nightmare,\u201d Mandra mayor Christos Stathis told Open TV. \u201cHouses and properties are on fire.\u201d Late on Tuesday, the flames were headed toward the seaside town of Nea Peramos. The blaze, which broke out on Monday in the region of Dervenochoria, about 30km north of Athens, spread fast as it was fanned by erratic winds and reached Mandra on Tuesday, forcing people to flee and burning houses. As of 20.36 GMT, the flames were raging unchecked. Five coastguard vessels and private boats were on standby off Elefsina, ready to assist an emergency evacuation. The World Meteorological Organization says the heatwave in the northern hemisphere is set to intensify. An estimated 61,000 people may have died in heatwaves last year in Europe alone. The EU\u2019s emergency response coordination centre issued red alerts for high temperatures for most of Italy, north-eastern Spain, Croatia, Serbia, southern Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Montenegro. In Italy, temperatures on the island of Sardinia hit 44C (112F) and Rome topped out at 40C (104F) on Tuesday, as the health ministry issued red weather alerts for 20 of the country\u2018s 27 main cities, with the number expected to rise to 23 on Wednesday. This is the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the dangerous heatwaves and other extreme weather impacting people around the world, with me, Helen Sullivan.

Tessier-Lavigne announced his plans to step down on 31 August in a letter to students and staff on Wednesday. Tessier-Lavigne said he was stepping down because he expected continued debate about his ability to lead the university. \u201cI\u2019ve never submitted a scientific paper without firmly believing that the data were correct and accurately presented,\u201d he said in a statement. But he added that he should have been more diligent in seeking corrections regarding his work. The announcement comes after the board of trustees of the historic institution, which sits in the heart of Silicon Valley and is often referred to as the \u201cIvy of the West\u201d, launched a review late last year into allegations of fraud and ethical misconduct around papers Tessier-Lavigne had authored or co-authored. The review assessed 12 papers that Tessier-Lavigne worked on, five of them in which he was the principal author. The misconduct allegations about the work were first aired on PubPeer, a website where members of the scientific community can discuss research papers, the panel\u2019s final report stated. The panel cleared him of the most serious allegation, that a 2009 paper on a model of neurodegeneration published in the scientific journal Nature was the subject of a fraud investigation and that fraud was found. Neurodegeneration models could have great potential for Alzheimer\u2019s disease research and therapy. There was no investigation and no fraud discovered, the panel ruled. But it also concluded the paper had multiple problems, including a lack of rigor in its development and that the research that went into the paper and its presentation contained \u201cvarious errors and shortcomings\u201d. The panel did not find evidence that Tessier-Lavigne was aware of the lack of rigor. \u201cPeople tend to think of scientists as these individuals that they\u2019ve heard of like Einstein and Marie Curie,\u201d said H Holden Thorp, editor-in-chief of the Science family of journals. \u201cThe truth is that researchers run laboratories filled with people, and everything that happens in that laboratory is a product of many individuals there.\u201d While the report cleared Tessier-Lavigne of research misconduct, Thorp said ultimately the boss is responsible for what happens in the lab \u2013 and shouldn\u2019t be distracted by doing other jobs. He pointed to the report\u2019s finding that lab culture played a role. The panel found that \u201cthe unusual frequency of manipulation of research data and/or substandard scientific practices\u201d suggested a need for improved \u201coversight and management\u201d. Tessier-Lavigne is expected to retract three of the five papers of which he was the principal author and make heavy correction to the other two, the board\u2019s final report says. Tessier-Lavigne had been the university\u2019s president for nearly seven years. He will remain on faculty as a biology professor and will continue his research into brain development and neurodegeneration. The board named Richard Saller as interim president starting 1 September, said the board chair, Jerry Yang. In a statement, Yang said Tessier-Lavigne was key to creating the university\u2019s first new school in 70 years, the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability, and in 2019 he unveiled a strategic long-range plan that will continue to guide the university\u2019s growth. Tech and business magnates including Sergey Brin, co-founder of Google, and Reed Hastings, who co-founded Netflix, graduated from the school. Tessier-Lavigne did not immediately respond to the Guardian\u2019s requests for comment."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b2239d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jul/19/even-hanging-on-to-one-would-be-a-win-tories-brace-for-byelection-results", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018Even hanging on to one would be a win\u2019: Tories brace for byelection results", "lead": "Votes in the three very different seats could indicate general election swings and prompt cabinet reshuffle", "author": "Pippa Crerar Political editor and Aubrey Allegretti", "datePublished": "2023-07-19 19:42:48", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.232230", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/b116cec65d08180774c61de6e1cb4acfe1d521ed/0_372_8192_4916/500.jpg", "body": "The Conservatives are braced for painful byelection results in a vote on Thursday that could become a damning verdict on Rishi Sunak\u2019s ability to win a broad enough coalition of voters at the next election to retain his party\u2019s majority. The party could lose all three of the constituencies that are up for grabs \u2013 which each have significantly different demographics that the Tories would need to win \u2013 with the prospect of hanging on to just one being touted by senior ministers as a victory. Tory party insiders said that even if they managed to hang on to Selby and Ainsty, which has a 20,000 majority, a huge swing to Labour in the bellwether seat could indicate what is to come at the general election. However, retaining this constituency \u2013 even with a substantially reduced majority \u2013 or Boris Johnson\u2019s former Uxbridge and South Ruislip seat could give them hope that Sunak could pull it back next year. One cabinet minister said: \u201cLet\u2019s be honest, even hanging on to one would be a win for us.\u201d Despairing Conservative MPs, however, warned that the government could find itself \u201cin the death throes\u201d if thousands of voters in the vastly different seats in Somerset, west London and North Yorkshire gave them a pummelling at the polls. The byelection in Somerton and Frome is an opportunity for the Liberal Democrats to win a seat from the Conservatives, with some in Ed Davey\u2019s party seeing victory there as a near certainty. Neither Sunak nor the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, have visited the constituency. In a broadcast clip while on a visit to Warwickshire, Sunak refused to rule out holding an immediate reshuffle after days of speculation that he could rejig his top team to try to reset the narrative after what were expected to be poor results. His press secretary said byelections were \u201cvery difficult\u201d for incumbent governments, in what appeared to be an expectation management exercise. \u201cThe election we are most focused on is the general election,\u201d she added. In an attempt to improve party morale before polling day, Sunak addressed Tory MPs at a meeting of the backbench 1922 Committee. Afterwards, one MP, Jonathan Gullis, said the prime minister appeared to acknowledge the byelections would be \u201ca tough battle\u201d and had urged them to help get out the Conservative vote. During the behind closed doors meeting of Tory MPs, it was claimed Sunak had joked about his private swimming pool. Several of those present said he was looking forward to using it over the summer \u2013 but that diving in at the deep end might feel too much like the day job. There was no mention by the prime minister of whether a cabinet reshuffle could come as early as this Friday, after fevered speculation \u2013 including by the outgoing defence secretary, Ben Wallace. A No 10 source dismissed Wallace\u2019s comments, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t think cabinet ministers are told when reshuffles are going to happen.\u201d James Cleverly also issued an unusual public appeal to Sunak to keep his role in the next reshuffle. The foreign secretary told the Aspen Security Forum on Wednesday he would only be dragged out of his job \u201cwith nail marks down the parquet flooring\u201d, after speculation he could be moved to the defence brief to replace Wallace. In a significant departure from the normal ministerial practice of not commenting on reshuffles, Cleverly told the US conference: \u201cIf anyone in the UK is watching, listening, particularly you prime minister, I very much want to stay put \u2026 I very much want to stay put as foreign secretary. It\u2019s a job that I love, I think it\u2019s an important job.\u201d He added: \u201cThis is the job that I know, the job that I like to think I\u2019m good at and the job that I absolutely adore. So my plan is to stay put. If I\u2019m going to be dragged out at some point in the future, you\u2019ll see the nail marks down the parquet flooring in my office.\u201d Labour sources said that it would \u201cextraordinary\u201d for the party to overturn the Conservatives\u2019 huge majority in Selby, requiring a 17.9% swing which would be greater than Tony Blair had achieved in the 1997 election. They said there was a \u201cnarrow route\u201d to such a victory if the Tory vote was depressed and turnout was low. Party officials have been using the campaign to gather data ahead of the constituency boundary changes at the election, which will create a theoretically more winnable seat. There are frayed nerves in both camps over the Uxbridge seat in west London, which was not even won by Labour in 1997 and where the Tories hold a 7,000 majority. One Labour source said: \u201cI go through days where I think we are doomed, and then days where I think we are actually going to do this. But it\u2019s going to be close and I don\u2019t think it is going to be a huge victory for either party.\u201d The Tories have been focusing on the ultra-low emissions zone policy of the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, which is unpopular locally, but some party insiders believe the issue is being overplayed and voters are more concerned about the cost of living, for which the Conservatives could be blamed. They could also suffer from what one senior Tory MP, Steve Brine, called the \u201clong Boris\u201d effect, with voters punishing the government in Uxbridge amid anger over the scandal-ridden former prime minister. The pattern could be repeated in Selby where Nigel Adams, a close Johnson ally, has just vacated the seat. Taking either seat would be a boost for Starmer after a difficult week in which he has been challenged by his own party over his refusal to make any unfunded spending commitments, including scrapping the two-child benefit cap. Failing to make any headway would lead to further questions over his strategy. The byelections come as the prime minister\u2019s approval ratings hit an all-time low, with just a quarter of Britons surveyed by YouGov holding a favourable view of Sunak, and two-thirds having an unfavourable opinion. His net favourability has tumbled to minus 40, the lowest level since he took office, the polling firm said. Losing all three seats would make Sunak the first prime minister since Labour\u2019s Harold Wilson in 1968 to lose three byelections in a single day. He faces the prospect of two more tricky byelections in Mid Bedfordshire and Tamworth, which are held by Nadine Dorries and Chris Pincher, respectively, later in the year."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b2239e", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jul/19/sian-berry-green-party-candidate-caroline-lucas-brighton-pavilion-seat", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Si\u00e2n Berry to be Green candidate for Caroline Lucas\u2019s Brighton seat", "lead": "Green members select the party\u2019s former co-leader to stand in Brighton Pavilion at next election", "author": "Nadeem Badshah", "datePublished": "2023-07-19 19:26:32", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.232250", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/b1fb81bf25fc8deded8277a267f85bfad70a1b51/0_50_4366_2620/500.jpg", "body": "The Green party has selected Si\u00e2n Berry as its candidate to stand in Brighton Pavilion to replace Caroline Lucas MP.

Her selection was announced in Brighton on Wednesday evening after she won 71% of first preference votes. Berry, who was co-leader of the party alongside Jonathan Bartley between 2018 and 2021, said following in Lucas\u2019s footsteps was an \u201cenormous responsibility\u201d. She said: \u201cBrighton Pavilion needs a Green MP in parliament representing all the people across this wonderful constituency, and I can promise every voter in Brighton Pavilion that I will work every moment between now and the general election to win their trust and support.\u201d Berry has been the Green party of England and Wales\u2019s candidate for mayor of London three times. She has been a member of the London assembly since 2016 and has been a councillor for the Highgate ward in Camden since 2014. Voting took place in the Brighton contest from 3 July to 19 July. Lucas said: \u201cIt has been the honour of my life to represent the people of Brighton Pavilion in parliament for the past 13 years, and to see my majority increase at each of the past four elections. \u201cI am delighted that Si\u00e2n has been elected by party members. \u201cThere couldn\u2019t be a more passionate and committed person to pick up the baton and continue this city\u2019s tradition of doing politics differently, and standing up for what matters. \u201cI am certain that Si\u00e2n will be a powerful Green voice in parliament, holding to account whichever party forms the next government, and championing the concerns of constituents.\u201d Last month, Lucas announced she would be stepping down at the next general election. In a letter to her constituents, she said the \u201cthreats to our precious planet\u201d had become \u201cever more urgent\u201d and her role in parliament as the Green party\u2019s only MP meant she had \u201cstruggled to spend the time I want on these accelerating crises\u201d. \u201cI have therefore decided not to stand again as your MP at the next election,\u201d she said.

And so it is that a little after 4pm on a pale summer\u2019s day in Manchester, Cameron Green walks out of the pavilion to join Mitchell Marsh in the middle. Their gazes meet, and for a fleeting moment we are reminded of that famous internet meme with the two Spider-Man characters pointing at each other. Hang on. I thought I was the tall, big-hitting 85mph seam-bowling all-rounder in this team. So who are you exactly? They share a few quick words, although given the noise around the place it\u2019s arguable whether any actual information was communicated. Australia are 189 for five, having lost two wickets for six runs either side of tea. Stuart Broad has a nefarious glint in his eye and a little sliver of tongue poking out of the side of his mouth, the way he looks when he can taste blood. Marsh is on two. Green is on nought. The Ashes are afoot, England are rampant and the only thing standing in their way is just under four metres of prime Perth flesh. At which point it is worth recounting the unlikely sequence of events that brought us to this juncture. Perhaps it all starts when Nathan Lyon pulls his calf muscle during the second Test at Lord\u2019s. In comes Todd Murphy, who bowls nine largely inoffensive overs at Headingley. Meanwhile Green pulls up with a minor hamstring strain and in his stead Marsh scores a brilliant momentum-shifting hundred. If any of those things don\u2019t happen, nor does this. If you go back through history, Australian selection policy has traditionally been lavishly unsentimental in situations such as these. Martin Love hits an unbeaten century in 2003 and never plays another Test. Michael Slater\u2019s career is abruptly ended in the middle of an Ashes series. Stuart MacGill plays about 80 Tests fewer than he would have done for any other nation. For years Australia have almost taken a macabre pride in benching richly talented players as a show of strength. Shoehorning, tinkering, selection gymnastics: yeah, we leave that stuff to the other guys. But something about Green has always been different. Ever since he burst on to the scene in the home summer of 2020-21, Australia\u2019s most promising all-round talent since Keith Miller, he has subtly shifted the gravity of the side around him. The golden boy. The fulcrum. The future. The key to resting and managing Australia\u2019s formidable fast-bowling attack. Perhaps even captain one day. Australia are all in on Green, not only as a player but as a concept. And so once he declared himself fit, there was never any realistic possibility that he would miss out. Even if it meant going into a Test without a frontline spinner for the first time in 11 years. There have been times during this series when Green has looked visibly burdened by the weight of expectation he carries. His bowling has been quick and lively, but lacking its usual penetration and hit for almost a run a ball. He is yet to pass 40 with the bat. Here again there was a kind of ambiguity to him: a young and abundantly talented cricketer still seeking to define his role, still trying to work out the sort of batter he wants to be. Perhaps this would be less of a problem were it not for the guy at the other end. Marsh was the captain of Western Australia when Green first came into the side in 2017, batting at No 8 or No 9 with a licence to play his shots. Over the subsequent years, and largely from a distance, he has watched the younger man gradually grow into the star all-rounder role he once dreamed for himself. They are good friends, of course, and revel in each other\u2019s successes. But Marsh will also have known that at heart, this is a zero-sum game. And during his four-year exile from Test cricket between 2019 and 2023, he will have become increasingly aware that only one of these men has a substantial Test career ahead of them. All of which has given him a curious kind of freedom this series. And here the contrast between them was stark. Green got his first runs with a streaky edge behind square. Marsh crunched a similar ball for four the same over. Green gingerly edged Broad down into the slips. Marsh took a swing and slashed him for four. Green tapped tentative singles off Moeen Ali. Marsh walloped him into the crowd. If Green was Oppenheimer, then Marsh was Barbie. Which explains why, by the time Chris Woakes had cleaned them both up in the same over, Marsh had made 51 and Green 16. Green may be the coming force in Australian cricket, but for now it is his understudy \u2013 more fluent, more unhurried, less freighted by doubt \u2013 who is exerting the greater influence on the series. Depending on how Australia\u2019s no-spinner gamble fares, they may not be teammates for very much longer. But while they are, Green may just be able to learn a thing or two."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b223a0", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/19/oceangate-stockton-rush-karl-stanley-mousetrap-billionaires", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush created \u2018mousetrap for billionaires\u2019, says friend", "lead": "Karl Stanley says Rush \u2018definitely knew it was going to end like this\u2019 and that he had warned Rush the craft was dangerous", "author": "Edward Helmore in New York", "datePublished": "2023-07-19 19:02:42", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.232286", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/5ff639d294da6e4d9fbfa59bb0ed5e33ac14758b/0_215_6000_3599/500.jpg", "body": "A one-time passenger of the submersible that imploded over the wreck of the Titanic last month, killing five, has reportedly said he believes OceanGate\u2019s CEO, Stockton Rush, who died in the accident, knew that expeditions of the Titan craft would end in disaster but continued to create a \u201cmousetrap for billionaires\u201d. Karl Stanley, who was interviewed by 60 Minutes Australia on Sunday, told the broadcast that he\u2019d warned his friend that the carbon fiber and titanium craft was dangerous. \u201cHe definitely knew it was going to end like this. He literally and figuratively went out with the biggest bang in human history that you can go out with,\u201d Stanley said. \u201cHe was the last person to murder two billionaires at once and have them pay for the privilege.\u201d \u201cI think Stockton was designing a mousetrap for billionaires,\u201d Stanley added. Stanley, who had been on a dive with Rush in the Bahamas in 2019, said in the interview that he had \u201cno doubt\u201d in his mind \u201cthat it was the carbon fiber tube that was the mechanical part that failed\u201d during the Titan\u2019s final trip.

Photos of pieces of the Titan taken in Canada showed structural titanium rings front and rear of the Titan are believed to support the theory that the carbon fiber tube collapsed under the intense pressure of water at that depth. The accident is currently under investigation by the US Coast Guard, the Transportation Safety Board of Canada and the UK Marine Accident Investigation Branch. Stanley, who runs a deep-sea exploration company in Honduras, Stanley\u2019s Submarines, has previously said that after he made his trip on the Titan he sent an email to Rush warning him of suspected defects. \u201cWhat we heard, in my opinion ... sounded like a flaw/defect in one area being acted on by the tremendous pressures and being crushed/damaged,\u201d Stanley wrote in an email obtained by CNN. \u201cFrom the intensity of the sounds, the fact that they never totally stopped at depth, and the fact that there were sounds at about 300 feet that indicated a relaxing of stored energy /would indicate that there is an area of the hull that is breaking down/ getting spongy,\u201d Stanley wrote to Rush. In his latest comments, Stanley said in the interview with 60 Minutes that he was brushed off by Rush, who railed against \u201cuninformed accusations from industry pundits\u201d and had incited Rush to push forward with his doomed project."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b223a1", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/19/womens-world-cup-this-time-the-world-really-is-watching", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Women\u2019s World Cup: this time the world really is watching", "lead": "In New Zealand and Australia Women\u2019s World Cup fever has truly taken hold for a tournament that appears wide open", "author": "Suzanne Wrack in Brisbane", "datePublished": "2023-07-19 19:00:08", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.232305", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/f31ac8fed66c1723e79e6cede0ffdced8d798bda/118_363_5644_3386/500.jpg", "body": "Step off the plane at Auckland airport and you step on to the pitch. Well, a pitch, a mini artificial pitch, with a little stand in which those waiting in arrivals can sit while their friend or family member struts on to the turf to meet them, pulling a suitcase that disagrees with the surface. In New Zealand and Australia Women\u2019s World Cup fever has well and truly taken hold, with advertising, flags, welcome signs and merchandise on show. There is a buzz, in New Zealand because it is so rare that these players get to play in front of home crowds, being such a long way to go for friendlies, and in Australia because there is a real undercurrent of excitement at their prospects in the tournament. The vibe is very different from that which welcomed fans arriving for the 2019 Women\u2019s World Cup in France, where if it was possible for a country to shrug its shoulders, that is precisely what would have happened if you had asked it whether the tournament was even taking place. France felt out of step with the demands of a growing game with an increasingly captive audience, but Australia and New Zealand feel as if they have quickened pace with delight to keep up with the ever-growing women\u2019s game. This is not just a big moment for women\u2019s football in Australia and New Zealand, it is a big moment for sport. Sam Kerr is not just the poster girl for women\u2019s football here in Australia, or for football, but a poster girl in general and she is playing on the biggest of stages in front of everyone. The Sydney Olympics gold medallist and sporting icon Cathy Freeman surprised the Matildas with a visit this week. \u201cThe power of you just being here is unimaginable,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s beyond your wildest dreams what you\u2019re going to be able to do. You\u2019re going to be able to get into the blood of everyone who\u2019s on the journey with you.\u201d She is right and you can feel it, a flush of excitement and anticipation running through the veins of the country. When the first ball is kicked, at Eden Park when New Zealand host Norway, before Australia play the Republic of Ireland three hours later, the curtain will be raised on what is sure to be the biggest Women\u2019s World Cup in history and could be its most entertaining. Yet, backstage, the quality of the show is being undermined. A number of the actors are in revolt, being pulled away from fully focusing on the performance. The focus in the buildup to the World Cup is not on the nuances of who can win and how but on off-field issues that are blighting teams. For England, it is performance-related bonuses, for Australia equal prize money, for Nigeria and South Africa it is not being paid, for Jamaica it is having to crowdfund to cover costs, and for Spain and France it has been frustrations with the culture in the national team set-up. These issues will not go away when play begins. The US women\u2019s national team showed the power of speaking out on the biggest stages four years ago when their push for equal pay was heard in the chants echoing around the stadium after they had beaten the Netherlands in the final. This is a moment when the world is watching and listening, and the football will not supersede the drive to use that platform. The football, though, is needed to elevate the voices of the players up a level. For England and the other nations competing for the trophy, success strengthens the negotiating position. For nations making their debut, just reaching the tournament increases theirs. For those further down the rankings, each goal, draw or win does the same. Victory will look different to every team. Who will take the biggest prize and have their platform elevated the highest? It is increasingly difficult to say. The holders, the US, despite being in a period of transition, have an unrivalled culture, environment and player pool that have set them up for sustained success. England, as European champions, are a threat but injury-hit. Germany seem to be finding form and fitness at the right time. France have a new manager and a sense of stability for the first time in a long time. Australia? Well, the opportunity for the co-hosts is large, unpredictable and exciting. In Kerr they have a talismanic leader capable of taking any game by the scruff of the neck and turning it, of getting one chance and putting it away. Around Kerr is a team of elite players worthy of sharing the stage with the Perth-born forward and capable of extraordinary things themselves. In France, despite a few tough games, there was only really ever going to be one winner. The beauty of the tournament four years on is that the winner could realistically be any team that reaches the quarter-finals. The gap at the top is tightening and the prizes, on and off the field, are greater than ever."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b223a2", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2023/jul/19/county-cricket-middlesex-v-surrey-essex-v-kent-and-more-live", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "County cricket: Cook garnishes Essex\u2019s delicious day against Kent", "lead": "Alastair Cook cemented Essex\u2019s dominance at Chelmsford while Leus du Plooy and James Rew fell short in the race to 1,000 runs", "author": "Tanya Aldred", "datePublished": "2023-07-19 18:57:59", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.232332", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/4a5f0f657bcc7f7d000d892b66e900ab952f6b65/0_146_3600_2160/500.jpg", "body": "Time wheeled to sepia at Chelmsford, with Alastair Cook unbeaten on 64 at stumps on a good day for Essex. Kent, who had chosen to bat on a greenish pitch and with frowning skies, were dismissed by tea, with Sam Cook and Jamie Porter pocketing three wickets each. Surrey\u2019s Jamie Smith gambolled to an unbeaten 120, his second century of the season, in the London derby against Middlesex at Lord\u2019s, backed up by 79 from Rory Burns who has suffered a forlorn summer with the bat. Lancashire were rescued from the indignity of 150 for seven by an unbeaten partnership of 145 between George Balderson (94) and Tom Bailey (a career-best 75) on the Edgbaston pitch which hosted the Blast final. A career-best 145 from Derbyshire\u2019s wicket-keeper Brooke Guest frustrated Division Two leaders Durham. Guest\u2019s carefree hundred came after Durham won the toss and bowled, but the overhead conditions were trumped by a true pitch, especially once the sun peeled up the blackout blind. There were two wickets for Matthew Potts, Scott Borthwick and Ben Raine. Haider Ali had time to thrash Matt Parkinson for six before suffering a brain fade and being stumped after attempting a run when an lbw appeal against him was turned down. In the race to 1,000 runs, Leus du Plooy needed just 21 but was out for two. Another candidate for the race, James Rew, was caught 26 runs short of the magic four figures. Somerset were all out for 351, after Northamptonshire\u2019s Jack White grabbed five for 77. Carnage at Oakham school where 18 wickets fell, nine Worcestershire batters between lunch and tea after they\u2019d finished a sensible morning 74 for one. But Leicestershire\u2019s innings proved even more fragile, collapsing to 88 for eight. Fifteen wickets too at Trent Bridge, where Nottinghamshire rattled through Hampshire, only to come unstuck themselves, 87 for five at stumps, still trailing by 79. At a rainy Headingley, Yorkshire took six quick Sussex wickets. Another busy Championship Wednesday, even as Ashes events unrolled at Old Trafford. Sir Alastair rolling back the years, Lancashire lancsing up and recovering, and wickets a go-go at Oakham School and Trent Bridge. That\u2019s it for today, thanks for the messages, I\u2019ll be back tomorrow, this time at Cheltenham. Bye! DIVISION ONE Chelmsford: Essex 106-0 v Kent 207 Lord\u2019s: Middlesex v Surrey 312-5 Northants: Northamptonshire v Somerset 351 Trent Bridge: Nottinghamshire 87-5 v Hampshire 166 Edgbaston: Warwickshire v Lancashire 295-7 DIVISION TWO Derby: Derbyshire 317-6 v Durham Oakham: Leicestershire 88-8 v Worcestershire 178 Headingley: Yorkshire v Sussex 120-6 Oh, and Leicestershire? (50-5) Must pop back to say bravo Jamie Smith, another classy ton, this time off 137 balls. The pick of the Surrey batting this year. He has company in Clark (20); Surrey 277-5. Time for me to write up for the paper but do chat on below the line, round the grounds. Still no resumption at Headingley, where Sussex are stranded on 62-5. Elsewhere in the party division, Derbyshire power on, 273-5, Guest 123 not out; Leicestershire 20-1 following Worcestershire\u2019s 178. In Div one: Balderson and Bailey have rescued Lancashire, 247-5; Hampshire all out 166 v Notts, who begin their innings; Somerset 282-7 \u2013 no thousand runs for Rew today -; Surrey 241-5, Smith 85 not out; and Browne and Cook whizzing along against Kent, Essex 56-0. Hampshire\u2019s bowlers have a bit to do. An enormous amount to do actually. All out for 166, and that only thanks to forties from Gubbins and Fuller. Three wickets each for Hutton, Paterson and James. Hope Notts are ready. Haider Ali\u2019s brain fade in full: Since Bairstow\u2019s selection for the Ashes, Foakes hasn\u2019t been able to pull out a real come and get me innings \u2013 this time out for 20, Surrey 230-4. Pennington showing his teammates how much he\u2019ll be missed, as he has Patel caught in his second over. Leics 6-1. While Jack White has five at Northampton, Somerset 260-6. Rew still there. The BBC have Rew resplendent on 953 runs in their averages. Assuming, dangerously, that was up to date at the start of the day, he needs just 47 today to reach the fat thousand. Currently on 21, he needs 26. Pls advise if that is wrong! Doughtiness from Derbyshire at No. 3 \u2013 181 balls, 15 fours. Two in a row to boot! On a good batting pitch, Derby press on, 239-3. Bit of turn for Parky, still on his loan-turn in the north east. An intriguing read for a spare five minutes: Things rattling along quickly at Oakham School, Worcestershire all out for 178, three wickets each for Mulder and Salisbury. Azhar Ali the top scorer with 34. And Leicestershire, in reply, are 2-0, slips awaiting. Browne and Cook are out in the middle at Chelmsford, just two tinkling onto the scoreboard. While George Bartlett picked up fifty just before tea as he and James Rew \u2013 eyes on four figures \u2013 took Somerset through till tea. Somerset 226-4. DIVISION ONE Chelmsford: Essex v Kent 207 Lord\u2019s: Middlesex v Surrey 188-3 Northants: Northamptonshire v Somerset 218-4 Trent Bridge: Nottinghamshire v Hampshire 84-6 Edgbaston: Warwickshire v Lancashire 184-7 DIVISION TWO Derby: Derbyshire 203-3 v Durham Oakham: Leicestershire v Worcestershire 161-9 Headingley: Yorkshire v Sussex 61-5 rain Bartlett and Kohler-Cadmore providing a steadying hand for Somerset in a stand of 77 at The County Ground, Somerset 215-3. Ah, Kent are all out for 207, Qadri left stranded on 19, Stewart a quick-fire 34, Compton 47 at the top and not much else. At Lord\u2019s Middlesex make the breakthrough \u2013 and it be Burns, a second for Higgins, for a hard-fought 79. Surrey 163-3. Enter Ben Foakes. Vince gone (in a mini-slump?) for 22, then James gets Brown two balls later. Gubbins a sniff away from fifty. Hampshire 81-4. And a wicket at the Test as Moeen grabs a sweaty Labuschagne for 51. Mitchell gone, Lamb follows, Lancs in a pickle: 155-7. The surprise package of the day award goes to Derbyshire who are fizzing along against Durham, 169-2, half centuries for Madsen and Guest. We\u2019re underway again at Headingley, but no great joy for Sussex who have lost Carter for 2, the third Sussex player to fall in single figures. Ibrahim, who became the Championship\u2019s youngest half-centurion at Headingley in June 2021, joins Alsop (20). Sussex 46-4. Rather against all the odds, Leicestershire have managed to hold onto Rehan Ahmed and Rishi Patel. Gubbins and Vince, butchers of longstanding quality, in at Trent Bridge after Holland and Middleton were both out for ducks. Hampshire 41-2. Daryl Mitchell stands between Lancashire and a Lancs-up \u2013 currently 116-5, Salt adn Bell out in single figures. Two for Hannon-Dalby. Lancs 120-5. I don\u2019t know what was in the Oakham lunch boxes, but Worcestershire have taken a pretty tumble after lunch: Roderick, Haynes, Hose and D\u2019Oliveira all back in the dressing-room. Mulder 3-27. Runs at last. Only the second of the season for the ponytailed prince.. Surrey\u2019s hundred up in 36 overs. DIVISION ONE Chelmsford: Essex v Kent 92-4 Lord\u2019s: Middlesex v Surrey 77-1 Northants: Northamptonshire v Somerset 107-1 Trent Bridge: Nottinghamshire v Hampshire no play yet today, rain Edgbaston: Warwickshire v Lancashire 84-3 DIVISION TWO Derby: Derbyshire 74-2 v Durham Oakham: Leicestershire v Worcestershire 74-1 Headingley: Yorkshire v Sussex 24-3 rain We\u2019re back with Duke\u2019s this morning, but not much success for the bowlers round the grounds \u2013 much though they complained about the Kookaburra. But I think the Kookaburra typically went soft around 30 overs \u2013 so perhaps we\u2019ll see the difference after lunch. Incidentally, soapy-palmed Essex have dropped another. Potts, unlucky not to have played a part in the Ashes, biding his time till Broad and Anderson finally hang up their boots, makes a breakthrough at The County Ground. Derby 61-2. A wicket for Ed Barnard at Edgbaston, with the ballsy Bohannon gone for 33. Lancs 66-2. If you are feeling more internationally inclined, Geoff has the latest from Old Trafford: At Headingley they\u2019re taking lunch at 12.50, and sending out the umpires to sniff around at 1.10. In Division Two: rain. Sussex, 24-3, rescued from Fisher, holed up at Headingley, Worcestershire, 48-1, lost Libby for 24, (Scriven) just before the fat drops started falling at Oakham School. And Derbyshire are 53-1 against Division Two\u2019s runaway leaders Durham. Brooke Guest looking typically at home, 26 off 36 balls. A great read on the women\u2019s Ashes: A stroll round the Division One grounds with an hour of play gone: Simon Harmer is already bowling at Chelmsford, where Essex are 38-3, a run-out following that two-in-two for Sam Cook. At Lord\u2019s, Surrey have lost Sibley for 3, to Ryan Higgins, but the out-of-sorts Burns remains, unbeaten on 15. Surrey 30-1. Somerset are 48-1 at Northants, Lammonby caught for 3. James Rew, favourite in the race for 1000 runs, still two wickets away from having a bat. Jennings and Bohannon plugging away at Edgbaston, Bohannon rather more quickly, Lancashire 35-1. And no play yet at Trent Bridge. Nice work by Leicestershire \u2013 hope some schools broke up early and the team get lots of eager beavers. A wicketless morning for Leicestershire\u2019s bowlers so far. Worcestershire, who will lose Pat Brown to Derbyshire at the end of the season \u2013 won over by more red-ball opportunities -, as well as Josh Tongue and Dillon Pennington to Notts, are 36-0. As noted BTL, very strange goings-on at Lancashire with Rob Jones, who made an excellent century at Blackpool, albeit in a (just) losing cause, seemingly punished for moving to Worcestershire for more game time by being removed from the first team for the rest of the season. The statement from Mark Chilton seemed to have three totally unconnected paragraphs: \u201cUltimately, Rob has decided that he believes he will get more opportunity across all formats to progress his career at Worcestershire and while we are disappointed to lose him, we respect his decision. \u201cWe have taken the decision that Rob won\u2019t feature in our First Team plans for the rest of this season - as we focus on players who will be at the club next season and beyond. Discussions are ongoing between Lancashire and Worcestershire as to what the remainder of Rob\u2019s season entails. \u201cRob has been an extremely popular member of the dressing room and has always given 100% for the Red Rose. We thank him for his services and wish him all the best with his new chapter at New Road.\u201d But at the same time Danny Lamb, who will move to Sussex at the end of the season, is playing against Warwickshire. Confused shrug. And at Edgbaston, Lancs are 24-1 after being inserted by Warwickshire. Hat-trick ball for Matthew Fisher too, at Headingley. Tricky morning for the creche, 18-3. Clark, Haines and Coles back in the playroom. Sam Cook on a hat-trick: Muyeye and Denly in his pocket. Kent 28-2. Durham (9) 155 Leicestershire (9) 108 Sussex (9) 106 Glamorgan (9) 95 Worcestershire (9) 92 Yorkshire (8) 80 Gloucestershire (9) 65 Derbyshire (8) 63 Another drop at Chelmsford \u2013 Critchley this time lets one through his fingers. Kent 18-0, having a much-needed helping hand. Quite a change in the Div One race, from what seemed early season like a Surrey smash n grab. Essex on a roll, four in a row, and Warwickshire well in the chase with a game in hand. Surrey (9) 139 Essex (9) 126 Warwickshire (8) 116 Hampshire (9) 113 Somerset (9) 100 Lancashire (8) 90 Nottinghamshire (9) 89 Kent (9) 74 Middlesex (8) 63 Northamptonshire (8) 47 Update from Trent Bridge: pitch inspection at noon. Harmer, who uncharacteristically dropped one (or two?) at Blackpool, lets one slip past . Kent 9-0. Rain at Trent Bridge where Nottinghamshire are in desperately seeking victory \u2013 no Championship wins since May \u2013 but we\u2019re rolling elsewhere, with everyone\u2019s wickets still intact (as I write\u2026) All change please, all change: Some transfer news: DIVISION ONE Chelmsford: Essex v Kent Lord\u2019s: Middlesex v Surrey Northants: Northamptonshire v Somerset Trent Bridge: Nottinghamshire v Hampshire Edgbaston: Warwickshire v Lancashire DIVISION TWO Derby: Derbyshire v Durham Oakham: Leicestershire v Worcestershire Headingley: Yorkshire v Sussex Good morning and welcome back! This is the penultimate round before we break for August, with much still up in the air in the 2023 chase for the title. The skies are questioning over Manchester this morning, and much of the country, but I think we\u2019ll have enough to run along with. The Met office verdict: \u201cResidual rain will clear from central and eastern England to leave a day of sunshine and showers. Showers will be most frequent and heaviest across central and eastern areas.\u201d Lots to look forward to with Essex, fresh from victory against Lancashire, taking on grotty-round-the gills-Kent; an all-London clash at Lord\u2019s; Northants entertaining big-scoring Somerset; and two big beasts clashes \u2013 Notts and Hants at Trent Bridge and Warwicks and Lancs at Edgbaston. In Division Two: Durham prepare to eat up Derbyshire at The County Ground; Leicestershire move to their outground at Oakham school, and Yorkshire entertain Sussex at Headingley. The Cheltenham festival starts tomorrow, with Glamorgan the visitors."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b223a3", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/jul/19/jonny-bairstow-catch-bazball-england", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Jonny Bairstow\u2019s catch sums up shock of the old with Bazball England | Barney Ronay", "lead": "All members of England\u2019s Unforgiven chipped in, with Mark Wood producing a thrilling spectacle across three spells", "author": "Barney Ronay at Emirates Old Trafford", "datePublished": "2023-07-19 18:56:09", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.232361", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/5789c03c2d985383cbaa440ac683a9f023dd9759/0_428_1368_821/500.jpg", "body": "The best part was probably the celebration, the ball clamped in the outer webbing of Jonny Bairstow\u2019s right glove, legs splayed, arms wide. For a few moments England\u2019s wicketkeeper just sat there like a very happy life-sized gingerbread man, emitting an extended roar of triumph. It was perhaps the central moment of a day when England\u2019s oldest ever five-man bowling attack \u2013 combined age: 180 years \u2013 just kept on refusing to die away, that liver-spotted hand clutching at Australia\u2019s elbow every time they seemed to be easing clear. The catch was a spectacular piece of gymnastic agility as the shadows began to lengthen, Bairstow dropping through a previously invisible trapdoor in the Old Trafford turf to scoop Mitchell Marsh\u2019s low outside edge off Chris Woakes, who took four wickets and was once again a model of craft and persistence. It meant more because Bairstow had spent the day to that point clanging away on his cymbals behind the stumps. The great Les Ames used to keep wicket with a piece of rump steak in each glove to soften the impact of ball on palm, wafting a notoriously cadaverous stench across the cordon during those long afternoons in the high summer sun. Bairstow looks like he\u2019s got a packet of frozen chicken escalopes in there. But this was a reminder of his wonderful base-level athleticism, and beyond that of the unbowed, surprisingly tenacious quality of England\u2019s old and very old hands in the current paradigm-shifting era. Bazball is new. Bazball is fresh and punkish. Bazball will debunk your ossified certainties. Bazball is also a lot of grizzled mid-30s blokes having a wonderfully cathartic time, shaking off the scars, chucking it all on the fire while this thing is still on. Welcome to the shock of the old. Ben Stokes talks a lot about feelings, energy, the dream of constructing out of this Ashes the perfect stand-alone piece of sporting theatre. But this has also had the feel from the start of a late blaze of summer, the buildup to a bravura ending. Stokes himself is 32 and essentially held together with nails, string and pieces of old deckchair. Bairstow is 33. Woakes is 34. Stuart Broad has turned 37 this summer and took his 600th Test wicket here, still bowling with fire, still from the boundary the same oddly compelling fast-medium beanpole of the earliest iteration. And, in the event, every member of England\u2019s oldest attack played a part in restricting Australia to 299 for eight on another pivotal day in this ever\u2011pivotal summer. Jimmy Anderson has an end here; but not quite an ending just yet. He bowled 17 tight wicketless overs with no dip in his energy levels, just a sense somehow of a Jimmy Anderson who isn\u2019t quite Jimmy Anderson. The same lines and angles are there, same coiled sense of twang, same easy action. But somehow the end result is missing that familiar malevolent snaking intelligence on the ball in flight, the sense of Anderson\u2019s fingers still in place as it veers towards his latest victim, giving it a flick, some zip, a late swerve. Anderson still has another innings to bowl here. But he seems these days to be running through evening sunlight. Mark Wood was a thrilling spectacle across three spells, and as ever a tactically vital presence in this attack. He really is a marvel of will, conditioning and technique. Here is a bowler who has got quicker in his mid-30s, who is in likelihood, aged 33, the quickest England have ever had. His second ball here was 91mph. This is instant, pre-mixed pace, delivered from a run-up that carries a distinct sense of Terminator-ish menace before launching into the catapult moment, front leg planted, knee splayed back, angle twanging, whirling over that anchor point with a snap of the back and whip of the right arm, accelerating his bowling hand from hip height and ending down by his toes. This is serious athletic talent combined with long-suffering technical refinement. When Wood swings the ball too there is a kind of ripple effect, every aspect of the game heightened, batters at both ends living on their nerves. The final member of England\u2019s Unforgiven, Moeen Ali, has gone one step further. Here is a Test cricketer who has already retired, who is quite openly looking forward to doing so again three weeks from now, but who still appears (aged 36) to be central to every part of England\u2019s burn\u2011it\u2011all\u2011down planning. Moeen bowled with serious revs in the mid-afternoon session, getting the ball to dip as well as turn, testing you on length as well as line. In between this he bowled a lot of absolute filth, keeping the batters in two minds by mixing his half-volleys with full bungers. Is this a new Bazball strand? First-day declaration bowling? But Moeen still ripped enough deliveries, beating the forward prod of a well-set Marnus Labuschagne at the vital moment. And by the end England\u2019s dad-squad attack, aided by that moment of defiant athleticism behind the stumps, had carried the opening day thanks to some late swing and nip from Woakes. Like late-stage Test cricket itself, they may be here for a good time not a long time. But this game is already cartwheeling along towards another decisive finish."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b223a4", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/jul/19/what-are-the-uk-rules-on-access-to-banking-and-how-are-disputes-settled", "primaryCategory": "money", "subCategories": "test", "title": "What are the UK rules on access to banking and how are disputes settled?", "lead": "Everyone has a right to a basic account but banks can deny customers additional services", "author": "Kalyeena Makortoff Banking correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-07-19 18:49:54", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.232391", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/57b735b37f8df29289edd7b387c79fe92e4cca84/0_381_2519_1511/500.jpg", "body": "As the storm over the closure of Nigel Farage\u2019s bank accounts at the private lender Coutts grows, here we look at the UK rules on the right to be banked and how account holders can complain if they feel they have been treated unfairly. What rights do I have to a UK bank account? Under the payment accounts regulations, everyone in the UK has a right to hold a basic bank account offering the ability to receive and make payments. However, UK banks, like most businesses, are free to deny additional services to customers for a number of reasons, including suspicions over financial crime. Lenders can also choose to close or refuse an account if they believe customers pose a risk to their reputation. This was apparently one of the key reasons Coutts decided to shut Nigel Farage\u2019s account. Farage used a subject access request to obtain internal documents detailing the decision. It showed the bank was concerned about his \u201cxenophobic, chauvinistic and racist views\u201d and believed maintaining his accounts posed a reputational risk. The report highlighted Farage\u2019s ties to controversial politicians such as Donald Trump, and his views on issues including migration and Russia. It said some of Farage\u2019s comments were \u201cnot in line with our views or our purpose\u201d. It is important to note that Farage has not, as he claims, been \u201cdebanked\u201d. He has been offered a standard account at Coutts\u2019 sister bank, the high street lender NatWest, and he has so far refused to confirm whether he plans to take up the offer. What does this mean for me? Can banks close customer accounts at any time? Reputational risks are considered to be part of banks\u2019 commercial decision-making but are subject to fair treatment and equality concerns, meaning individuals cannot be denied services on the basis of protected characteristics such as gender or race. The City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), confirmed that the rules, which have been inherited from the EU, cover people\u2019s political views. Those rules, which came into force through the 2015 payment accounts regulations (PARs), gave people in the UK a right to have a basic bank account and detailed protections against discrimination. The legislation, which predates Brexit, states that \u201ca credit institution must not discriminate against consumers legally resident in the European Union by reason of their nationality or place of residence or by reason of any other ground referred to in article 21 of the charter of fundamental rights of the European Union when those consumers apply for or access a payment account\u201d. The charter states: \u201cAny discrimination based on any ground such as sex, race, colour, ethnic or social origin, genetic features, language, religion or belief, political or any other opinion, membership of a national minority, property, birth, disability, age or sexual orientation shall be prohibited.\u201d The matter is a bit more hazy if a lender argues that an individual\u2019s opinions do not align with its values or purpose. The FCA\u2019s chair, Ashley Alder, told MPs on the Treasury committee on Wednesday that \u201cfor banks as well as other commercial enterprises, it\u2019s fundamentally up to them to choose who they do business with\u201d. He said he was \u201cnot aware of anything in the FCA rulebook that goes to the point around how banks judge their own attitude to reputational risk, if that\u2019s what it comes down to\u201d. Has this happened before? Yes. Reputational concerns have resulted in account closures for individuals and business involved in sex work, or pornography and adult entertainment industries, as well CBD and cannabis-related companies. In 2021 it emerged that OnlyFans, the online subscription platform known for hosting adult content, had had its company accounts closed at the UK-based Metro Bank and had run into trouble with the US lender BNY Mellon, which started flagging and rejecting cash transfers. OnlyFans later said it had reached a new agreement with its lenders and payment providers, but others in the industry have not been so lucky. What recourse do I have if I believe I have been treated unfairly? If a customer believes they have been discriminated against or treated unfairly by their bank, they can file a complaint with the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS). The FOS will take evidence from the customer and the bank before making a decision. Its ruling could force the bank to correct its mistake, which could mean reinstating an account, and even pay the customer compensation. The process could take months, with the initial assessment alone lasting up to 90 days. If it is a complex complaint or if either party disagrees with the initial assessment, the matter will take longer to settle."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b223a5", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2023/jul/19/nigel-farage-has-a-point-coutts-should-explain-itself", "primaryCategory": "business", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Nigel Farage has a point.

The former Ukip leader, according to the memo of the meeting of the \u201cWealth Reputational Risk Committee\u201d, was about to fall below the qualifying threshold to be a customer. That threshold is maintaining borrowings or investments of more than \u00a31m, or more than \u00a33m in savings. Farage was soon to pay off his mortgage, presenting Coutts with a choice. It could keep him as a customer and overlook the qualifying criteria. Or it could put him on a \u201cglide path\u201d, in the language of the committee, to being removed. It opted for removal. And one cannot call this a case of being \u201cdebanked\u201d, as Farage is spinning it, because he was glided towards another entity within the same group. NatWest, hardly an obscure outfit, offered him a personal account and a business account. Thus, if one wishes, one can enjoy some sport at Farage\u2019s expense: at one level, he is merely complaining about having to bank with the common people. Except the tale is not that straightforward. The minutes of Coutts committee\u2019s meeting make two things clear. First, Farage was still regarded as wealthy enough to be a profitable customer. \u201cThe client\u2019s EC [economic contribution] is now sufficient to retain on a commercial basis,\u201d it says, noting that he had been downgraded to \u201clower risk\u201d in the classification of \u201cpolitically exposed persons\u201d. Second, the choice to get shot of Farage was motivated by Coutts\u2019 objections to his views. \u201cThe committee did not think continuing to bank NF [Nigel Farage] was compatible with Coutts given his publicly stated views that were at odds with our position as an inclusive organisation.\u201d He failed a political or inclusivity test and was regarded as a risk reputation-wise. Are we really happy with the idea of bank committees passing inclusivity judgments on customers and then not explaining their decisions? It is surely possible to disagree profoundly with Farage\u2019s views on most issues and find Coutts\u2019 stance alarmingly illiberal. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the chief financial regulator, doesn\u2019t see much a problem, it should be said. Its chair, Ashley Alder, told the Treasury select committee that regulated firms must treat customers fairly but added: \u201cFor banks as well as other commercial enterprises, it\u2019s fundamentally up to them to choose who they do business with.\u201d He went on: \u201cI\u2019m not aware of anything in the FCA rulebook that goes to the point around how banks judge their own attitude to reputational risk, if that\u2019s what it comes down to.\u201d Well, OK, banks are private businesses (even NatWest, 39%-owned by the state) and they can choose their customers. But it is also reasonable to expect some accountability and transparency in the process. It is, for example, hard to pin down how the stated purposes and values of NatWest and Coutts lead them to consider, among other things, Farage\u2019s contact with non-vaccinated Novak Djokovic or his retweeting of a Ricky Gervais trans joke. Here\u2019s one of NatWest\u2019s descriptions of its purpose: \u201cWe champion potential, helping people, families and businesses to thrive. Because when they thrive, so do we.\u201d That\u2019s just blurry. As for Coutts, the front page of its website boasts that it wants clients who are \u201cdisrupters and challengers\u201d, two descriptions that, perversely, could be applied to Farage. In money-laundering cases and suchlike, it isn\u2019t possible for banks to explain why a customer has been ditched. The regulatory demands for secrecy are rightly strict. But there is a problem if requirements for confidentiality elsewhere are used as cover for excluding accounts of politicians whose views the bosses of banks find distasteful. Farage makes a difficult case because so many other people understandably regard him as objectionable. But Coutts\u2019 position here is odd. It seems to amount to this: if we find your views lawful but offensive, we\u2019ll do nothing if you\u2019ve got \u00a31m on deposit; but we may dump you without explanation if you\u2019ve got less. How does that align with those fluffy corporate values?"}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b223a6", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jul/19/james-cleverly-public-appeal-to-keep-job-foreign-secretary-rishi-sunak-reshuffle", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "James Cleverly makes public appeal to keep job as foreign secretary", "lead": "Departure from normal ministerial practice adds to speculation of an imminent reshuffle by Rishi Sunak", "author": "Kiran Stacey Political correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-07-19 18:38:47", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.232457", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/27fc19cc29e508f69bcc0a6117e4f133cc29063f/0_0_6830_4097/500.jpg", "body": "James Cleverly has issued an unusual public appeal to Rishi Sunak to keep his job as foreign secretary in the next reshuffle, as speculation mounts that the prime minister could change his frontbench team in the coming days. The foreign secretary told the Aspen Security Forum on Wednesday he would have to be dragged out of his job \u201cwith nail marks down the parquet flooring\u201d, after speculation he could be moved to the defence brief to replace Ben Wallace. His comments are a departure from the normal ministerial practice of not commenting on reshuffles, and add further weight to reports that Sunak intends to make big changes to his top team before next year\u2019s election. Cleverly told the US conference: \u201cIf anyone in the UK is watching, listening, particularly you prime minister, I very much want to stay put \u2026 I very much want to stay put as foreign secretary. It\u2019s a job that I love, I think it\u2019s an important job.\u201d He added: \u201cThis is the job that I know, the job that I like to think I\u2019m good at, and the job that I absolutely adore. So my plan is to stay put. If I\u2019m going to be dragged out at some point in the future, you\u2019ll see the nail marks down the parquet flooring in my office.\u201d Wallace said over the weekend he would seek to leave his role as defence secretary at the next opportunity, and stand down as an MP in the general election. His public declaration has intensified speculation in Westminster of an imminent reshuffle, something Wallace appeared to confirm on Tuesday when he said there could be one within days. Sunak faces the possibility of losing three byelections on Thursday, and some have speculated he could wish to use a reshuffle to reassert his authority over the parliamentary Conservative party. Asked about the possibility, the prime minister\u2019s press secretary said on Wednesday: \u201cThere are no plans for a reshuffle.\u201d Asked whether there would be one in the future, she added: \u201cI\u2019m not going to comment on the longer term.\u201d Wallace and Cleverly are not the only ministers commenting publicly on the possible reshuffle. Anne-Marie Trevelyan, a Foreign Office minister, on Monday replied to a tweet recommending her for the role as defence secretary, saying: \u201cIt would be a privilege to serve.\u201d Sunak has carried out one reshuffle since becoming prime minister last October, though that was a limited one aimed more at creating new Whitehall departments than moving around his most senior ministers. Tory MPs expect this one to be more wide-ranging, and not just because of Wallace\u2019s departure. Other high-profile members of the government tipped to be on their way out include Steve Barclay, the health secretary, and Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, the environment secretary. Some reports have suggested Sunak could also move Suella Braverman, the home secretary, and even Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b223a7", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/19/video-appears-to-show-wagner-chief-yevgeny-prigozhin-addressing-fighters-in-belarus", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Video appears to show Wagner chief for first time since aborted mutiny", "lead": "Footage released on Telegram is said to show Yevgeny Prigozhin addressing fighters in Belarus", "author": "Andrew Roth", "datePublished": "2023-07-19 18:32:02", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.232494", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/e84e5f3c079f92438a0677d7020c02e3dd9961e4/0_657_2114_1268/500.jpg", "body": "A video has appeared purporting to show the mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin addressing his fighters in Belarus and calling the Russian war effort in Ukraine a \u201cdisgrace\u201d, in the first footage of the Russian warlord to emerge since his mutiny last month. The video, which was published by two Telegram channels affiliated with the Wagner mercenary company, showed a man who resembled and sounded like Prigozhin telling his fighters: \u201cWelcome to the Belarusian land! We have fought with dignity. We have done very much for Russia!\u201d Vladimir Putin last week claimed Prigozhin had rejected an offer for him to step down as the head of Wagner and allow his mercenaries to continue fighting in Ukraine. Instead, an estimated 2,000 Wagner fighters have decamped to Belarus, where some are said to be instructing Belarusian territorial forces at a training camp in Asipovichy, south-east of the capital of Minsk. The Kremlin has begun to dismantle Prigozhin\u2019s business and media empire, which managed everything from catering contracts to fake news websites. But the arrival of Wagner troops in Belarus suggests both sides are sticking to a deal hammered out during the mutiny that would allow Wagner to live in exile in Belarus. In his filmed remarks to his fighters, Prigozhin continued his criticism of the Russian military\u2019s management of the war against Ukraine, saying that Wagner troops would not fight in Ukraine for now. \u201cWhat is happening at the front now is a disgrace in which we do not need to participate,\u201d he said. \u201c[We will] wait for the moment when we can prove ourselves in full.\u201d The Wagner Orchestra Telegram channel said Prigozhin addressed several thousand fighters, although that was unclear from the video, which was shot in low light. In the video, Prigozhin said his fighters would remain in Belarus \u201cfor some time. The Belarusians have met us as brothers.\u201d The Belarusian defence ministry last week published video it claimed showed Wagner paramilitaries training local defence forces in tactics. Prigozhin also said Wagner mercenaries would be training at the sites in Belarus and would be \u201cgoing on a new path to Africa\u201d. The Kremlin has said that it would seek to keep paramilitaries in Africa, where their work brings diplomatic benefits and is also considered to be extremely profitable, with Wagner receiving land and mining concessions as payment for protection and fighting from cash-poor governments. \u201cPerhaps we will return to the special military operation at the moment when we are sure that we will not be forced to put ourselves to shame,\u201d he added, using the preferred term in Russia for the invasion of Ukraine. Prigozhin then introduced a man he indicated was the Wagner field commander Dmitry Utkin, who is rarely photographed and had not been filmed speaking with his fighters before. Utkin goes by the callsign Wagner and is the namesake of the group. \u201cThis is not the end, this is only the beginning of the greatest work in the world, which will continue very soon,\u201d Utkin said. \u201cAnd welcome to hell,\u201d he added, saying the last words in accented English. The opposition Belarusian Hajun project, which monitors troop movements in Belarus, said it believed Prigozhin had flown from Russia to Belarus in order to deliver the address late on Tuesday evening, and later flew back to Russia. Hajun has reported that an estimated 2,000-2,500 Wagner fighters are located in Belarus. Since 11 July, 382 Wagner vehicles had entered the country in at least five organised columns, it added. Video posted to the internet has shown military vehicles said to carry Wagner fighters travelling into Belarus from Russia. Satellite data for the camp at Asipovichy indicates that as many as 7,500 fighters could be housed there, although the number of Wagner paramilitaries appears smaller. The arrival of heavy vehicles and large troop numbers is a new development this week, suggesting that the hastily struck agreement during last month\u2019s mutiny is now being implemented. The Pentagon earlier this month said it believed that most of Wagner\u2019s troops remained at their bases in Ukraine but were not actively involved in fighting on the frontline."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b223a8", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/19/yvonne-littlewood-obtituar", "primaryCategory": "tv-and-radio", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Yvonne Littlewood obituary", "lead": "First female television producer and director in the BBC\u2019s light entertainment department", "author": "Anthony Hayward", "datePublished": "2023-07-19 18:31:28", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.232528", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/3f950398f6ed3635b951ad7c49fa9e8f7351f9b2/0_396_1971_1182/500.jpg", "body": "Yvonne Littlewood, who has died aged 95, was BBC television\u2019s first female producer and director in its light entertainment department. Along with Patricia Foy for music, Margaret Dale for dance and Grace Wyndham Goldie for talk programmes, she was a trailblazer for women behind the scenes in television. Her early successes included the Eurovision song contest in 1960, when the fifth annual extravaganza of countries battling for the musical title took place in London for the first time, at the Royal Festival Hall. Littlewood worked on it as the programme coordinator, not helped when the scoreboard recorded Austria\u2019s five votes to France as seven. The following year, she directed the British heats and then, in 1963, the final, hosted by BBC Television Centre. It was a logistical challenge, spread over three studios, with the audience, the host, Katie Boyle, and the scoreboard in one, the performers and orchestra in another and the British jury in a third. The quick changeover of sets between the 16 acts led to rumours that parts of the live programme were recorded, but this was emphatically denied. Another controversy came when Norway\u2019s jury was not ready with its votes as Boyle asked for them, and gave intermediate scores \u2013 which proved very different from the final ones it read out later, securing victory for its Scandinavian neighbour Denmark. Littlewood began the programme with shots from the sky above, showing off the newly built Television Centre. \u201cYou have to do something to establish the country, wherever it\u2019s being held,\u201d she explained. \u201cWe landed this helicopter on the roof. It was exciting to do that.\u201d Over the next 27 years, Littlewood immersed herself as a producer in light entertainment series and specials starring popular singers. She had long runs with Petula Clark (1966-74), Nana Mouskouri (1968-76), whom she had met at the 1963 Eurovision song contest, and Val Doonican (1976-88). In 1968, the BBC released her for six weeks when she was asked to co-produce an American TV special for Clark on the NBC network. The programme, Petula, featured Harry Belafonte as the guest star. After Clark held his arm while singing a duet, the director insisted on reshooting it, with the stars standing apart, because of objections from the show\u2019s sponsor on racial grounds. Clark subsequently objected, Littlewood wiped the second version and the original was used. Although she disliked the nature of programme-making by committee in the US, Littlewood made further shows there with Clark. She retired from the BBC in 1986 but continued as a guest producer until 1990, when she made A Royal Birthday Gala as Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, celebrated her 90th. Born in Maidstone, Kent, Yvonne was the daughter of Joan (nee Ball) and Eric Littlewood, a bank manager. The family moved briefly to King\u2019s Lynn, Norfolk, then Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire, where Yvonne excelled at ballet and played the piano while her parents sang with the local amateur operatic and dramatic society. In 1944, she joined the BBC as a secretary in its finance department at the Alexandra Palace studios in London. Two years later, she moved to television and, in 1947, became production secretary to the first producer-director of TV light entertainment programmes, Michael Mills. Together, they worked on shows such as Saturday Night at the Palace (1947-48). Littlewood, who had a particular love of music, was then promoted to production assistant. She said: \u201cIn those days, the BBC was very much a man\u2019s world.\u201d Nevertheless, she managed to demonstrate her skill, particularly when in 1956 Bill Cotton \u2013 the BBC\u2019s future head of light entertainment \u2013 began as a producer-director and found himself in a tangle. She was able to show him how to cut from one camera to another in sync with the music. Her own career as a producer began with Soft Lights and Sweet Music, The Perry Como Music Hall (both 1960-61) and a 1961 Russ Conway series. The following year, her star-studded programmes featured Kenny Ball, Nelson Riddle, Shirley Bassey, Cleo Laine and Johnny Dankworth, and Johnny Mathis. Later specials included stars such as Olivia Newton-John (1977), Tony Bennett (1979), Tommy Steele (1981), John Denver (1982) and James Galway (1986). Littlewood also worked as producer or director on four Royal Variety Performances between 1970 and 1986. In the 1970s, she was still the only woman among 20 male producers in light entertainment, but the situation at the BBC slowly improved as a result of a report in 1985 by Monica Sims, the corporation\u2019s first female director of radio programmes. Littlewood was appointed MBE in 1986. \u2022 Yvonne Mary Pearl Littlewood, producer and director, born 22 July 1927; died 7 July 2023"}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b223a9", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jul/19/asdas-profit-margins-at-the-pump-have-trebled-mps-told", "primaryCategory": "business", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Asda\u2019s profit margins at the pump have trebled, MPs told", "lead": "Competition regulator tells business committee of \u2018significant change\u2019 in retailer\u2019s fuel pricing", "author": "Sarah Butler and Yassin El-Moudden", "datePublished": "2023-07-19 18:30:54", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.232563", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/5a1b6caa06bc2ecb5536406a14cdd17154e603d0/0_115_3000_1800/500.jpg", "body": "Asda\u2019s profit margins on fuel have tripled since before the pandemic, according to the competition regulator at a bad-tempered parliamentary hearing where the supermarket chain\u2019s co-owner repeatedly refused to explain its pricing strategy. Mohsin Issa declined to answer multiple questions on whether Asda had increased its profit margins on fuel since its takeover in 2021, prompting MPs on the business select committee to become increasingly furious as the retailer insisted it had not changed its strategy. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) published a report this month saying that drivers were paying more for petrol and diesel than before the Covid pandemic because of \u201cweakened\u201d competition. The CMA told the committee there had been a \u201csignificant change\u201d in the supermarket\u2019s pricing approach after its \u00a36.8bn takeover by the billionaire Issa brothers and their private equity partner in 2021. Asda is now set to buy the UK arm of the Issas\u2019 EG Group petrol forecourts business for \u00a32.27bn, tightening its grip at the pump. Petrol has become a lightning rod for concerns about the rising cost of living as soaring inflation on food, energy and other everyday essentials has squeezed household budgets. Supermarkets are under the spotlight with the CMA also set to report on whether they have been banking additional profits on groceries \u2013 so called \u201cgreedflation\u201d. Jonathan Gullis, an MP on the committee, said on Wednesday that \u201cpeople were being ripped off at the pump\u201d at a time when the cost of living was \u201calready forcing a squeeze at the till from supermarkets\u201d. He said that only when the competition watchdog effectively \u201cnamed and shamed\u201d what was happening that \u201csuddenly supermarkets magically managed to find a way to take 6p per litre off their costs\u201d. Darren Jones, the chairman of the committee, said a whistleblower had told him that under Asda\u2019s former owner Walmart, the retailer had aimed to be at least 1p per litre cheaper than its nearest rival but the new owners had reduced that target to just 0.1p. In faltering words, a quietly-spoken Issa refused to confirm whether that was the case, saying there were many elements that contributed to decisions on fuel pricing. He insisted the group had not changed its strategy, saying Asda was \u201cproud of being a price leader\u201d and, while he refused to say directly whether the new management had increased profit margins on fuel, he suggested the group had, saying \u201cwe invested that margin into food\u201d. \u201cWe don\u2019t see this as a fuel business on its own. We see this as a holistic business,\u201d he said. The retailer\u2019s overall profit margins had fallen from 2.7% to 1.7% under his ownership, Issa said. He insisted he was \u201cabsolutely in touch with where customers are coming from\u201d having grown up in a \u201ctwo-up, two-down\u201d and said Asda had invested in keeping food prices down and in its loyalty scheme. Before Issa gave evidence, Dan Turnbull, the director of the CMA, told the committee that the chain had stuck with its strategy of being price leader but had altered course on two other aspects \u2013 increasing profit margins and to \u201cdeliberately feather\u201d prices \u2013 or to take more time to react to drops in the wholesale price of fuel. He said this was particularly the case on diesel where there had been a lot of volatility in prices. \u201cWe found that between 2021 and 2023 they significantly increased their internal fuel margin targets on a pence per litre basis, and indeed by 2023 those pence per litre targets were three times what they\u2019d been in 2019,\u201d he said. The competition regulator has said it expects the government to bring in new legislation to ensure fuel retailers provide up-to-date pricing data to a planned comparison service. On Monday, the energy secretary, Grant Shapps, appeared to row back on plans for a law to force supermarkets to make fuel prices more transparent, instead backing a voluntary price scheme."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b223aa", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jul/19/byelection-seats-thursday-uxbridge-and-south-ruislip-somerton-and-frome-selby-and-ainsty", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Which byelection seats are being fought \u2013 and will the Tories lose them?", "lead": "Polls in Uxbridge and South Ruislip, Somerton and Frome, and Selby and Ainsty will test the government\u2019s popularity on Thursday \u2013 but local issues are also at the fore", "author": "Aubrey Allegretti  Senior political correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-07-19 18:27:23", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.232598", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/9e37c24d7cb9ffe3f6d2dff664e8de2d2ab70e6a/0_458_8176_4905/500.jpg", "body": "These are the seats being contested on Thursday: Uxbridge and South Ruislip Boris Johnson\u2019s former seat, this area on the fringes of west London should be the easiest for Labour to take from the Conservatives. It has the smallest Tory majority \u2013 about 7,200 votes in 2019 \u2013 and the former prime minister has been totally absent from the contest, suggesting he is not seen as an electoral asset. The only engagement he is said to have had is a 30-second phone call with the Tory candidate, Steve Tuckwell, a local councillor and business consultant. Labour\u2019s Danny Beales is a charity worker and was born and raised here. However, critics have accused him of being parachuted in by pointing to the fact he is a councillor in Camden, several miles away. It\u2019s a heavily car-reliant area, sitting just within London\u2019s orbital M25, and the London mayor\u2019s plans to expand the ultra-low emissions zone to reduce air pollution have become a central feature of the contest. Given the cost of living is such a pressing concern, the fee some drivers will incur because of Sadiq Khan\u2019s decision has been a prominent part of Tory attacks. Such moves, Conservative activists hope, will help stem apathy among their traditional voters and give them a fighting chance of holding on. The seat has voted Tory stretching back to the 1970s, under its old incarnation and current boundaries. It voted 52.7% leave in the EU referendum, and is home to a significant number of retired people, though its demographics have changed in recent years, with an influx of younger families. Somerton and Frome While it is a solid Conservative seat with a 19,000 majority at the last election, this quaint pocket of Somerset was held by the Liberal Democrats between 1997 and 2015. Ever since allegations about the outgoing Tory MP, David Warburton, emerged 15 months ago \u2013 which he denies \u2013 the Lib Dems have ploughed time and resources into preparing for the moment the race officially began. That means that despite the seemingly huge mountain to climb, it is strangely the seat that bookies say is the most likely to flip. Much of the area is rural \u2013 and the Lib Dems have sought to replicate the success they managed last year in managing to clinch a seismic victory in Tiverton and Honiton. Tactical voting between those on the left, combined with apathy among habitual Tories, has led to Labour writing off much involvement in the fight and instead focusing their energies elsewhere. Sarah Dyke, the Lib Dem candidate, says she has been treated like the new MP for some time, given complaints about Warbuton\u2019s absence. Faye Purbrick, the Conservative candidate, is a councillor and similarly paints herself as someone who can hit the ground running. She has pointed to visits from a string of ministers, such as Michael Gove and Grant Shapps, as evidence the Tories are still fighting to retain the seat. Selby and Ainsty A picturesque collection of towns and villages sprawling across North Yorkshire, this constituency is uncomfortably close to Rishi Sunak\u2019s own of Richmond. The byelection was triggered by Nigel Adams, a staunch ally of Johnson, when he was passed over for a peerage, and as such, some residents are frustrated at being left in the lurch by what they say is his \u201cpetty\u201d resignation from parliament. Overturning the Tories\u2019 majority of 20,000 votes would be a huge coup for Labour \u2013 and would show they could threaten the Tories not just in metropolitan seats and their traditional former industrial heartlands, but in rural areas, too. It is a very high bar to clear, however. Labour would need a swing of about 18% to pull off a win over the Conservative candidate, Claire Holmes. Labour\u2019s candidate, Keir Mather, would become the \u201cbaby of the house\u201d by being the youngest MP, if elected. The future of the local Drax power station and concerns about the affordability and development of housing in the area are issues local people raised during the campaign. Adams\u2019s departure and broader discontent with Sunak, as well as frustration at the cost of living and access to healthcare, have also featured. Selby voted for Brexit by 59.2%, and the wider constituency is littered with church spires and historic battle sites. Under its reconfigured boundaries that will take effect at the next general election, the seat is more likely to swing towards Labour."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b223ab", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jul/19/sunak-braverman-and-city-regulator-wade-into-farage-banking-row", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Sunak, Braverman and City regulator wade into Farage banking row", "lead": "FCA chief says banks cannot \u2018discriminate\u2019 against political views, but chair argues it\u2019s up to Coutts \u2018who they do business with\u2019", "author": "Kalyeena Makortoff and Ben Quinn", "datePublished": "2023-07-19 18:22:14", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.232633", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/a1d5cbf241e9d7c23a51c2cd7c586a66088dc823/0_182_5472_3283/500.jpg", "body": "The City regulator has said it has contacted the owner of Coutts bank amid a growing row over its decision to close Nigel Farage\u2019s accounts, but told MPs that while lenders cannot discriminate against customers, it is ultimately up to firms to decide who to do business with.

Coutts, an exclusive private lender that caters for royals and the global super-rich, terminated its relationship with Farage earlier this year. On Tuesday, the Brexit campaigner and former UK Independence party leader released internal documents obtained from the bank, which stated it was concerned about his \u201cxenophobic, chauvinistic and racist views\u201d and believed maintaining his accounts posed a risk to the bank\u2019s reputation.

Speaking at a hearing of parliament\u2019s Treasury select committee, Rathi said: \u201cYou\u2019re not able to discriminate on the basis of political views either.\u201d However, the FCA chair, Ashley Alder, suggested lenders had some discretion around customers: \u201cFor banks as well as other commercial enterprises, it\u2019s fundamentally up to them to choose who they do business with.\u201d In a series of interventions, ministers and Conservative MPs piled in on the controversy, with Jacob Rees-Mogg pressing Rishi Sunak to open a public inquiry during prime minister\u2019s questions.

Speaking during a press conference in Warwick, Sunak said: \u201cIt\u2019s not right for anyone to be denied financial services because they\u2019re exercising their lawful right to free speech. That\u2019s why the government passed laws that are being consulted on that make sure banks do deal with what are called \u2018politically exposed persons\u2019 in a proportionate way.\u201d The Treasury is reportedly considering increasing the notice period before banks close accounts from 30 days to three months after the row, according to Sky News. In a Twitter post, the home secretary, Suella Braverman, accused NatWest Group of \u201cpolitically biased dogma\u201d, claiming \u201cthe Coutts scandal exposes the sinister nature of much of the Diversity, Equity &amp; Inclusion industry\u201d, while the City minister, Andrew Griffith, said in a tweet that financial services should not be denied to those \u201cexercising their right to lawful free speech\u201d. \u201cThe privilege of a banking licence in a democracy should imply a duty not to \u2018debank\u2019 because you disagree with someone\u2019s views,\u201d said Griffith. Farage has railed against Coutts for weeks, originally claiming its decision to close his account was linked to the fact he was categorised as a politically exposed person (PEP), who would be subject to additional financial crime checks. He also said this was the reason he had been denied services by nine other lenders as he tried to shift his cash. Farage had held personal and business accounts for his media work company, Thorn in the Side Ltd, with Coutts. A spokesperson for Farage refused to say whether he would accept an offer to become a NatWest customer. The bank ultimately decided to cut ties with the former politician once his mortgage expired this year. Without a mortgage, Farage fell below the bank\u2019s financial threshold, which requires its customers to hold at least \u00a33m in savings, or borrow or invest at least \u00a31m with the bank. It was previously reported that this was the reason the bank had removed him as a customer. \u201cThe relationship has been below commercial criteria for some time and upon review of Nigel\u2019s past public profile and connections, the perceived risks for the future weighed against the benefit of retention, the decision was taken to exit upon repayment of an existing mortgage,\u201d the internal Coutts report, published by the Telegraph and Daily Mail, stated. Everyone in the UK has a right to a basic bank account, which offers the ability to receive and make payments. However, UK banks, like most businesses, are free to deny additional services to customers if they pose a risk to their reputation. It is considered a commercial decision but is still subject to fair treatment and equality concerns \u2013 meaning individuals cannot be denied on the basis of protected characteristics like gender or race. The FCA\u2019s Rathi explained to MPs that it would now be up to Farage to file a complaint with the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS), which would take into account both the former politician\u2019s concerns and the bank\u2019s rationale. Farage\u2019s spokesperson did not immediately confirm whether he had lodged a formal complaint. A Coutts spokesperson said the bank could not comment on the case in detail due to client confidentiality rules. \u201cHowever, it is not Coutts\u2019 policy to close customer accounts solely on the basis of legally held political and personal views. Decisions to close an account are not taken lightly and involve a number of factors including commercial viability, reputational considerations and legal and regulatory requirements. \u201cWe recognise the critical importance of access to banking. When it became clear that our client was unable to secure banking facilities elsewhere, and as he has confirmed publicly, he was offered alternative banking facilities with NatWest. That offer stands,\u201d the bank added. \u201cWe understand the public concern that the processes for ending a customer relationship, and how that is communicated, are not sufficiently transparent. We welcome the anticipated HM Treasury recommendations in this area, alongside the ask to prioritise the review of the regulatory rules relating to politically exposed persons. \u201cWe look forward to working with government, the regulator and the wider industry to ensure that universal access to banking is maintained,\u201d Coutts said."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b223ac", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jul/19/enrique-zapata-bravo-obituary", "primaryCategory": "society", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Enrique Zapata-Bravo obituary", "lead": "<strong>Other lives:</strong> Psychiatrist who moved to England fleeing the Pinochet regime and worked to help refugees across the UK and around the world", "author": "Liz Peretz", "datePublished": "2023-07-19 18:10:23", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.232672", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/1d6345aecd1531a4789b5b94bbf69046e4957968/0_89_460_276/master/460.jpg", "body": "My friend Enrique Zapata-Bravo, who has died aged 83, was a psychiatrist in hospitals and secure units across the country, a supporter of refugees with a history of torture and an expert who travelled on World Health Organization missions in Africa. Having trained in psychiatry in Oxford and Buckinghamshire, Enrique became a member of the Royal College of Psychiatrists in 1986. Over the following decades he worked as a consultant psychiatrist in Oxford, Milton Keynes and Northampton; lectured in Canada, Spain, Argentina and Chile; taught postgraduate students; and published original research. From the 1980s he worked tirelessly for victims of torture as an independent consultant and a medico-legal expert at the Helen Bamber Foundation, helping scores of refugees to remain in the UK. In 2019, he made a landmark contribution in the case of KV, an asylum seeker from Sri Lanka, by convincing the supreme court that the man had indeed been tortured and that his wounds were not self-inflicted, as the Home Office claimed. Born in Osorno in the south of Chile, Enrique attended the Liceo de Hombres de Osorno, and went to medical school at the University of Chile, Santiago, where has also took a post-graduate course in public health. He met Flor Duran, then a student, later a teacher, in a student summer camp in the southern mountains, working with the impoverished Mapuche communities of Auraucania. Shortly after they married, in 1964, he set up a pioneering clinic for the widely dispersed and poor population in the far south. Later, as a consultant in chest medicine at the teaching hospital Jose Joaquin Aguirre in Santiago, he worked with miners in the copper belt. He was at the height of his career, working as director of the Institute of Respiratory Medicine at the University of Chile, when President Salvador Allende was overthrown by General Augusto Pinochet in 1973. Three years later, when Pinochet\u2019s military began to target them and their friends, Enrique, Flor and their two sons left the country and arrived in Oxford with nothing. It was through Flor\u2019s connections with the World University Service that I met the couple and taught them English. Enrique had come to Oxford to undertake medical research at the chest clinic at the Churchill hospital, and gained a master\u2019s from the University of Oxford in 1978. Finding that he needed to retake all his exams \u2013 in English this time \u2013 in order to practise, he accepted the challenge and and opted for another specialism, psychiatry. He chose to stay in the UK, where his third son was born. After retirement, Enrique continued working as a locum until 2022, but in his later life he played chess and tennis and formed a musical group, performing and explaining tangos and sambas to enthusiastic audiences. He is survived by Flor, their sons, Felipe, Camilo and Xavier, and grandchildren, Annabella, Lucas, Toni and Kika."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b223ad", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/19/the-guardian-view-on-robert-f-kennedy-jr-from-camelot-to-conspiracy-mongering", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "subCategories": "test", "title": "The Guardian view on Robert F Kennedy Jr: from Camelot to conspiracy-mongering | Editorial", "lead": "<strong>Editorial:</strong> The lawyer trades on his family\u2019s image while spreading dangerous ideas.

His own siblings disagree. His uncle\u2019s presidency, like his namesake father\u2019s career and presidential campaign, had an aura of hope and responsibility as well as glamour. RFK Jr talks vaguely of overcoming divisions, but in reality trades upon a peculiar blend of \u201ccynicism and credulity\u201d, as one commentator notes. Most recently he claimed that \u201cCovid-19 is targeted to attack Caucasians and black people. The people who are most immune are Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese,\u201d in comments reported by the New York Post. However jarring the remarks \u2013 he partially backtracked later \u2013 they sit comfortably with his long history of fomenting conspiracy theories and his nonsensical, anti-scientific views. He has falsely linked childhood immunisations to autism and wifi to cancer and \u201cleaky brain\u201d, claimed that HIV does not cause Aids, and suggested that chemicals in drinking water could make children transgender. One of his sisters warned that his latest comments put people\u2019s lives in danger. So much for the Kennedy legacy. Nor does he look like much of a Democrat. He is being hyped by billionaires and rightwing broadcasters such as Sean Hannity, and has gained traction among Republicans rather than Democrats. Some see his campaign primarily as a vehicle for his ego and brand, which may be less damaging to President Biden\u2019s chances than a possible third-party bid by Democratic senator Joe Manchin and Republican former governor Jon Huntsman\u2019s No Labels group. A poll this month suggested that a \u201cmoderate, independent third-party candidate\u201d could gain about 20% of the vote and result in a second term for Donald Trump. But talk up Mr Kennedy enough and he might have a marginal effect in denting President Biden. Others suspect that Mr Kennedy wants the Republican vice-presidential slot. Steve Bannon and Roger Stone have both floated the idea of a Trump-Kennedy ticket. None of this has prevented him finding up to 20% support among Democrats in polls. Camelot nostalgia and the celebrity factor have clearly played a large part in that. Mr Kennedy has never run for any public office, still less held it, but boasts that he\u2019s \u201cbeen around\u201d politics since he was a little boy. The lack of enthusiasm for the sitting president is also potent: most Democrats do not want him to run again, although they indicate that they would vote for him over Mr Trump. Voters, including independents, are not giving Mr Biden credit for the improving the economy or other achievements. That may not be fair. But it\u2019s a fact. Mr Kennedy\u2019s appeal goes deeper, however. He has found a home in the world described by a new book, Conspirituality, where new age spirituality and the \u201cwellness\u201d industry overlap with the politics of paranoia, as well as alongside the Trumpian right. Distrust of institutions, suspicion at the marriage of state and corporate power, and fear and sadness at the despoliation of the environment are in themselves reasonable concerns. But the political ambition that feeds upon and mutates them into more poisonous beliefs is unpalatable. Mr Kennedy\u2019s anti-vaccine conspiracy-mongering has caused enough damage. His latest remarks show how easily conspiracy theories blur into bigotry and scapegoating. It may be farcical to hear a multimillionaire from the country\u2019s most famous political dynasty railing against \u201celites\u201d, but there is nothing funny about this campaign."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b223ae", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/19/the-guardian-view-on-the-fifa-womens-world-cup-a-showcase-for-a-booming-sport", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "subCategories": "test", "title": "The Guardian view on the Fifa Women\u2019s World Cup: a showcase for a booming sport | Editorial", "lead": "<strong>Editorial:</strong> A record number of tickets have been sold in Australia and New Zealand, as the women\u2019s game continues to grow in popularity across the world", "author": "Editorial", "datePublished": "2023-07-19 18:06:01", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.232742", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/3e3f58991b96e730c2039f26cee90b88a8062246/0_165_5638_3383/500.jpg", "body": "When the inaugural Fifa-backed Women\u2019s World Cup took place in 1991, the tournament was given a weird title designed to distance it from the \u201creal\u201d competition \u2013 the one played by men. Notwithstanding a lack of resources and a belittling name, the \u201cFirst Fifa Women\u2019s World Championship for the M&amp;Ms Cup\u201d was an undeniable success and a beginning. As the ninth Women\u2019s World Cup kicks off in Australia and New Zealand on Thursday, such crass chauvinism has largely disappeared. But the booming popularity of the female game continues to outstrip expectations. The demand for tickets for Australia\u2019s opening game with the Republic of Ireland was such that the match had to be moved from a 45,000-capacity venue to Sydney\u2019s Accor Stadium, which holds more than 80,000. A year after England\u2019s Lionesses actually did bring football home by winning Euro 22, Australia\u2019s Matildas look set to enjoy a similar level of passionate backing. Plenty of other impressive numbers suggest that this World Cup will be a superb showcase for the planet\u2019s most upwardly mobile sport. Thirty-two countries \u2013 a record number \u2013 will compete in 10 venues across nine cities. Close to one and a half million tickets, another record, have already been sold. Fifa hopes for a global television audience of 2 billion, compared with the 1.12 billion viewers who tuned in to the 2019 edition in France. That figure amounted to almost a third of the television audience that watched the men\u2019s World Cup the previous year. These are stellar statistics. But this being women\u2019s football, perpetually undervalued and underfunded, due recognition and reward are never achieved without a struggle. This year, finally, broadcasting rights to the games have been sold separately from the men\u2019s competition, and the money on offer has tripled to $152m. Parity with the men has been promised for 2027. After admirable collective pressure from players for a levelling-up of pay and conditions, Fifa has also agreed to pay a proportion of the money directly to team members \u2013 an invaluable boost to the careers of those representing poorer countries in an amateur or semi-professional capacity. In a sport developing at an uneven pace across the world, in which the average salary is about \u00a311,300, much more needs to be done to level the playing field. From Thursday, though, the focus will be on the football, in what promises to be the most open and exciting Women\u2019s World Cup for a long time. The United States, winners of the past two tournaments, are a team in transition, and a hat-trick of triumphs may be beyond them. The Lionesses have the psychological boost of knowing what it takes to win a trophy, but have lost key stars such as Beth Mead and Leah Williamson to injury. In front of a fervent home audience that has already taken the Matildas to its heart, the stage could be set for Australia\u2019s prolific striker and captain, Sam Kerr, to inspire her side as Lionel Messi inspired Argentina in Qatar. As the women\u2019s game blossoms across the world, feeding off the momentum afforded by occasions such as this, the spectacle of a famously sports-mad nation in jubilation would provide a fitting climax. Whoever triumphs in a month\u2019s time, the biggest World Cup in the history of women\u2019s football also has the ingredients to become the most memorable."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b223af", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2023/jul/19/the-ashes-2023-england-v-australia-fourth-test-day-one-live-updates-score-results-eng-vs-aus-old-trafford-start-time", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "The Ashes 2023: England v Australia, fourth Test, day one \u2013 as it happened", "lead": "Stuart Broad took his 600th Test wicket as Australia ended a seesaw first day on 299 for eight after being put in by Ben Stokes", "author": "Geoff Lemon at Old Trafford (earlier) and Rob Smyth (later)", "datePublished": "2023-07-19 17:58:36", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.232778", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/4288bd10aab4943047af2ac3bd802e66669cfefb/0_241_5105_3062/500.jpg", "body": "That\u2019s it for today. Thanks for your company and emails; please join us again in the morning. Big first session you know. A bit more from Stuart Broad [On his winter playing club cricket in Melbourne] I was 17-18, living with the groundsman. I rolled the pitches, trained Tuesday and Thursday and played on Saturday and Sunday I think. I loved it: I opened the batting, opened the bowling and stuck in. [On the 600th wicket] All of us didn\u2019t think it was carrying to Rooty. We were delighted to get Head out; he hit some amazing cover drives. Tea came at a good time for us. We had a little chat about how we should bowl with the slightly softer ball. [On the ovation from the crowd] It\u2019s really nice. I love playing at Old Trafford. I got my 500th here and my dad was on the ground. It was during the Covid bubbles but he was the match referee so that was quite nice. My mum and stepdad were here today as well. [On his dad Chris\u2019s tweet about David Warner] I had a coffee with him last week and told him, \u2018You should get fined for that!\u2019 More from Stuart Broad I find Ashes series the most enjoyable to play in. I enjoy the extra scrutiny and how much the public love it. I\u2019ve been able to forge great battles with some of the Australian players over a long period of time. It\u2019s been a pleasure to play against those guys. I never really think about what I\u2019ve done on the field. The special memories are in the changing-room when you\u2019ve won a Test or a series. I\u2019d argue the last year has been the most enjoyable of my career. Aussies are generally very competitive people, and that brings out the best in me. I love that eye-to-eye battle. We play cricket to have great battles on the field but also to enjoy each other\u2019s company after the game. A lot of the players have got good relationships off the field. When we won the toss and bowled I was hoping to get it [the 600th wicket], as it would mean we\u2019re taking wickets. A nightmare day for us would have been 350-3, which could have happened when the blue sky came out. We\u2019re delighted to take eight wickets. Of all the pitches we\u2019ve played on in this series, it feels like the most balls were middled today. It felt like if you just missed, you went to the boundary. But ultimately there are wicket balls out there as well. When we won the toss we weren\u2019t hoping for 160 all out; we\u2019re just hoping for a decent chase. Stuart Broad speaks I had a few hugs and handshakes, certainly from staff who have been in the dressing-room longer than me. There\u2019s a nice ring to it, getting my 600th pole at the James Anderson End! Glenn McGrath was my hero growing up, so when I went past him last year that was really cool. I\u2019m not saying I was at his level as a bowler \u2013 if he\u2019d played more Tests he\u2019d have ended up with 700. I suppose it\u2019s a sign of longevity. I\u2019m addicted to Test cricket \u2013 I love the grit and competitiveness of it, and it feels very special to be on a list with some of the greats of the game. I remember getting my cap from Sir Ian Botham in Colombo. A lot of people say that getting your Test cap is the dream. I never felt like that. I wanted to make memories in it, win big series and experience a lot with that cap. That was my mindset. You never know when your last game will be \u2013 I\u2019m probably one of the most dropped bowlers in history! \u2013 but I feel very lucky to have played with some great teams along the way. The consensus on Sky is that it\u2019s England\u2019s day, just about. They looked in trouble when Australia were 120 for two and 183 for three but took wickets at vital times, sometimes in strange ways. Eight of Australia\u2019s top nine reached double figures; nobody scored more than 51. Chris Woakes was the star, taking 4-52, but it\u2019s Stuart Broad who leads the team off. He took his 600th Test wicket \u2013 just think how much hard yakka that entails \u2013 when Travis Head was caught on the hook. He\u2019s England\u2019s greatest Ashes cricketer since Sir Ian Botham, so it\u2019s no surprise he reached the milestone against Australia. 83rd over: Australia 299-8 (Starc 23, Cummins 1) Woakes may never have a better chance of a first Ashes five-fer. He almost gets it when Starc is beaten by an outswinger, but he survives and that\u2019s the end of a compelling first day\u2019s play. 82nd over: Australia 298-8 (Starc 23, Cummins 0) James Anderson, 40, returnes for a single oover before the cose. Starc has an almighty hack across the line, inside-edging the ball past the stumps for four. Anderson walks back to his mark smiling. They got to him as well. Though he has been nowhere near his best today, Anderson has again been pretty unlucky. You should see his xW! 81st over: Australia 294-8 (Starc 19, Cummins 0) Chris Woakes has had another day out: 18-3-51-4. All ten of his wickets in this series have been proper batters, even if Carey is No8 in this game. Chris Woakes strikes with the second new ball! Carey tried to leave one outside off stump, was too late in doing so and got a thin inside edge through to Bairstow. That was similar to his dismissal at Headingley, when he tried to leave Woakes and dragged the ball onto his stumps. 80th over: Australia 293-7 (Carey 20, Starc 19) The diminuendo continues with a maiden from Wood to Carey. At Headingley, Carey struggled against Wood\u2019s pace but today he has been rock-solid in defence. The attacking strokes can wait until tomorrow. After an interlude of 21 runs in 12 overs, it\u2019s time for the second new ball. 79th over: Australia 293-7 (Carey 20, Starc 19) Starc finally plays an attacking stroke off Moeen, dumping a slog-sweep for four. He\u2019s a place too low at No9, and has looked very comfortable in making 19 from 56 balls. 78th over: Australia 289-7 (Carey 20, Starc 15) Mark Wood returns for one last spell. His first ball is a slightly apologetic bouncer to Carey, though it\u2019s still clocked at 91mph. Wood laughs and runs back to his mark. Carey turns down a couple of singles, continuing his policy of protecting the tail from Wood\u2019s pace, and as a result it\u2019s a maiden. We\u2019ve had 17 runs from the last 10 overs, a sleepy end to another eventful day. 77th over: Australia 289-7 (Carey 20, Starc 15) Carey reaches for a nice delivery from Moeen and edges wide of slip for three runs. It wouldn\u2019t have carried anyway. 76th over: Australia 286-7 (Carey 17, Starc 15) Starc pulls Woakes round the corner for a single. We\u2019re four overs away from the second new ball, so I may have been premature in suggesting James Anderson\u2019s work was done for the day. \u201cRegarding wickets taken since 2008 (over 68), it\u2019s notable that the next England names on the list (after Swann) are Ali, Stokes, and Woakes,\u201d says Peter Hanes. \u201cIs this England\u2019s wicketiest ever attack?\u201d It\u2019s not just England\u2019s, it\u2019s the highest for any team. The six main bowlers, including Stokes, had 1916 Test wickets between them at the start of the game, which puts them a nose ahead of the England attack at Trent Bridge in 1993. 75th over: Australia 284-7 (Carey 16, Starc 14) Stalemate. \u201cThe new England/New Zealand approach to cricket means averages are now of little relevance,\u201d writes Dean Bainbridge. \u201cThe entire approach assumes nobody will get \u2018average\u2019 scores - the approach allows failure. It is actually expected that some batters or bowlers will fail, safe in the knowledge that the freedom their colleagues play under allows them to more than make up for low scores or wicketless periods. \u201cStatistically, it just needs 2-3 players to play well for decent scores to be posted. It\u2019ll work for a team with genuine talent and potential, but it\u2019s perfect for this England team. It explains Moen\u2019s inclusion - on a statistical basis, he\u2019ll be nowhere near this team, but just his potential for runs and wickets sees him picked. He could hit a century in a session, or get out reverse sweeping; it\u2019s all the same as far as England are concerned.\u201d Especially if it means Joe Root doesn\u2019t have to bat at No3. 74th over: Australia 283-7 (Carey 16, Starc 13) Woakes replaces Anderson, whose confusing day ends with figures of 16-4-39-0. Carey back cuts his third ball for foour, a nice shot from a player who looks in control again after a loose batting performance at Headingley. England\u2019s ageing attack \u2013 Wood is the youngest at 33 \u2013 are looking weary, and Australia might be missing a trick by not applying more pressure. Even with that boundary, there have been only 11 runs from the last six overs. 73rd over: Australia 277-7 (Carey 11, Starc 12) Moeen has found a deecnt rhythm in this spell, probably helped by the fact they haven\u2019t played any attacking strokes. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting that you mentioned Keith Miller, because it seems his shadow has loomed over Australian selections ever since he retired,\u201d says Martyn Gillam. \u201cThere\u2019s been a near obsession with finding an \u2018all rounder,\u2019 with a penchant for picking blokes who aren\u2019t really the true deal, but who scratch the selectors\u2019 itch. There\u2019s been a long list including Graeme Watson, Shane Watson, younger Mitch Marsh and now Cameron Green who has been anointed with \u2018automatic selection\u2019 status even when his results don\u2019t justify it. How much would Australia like a mulligan right now and swap him for Murphy to bowl in the fourth innings? The fact is, players like Miller, Sobers and Kallis are a rare breed, and selectors shouldn\u2019t be putting square pegs in round holes to try to recreate them.\u201d Simon Burnton\u2019s Ashes diary 72nd over: Australia 277-7 (Carey 11, Starc 12) It\u2019s hard to know what a good score is on this pitch, though instinct says between 300 and 350. All the batters have reached double figures apart from Khawaja, yet nobody has gone past 51. England\u2019s bowling has been mixed \u2013 lots of jaffas, lots of fourballs \u2013 and the old ball is still doing enough for Anderson to lift one past Starc\u2019s outside edge. 71st over: Australia 276-7 (Carey 11, Starc 11) \u201cI agree that Carey batting at No8 is crazy,\u201d says Brian Withington. \u201cShouldn\u2019t there a rule against a team fielding as many decent batters as Australia? Don\u2019t they know that fair play dictates that you should always include a spinner batting at three, preferably one coming out of retirement with a dodgy finger?\u201d If you think Australia\u2019s tail looks strong today, check out South Africa\u2019s at Adelaide in 1997-98. Nos 7-11 were Brian McMillan, David Richardson, Shaun Pollock, Lance Klusener and Pat Symcox. The daft thing is they needed to win the game to draw the series, yet they beefed up their batting. I suppose it almost worked. 70th over: Australia 274-7 (Carey 10, Starc 10) The momentum has shifted subtly throughout the day; so has the tempo. We\u2019re having a quiet little spell at the moment, with Anderson conceding a single from his 15th over. \u201cDear Monsieur Smyth,\u201d begins your friend and mine, Robert Wilson. \u201cPeople are very fond of Moeen (and disturbingly proud of themselves for it). That\u2019s charming but I watched that spell and the Aussies were taking an actual rest. It was saved from being embarrassing by the first five overs of Bairstow\u2019s classic Dadaist keeping (might be his most ironic yet). He seems a genuinely decent bloke and I truly hope that this becomes an absolute reverse hex resulting in him knocking out an effortless double hundred but a wrong-way-round 27/37 average is giving me flashbacks to the worst bits of the 1990s.\u201d Usually I\u2019d agree with you. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m not going to agree with you. Am I really going to disagree with you when Moeen is averaging 16 and 55 in the series? I jolly well am, you know. I can\u2019t really see a credible alternative, and this highly peculiar line-up feels like the best solution to a bespoke problem. The other thing is that simple averages have become less relevant under Stokes and McCullum, although the geek in me, who grew up Tony Gray was the greatest bowler of all time, is weeping at that thought. 69th over: Australia 273-7 (Carey 9, Starc 10) With two left-handers at the crease, Moeen Ali replaces Chris Woakes (15-3-43-3). A quiet first over, one from it. In other news, look at this catch. 68th over: Australia 272-7 (Carey 8, Starc 10) I wonder how Peter Moores, who started the Branderson era by dropping Steve Harmison and Matthew Hoggard at Wellington in 2008, felt when Stuart Broad took his 600th Test wicket. Anderson and Broad are the only seamers in history to take 600 Test wickets. Since Moores made that decision, Anderson and Broad have taken 626 and 599 wickets respectively; nobody else has 500 in that time. Anderson returns to the attack. Starc edges on the bounce to sleep and then flicks successive half-volleys through midwicket for four. He\u2019s using his wife Alyssa Healy\u2019s bat, and he borrowed her timing with those two strokes. 67th over: Australia 264-7 (Carey 8, Starc 2) Carey turns Woakes round the corner for two, with Wood doing absurdly well to save the boundary at fine leg. Woakes switches round the wicket, until Carey drives him straight for four and he moves back over. Carey is a helluva No8 in any team. 66th over: Australia 258-7 (Carey 2, Starc 2) A quiet over from Wood, which is to say I was editing/replying to the email below, and that\u2019s drinks. \u201cA good keeper would have taken that to hands,\u201d says Dechlan Brennan. \u201cEven Bairstow\u2019s catches look ugly. Ian Healy (perhaps the best keeper of all time) has hammered him on Australian TV and that\u2019s correct. You\u2019ll say it\u2019s a great catch with your English lens on though.\u201d Ah, come on, we may be England or Australia fans but we\u2019re all two-eyed. For want of a much, much, much less pompous phrase, I thought it was a great catch with my empathy lens on. Ian Healy is probably the best wicketkeeping analyst around, so we should all defer to him on technical matters. But after everything Bairstow has been through, that was a charming moment of human triumph. 65th over: Australia 256-7 (Carey 1, Starc 1) Woakes angles a good delivery past Starc\u2019s outside edge. He\u2019s taken nine wickets at an average of 20 in this series, all proper batsmen. And crucially, he has dismissed Keith Miller Mitchell Marsh three times. Nobody ese looks like getting him out. Starc takes a single off the last ball, which means he\u2019ll be facing Mark Wood at the start of the next over. Hmm. \u201cWith the sound effects that accompanied Alex Carey to the wicket, I think you may need to give Yvette Campbell (58th over) an update \u2026\u201d says Tom Adam. 64th over: Australia 255-7 (Carey 1, Starc 0) Poor Chris Woakes. Even when he takes two wickets in an over, he\u2019s overshadowed by somebody else. Near flawless human being that he is, he won\u2019t mind one bit. Wood continues \u2013 I suspect he would have taken a break had Marsh and Green still been at the crease \u2013 and Carey turns down a single to deep backward point. That\u2019s seems an odd decision, with Mitchell Starc at the crease and Pat Cummins still to come, but I\u2019d imagine he\u2019s just trying to see Wood out of the attack. If so, chapeau; if not, what are you doing, man. 63rd over: Australia 255-7 (Carey 1, Starc 0) The celebrations of that wicket were delightful. Ben Stokes charged towards Bairstow and seemed to break into song at one point. After all he\u2019s been through, that\u2019s such a lovely, life-affirming moment. And it wasn\u2019t any old wicket, either, because Mitch Marsh was batting marvellously. Jonny Bairstow has taken a sensational catch to dismiss Mitch Marsh! Chris Woakes has taken two in an over and England are on top again. Marsh was turned round by a beauty and edged it between wicketkeeper and first slip. Bairstow changed direction, plunged to his right and grabbed the ball just about the turf. He celebrated in style, spreading his arms and legs wide before he was swamped by his teammates. They could not be more delighted for him. Heeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeere\u2019s Jonny! If you want a job done, and you\u2019re in England, ask Chris Woakes to do it. He has struck with the first ball of a new spell, trapping Cam Green LBW. Green lunged around his front pad and was hit just above the kneeroll. Joel Wilson gave it out on the field, and that was crucial because it was umpire\u2019s call on height. Green reviewed unsuccessfully, and he might feel a bit aggrieved because that was only just hitting the bails. Either way, it\u2019s the end of an unconvincing, slightly tenative innings. 62nd over: Australia 254-5 (Marsh 51, Green 16) Wood implores Nitin Menon to raise the finger when Green is hit on the boot by a sizzling yorker. It was bat first - just - and the umpire rightly says not out. Wood tries another yorker later in the over, but it\u2019s too straight and Marsh puts it away for four. That brings up another dominant, hard-hitting fifty from just 57 balls. From nowhere he has become a key man in this series; no batter on either side looks in such good touch. 61st over: Australia 245-5 (Marsh 46, Green 12) Another full toss from Moeen is driven down the ground for four by Marsh. England have bowled too many fourballs today, and it might be time for a change at this end. Marsh looks in complete control against Moeen. 60th over: Australia 241-5 (Marsh 42, Green 12) Though Wood hasn\u2019t found his Headingley rhythm today, he has still given everyone the hurry-up. Even Marsh, who eats extreme pace bowling without needing a knife and fork, is playing him respectfully. Marsh turns a straight ball into the leg side for two, which brings up an important fifty partnership from just 60 balls. Australia\u2019s running has been much more aggressive today. 59th over: Australia 237-5 (Marsh 39, Green 11) Marsh fails to punish another low full toss from Moeen, who is once again in little-girl-with-the-little-curl mode. He has bowled some fine deliveries too, and as I type he skids one past Marsh\u2019s defensive push. Probably fair to say Broad and Moeen weren\u2019t the right combination for Mitch Marsh; his combined Test average against them is in excess of 300. 58th over: Australia 232-5 (Marsh 35, Green 11) Stokes misses a run-out chance! Green knocked the new bowler Wood into the covers and loudly rejected the offer of a single. Marsh was halfway down the track when Green gave him the bad news, but Stokes couldn\u2019t pick the ball up cleanly on the run. He howled at the sky in frustration when he realised. That allowed Wood a few more deliveries at Green, two of which flew past the outside edge. He\u2019s riding his luck. \u201c1.30am in Oz,\u201d writes Yvette Campbell. \u201cReading your updates under the covers in bed, sound off so as not to wake hubby next to me. As I cannot hear the coverage, I was wondering how the crowds have been acting towards the Australians. Have they been polite and fair, or booing Aussies at every opportunity? I\u2019ve loved cricket since I can remember, but the crowd and members\u2019 behaviour at Lords truly shocked me. The Ashes lost something that day.\u201d There were some pantomime boos for Warner and Smith, the usual nonsense, but I can\u2019t recall anything else today. That incident at Lord\u2019s feels a bit weirder every day. 57th over: Australia 232-5 (Marsh 34, Green 11) The increasingly dangerous Marsh drives Moeen through extra cover for successive boundaries. Both were fine shots, though the second came off a low full toss. It\u2019s been a mixed bag from Moeen today: 9-0-46-1. Marsh, meanwhile, has smacked 31 off his last 22 deliveries. He has already taken Broad and Moeen apart in this series, and he played Wood superbly at Headingley, so England are running out of options. 56th over: Australia 223-5 (Marsh 25, Green 11) Green is beaten all ends up by an extravagant leg-cutter from Broad, who is bowling by far his best spell of the day. A big inswinger is forced down the ground for a single, which brings Marsh back on strike. Marsh has a great record against Broad, with a head-to-head average of around 175 in Tests. As if to prove the point, he chips Broad contemptuously over mid-off for a one-bounce four. What sort of way is that to treat a man who\u2019s just taken his 600th Test wicket? Whatever the outcome, it\u2019s turning into one of the all-time great Ashes series. We hope you are relishing this live coverage, brought to you in long, persistent spells fby our team of cricket writers. Whoever you are supporting in this series, if you find these OBOs bring some value to your life, we hope you might consider supporting the Guardian as well. Think of it as an important contribution to our own first-innings total, like a cheeky 10 not out from a tailender that makes the bottom line look so much better. If you can, please support us on a monthly basis from just \u00a32. It takes less than a minute to set up on this page. Thank you. 55th over: Australia 217-5 (Marsh 20, Green 10) Marsh defends a peculiar little grubber from Moeen Ali. It was wide enough that he wouldn\u2019t have been out LBW had he missed it, but it\u2019s surprising to see a ball like that on day one. Moeen ends a good over with a quicker delivery that skids on to hit Marsh on the back pad. England go up for LBW but it was missing off. 54th over: Australia 216-5 (Marsh 20, Green 9) Green is struggling against Broad. He edges along the ground for four and then plays and misses outside off stump. Marsh, who looks far more comfortable, thumps an uppish drive for two. Saying which, the next ball nips back to hit Marsh on the thigh. Well bowled. \u201cI recall reading that the Australians stated that they always liked to include a spinner,\u201d writes Colum Fordham. \u201cAnd yet they have omitted Todd Murphy, a decent replacement for Nathan Lyon. I\u2019m hoping that Moeen Ali\u2019s role as an off-spinner could prove a crucial difference in this vital test and that the Aussie selectors will rue their decision to include two all-rounders and just Head as a part-time twirler.\u201d Though I understand the logic, it\u2019s very unusual for Australia. The last time it happened was in 2012, and on two of the lats three occasions they tried it against England (Oval 2009 and Melbourne 2010), they lost the Ashes. England do it more often, though that is partly because of the quality of their spinners in comparison to Australia\u2019s. I think they did it only once, at Headingley in 2012, when Graeme Swann was in his imperial phase. 53rd over: Australia 209-5 (Marsh 18, Green 4) Marsh was very cautious before tea, but now he\u2019s back in Headingley mode. He launches Moeen over long on for six, then defends the remainder of the over on the back foot. \u201cI guess Moeen\u2019s wickets should be officially described as \u2018sweet\u2019 from now on,\u201d says John Starbuck, \u201cgiven his patent honey treatment of the dangerous digit.\u201d I won\u2019t ask what word we\u2019d have to use had he decided to widdle on it. 52nd over: Australia 203-5 (Marsh 12, Green 4) Green softens his hands to edge Broad well short of second slip. I\u2019m trying to recall when it was obvious England had found one with Broad. The first time I really noticed him was at Finals Day in 2006, when he gave the dangerous Ronnie Irani a spectacular working-over. I guess it was the Ashes decider of 2009 when we first realised he could lay waste to even a high-class Test batting line-up. He\u2019s actually bowled quite poorly today, with far too many short balls. Marsh lasers another thorugh extra cover to move into double figures, and Broad\u2019s figures are kinda funny lookin\u2019: 12-0-55-2. \u201cGood afternoon Rob,\u201d says Kim Thonger. \u201cWe are driving through Northamptonshire, the Rose of The Shires, on the way back from Somerset after a marvellous day at Taunton watching national treasure Dame Sciver-Brunt despatch Australian bowlers to all parts of the ground. \u201cMrs T is incensed by a white van in front of us who has just thrown a paper cup out his window. She is so indignant I feel obliged to ask you to ask if there are any police officers who will prosecute the impertinent fellow if I send them (via you) the dashcam footage of the offence? To give you some idea of how miffed she is, she\u2019s crosser than she was about the sandpaper incident that of course we no longer refer to in polite company as it\u2019s ancient history obvs.\u201d 51st over: Australia 197-5 (Marsh 7, Green 3) Moeen Ali is right in the game. Cam Green gets off the mark with an outside edge for three; Marsh survives an LBW appeal after pushing around a big offbreak that would have missed leg stump; and finally Marsh slaps a long hop square on the off side for four. 50th over: Australia 189-5 (Marsh 2, Green 0) Broad probably imagined his 600th Test wicket would be David Warner, caught at first slip. But he might enjoy this even more because of its significance and timing. Head, as we have seen so often in the past two years, can savage tiring attacks in the final session. \u201cI\u2019m a big fan of Bazball, but I wonder if we\u2019re seeing an unintended consequence,\u201d says Dan Tarpey. \u201cAustralia know England won\u2019t bat for long, so they can pick only three specialist bowlers and not worry about them being overworked. Interesting to see if it happens more often.\u201d I\u2019m not sure it will. I agree with your point, but I don\u2019t think Australia would have risked it had the forecast been for\u2026 well, the weather we\u2019re getting right now. Context is everything I guess. Travis Head has been suckered straight after tea! Of all the ways for Stuart Broad to take his 600th Test wicket. The field was set for a barrage of short stuff, and Head obligingly hooked towards long leg. Joe Root ran in and took an excellent low catch. It\u2019s a wonderful moment for Broad, a giant of a cricketer, and a vital one in the context of the series. He becomes only the fifth bowler, and the second seamer to reach 600: Muttiah Muraliharan, Shane Warne, James Anderson, Anil Kumble and now big Broady. It\u2019s also his 149th Test wicket against Australia, which puts him one clear of Sir Ian Botham. They belong together, because in my lifetime no England cricketers have been stimulated by Ashes cricket as much as those two. Teatime reading England are long overdue an Ashes win at Old Trafford; the last one was 42 years ago. Back in 1981, a Mike Brearley team featuring Ian Botham beat Kim Hughes\u2019 side in the fifth Test, taking a 3\u20131 lead into the final game at the Oval. England\u2019s series win was reported on the front of the Guardian, Paul Fitzpatrick at Old Trafford mentioning man of the match Ian Botham and Australia\u2019s Allan Border, who batted with a broken finger to reach 123 not out. Botham would have been especially pleased by his performance, as the England all-rounder had controversially resigned as England captain after the second Test at Lord\u2019s. An intriguing session ends with Australia maybe slightly ahead in the game. They made 80 runs in 24 overs for the loss of their two limpets, Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne. See you in 20 minutes for an extended and very important evening session. 49th over: Australia 187-4 (Head 47, Marsh 1) A loose delivery from Moeen is flicked fine for three runs by Head. That gives Moeen two balls at Marsh, whose hard hands can make him vulnerable to spin early in his innings. But not today, not yet. That\u2019s tea. 48th over: Australia 184-4 (Head 44, Marsh 1) This feels like one of England\u2019s innings this series, particularly at Edgbaston and in the runchase at Headingley. Every time Australia have threatened to get away, England have taken (or been given) a wicket. There was no pressure on Mitch Marsh ahead of that extraordinary century at Headingley. Today is different, so it\u2019ll be interesting to see whether he plays with the same freedom. He has started tentatively \u2013 fair enough, with tea imminent \u2013 and is beaten by a lovely outswinger from Woakes. A nipbacker leads to a big LBW appeal, but it was slightly high and Nitin Menon wasn\u2019t interested. Excellent stuff from Woakes. 47th over: Australia 184-4 (Head 44, Marsh 1) This is very encouraging for England \u2013 not just the wicket, but the amount of turn Moeen is getting on day one. Labuschagne has had a strange series, with scores of 0, 13, 47, 30, 21, 33 and 51. Magnus Magnusson would not have approved. \u201cI say this as someone who believes James Anderson is Britain\u2019s greatest current sportsman: he\u2019s barely been threatening all series,\u201d says Neill Brown. \u201cYes, the pitches have had nothing for him, and yes he\u2019s had the odd unlucky over, but he\u2019s almost performing the traditional spinner\u2019s role of slowing the run rate and keeping the batsmen in check. Perhaps that\u2019ll be enough? \u201cI definitely know that it won\u2019t cloud over after tea, and Jimmy won\u2019t get the old ball to swing all over the place and take a valedictory five-fer on his home ground. [Starts crying.]\u201d He\u2019s gone! It was hitting the top of middle stump, and Labuschagne looks disconsolate as he walks off. It was a really nice delivery from Moeen but, as Mike Atherton says on Sky, somebody playing as well as Labuschagne should not have missed it. It was a slightly absent-minded defensive stroke. Labuschagne pushed defensively outside the line of a lovely off-break that hit him on the kneeroll. This is really close you know\u2026 England review for LBW against Labuschagne! I suspect it will be umpire\u2019s call and therefore not out, but things are happen for Moeen Ali here. 46th over: Australia 183-3 (Labuschagne 51, Head 44) Woakes replaces Anderson, whose figures of 13-4-29-0 are starting to do my head in because I can\u2019t decide whether he has bowled well or not. His second ball is too short and cut wristily for four by Labuschagne, who is batting with such assurance and control. There were nine days between Test matches; some Australian players went to Europe, others to Scotland. Pat Cummins went to is in-laws. This deviant spent all nine days in the nets didn\u2019t he? A pull for three brings up Labuschagne\u2019s first fifty of the series, a 114-ball masterclass in risk management, and then Head scorches another boundary through extra cover. England are struggling to control him, again. \u201cMatt and Geoff here, two Aussies keeping up from down in Casablanca (where the Cointreau flows like water),\u201d writes Matt. \u201cWe\u2019re wondering if this is the first time in the series where (barring some collapse in the next few overs) a side has been on top, and remained in control for two full sessions? I\u2019d think that the last few sessions of the last Test almost count, but Bairstow\u2019s dismissal really levelled things.\u201d How about the first day at Lord\u2019s? Australia lost a couple right at the death but before that they moved with increasing comfort to 300-odd for three. 45th over: Australia 171-3 (Labuschagne 44, Head 39) Moeen Ali replaces Broad, who has been expensive today (10-0-47-1), and beats Head with his first ball. That turned a little and bounced a lot. As my colleague Tim de Lisle points out, Moeen has an excellent record at Old Trafford: 16 wickets at 19.56. That said, his last game here was against South Africa six years ago, when he was in the form of his life. Things are already happening for Moeen. Labuschagne walks down the track to a good delivery that hits him on the body and ends up in the hands of Bairstow. England appeal for caught behind, hoping there might have been a touch off the glove. Joel Wilson disagrees and Ben Stokes, always so considered in his use of DRS, decides not to review. \u201cCall me an under-stimulated boomer with a fickle attention span,\u201d offers Brian Withington, \u201cbut as well as the Test match I\u2019m also currently live streaming Essex vs Kent, the Tour de France and Open Golf \u2018Live from the Range\u2019, whilst following CCLive! and the OBO. Have I missed anything (apart from the Aussies Inexorably strengthening their vice-like grip on the Ashes)?\u201d You\u2019ve heard about [redacted], [redacted] and [redacted], right? 44th over: Australia 170-3 (Labuschagne 44, Head 38) Head again tries to launch Anderson towards Stockport High Street and again connects with nothing but fresh air. A flick off the pads brings him a couple of runs, and a single brings up a Head-dominated fifty partnership. After a modest first Ashes series in 2019 (avge 27, s/r 49), he has become an almighty irritant to England. It might be time to risk Moeen Ali against him. 43rd over: Australia 167-3 (Labuschagne 44, Head 35) A punisher like Head is the perfect partner for Labuschagne, who can potter along his bubble at the other end. The stats back that up, which is always handy when you throw out a half-arsed observation in the hope it sticks. Labuschagne is in total control at the moment. He waits for Broad to err in length and leathers an extra cover-drive for four. 42nd over: Australia 163-3 (Labuschagne 40, Head 35) Head considers an essentially immaculate outswinger from Anderson\u2026 and belts it wristily whence it came for four. That was a remarkable shot, and it\u2019s fair to say England no longer have control of the scoreboard. Head then fresh-airs a windy woof outside off stump, which elicits the reaction you\u2019d expect from Anderson. We\u2019ve said this a few times already today, but England could do with a wicket. \u201cIt is hard to judge Jimmy in this series isn\u2019t it?\u201d says Gary Naylor. \u201cThe Australians give him plenty of respect, but he consistently bowls lines and lengths that invite respect. The result is a kind of stalemate that is reflected in his figures. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s up to the other bowlers to use that pressure, but if blunting England\u2019s finest is the plan, is it really pressure?\u201d You\u2019re asking a man who thought Bazball Towers was up in flames after two Tests, so I\u2019m keeping my mouth shut. 41st over: Australia 159-3 (Labuschagne 40, Head 31) Head releases the pressure by clattering Broad\u2019s first two balls for four \u2013 a back-foot belt through the covers and a hearty thump between mid-off and extra cover. He is savage whenever a bowler errs in length. It\u2019s worth dusting off the Travis Head 2.0 stats. Since his recall in December 2021, which he celebrated with a riotous 152 against England at Brisbane, he has a Test average of 54 and a strike-rate of 81. Of those who have played 10 innings in that time, only Ben Duckett and Harry Brook are scoring faster. Whenever Head gets going I hear Richie Benaud, talking about Inzamam-ul-Haq during the 1992 World Cup semi-final, in my mind\u2019s ear: \u201cThis guy\u2026 is a dangerous customer.\u201d 40th over: Australia 148-3 (Labuschagne 40, Head 20) Head tries to drive a wide, swinging yorker from Anderson and almost knocks himself off his feet. Then he gets a single with a leading edge that flies to safety on the off side. We\u2019ve spoken all series about England needing to occasionally sit with the bat. They\u2019re doing it with the ball at the moment. In the morning session Australia scored at 4.3 an over; since lunch it\u2019s down to 2.7. It\u2019s an intriguing arm-wrestle. \u201cVisual feed is a bit jaggy in Nusa Dua Rob - usually the reading is a lyrical supplement and I skim the active description but I\u2019ll take it all for now, unlike the cover tunes in the bar of which I\u2019ll take one in every four,\u201d says Eamonn Maloney. \u201cLike the balance of the Aus side on a brown top if you still rate Green as one of the best seven bats available; if someone was averaging 40 in the Shield and outdoing Head for turn you\u2019d have an argument, but ye doesnae.\u201d 39th over: Australia 147-3 (Labuschagne 40, Head 19) Labuschagne has left superbly today. That wouldn\u2019t usually be worthy of note \u2013 it\u2019s one of his great strengths \u2013 but he had an uncomfortable relationship with his off stump in the first three Tests. After moving Labuschagne across his crease, Broad tries a hooping yorker. Labuschagne has seen it all before and defends with authority. He has scored only three from the last 25 balls, and he won\u2019t care one jot about that. 38th over: Australia 146-3 (Labuschagne 40, Head 18) Thanks Geoff, afternoon everyone. James Anderson bowls another maiden straight after drinks, including a jaffa that squares Labuschagne up and goes past the outside edge. Anderson\u2019s performance looks fine on paper (10-4-21-0); I can\u2019t decide whether he\u2019s been unlucky or unthreatening. 37th over: Australia 146-3 (Labuschagne 40, Head 18) Broad comes back, lining up Labuschagne for most of the over. Everyone gets celebrated when Bairstow gloves a ball cleanly down the leg side, but it\u2019s off the pad. Drinks! And that\u2019s it for me today. Thanks for your emails, from here kindly direct them Rob Smyth, Esq., care of The Guardian OBO. 36th over: Australia 145-3 (Labuschagne 39, Head 18) Anderson is back, and he\u2019s still getting swing with this older ball, the ball shaping away from Labuschagne. Can\u2019t dot them up though, Labuschagne a run to cover, Head clipping square and again really good running to get back for two. Throw in a no ball as well. 35th over: Australia 141-3 (Labuschagne 38, Head 16) Smoked through the covers! Travis Head gets a rare chance to come forward to Woakes, and takes full advantage. Pulls a single to follow, Labuschagne finds another. 34th over: Australia 135-3 (Labuschagne 37, Head 11) Wood carries on short, Head dinks a shot off his hip through fine leg for four, then rides the better bouncer well enough. Helmet and box come out for Stokes, who is going to put himself in at silly point. Down leg again, then when he fancies the line, Head nails a pull shot for four! Behind square, just. That\u2019s good contact. 33rd over: Australia 126-3 (Labuschagne 37, Head 2) Woakes ticking away, bowling to Labuschagne, so he\u2019s on his normal length with a normal field. Labuschagne takes a long break to change his shoes, ideal just after lunch, and he\u2019s very annoyed when he clips a straight ball straight at the midwicket fielder. 32nd over: Australia 126-3 (Labuschagne 37, Head 2) Hit in the grille! Unsociable bowling from Wood, gets the aim right on his bouncer. Travis Head is shaping to pull and then just wants to get out of the way. Too late. Turns away from the ball and wears the contact from shoulder onto grille. Takes a leg bye, then passes his concussion check. Labuschagne keeps out a scorching yorker, then runs really well to again get back for two when he works a ball to square leg. Another run through cover. 31st over: Australia 122-3 (Labuschagne 34, Head 2) Wood bowling short to Head, ok then. Chris Woakes bowling bumpers? Come on. They at least have a slip and a gully, and only three boundary riders on the hook and cut rather than five or six. Woakes doesn\u2019t use them, bowling short and then bowling on the pads for Head to take a single. Mike Jakeman writes in. \u201cI\u2019d add that it\u2019s hard to know whether the groundsmen have struggled to produce what McCullum/Stokes wanted or if McCullum/Stokes wanted the wrong thing. I generally feel this whole argument is a bit overblown. The best pitches have something for everyone and no-one tends to whinge about a good pitch. The track at Headingley was superb.\u201d It was. But it was also an anomaly. Asking for fast and flat pitches in England? They can give you flat, they can\u2019t very easily give you fast. 30th over: Australia 121-3 (Labuschagne 34, Head 1) One ball after cracking four through point, Smith is gone. Australia are three down. And all of the slips disappear to all corners of the field so that England can bounce Travis Head. At least they have a short leg and a couple saving the single. Head gets a horrible bouncer second ball, right at the face, that he gets down to ground off the glove and splice. Evades a couple, then gets one run behind square. Huge review for England! Wood with pace, some angle in at the stumps, and the Smith of old was never beaten on the inside edge but the Smith of today can be, especially against such pace. Wood explodes in that appeal, and I\u2019m not sure why Umpire Menon thinks it\u2019s not out. Outside the line? Height? Hits him above the knee roll but the bounce has been modest from this surface. It doesn\u2019t matter in the end, because the review shows three reds on middle stump. England get their man! 29th over: Australia 116-2 (Labuschagne 34, Smith 37) Again good running, Smith this time taking Woakes through square and getting back for two. Three slips and a leg slip, cover, mid off, mid on, midwicket, long leg. Patchy sun, patchy cloud. Smith walking across, walking across. Another single. 28th over: Australia 113-2 (Labuschagne 34, Smith 34) Full sprint from Wood, almost ready to bowl, then some numbskull walks along the front row of seats in front of the sight screen. Labuschagne flicks a couple of runs, well sprinted, and the throw hits Smith\u2019s bat and ricochets but doesn\u2019t reach the fence. They don\u2019t take any extra runs. Would have made for an entertaining next couple of days if they had\u2026 27th over: Australia 111-2 (Labuschagne 32, Smith 34) Woakes from the Statham End, Smith soaking up the whole over. Nicks the ball into his pad from the final ball. 26th over: Australia 111-2 (Labuschagne 32, Smith 34) Mark Wood to start us off. But he\u2019s still not quite there. Labuschagne pushes three through cover to start the session. Wood goes down the leg side a couple of times, wide enough in the other direction to leave alone. Smith deflects a run to point from the last ball. Coming back after lunch\u2026 \u201cNot had the chance to watch enough or read the updates in depth but wondering how the wicket is looking?\u201d asks Damian Johnson. \u201cFrom what I have seen it looks aa bit dead again (heartbreak for Jimmy).\u201d I wouldn\u2019t say dead, but it\u2019s very brown, even on morning one. Consistent bounce so far. But there have been enough false shots and moments of risk that good bowling can be rewarded. \u201cSun stopping play in Manchester- proof that irony isn\u2019t dead,\u201d writes Bob O\u2019Hara. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the first time - there was a problem a few years ago with windows outside the ground (IIRC). Might have been in the 90s.\u201d The pitch used to run from east to west, of course, so half the day was terrible in that respect when facing one end. \u201cThey\u2019re discussing, how shall I put this, \u2018toss strategy\u2019 on TMS,\u201d writes Simon McMahon, \u201cand whether or not Cummins should have stuck or twist, having lost three in a row before this morning. I\u2019m reminded of a story I think from Ed Smith\u2019s book on luck in sport about a county captain who would toss a coin by himself before the actual toss took place, and then choose heads or tails based on this. Go figure. Still, always better to be lucky than good, right?\u201d Probability is an interesting subject, and one entirely at odds with the human emotional method of processing random results. The session hasn\u2019t worked for Stokes, then. England did prise out the openers, Broad and Woakes taking the wickets, but Australia\u2019s blue-chip pair have done well so far. A few dangerous moments but they\u2019ve got through. Wood was not especially effective. There has been some swing, and decent carry from the pitch. Nothing drastic though, and the runs have flowed throughout. 25th over: Australia 107-2 (Labuschagne 29, Smith 33) Out to deep cover goes Labuschagne, looks like four but there\u2019s a sub fielder out there under the broad brimmed hat who makes a good tumbling stop. Two runs, then a nudge for one, and Smith drives the last ball of the session back past Moeen for two more. 24th over: Australia 102-2 (Labuschagne 26, Smith 31) This is a funny old innings from Smith today. Leaves alone as much as he can for five balls of an Anderson over, then chases the widest ball of the lot and flashes it past gully for four. Cut shot. So wide he can\u2019t have controlled it well. He sometimes does play in this manic way, and it usually doesn\u2019t last long. 23rd over: Australia 98-2 (Labuschagne 26, Smith 27) Moeen Ali comes on. This was the key at Headingley, him versus Smith and Labuschagne. Cautious exchanges early, a couple of singles. Then Smith says sod all that, and whacks him for six! Over long on, way back. Laces a drive for three to follow, through mid off. 22nd over: Australia 86-2 (Labuschagne 24, Smith 17) Tap, tap, tap, goes Smith. Walks across. Anderson bowls what would have been a yorker had the stumps been three feet further to the leg side. Somehow Smith catches up with it and hits it, and even more strangely he hits it straight to square leg. Can\u2019t score. Anderson completes maiden over #1681. 21st over: Australia 86-2 (Labuschagne 24, Smith 17) Flicked through midwicket by Smith first ball, almost stopped at midwicket but it gets through! Picks up four. If Broad does get his 600th wicket today it will also take him past Botham\u2019s tally of 148 for the most Test wickets against Australia. As for winning the toss and bowling at Old Trafford, Ali Martin tells me that the record is three losses, seven draws, no wins. The sun is out. 20th over: Australia 81-2 (Labuschagne 24, Smith 12) Smith with that exaggerated movement across, getting into line with an Anderson outswinger so he can push it to point for a run without risking the outside edge. Later in the over he doesn\u2019t move, gets the straighter ball and takes it to the leg side for another. He must be maddening to bowl to. 19th over: Australia 78-2 (Labuschagne 23, Smith 10) Broad comes back to partner Anderson, and strays wide of off stump second ball. Smith stands up and punches it through point for four! Quite the shot, to connect that cleanly so far from his body and at that length. Not a cut shot, a punch with a straighter bat. Gets another run off the pad, and Labuschagne flicks behind square for four. Quality. 18th over: Australia 69-2 (Labuschagne 19, Smith 5) Anderson back on for Wood. We went early on a maiden over for him earlier, but this one is truly without score. Making 1680 of them in his Test career. He didn\u2019t bowl his best. In terms of accuracy, allowed them not play a lot with the ones down the leg side. 17th over: Australia 69-2 (Labuschagne 19, Smith 5) Not reading the swing through the air really, Smith steps across and then uses his pads to block the ball outside the off stump from Woakes. Perhaps he\u2019s reading it perfectly, knowing it would hit him outside the line. Huw Swanborough is pondering the comic value of the shin. \u201cI think it\u2019s the bony quality. It\u2019s extremely painful for a very short time, and will bounce off with an audible knock. It\u2019s pain theatre, a good spectacle but rarely lasting discomfort. I got a great hit directly on the kneecap at short mid-on once, made a better sound that the batsman middling it.\u201d Yuck. 16th over: Australia 68-2 (Labuschagne 18, Smith 5) Nasty bouncer from Wood, getting up to 94 miles per hour and rearing at Labuschagne. The sightly less hostile deliveries they\u2019re able to knock around for three singles. \u201cI\u2019m enjoying as much of the cricket as I can before the Women\u2019s World Cup starts tomorrow. Carn Australia in both forms,\u201d writes Murray Henman. Yep, big sporting fortnight coming up with the Ashes here alongside the football in my home country. It\u2019s a dream. 15th over: Australia 65-2 (Labuschagne 16, Smith 4) What on earth was that? Something strange has happened in Steve Smith\u2019s head of late. He plays some erratic shots compared to the player we once knew. Walks out in a Test match on a ground where he made a double ton last time, and pulls his first ball in the air straight at deep backward square! There\u2019s a fielder out there, but in about ten metres off the rope. By a quirk of fate, Smith gets enough purchase to land that ball over Wood\u2019s head as the fielder runs back, and scores four. There he goes! Another start, another innings that doesn\u2019t go on! That\u2019s aggressive Warner rather than defensive, on the front foot and driving at Woakes but the length isn\u2019t quite full enough. A bit of movement takes the edge behind! 14th over: Australia 61-1 (Warner 32, Labuschagne 16) Finally we finish the over. It began short at the hip from Wood, Warner works it away and again belts back for the second run! Wood pitches up to Labuschagne, looking for pads or stumps, and is whipped away for four! Quite the shot. Then the long delay, after which Labuscahgne edges for four! No fourth slip. Stokes at leg slip. If you\u2019re confused, the layout here is confusing. There\u2019s a big white sight screen in front of the old pavilion, but then there are about ten rows of seats in front of and below that sight screen. Broad directed some of those people up to the back row, where the offending glint originated, and maybe they did something there? The glare seems to have stopped. Anyway, now the clouds have come over. And probably we took so long over it that the earth\u2019s rotation has changed the angle of the sunlight. That\u2019s funny. Stuart Broad has taken matters in hand, going down to the offending area of the ground personally and chatting to the crowd. It\u2019s 57 for 1 right now, if you\u2019re wondering. \u201cOn TMS they are on about the toss and Australia\u2019s failure so far in this series. Whatever happened to the suggestion that the toss be abandoned and the visiting captain only deciding whether to bat or not?\u201d Hello John Starbuck. The suggestion never reached the top levels of decision-making within the game, I don\u2019t think. It\u2019s a suggestion designed to reduce the extremes of home teams tailoring conditions to suit themselves. In this series though, England have produced pitches to order that have largely hampered England, negating their bowlers who are usually their best home asset. We\u2019re taking drinks partway through the 14th over because there\u2019s an issue behind the bowler\u2019s arm at the James Anderson End. Looks like a few of the plastic seats are reflecting bright bursts of light that are in Labuschagne\u2019s eyes. Not what you want when you\u2019re facing Mark Wood. 13th over: Australia 50-1 (Warner 29, Labuschagne 8) Warner, mixing and matching, picks the inswinger from Woakes and drives it neatly for two. Then some classic Warner, in the bad sense. Slashes the bat at slight width and misses the lot. Goes back to good Warner \u2013 drop the ball to cover and sprint like the devil is chasing. 12th over: Australia 47-1 (Warner 26, Labuschagne 8) Wood hasn\u2019t got the line right yet. Bowls at Labuschagne\u2019s hip, the batter gets a little contact on it very fine, straight at leg slip on the bounce, and it nails Stokes in the shin. Ouch. Takes his leg out from under him. He eventually gets up with a laugh. Why is being hit in the shin intrinsically funny? Box, shin, we laugh. Most other places we commiserate. No run there. Four byes though the next time Wood goes leg side and Labuschagne gets nothing on it. In between times he sways away from some shorter balls and plays others into the off side as required. See, that over gets classed as a maiden even though poor bowling cost the team four extras. It doesn\u2019t make sense. 11th over: Australia 43-1 (Warner 26, Labuschagne 8) Testing from Woakes, full and curling back in, Warner gets bat down in time and squeezes the ball off the toe along the ground into the cordon. Gets hold of the shorter length though, flip-pulled around the corner and well placed behind square for four! 10th over: Australia 39-1 (Warner 22, Labuschagne 8) A big cheer as Mark Wood replaces Anderson. His first ball is a warm-up, very wide and not that fast, and Warner cuts for three. Labuschagne has to dive for his ground as they hustle the third. Leg slip for Labuschagne, who jabs off the hip but straight to square leg, then misses one down leg that injures Bairstow. Cops him on his fingers as he can\u2019t take it cleanly. He takes a moment to get the gloves off and back on, and will continue. Wood started his over at 87 miles per hour and is now up to 93, as Labuschagne hops and drops to point for a run. Warner looks comfortable so far, opening the face to find three more runs to point. Sprints through! 9th over: Australia 32-1 (Warner 16, Labuschagne 7) Chris Woakes to replace Broad after four overs and a wicket. Not troubling Warner with swing but pitching back of a length, twice Warner mistimes into the pitch trying to get on top of the bounce and play into the off side. Gets a run the second time, back past the keeper to the leg side. Matthew Dunnill writes in. \u201cReally looking forward to the Test today \u2013 great to have you back, I\u2019ve missed you and the gang this week!\u201d We missed you too. \u201cMy mate Bilaal\u2019s on his last day at work today. He\u2019s a massive Stuart Broad fan so I thought maybe I could do a big Celebrappeal and wish him well in his new job and in the future?\u201d Bilaal, the best day at a job is when you leave it. Sail smoothly. 8th over: Australia 31-1 (Warner 15, Labuschagne 7) Warner\u2019s ideal strike management continues. Places Anderson through point for three runs, second ball of the over. 7th over: Australia 28-1 (Warner 12, Labuschagne 7) Over the wicket comes Broad to the right-handed Labuschagne. Having already bagged Khawaja, he\u2019s on track to get Warner for his 600th Test wicket. Imagine. Labuschagne gets his first boundary with a glorious drive, picks the inswinger and nails it through mid off. Then is lucky to survive against one that bounces more! He\u2019s trying to leave, the ball cuts in and bounces, and Labuschagne in a flinch movement lifts his back pad to make sure it covers the stumps. The ball hits that pad flap in front of middle, but above bail height. Ah, it\u2019s a no ball anyway. Labuschagne takes a couple through mid off, then swing takes the ball past Bairstow down the leg side for four byes. 11 from the over. Chris Goater writes in. Are you Nathan Lyon in disguise? \u201cThe worry I have about the final two Tests is that Australia probably only need one decent innings out of their next four to retain the Ashes. If Smith and Labuschagne can get going, then Australia can get 500+ at least once and that probably is enough for a win or draw in one of the Tests (even given the speed at which England play), which is all they\u2019ll need to keep the urn.\u201d Australia don\u2019t want to retain, though. They want to win a series in England. 6th over: Australia 17-1 (Warner 12, Labuschagne 1) Four slips and a leg slip for Labuschagne, who is here to make runs and chew gum, and he\u2019s been all out of runs. Beaten handsomely by his second ball from Anderson, whispering past the outside edge. Warner has already got off strike thanks to a leg bye. He\u2019s been adept at getting down the other end so far. Labuschagne gets a single from the last ball. 5th over: Australia 15-1 (Warner 12) Khawaja flicks a couple of runs through midwicket, but the last ball of the over he misses. Broad from around the wicket, his line of attack is vindicated! Wobble seam, cutting into the batter. Hits him above the knee roll on the back leg but that leg is straight and angled forward, so the impact isn\u2019t that high. Khawaja reviews with one second left on the clock and walks off when the three reds come up. 4th over: Australia 13-0 (Warner 12, Khawaja 1) Warner undoes and redoes his gloves, settles into his stance, waits for Anderson. Flashes it away for four! Deliberate shot, opens the face and steers it into the gully gap \u2013 with four slips waiting. That\u2019s confidence. England excited, and more so when Warner leaves one that swings back in, but it\u2019s hitting him too high. Then he misses one that maybe clips the pad, and Bairstow drops it \u2013 there\u2019s no edge but they talk about an lbw review and don\u2019t take it. Lots going on. Warner takes two more runs square on the off side. 3rd over: Australia 7-0 (Warner 6, Khawaja 1) Warner will be loving this, off strike first ball of Broad\u2019s over dropping a run towards point. Khawaja draws a half appeal from Broad \u2013 half in that the bowler doesn\u2019t hare off to the slip cordon and begin mixing a celebratory jug of margaritas. The ball is going past leg stump. Too wide for most of the over and Khawaja leaves. 2nd over: Australia 6-0 (Warner 5, Khawaja 1) Young James Anderson (YJA to his friends) will partner Stuart Broad for the 19 millionth time. Nice seam movement early, a bit of movement through the air. Khawaja plays him with very soft hands when he has to play, and leaves the rest. That\u2019s maiden over #1679 for Anderson. Ruth Purdue writes in. \u201cDo you think the guys on TV will bring up Crawley\u2019s runs when they talk about Warner? I doubt it, but it isn\u2019t just the Australian who can\u2019t get runs as an opener.\u201d In this series specifically, I think Crawley has done a decent job, in a different way to Warner, who has also contributed. 1st over: Australia 6-0 (Warner 5, Khawaja 1) Stuart Broad to begin, looking for Test wicket 599. Not with that ball! Short, wide, and Warner crunches the cut shot for four! First ball of the Test match. Then a wildly swinging ball down the leg side that Warner glances for one. Broad stays around the wicket for Khawaja, not sure about that. Khawaja blocks out a yorker, well bowled and played there, Broad was nearly through. Then takes a single to midwicket. Goodness me, we\u2019re about to start. Emails flooding in, thanks for those, I probably can\u2019t publish the 500-word ones about Bairstow and Foakes stats but I take your point(s). Let\u2019s play. Let\u2019s start our correspondence on an upbeat note. \u201cDifficult to argue with Mark Ramprakesh\u2019s impression of an England team unravelling without any plan for the future. I\u2019m reminded of the way my company went through an evangelical period of major \u2018business process re-engineering\u2019 back in the day. The guru of this change was inspired by a number of companies, especially an emergent transformative giant in the energy sector. \u201cI confess to having been rather cynical about the process, which seemed to consist of discarding and ridiculing old ways and activities (like planning), and embracing new ways and a comprehensive change of culture. Ironically, I was just getting on board with some aspects when the boss got fired and the rug was pulled on the whole episode. It may have ended in tears but it was a wild ride while it lasted. Hopefully England\u2019s inspiration will bear longer term fruit and won\u2019t turn out to have been based on the transformative premise of a business called Enron.\u201d You can see why Brian Withington has a suburb in Manchester named after him. For those radio heads outside England and Australia, the TMS overseas link. Australia David Warner Usman Khawaja Marnus Labuschagne Steve Smith Travis Head Mitchell Marsh Cameron Green Alex Carey + Mitchell Starc Pat Cummins * Josh Hazlewood England Zak Crawley Ben Duckett Moeen Ali Joe Root Harry Brook Ben Stokes * Jonny Bairstow + Chris Woakes Mark Wood Stuart Broad James Anderson \u201cLooks like a good wicket, we\u2019re not too unhappy about that,\u201d says Cummins. Interesting call! That\u2019s been their method in this new era. Know what you\u2019re chasing. Overheads can help, says Stokes, but he would have bowled even if the sun was out. And there\u2019s Megan Maurice on the broader significance of this remarkable series. Meanwhile, in Taunton last night, it was another stunner for England\u2019s women, putting some serious holes in the Australian juggernaut. I want to recap this truly unbelievable stat. Here is Raf Nicholson\u2019s report. For those incensed by David Warner\u2019s retention, there is a practical case for it, which is what I\u2019ve tried to explain here. And the Final Word preview podcast, with a lot of insider net-session intel and an explanatory guide to unexpected Aussie Rules footballers showing up at Australian cricket training. Now for Australia, and unusually their team news came out the day before the match. They have been waiting until the toss in the previous matches. And here is Ali Martin with the overarching preview compiled yesterday. Our columnist Mark Ramprakash has his say on the makeup of England\u2019s team and the balance of the series. There will be a lot of chat about the pitch over the next few days, maybe as much as there is about the weather. Fascinating folk, us cricket types, aren\u2019t we? Manchester local Tanya Aldred is our grassroots correspondent. Moeen Ali at No3 is a contentious one. Doing it as a surprise tactic in the second innings at Headingley was one thing, starting a Test match with that as your plan is another. Let\u2019s catch up on everything that has been going on. First to Simon Burnton, who was at Ben Stokes\u2019 press conference yesterday. Full steam ahead, is the short version. Hello to you, as before and hopefully as again. One question burns through the Manchester mist. Are we ready to do it all again? It has been a non-stop cricket summer. The women\u2019s Ashes came to a dramatic end last night, the men\u2019s series rolls on today. There have been no quiet periods, no normal matches, no box-ticking exercises. Instead we have a Test series at 1-2 in favour of the visitors, two matches to play, and a need for England to get a win here by whatever means necessary. The weather might play a big part. It was tipping down rain here in Manchester yesterday, and I\u2019m told it has been for weeks. But today is clear so far and the forecast says we might be alright until the weekend. Hope springs eternal."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b223b0", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/19/england-australia-fourth-ashes-test-day-one-match-report", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Stuart Broad enters 600 club as England\u2019s attacking call pays off ", "lead": "Stuart Broad took his 600th Test wicket as England made a positive start to day one of the fourth Ashes Test at Old Trafford", "author": "Ali Martin at Emirates Old Trafford", "datePublished": "2023-07-19 17:57:31", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.232814", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/83acb0b3c095c18bf1acf863f06cb2b06b36f7d6/1594_481_2312_1387/500.jpg", "body": "If the weather forecast for the back end of this fourth helping of Ashes drama is to be believed then a make\u2011or-break second day lies in store for England. There are two Australian wickets still to claim and then it is over to the batters for what is shaping up to be the ultimate test of their aggressive approach under Ben Stokes. Stokes is under no illusions that, with rain expected to hit Manchester this weekend, fast-forward cricket is very much required here. It informed his decision to bowl first after what was his fourth success at the toss in this series and, having reduced the tourists to 299 for eight by the close on day one, just about paid off. England, 2-1 down with two to play, are very much in the hunt provided quick, big runs now follow. There was some minor irritation before stumps, Mitchell Starc finishing unbeaten on 23 as the players walked off and seven overs left unbowled. But across the course of three sessions there was plenty for the latest sell-out crowd to cheer, not least a 600th Test wicket for Stuart Broad, a remarkable one-handed catch from Jonny Bairstow that lifted some of the clouds engulfing his wicketkeeping, and a continuation of the fresh energy that Chris Woakes and Mark Wood have brought to proceedings. If there was one source of local lament it was Jimmy Anderson\u2019s wickets column ending up blank on his return to the side (even if the one for runs was typically thrifty). Still, on a beige surface that didn\u2019t scream to insert the opposition \u2013 and on a ground where the 10 sides to do so previously failed to secure the win \u2013 the fact that five Australians passed 30 and yet none went past 51 was a huge tick for Stokes and his men. So much of this came down to Woakes and immaculate figures of four for 52 from 19 overs, even if in typical Woakes fashion, we will start by focusing on Broad. The 37-year-old is enjoying a fine series and though the radar was a little off initially, and the duel with David Warner began with the first ball of the match racing to the rope, his removals of Usman Khawaja and Travis Head brought up a celebrated milestone. Broad hit 500 at Old Trafford three years ago when he removed the West Indies opener Kraigg Brathwaite lbw but that was the dreaded Covid summer; the season behind closed doors that meant the stands were deserted and deathly silent. This time his breakthroughs were met with a wall of sound, Broad moving to 599 first thing when he pinned Khawaja lbw for three and becoming just the second seamer after Anderson to reach 600, when Head pulled to long leg straight after tea. But really, for all the attention Broad demands \u2013 not just with the ball but for the weird moments that follow him, such as stewarding spectators to cover a piece of metal reflecting sunlight into the batters\u2019 eyes \u2013 Woakes knitted the day together for England. Fresh from his Headingley heroics he bowled an immaculate line, got the Dukes ball swinging, and meant Anderson\u2019s struggle for penetration was well covered. This began with a crucial incision from first change, Woakes replacing Broad from the Brian Statham End and cutting down Warner\u2019s promising 32 immediately after the first drinks break. Warner\u2019s eyes were already rolling back in their sockets in frustration before the ball nestled in Bairstow\u2019s gloves, the opener having been drawn to drive by a full delivery that moved away and tickled the edge. It was in the final session, once Broad had shut down Head, that Woakes broke the day open for England, however. Australia have picked two all-rounders instead of a frontline spinner and though Cameron Green did not entirely convince on his comeback, Mitchell Marsh was again looking in touch. The man they call the Bison was stampeding once more, clobbering seven fours and one six to take Australia to 254 for five. But in the space of five balls Woakes changed the complexion of the day, with Green trapped lbw for 16 \u2013 the ball projected to be trimming the leg-stump bail on the replay \u2013 and Marsh then falling for 51 to a sparkling one-handed pouch low down from Bairstow. With Alex Carey, stationed down at No 8, later falling to the same combination for 20 attempting a leave, Woakes had once again underscored his wizardry on home soil. The 34-year-old also highlighted the benefit of England playing five frontline bowlers when Stokes is unable to play a full role with the ball, a tactic that has returned 10 wins from 10 since 2018. The captain has variety and options at his disposal, something which came to the fore when, from 61 for two at the fall of Warner in the morning, Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne appeared to be rebuilding ominously. Wood was the bowler to break a third-wicket stand of 59 on another day of high speeds and lion-hearted effort with Smith struck in front for 41 by a 92mph full ball. Labuschagne ploughed on with Head, his confidence growing en route to his first half-century of the series. But on 51 the right-hander was undone by a bit of dip and turn from his fellow No 3, Moeen Ali, even if, like Smith, it took a review to confirm the lbw. There was a bit of purchase for Moeen to work with out there, something which immediately made Australia\u2019s jettisoning of Todd Murphy look questionable. How much this comes back to haunt Pat Cummins later in the game remains to be seen, however, with England\u2019s batters first needing to fire when their time comes on day two."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b223b1", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/19/pita-limjaroenrat-the-change-candidate-for-thai-voters-cut-down-by-senators", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Pita Limjaroenrat: Thai voters\u2019 change candidate, cut down by senators", "lead": "Young pro-reform candidate won over many in the electorate \u2013 but not military appointees who blocked him from being PM", "author": "Rebecca Ratcliffe in Bangkok", "datePublished": "2023-07-19 17:56:54", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.232849", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/7a0121075bd03d463d3684ccdd11ef14c9ad2f67/0_230_4500_2700/500.jpg", "body": "After almost a decade of rule by the former army chief Prayuth Chan-ocha, many voters in the recent Thai election longed for change. More than 14 million turned to pro-reform politician Pita Limjaroenrat and his party Move Forward. Pita, aged 42, is far younger than most politicians in Thailand, and he and his party were able to use social media to reach new voters. Since its predecessor was founded in 2018, the party has had a strong support base among young people drawn to its promises to remove the military from politics and tackle sensitive issues such as lese-majesty, the strict law that forbids criticism of the monarchy. When Pita became leader in 2020 \u2013 a change brought about when the party\u2019s predecessor, Future Forward, was dissolved, a common occurrence in Thai politics \u2013 he was able to appeal to a broader cross-section of voters, said Napon Jatusripitak, a visiting fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute. \u201cIt seems that he is popular among a wide section of the population: the young, the old, the elderly, even the conservatives,\u201d Jatusripitak said. Pita grew up in a wealthy family with political connections. His father, Pongsak Limjaroenrat, was an adviser to the ministry of agriculture, and his uncle Padung Limcharoenrat was a close aide of the former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. He went to a private school in Bangkok and in New Zealand where, with little to watch on TV but Australian soaps, he would instead listen to the speeches of the then New Zealand prime minister, Jim Bolger, as he did his homework. It sparked the start of an interest in politics. Pita studied at Thammasat University in Bangkok, as well as Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He went on to work in his family\u2019s rice bran business, and later became the executive director of Grab Thailand, a ride-hailing and food delivery app. Pita entered politics when he joined Future Forward, running as a candidate in the 2019 Thai general election. In opposition, he was seen as a rising star and won praise for his speeches on agriculture policies, said Napon. His image of having a \u201ctechnocratic vision\u201d rather than being an \u201cactivist politician\u201d appeared to have allowed Pita to win the support of more conservative voters, added Napon. \u201cA lot of conservatives look for policy-oriented politicians who can communicate effectively.\u201d Pita, a fluent English speaker, also had a style and background that tended to appeal to urban, middle-class ties, added Napon. Pita has faced questions while in the public eye. His ex-wife accused him of domestic violence in 2019. A family court dismissed the allegations, which he has previously denied. He has a seven-year-old daughter from his previous marriage, who has appeared on stage with him during campaigning, and on his social media accounts, where he has posted videos of them trampolining and pictures of them enjoying ice-cream and dinners out. Prior to the election, some young activists had voiced frustrations that his reforms were not bold enough \u2013 though this does not appear to ultimately have affected his popularity. At rallies younger voters gave him a rock-star reception, queueing up for selfies. And in May, Move Forward surprised many by winning the most seats and the most votes. The party was able to sweep almost every district in Bangkok, as well as poach seats that were once heartlands of the heavyweight opposition party Pheu Thai. Despite this, Pita has ultimately been unable to overcome the hurdles that were implanted in the Thai election system after the last coup. Military-appointed senators blocked his attempt to become prime minister, and his nomination to rerun on Wednesday was voided by a parliamentary vote. Pita is also facing two legal cases and is now suspended from parliament pending an investigation into allegations he was ineligible to run in the election as he owned media shares. He has denied any wrongdoing. If found guilty, he could face up to 10 years in jail, a 20-year ban from politics and a fine."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b223b2", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jul/19/uk-housing-market-forecast-to-avoid-slump-despite-zero-growth-in-prices", "primaryCategory": "business", "subCategories": "test", "title": "UK housing market forecast to avoid slump despite zero growth in prices", "lead": "Rents jump by record 5.1% in a month as rental market struggles to meet demand from priced-out buyers", "author": "Phillip Inman", "datePublished": "2023-07-19 17:48:45", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.232888", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/de909d012c3143b71d8dc91cb387f1bc129043b8/0_0_4368_2621/500.jpg", "body": "Britain\u2019s housing market is expected to avoid a slump triggered by rising interest rates, despite a drop in house price inflation to zero in May, according to analysts. The Office for National Statistics said a decline in month-on-month growth from 0.5% in April to 0% in May meant the annual rate of house price inflation dropped to 1.9%. However, a bigger than expected fall in UK inflation has meant financial markets are no longer expecting interest rates to increase as sharply, helping the housing market. Meanwhile, rents jumped for the 14th consecutive month, by a record 5.1%, adding to concerns that the private rental market is struggling to meet a rising level of demand from people unable to buy a home. A rise in mortgage rates and the cost of living crisis have prevented many people from entering the property market over the last year, leading to a cut in the number of transactions and the end of a two-year, 20% price spurt. Recent figures from the Nationwide and Halifax have shown annual prices falling, but the ONS\u2019s broader measure of the market, which includes cash buyers, found that annual property inflation had narrowly avoided going backwards. Some forecasters have predicted a decline in prices of 10% or more over the next year in response to the rise in interest rates to 5%, but Barret Kupelian, the chief economist at the consultancy PwC UK, said a fall in the consumer prices index (CPI) in June was likely to persuade the Bank of England to moderate further increases in the cost of borrowing. \u201cThe latest inflation reading, which was lower than economists\u2019 expectations, means financial markets no longer expect the Bank of England\u2019s base rate to peak at 6.5%,\u201d he said. \u201cWe also expect next month\u2019s headline inflation reading to garner another positive response from financial markets. This would mean that those intending to refinance their mortgages in the next few months could do so at possibly more favourable mortgage rates than those on offer at present. \u201cThis effect, coupled with possible real wage growth, could mean the housing market could be in a considerably different place in six months\u2019 time, with a bounceback possibly in sight.\u201d Marc von Grundherr, a director of estate agents Benham &amp; Reeves, said: \u201cThe pandemic property rollercoaster ride has certainly ground to a halt so far in 2023, but rather than the market coming off the rails, what we\u2019re now seeing is house prices returning to pre-pandemic levels.\u201d Average house prices increased over the 12 months to May to \u00a3304,000 in England, \u00a3213,000 in Wales, \u00a3193,000 in Scotland, and \u00a3172,000 in Northern Ireland. The north-east recorded the highest annual percentage change of all English regions with a 4% increase in the 12 months to May 2023, while the east had the lowest at 0%. Rhys Schofield, a managing director at the Derbyshire-based mortgage advisers Peak Mortgages and Protection, said landlords were struggling to keep rents in check after a series of cost increases that they were unable to absorb. Michelle Lawson, a director at the Fareham-based broker Lawson Financial, said: \u201cWith rising mortgage costs, increased regulatory costs and the removal of section 24 [rental income tax changes], landlords cannot absorb these rises any more and they are naturally having to be passed up the chain.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b223b3", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/jul/19/russia-ukraine-war-live-updates-moscow-attacks-odesa-crimea-military-base-fire-evacuation-kirovske-tavrida-highway", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Russia-Ukraine war: Moscow warns ships in Black Sea; video appears to show Prigozhin for first time since mutiny \u2013 as it happened", "lead": "Defence ministry says it will consider all ships travelling to Black Sea ports as potential carriers of military equipment", "author": "Sammy Gecsoyler (now); Martin Belam and Helen Sullivan (earlier)", "datePublished": "2023-07-19 17:47:58", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.232924", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/bd786eb417f9b46c3ece9f715dfe9c08109364ad/0_124_5181_3109/500.jpg", "body": "This blog is now closing. Below is a roundup of today\u2019s stories: Russia says all ships travelling to Ukrainian ports on Black Sea to be considered carriers of military equipment from Thursday. Russia\u2019s defence ministry said it would \u201cflag countries of such ships \u2026 considered parties to the Ukrainian conflict\u201d. The ministry did not say what actions it might take. Prigozhin says Wagner mercenaries will no longer fight in Ukraine war and will head to Africa. Prigozhin was shown in a video welcoming his Wagner fighters to Belarus and telling them they would for now take no further part in the Ukraine war, He also ordered his men to train the Belarusian army and collect their strength for a \u201cnew journey to Africa.\u201d Russian media sources reported that Vladimir Putin will be attending the BRICS summit in South Africa next month via videoconferencing instead of in person. Earlier in the day it was announced that Putin would not attend the summit in South Africa \u201cby mutual agreement\u201d with the hosts. The international criminal court (ICC) has a warrant out for Putin\u2019s arrest and South Africa is an ICC member, meaning they would have been obliged to arrest Putin if he entered the country. US announces $1.3b in additional security assistance for Ukraine. The package is set to include air defence capabilities and munitions. \u201cThis announcement represents the beginning of a contracting process to provide additional priority capabilities to Ukraine,\u201d the Pentagon said in a statement on Wednesday. Ukraine\u2019s air force said on Wednesday it downed 37 out of 63 targets in an Russian overnight missile and drone attack. The air force said critical infrastructure and military facilities had been attacked in the nighttime strikes, and that the main target was Ukraine\u2019s southern Odesa region. The Guardian\u2019s Shaun Walker described it as \u201ca second noisy night for residents of Odesa, with numerous explosions audible from the centre of the city and officials telling residents to take cover in bomb shelters. Since Russia pulled out of the grain deal on Monday it has been targeting Ukraine\u2019s main port city relentlessly.\u201d \u201cA difficult night of air attacks for all of Ukraine, especially in the south, in Odesa,\u201d Serhiy Popko, head of the Kyiv\u2019s city military administration, said on the Telegram channel. A fire broke out at the military training grounds in the Kirovske district on the Crimean Peninsula, the Moscow-backed governor of Crimea said on Wednesday. The fire forced the closure of the nearby Tavrida Highway, Sergei Aksyonov said on the Telegram messaging app. Serhiy Bratchuk, spokesperson for the Odesa military administration in Ukraine, posted two videos which purport to show fire in an uninhabited area of Crimea, saying, \u201cEnemy ammunition depot. Staryi Krym\u201d. Staryi Krym is a small historical town in the Kirovske district of Crimea, the peninsula that Russia unilaterally annexed from Ukraine in 2014. The fire comes two days after a blast damaged a bridge linking Russia to Crimea that Moscow blamed on Ukraine. Ukrainian presidential aide Andriy Yermak has criticised the west for not tightening loopholes in sanctions which are allowing Russia to re-stock its military supplies. The Russian defence ministry said on Wednesday its forces destroyed a stray Ukrainian mine drifting in the south-western part of the Black Sea. It said the mine was detected by Russia\u2019s Black Sea fleet, floating about 111 miles (180 km) north-east of the Bosporus Strait. Ukraine defensively mined its coast to prevent the closer approach of Russia\u2019s Black Sea fleet, which has been repeatedly used to launch cruise missile attacks at targets within Ukraine. Vitaliy Kim, governor of Mykolaiv, reports on Telegram that overnight, after a Russian attack, \u201crecreational infrastructure facilities in a coastal zone were destroyed and set on fire. Detailed information is being clarified. Two people were injured, one of them was hospitalised.\u201d The head of Britain\u2019s MI6 foreign spy service Richard Moore has said the Wagner group\u2019s mutiny attempt in June showed Russia\u2019s President Vladimir Putin was under pressure, adding he was optimistic about Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive. In a rare public address Moore said Iran\u2019s decision to supply Moscow with suicide drones for the Ukraine conflict was \u201cunconscionable\u201d, and appealed to Russians appalled by the war in Ukraine to \u201cjoin hands\u201d with his intelligence service and bring the bloodshed to an end. Russian president Vladimir Putin has blamed western countries who he said have \u201ccompletely distorted\u201d the expired Black Sea grain deal, but said Russia would \u201cimmediately\u201d return to the deal if all its conditions for doing so were met, Reuters reports. The US has announced additional security assistance for Ukraine, totalling about $1.3b, with the package including air defence capabilities and munitions. \u201cThis announcement represents the beginning of a contracting process to provide additional priority capabilities to Ukraine,\u201d the Pentagon said in a statement on Wednesday. Reuters reports that talks being mediated by Saudi Arabia and Turkey on the repatriation of Ukrainian thousands of children taken to Russia since Moscow\u2019s invasion have been under way since at least April, a source with knowledge of the discussions said on Wednesday. The source confirmed a Financial Times report that Riyadh and Istanbul were trying to broker a deal to bring home children who have been taken to Russia and placed in children\u2019s homes or adopted by Russian families. Ukraine has accused Russia of carrying out illegal deportations. Moscow, which controls parts of Ukraine\u2019s east and south, denies abducting children and says they have been transported away for their own safety. \u201cThe Turks and the Saudis especially have been showing an interest in bringing Ukrainian children back,\u201d the source, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters. The source said talks had been going on since April but also said they could have started earlier. The Financial Times, quoting four people familiar with the talks, said on Tuesday that discussions had been under way for several months. The source did not indicate to Reuters how the talks were going, but expressed doubt that a deal would be reached because it would depend on Russian president Vladimir Putin. \u201cFor him to give [the children] back would mean that he agrees that he\u2019s a war criminal,\u201d the source said. Russian and Turkish officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Saudi Arabia did not comment on the Financial Times article. The source said Riyadh had won trust after helping last year to negotiate one of the largest prisoner swaps since Russia\u2019s invasion in February 2022. About 300 Ukrainians returned home under the exchange, including commanders who fought a long battle for the city of Mariupol. Kyiv estimates nearly 19,500 children have been taken to Russia or Russian-occupied Crimea since last year\u2019s invasion. Ukrainian official figures show 385 children have been repatriated so far. In March, the international criminal court (ICC) issued an arrest warrant for Putin and Russia\u2019s children\u2019s rights commissioner, accusing them of abducting children from Ukraine. Russia rejects the ICC allegations, saying it does not recognise the court\u2019s jurisdiction and calling the warrants null and void. USAID Administrator Samantha Power met with Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Wednesday. On Twitter, Zelenskiy said the pair discussed further support for Ukraine and talked \u201cin detail [about] the consequences of Russia\u2019s attempt to destroy the Black Sea Grain Initiative.\u201d Russia\u2019s defence ministry has said it will consider all ships travelling to Ukrainian ports on the Black Sea as potential carriers of military equipment from Thursday. Reuters reports that Russia\u2019s defence ministry said on Wednesday that its forces had captured Movchanove railway station in Ukraine\u2019s northeastern Kharkiv region, citing the TASS news agency. Russian mercenary boss Yevgeny Prigozhin was shown in a video welcoming his Wagner fighters to Belarus and telling them they would for now take no further part in the Ukraine war, Reuters reports. In the video, the authenticity of which the Guardian or Reuters could not immediately verify, a man whose voice and Russian sounded like Prigozhin\u2019s is heard welcoming his men. The video was reposted by his press service on Telegram. \u201cWelcome lads \u2026 Welcome to Belarusian soil,\u201d Prigozhin said. The video was shot after night had fallen and it was only possible to discern what looked like Prigozhin\u2019s profile. \u201cWe fought honourably,\u201d said Prigozhin. \u201cYou have done a great deal for Russia. What is going on at the front is a disgrace that we do not need to get involved in.\u201d Prigozhin then tells his men to behave well towards the locals and orders them to train the Belarusian army and collect their strength for a \u201cnew journey to Africa.\u201d \u201cAnd perhaps we will return to the SMO (special military operation in Ukraine) at some point when we are sure that we will not be forced to shame ourselves,\u201d Prigozhin said. A man who sounded like Dmitry Utkin, who helped found Wagner, then spoke to the men. \u201cThis is not the end. This is just the beginning of the biggest work in the world that will be carried out very soon,\u201d Utkin said, before switching to English. \u201cAnd welcome to hell!\u201d The International Monetary Fund on Wednesday said Russia\u2019s exit from the Black Sea grain deal worsens the global food security outlook and risks adding to food inflation, especially for low-income countries, Reuters reports. An IMF spokesperson said the global lender would continue to carefully monitor ongoing developments in the region and their impact on global food insecurity. \u201cThe discontinuation of the initiative impacts the food supply to countries that rely heavily on shipments from Ukraine, in particular in north Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia,\u201d the fund said. \u201cIt worsens the food security outlook and risks adding to global food inflation, especially for low-income countries.\u201d Finland will cancel the operation permit of the Russian consulate in Turku, a city on the Finnish southwest coast, Reuters reports the country\u2019s government said in a statement on Wednesday. Finnish public broadcaster Yle reported the government said Russia\u2019s announcement on 6 July to close Finland\u2019s consulate general in St Petersburg was an asymmetric countermeasure to Finland\u2019s previously announced deportations, and the closure of Turku is considered a countermeasure. Russian media sources including RIA and Interfax are reporting that Vladimir Putin will still participate in the Brics summit, but via videoconferencing. Interfax quotes Kremlin spokesperson stressing this will be a \u201cfull-fledged participation.\u201d Earlier it was announced that Putin would not attend the summit in South Africa in August \u201cby mutual agreement\u201d with the hosts. On Tuesday, South Africa\u2019s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, had asked permission from the international criminal court (ICC) not to arrest Putin, because to do so would amount to a declaration of war, according to a local court submission. Earlier today the Kremlin insisted it did not tell South Africa that arresting Putin on a warrant from the ICC would mean \u201cwar\u201d. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, will appear in person at the event, unlike the \u201cfull-fledged participation\u201d of the president. In March this year the IIC in The Hague issued an arrest warrant for Putin for overseeing the abduction of Ukrainian children, claiming that he had issued a decree expediting the conferral of Russian citizenship on children put up for adoption in Russia after being forcibly deported from Ukraine. In a statement in March the ICC prosecutor Karim Khan said: \u201cMy office alleges that these acts, amongst others, demonstrate an intention to permanently remove these children from their own country. We cannot allow children to be treated as if they are the spoils of war.\u201d The Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, will visit Pakistan on a day trip on Thursday, a Pakistani foreign ministry statement said on Wednesday. Reuters reports Kuleba\u2019s visit will be the first ministerial visit from Ukraine since the establishment of diplomatic ties between the two countries in 1993, and that he will meet his Pakistani counterpart, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, and the prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif. Five central European countries want a ban on Ukrainian grains imports to be extended at least until the end of the year, agriculture ministers said on Wednesday after meeting in Warsaw. The EU in May allowed Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia to ban domestic sales of Ukrainian wheat, maize, rapeseed and sunflower seeds, while allowing transit of such cargoes for export elsewhere. That ban is set to end on 15 September. The countries include some of Kyiv\u2019s staunchest diplomatic supporters in its war against Moscow, but they say inflows of Ukrainian grain have hurt farmers at home. Reuters reports that the Polish agriculture minister, Robert Telus, said the five countries signed a common declaration regarding the extension of the ban until at least the end of the year, which they will present in talks with the European Commission. Reuters reports that Ukraine is setting up a temporary shipping route to maintain grain shipments after Russia quit the Black Sea grain deal, Kyiv said in an official letter on Wednesday. Russia attacked Ukraine\u2019s Black Sea Odesa port for the second consecutive night on Tuesday after quitting the deal on Monday, which included Moscow revoking guarantees for safe navigation. In a letter dated 18 July submitted to UN shipping agency, the International Shipping Organization, on Wednesday Ukraine said it had \u201cdecided to establish on a temporary basis a recommended maritime route\u201d. \u201cIts goal is to facilitate the unblocking of international shipping in the north-western part of the Black Sea,\u201d Vasyl Shkurakov, Ukraine\u2019s acting minister for communities, territories and infrastructure development, said in the letter. Ukraine added in the letter that the additional traffic route it was establishing would lead to the territorial waters and exclusive maritime economic zone of Romania, which is one of the neighbouring Black Sea countries. Here are some pictures of the Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, meeting the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and the prime minister, Denys Shmyhal. The Ukrainian agriculture minister, Mykola Solsky, said on Wednesday that a \u201cconsiderable\u201d amount of grain export infrastructure at Chornomorsk port in Ukraine\u2019s Odesa region had been damaged in a Russian attack, Reuters reports. The attack also destroyed 60,000 tonnes of grain at the port that should have been loaded and shipped via the Black Sea Grain Initiative 60 days ago, he said. \u201cThe night-time attack put a considerable part of the grain export infrastructure in the port of Chornomorsk out of operation,\u201d Solsky said on Telegram. The Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, has made an unannounced visit to Kyiv where he said \u201cRussia cannot be allowed to succeed\u201d. Speaking at a media briefing after talks with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Varadkar said: \u201cMy visits to the sites of these atrocities this morning, and my meeting here in Kyiv, has confirmed to me that Russia will not succeed, and Russia cannot be allowed to succeed. \u201cIf Russia thinks that targeting civilians and essential infrastructure will discourage Ukraine\u2019s friends, including Ireland, well, it\u2019s wrong. \u201cVolodymyr Zelenskiy, we will stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes. Ukraine will prevail and Ukraine will be rebuilt.\u201d On Twitter, Zelenskiy said: \u201cAlthough Ireland is a neutral country, this neutrality does not mean indifference, and this is very important. Thank you for all your support!\u201d The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, will not attend the summit of the Brics group of nations in South Africa in August \u201cby mutual agreement\u201d, with foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov taking his place. A statement released by South Africa\u2019s presidency on Wednesday said: \u201cBy mutual agreement, President Vladimir Putin of the Russian Federation will not attend the summit but the Russian Federation will be represented by foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov.\u201d On Tuesday, South Africa\u2019s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, had asked permission from the ICC not to arrest Putin, because to do so would amount to a declaration of war, according to a local court submission. On Wednesday, Russia said it did not tell South Africa that arresting Putin on a warrant from the ICC would mean \u201cwar\u201d. South Africa is due to host a summit of Brics nations \u2013 Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa \u2013 next month. But the ICC has an arrest warrant out for Putin, accusing him of the war crime of deporting Ukrainian children to Russia. South Africa, as an ICC member, is obliged to arrest him should he appear in person at the summit. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said Russia \u201cdeliberately targeted\u201d grain terminals and infrastructure in the Black Sea port of Odesa. On Telegram, Zelenskiy said: \u201cAt the morning conference call, I heard information about night-time Russian strikes on Odesa, Zhytomyr, and other regions of our country. Russian terrorists absolutely deliberately targeted the infrastructure of the grain agreement, and every Russian missile is a blow not only to Ukraine, but also to everyone in the world who seeks a normal and safe life.\u201d Russia did not tell South Africa that arresting President Vladimir Putin on a warrant from the international criminal court (ICC) would mean \u201cwar\u201d, the Kremlin said on Wednesday, Reuters reports. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters, however, that everyone understood \u2013 without having it explained to them \u2013 what an attempt to infringe on Putin\u2019s rights would mean. South Africa\u2019s President Cyril Ramaphosa had asked permission from the ICC not to arrest Putin, because to do so would amount to a declaration of war, a local court submission published on Tuesday showed. South Africa is due to host a summit of Brics nations \u2013 Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa \u2013 next month. But the ICC has an arrest warrant out for Putin, accusing him of the war crime of deporting Ukrainian children to Russia. South Africa, as an ICC member, is obliged to arrest him should he appear in person at the summit. The Kremlin said on Wednesday that the west had shown it was ready to turn a blind eye to what it said were \u201cterrorist attacks\u201d committed by Ukraine inside Russia, Reuters reports. Two people were killed on Monday after Moscow said Ukraine used naval drones to attack the bridge linking Russia to the Crimean peninsula, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014. Kyiv says Crimea is Ukrainian and that it intends to take it back by force. Russia has said that the UN has three months to implement the terms of a memorandum that would facilitate Russian agricultural exports if it wanted Moscow to resume talks about allowing Ukrainian grain exports to restart, Reuters reports. Russia\u2019s foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova told Radio Sputnik: \u201cThe Russia-UN Memorandum itself states, and I\u2019ll quote \u2026 that the agreement will be in force for three years, and in case one of the parties intends to terminate it [either Russia or the UN], it must give three months\u2019 notice. We have given notice. \u201cAccordingly, the UN still has three months to achieve concrete results. Therefore, people should not run to the microphones at the UN Secretariat, but use these three months to achieve concrete results. If there are concrete results, we will return to the discussion of this [wider] issue.\u201d Ukraine\u2019s air force said on Wednesday it downed 37 out of 63 targets in an Russian overnight missile and drone attack. The air force said critical infrastructure and military facilities had been attacked in the nighttime strikes, and that the main target was Ukraine\u2019s southern Odesa region. The Guardian\u2019s Shaun Walker described it as \u201ca second noisy night for residents of Odesa, with numerous explosions audible from the centre of the city and officials telling residents to take cover in bomb shelters. Since Russia pulled out of the grain deal on Monday it has been targeting Ukraine\u2019s main port city relentlessly.\u201d \u201cA difficult night of air attacks for all of Ukraine, especially in the south, in Odesa,\u201d Serhiy Popko, head of the Kyiv\u2019s city military administration, said on the Telegram channel. A fire broke out at the military training grounds in the Kirovske district on the Crimean Peninsula, the Moscow-backed governor of Crimea said on Wednesday. The fire forced the closure of the nearby Tavrida Highway, Sergei Aksyonov said on the Telegram messaging app. Serhiy Bratchuk, spokesperson for the Odesa military administration in Ukraine, posted two videos which purport to show fire in an uninhabited area of Crimea, saying, \u201cEnemy ammunition depot. Staryi Krym\u201d. Staryi Krym is a small historical town in the Kirovske district of Crimea, the peninsula that Russia unilaterally annexed from Ukraine in 2014. The fire comes two days after a blast damaged a bridge linking Russia to Crimea that Moscow blamed on Ukraine. Ukrainian presidential aide Andriy Yermak has criticised the west for not tightening loopholes in sanctions which are allowing Russia to re-stock its military supplies. The Russian defence ministry said on Wednesday its forces destroyed a stray Ukrainian mine drifting in the south-western part of the Black Sea. It said the mine was detected by Russia\u2019s Black Sea fleet, floating about 111 miles (180 km) north-east of the Bosporus Strait. Ukraine defensively mined its coast to prevent the closer approach of Russia\u2019s Black Sea fleet, which has been repeatedly used to launch cruise missile attacks at targets within Ukraine. Vitaliy Kim, governor of Mykolaiv, reports on Telegram that overnight, after a Russian attack, \u201crecreational infrastructure facilities in a coastal zone were destroyed and set on fire. Detailed information is being clarified. Two people were injured, one of them was hospitalised.\u201d The head of Britain\u2019s MI6 foreign spy service Richard Moore has said the Wagner group\u2019s mutiny attempt in June showed Russia\u2019s President Vladimir Putin was under pressure, adding he was optimistic about Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive. In a rare public address Moore said Iran\u2019s decision to supply Moscow with suicide drones for the Ukraine conflict was \u201cunconscionable\u201d, and appealed to Russians appalled by the war in Ukraine to \u201cjoin hands\u201d with his intelligence service and bring the bloodshed to an end. The Russian defence ministry said on Wednesday its forces destroyed a stray Ukrainian mine drifting in the south-western part of the Black Sea.

Ukraine defensively mined its coast to prevent the closer approach of Russia\u2019s Black Sea fleet, which has been repeatedly used to launch cruise missile attacks at targets within Ukraine. A gigantic pro-Russian mural painted by an Italian street artist on a bombed-out building in occupied Mariupol has sparked a row in Italy with the artist accused of plagiarism and spreading the Kremlin\u2019s false information on the conflict in Ukraine. On 11 July, Italian street artist Ciro Cerullo, known as Jorit, announced on his Instagram profile that he had completed a mural in the devastated Ukrainian city. The mural features the little girl with the colours of the flag of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People\u2019s Republic in her eyes. Behind her, bombs with the word \u201cNato\u201d are falling. \u201cThey lied to us about Vietnam, they lied to us about Afghanistan, they lied to us about Iraq, and now I have proof: they are also lying to us about Donbas\u201d, Jorit wrote in his post on Instagram. \u2018\u2019Be wary of those who would like to give us morals, their hands are covered in blood.\u2019\u2019 In an interview with Giornale Radio, Jorit said he had painted \u201ca living little girl from Donbas who spent her first years in Mariupol surrounded by war\u201d. However, a number of users on Instagram and Twitter pointed out the striking resemblance to a photograph that appeared on the 2018 cover of the Australian photography magazine Capture, taken by Australian photographer Helen Whittle with the subject being her daughter, the very same little girl allegedly used as a model by Jorit in Mariupol. As noted by Valigia Blu, an Italian non-profit independent factchecking and debunking website focusing on journalism, \u201cbefore the full-scale Russian invasion there was a mural dedicated to a Ukrainian girl from Mariupol, Milana Abdurashytova\u201d. \u201cIn January 2015, she was hit by a missile strike launched by pro-Russian separatist forces, and she lost her mother and a leg\u201d reports Valigia Blu. \u201cThree years later, to commemorate Milana Abdurashytova\u2019s story, street artist Sasha Korban dedicated a mural to her on the facade of a building on Prospekt Myru. But after the occupation, the Russians covered it up. For the Ukrainians \u2014 and the legitimate administration of Mariupol \u2014 the occupiers are \u201ctrying to erase the 2015 tragedy from the memory of the city\u2019s residents\u201d. Soon after the Russian invasion \u2013 in late February \u2013 Mariupol was one of the first major cities to be encircled. Viewed as a key Kremlin objective, the city was the scene of a siege that the Red Cross has defined as \u201capocalyptic\u201d. The outskirts of the city became the site of a mass grave, and the bodies of many more men, women and children were either dumped in the streets or remain buried beneath the rubble. Reuters has spoken to a farmer in Ukraine who fears for his livelihood with the ending of the Black Sea grain export deal. Kees Huizinga, who moved from his native Netherlands to farm in central Ukraine in 2003, said his finances, already squeezed by Russia\u2019s invasion last year, appear catastrophic. \u201cWe have some reserves so we can survive for a month or so, but if we can\u2019t sell it\u2019s going to be a disaster,\u201d he said at his 15,000-hectare farm in a village in the rolling hills and green flat plains of the Cherkasy region in central Ukraine. The Dutchman, who grows seven major crops including wheat and sunflowers, estimates war-related disruption cost his business between $3m and $6m in 2022, and could cost it another $6m this year. He said he was getting about $100 a ton for his barley, half the price that western European farmers would receive, and that his transportation costs had risen sharply. \u201cSome farmers who have more reserves will last longer, and those farmers who have less reserves will probably have to sell or close down the business, or give it to somebody else,\u201d he said. The Guardian\u2019s Jamie Wilson has taken these pictures this morning at the scene of one of the overnight Russian strikes on Ukraine\u2019s port city of Odesa. He reported that windows were blown out in dozens of surrounding buildings. Some more words from the head of Britain\u2019s MI6 foreign spy service Richard Moore, who has said the Wagner group\u2019s mutiny attempt in June showed Russia\u2019s President Vladimir Putin was under pressure, adding he was optimistic about Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive. Reuters reports that in a rare public address Moore said Iran\u2019s decision to supply Moscow with suicide drones for the Ukraine conflict was \u201cunconscionable\u201d, and claimed it had provoked internal quarrels at the highest level of the regime in Tehran. Mykhailo Podolyak, adviser to the head of the president\u2019s office, has also addressed the recent wave of Russian attacks on Odesa on social media. He posted to say: Today\u2019s massive and combined attack on Odesa absolutely concretely recorded the attitude of the Russian Federation to \u201cfood security\u201d. The Russian Federation deliberately and purposefully struck grain terminals and other port facilities. The main task is to destroy the possibility of sending Ukrainian grain. These are direct strikes on civilian infrastructure and the civilian population and blows to the global food programme. In a reference to recent comments by Russian officials about damage to the Crimean bridge being a terrorist attack on civilian infrastruture, he asked \u201cWill [UN secretary general] Ant\u00f3nio Guterres make statements about the \u2018inadmissibility of strikes on legitimate civilian infrastructure\u2019?\u201d and Podolyak challenged the UN to hold a security meeting about the attacks. There are some punchy statements coming out of Volodymyr Zelenskiy\u2019s presidential office this morning. First off, on Telegram Andriy Yermak has criticised the west for not tightening loopholes in sanctions which are allowing Russia to re-stock its military supplies. He said: The Russian terror of Odesa proves once again that they need hunger and problems in the countries of the global south. They want to create a refugee crisis for the west. Everything is done in order to weaken allies and politically intervene in the internal affairs of these countries. For this, the Russians use weapons that cannot be manufactured without components produced in the west and in Asian countries. We need a systemic response. It is necessary to strengthen sanctions, in particular, against those who help the Russians to circumvent them. We are waiting, our allies are preparing a solution. It is also possible to stop the re-export of necessary components for the manufacture of weapons, if those with the responsibility for this will act strictly. He reiterated Ukraine\u2019s appeal for longer range weapons, saying: The answer to terror is force. Weapons, aviation, long-range missiles \u2013 this is what Ukraine needs. We must expel the Russian Federation from our territory. The head of Britain\u2019s MI6 foreign spy service appealed on Wednesday to Russians appalled by the war in Ukraine to \u201cjoin hands\u201d with his intelligence service and bring the bloodshed to an end. In his second speech since becoming chief of the Secret Intelligence Service in 2020, Moore said there appeared little prospect of Russia regaining momentum in Ukraine. Delivering his speech at the British embassy in Prague, he likened the current situation in Ukraine to the Prague spring in 1968. \u201cAs they witness the venality, infighting and callous incompetence of their leaders \u2013 the human factor as its worst \u2013 many Russians are wrestling with the same dilemmas as their predecessors did in 1968,\u201d Reuters reports Moore said. \u201cI invite them to do what others have done this past 18 months and join hands with us. Our door is always open \u2026 their secrets will be safe with us and together we will work to bring the bloodshed to an end.\u201d Suspilne reports that Ukraine is considering the possibility of a \u201cgrain corridor\u201d through the territorial waters of Romania and Bulgaria, after Russia\u2019s withdrawal from the grain deal. It cited Ukraine\u2019s ambassador to Turkey. Here is one of the unverified video clips purporting to be the fire at a military training ground in Russian-annexed Crimea that has being doing the rounds on social media this morning. The Guardian has not independently verified the location or time the video was taken. Here is a selection of some of the most recent pictures sent to us from Ukraine and Crimea. Shaun Walker is in Odesa for the Guardian: It was a second noisy night for residents of Odesa, with numerous explosions audible from the centre of the city and officials telling residents to take cover in bomb shelters. Since Russia pulled out of the grain deal on Monday it has been targeting Ukraine\u2019s main port city relentlessly. A wave of missiles and drones were used in the overnight attacks, most of which were intercepted by Ukrainian air defences. Various residents shared videos on Telegram of damage to windows or shrapnel damage from falling debris, but was it not immediately clear if there were casualties in the city. Ukraine\u2019s air force said six high-precision Onix missiles were directed at Odesa\u2019s port, where yesterday USAid chief Samatha Power held a press conference. On Wednesday morning, authorities reported they were battling a fire in the broader Odesa region after Russian incoming hit warehouses containing fireworks and tobacco. One person was injured there. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, has posted this latest news update from Odesa. It writes: During the night attack on Odesa region, rockets hit the grain and oil terminal, damaged tanks and equipment for loading, and a fire broke out, said Vladyslav Nazarov, the spokesperson for the \u201cSouth\u201d command. In the Odesa region, an industrial facility was hit, where an employee was injured, and two warehouses in different locations were also hit \u2013 with tobacco and fireworks. Also, as a result of combat work, several apartment buildings were damaged by an explosive wave in residential complexes of Odesa. At least six residents of Odesa, including a nine-year-old boy, sought medical help after being injured by fragments of glass and other objects. The claims have not been independently verified. Jamie Wilson, who is in Odesa for the Guardian, reports that, after a night of intense Russian attacks, \u201cit is business as usual in central Odesa this morning, with lots of cars and buses and people going off to work.\u201d Ukraine\u2019s air force said on Wednesday it downed 37 out of 63 targets in an Russian overnight missile and drone attack, including 23 suicide drones and 14 cruise missiles. The air force said critical infrastructure and military facilities had been attacked in the nighttime strikes, and that the main target was Ukraine\u2019s southern Odesa region.

You can contact me at martin.belam@theguardian.com. Most of Ukraine was under air raid alerts on and off starting soon after midnight on Wednesday, with Russia striking other places, including a drone attack on Kyiv. \u201cA difficult night of air attacks for all of Ukraine, especially in the south, in Odesa,\u201d Serhiy Popko, head of the Kyiv\u2019s city military administration, said on the Telegram channel. He said Kyiv was attacked and according to preliminary information there was some damage or casualties. The Moscow-backed governor of Crimea has said on Telegram that 2,000 people will be evacuated as a result of the fire. Sergei Aksyonov wrote: The temporary evacuation of residents of four settlements \u2013 that\u2019s more than two thousand people \u2013 is planned from the area adjacent to the landfill in the Kirovsky district. The operational headquarters has been deployed, all specialised services are working on the spot. A fire broke out at the military training grounds in the Kirovske district on the Crimean peninsula, the Moscow-backed governor of Crimea said on Wednesday. The fire forced the closure of the nearby Tavrida highway, Sergei Aksyonov said on the Telegram messaging app. Earlier, the RBC-Ukraine news agency reported that there were explosions on the military training grounds. Russia launched strikes on Ukraine\u2018s southern Odesa region, the local governor said early Wednesday, the second consecutive night of attacks on the area since Moscow pulled out of a grain export deal. AFP: Oleg Kiper said there had been a \u201cmassive attack\u201d, without providing details. He asked residents to stay in shelters. Ukraine\u2019s air force said it had detected the launch of Kalibr missiles from the Black Sea, without giving details. A video posted on social media purporting to show the aftermath of a strike showed a multi-storey apartment building with several windows blown out and shards of glass on the street. Air alerts were issued for more than a dozen regions across Ukraine. On Tuesday a Russian strike damaged facilities at the port city of Odesa after Moscow pulled out of an agreement facilitating the safe shipment of grain from Ukraine. The Kremlin later issued a veiled warning over the future of grain exports via the Black Sea, claiming Kyiv was using the export corridor \u201cfor combat purposes\u201d. Welcome back to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the war in Ukraine with me, Helen Sullivan. Our top stories this morning: Russia launched strikes on Ukraine\u2019s southern Odesa region, the local governor said early Wednesday, the second consecutive night of attacks on the area since Moscow pulled out of a grain export deal. Oleg Kiper urged residents to stay in shelters, before declaring the air alarm suspended, without providing details on damage. And a fire broke out at the military training grounds in the Kirovske district on the Crimean Peninsula early on Wednesday morning, the Moscow-backed governor of Crimea said. The fire forced the closure of the nearby Tavrida Highway, Russian-installed Governor Sergei Aksyonov of Crimea said on the Telegram messaging app. Earlier, the RBC-Ukraine news agency reported that there were explosions on the military training grounds. Neither the Guardian nor Reuters have independently verified the report. Elsewhere: Russia\u2019s defence ministry said on Tuesday it had carried out overnight strikes on two Ukrainian port cities in what it called \u201ca mass revenge strike\u201d a day after an attack on the Kursk Bridge, which it blamed on Kyiv. The ministry claiming thats it hit \u201cfacilities where terrorist acts against the Russian Federation were being prepared using crewless boats, as well as at the place of their manufacture at a shipyard near the city of Odesa\u201d, and fuel depots in Mykolayiv. Russia and Ukraine presented vastly different accounts of fighting in northeastern Ukraine on Tuesday, with Moscow reporting advances by its troops and Kyiv saying it had seized the initiative in the region. Both sides reported no letup in the fighting. Ukraine has reported a measure of progress in a counteroffensive launched early last month in the east and in capturing villages in the south, while Moscow says it has contained any move forward by Kyiv\u2019s forces. Both sides have achieved \u201cmarginal advances\u201d in different areas over the past week, the UK\u2019s Ministry of Defence has said in its latest intelligence update on the conflict. There are a \u201cnumber of ideas being floated\u201d to help get Ukrainian and Russian grain and fertiliser to global markets after Moscow quit a deal allowing the safe export of Ukraine grain through the Black Sea, the United Nations said on Tuesday. The head of USAid accused Putin of making a \u201clife and death decision\u201d affecting millions of the world\u2019s poorest people by withdrawing from the Black Sea grain deal. Speaking in the shadow of several vast grain silos in the key trading port of Odesa, Samantha Power pledged a further $250m to create and expand alternative routes for Ukrainian grain to leave the country, but admitted nothing would compensate for the loss of the Black Sea ports. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, discussed with his Turkish counterpart, Hakan Fidan, ways of exporting Russian grain via routes \u201cthat would not be susceptible to Kyiv and the west\u2019s sabotage\u201d, Russia\u2019s foreign ministry said on Tuesday. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has asked permission from the international criminal court not to arrest Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin, because to do so would amount to a declaration of war, a local court submission published on Tuesday showed. South Africa is due to host a summit of the BRICS club of nations \u2013 Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa \u2013 next month. But the ICC has an arrest warrant out for Putin, accusing him of the war crime of deporting Ukrainian children to Russia. South Africa, as an ICC member, is obliged to arrest him should he appear in person at the summit. An investigation has identified military units under Russia\u2019s command that carried out human rights abuses last year during the occupation of the Ukrainian city of Izium. The report by the Centre for Information Resilience names four militia units that allegedly abused civilians and prisoners of war. US General Mark Milley said in a Pentagon briefing that Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive is far from a failure but the fight ahead will be long. He said: \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of fighting left to go and I\u2019ll stay with what we said before: This is going to be long. It\u2019s going be hard. It\u2019s going to be bloody.\u201d Ben Wallace, the outgoing UK defence secretary, said the war in Ukraine is \u201cwinnable\u201d, arguing the Nato alliance \u201cdoes function\u201d as a deterrent against Russia at the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change conference in London. Russia\u2019s parliament has extended the eligibility for military call-up by at least five years \u2013 in the case of the highest-ranking officers, up to the age of 70. Britain\u2019s Ministry of Defence said on Tuesday it plans to invest \u00a32.5bn ($3.3bn) in army stockpiles and munitions \u201cto improve fighting readiness\u201d, as it \u201ctakes learnings from the war in Ukraine\u201d. Russian air defences and electronic countermeasure systems downed 28 Ukrainian drones over Crimea in the early hours of Tuesday, the RIA news agency has cited the Russian defence ministry as saying. The drone attacks caused no casualties or damages, the ministry said.

Rishi Sunak had promised that guidance for schools in England dealing with trans issues would be published by the end of the summer term. But the guidance has been held up by legal questions, with No 10 saying on Wednesday that \u201cmore evidence is required\u201d before publication. Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said the internal battle between ministers was leaving schools isolated. \u201cWe have been telling the government that schools and colleges need clear guidance on provision for transgender and gender-questioning pupils for the past five years, so it is frustrating that it has now got to the point of producing something but appears to be locked in an internal political squabble which is causing a further delay,\u201d Barton said. \u201cAt present, schools have to navigate this complex and sensitive subject entirely on their own. \u201cClear, practical guidance on this matter is important as long as it is genuinely supportive to schools and pupils and does not add to the existing and onerous expectations on schools. \u201cWe will be looking very closely at the guidance when it is published and consulting with our members to ensure it is proportionate, fair and deliverable.\u201d The prime minister\u2019s spokesperson said: \u201cWe understand that there is a need for further guidance, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been working on urgently. \u201cEqually, it\u2019s vital we get this right. Teachers want clear guidance that is workable in school settings and that\u2019s what we are working towards. But this is a sensitive area. We do feel more evidence is required before we publish the guidance.\u201d Schools have faced an increasing number of children questioning their gender in recent years, and school leaders have repeatedly called for clarity on how they should support trans children. Kemi Badenoch, the minister for women and equalities, is said to be pushing for the non-statutory guidance to include a ban on social transitioning by pupils, meaning that transgender children would not be able to use another name and pronoun or wear uniform of the opposite gender. But the Times said legal advice from Victoria Prentis, the attorney general, found that a ban on social transitioning in schools was unlawful under the Equalities Act and would require the government passing new legislation. A spokesperson for the attorney general\u2019s office said: \u201cBy longstanding convention, reflected in the ministerial code, whether the law officers have been asked to provide legal advice and the content of any advice is not disclosed outside government without their explicit consent. That consent is rarely given.\u201d New legislation could delay the guidance until the 2024 general election. Alternatively, the government could issue guidance that drops the controversial clauses. On Sunday Badenoch told the BBC that the guidance would compel schools to inform parents if their child was questioning their gender. \u201cWhat is right is that parents know what is going on with their children at school,\u201d she said. But on Monday the education secretary, Gillian Keegan, declined to tell MPs when the guidance would be published, saying that she was working with Badenoch to produce it \u201cin the near term\u201d."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b223b5", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/19/vladimir-putin-to-miss-south-africa-summit-amid-row-over-possible-arrest", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Vladimir Putin to miss South Africa summit amid row over possible arrest", "lead": "Cyril Ramaphosa faced demands for Russian president to be detained under ICC warrant if he attended Brics summit", "author": "Andrew Roth", "datePublished": "2023-07-19 17:46:14", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.232994", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/6c7bde720f1c5160e45750537769142a344ec937/0_66_4375_2624/500.jpg", "body": "Vladimir Putin will not attend a Brics summit in South Africa next month amid speculation that he could be detained under an international criminal court warrant for his arrest for war crimes in Ukraine. South Africa\u2019s presidential office announced that the Russian president would not be attending the summit after holding a \u201cnumber of consultations\u201d with the Kremlin. South Africa is an ICC signatory and would be expected to aid in his arrest if the Russian leader came to the summit. Putin\u2019s potential attendance had sparked a domestic political scandal. President Cyril Ramaphosa said taking part in arresting Putin would risk a war with Russia. His remarks came after the Democratic Alliance, the largest opposition party, sued the government to demand that Putin be arrested if he arrived in the country. \u201cRussia has made it clear that arresting its sitting president would be a declaration of war,\u201d Ramaphosa responded, according to court documents. \u201cIt would be inconsistent with our constitution to risk engaging in war with Russia.\u201d The Kremlin denied that it had explicitly told Pretoria that an attempt to arrest Putin in South Africa would be tantamount to a declaration of war. But it did not deny that fact either. \u201cNobody informed anyone about anything,\u201d said Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesperson. \u201cIn this world, it\u2019s absolutely clear to everyone what an attempt to encroach on the Russian leader means.\u201d \u201cTherefore, there\u2019s no need to explain anything to anyone here.\u201d In March, the ICC issued an arrest warrant for Putin for overseeing the abduction of Ukrainian children in its invasion of Ukraine. Both Putin and Russia\u2019s children\u2019s rights commissioner Maria Alekseyevna Lvova-Belova bore responsibility for the \u201cunlawful deportation\u201d of thousands of Ukrainian children, the court, based in The Hague, said. It was a rare indictment of a sitting head of state. Russia has denounced the ICC decision and said it does not apply to Russia because Moscow is not a signatory to the treaty. But Putin has not travelled abroad, save for the occupied territories of Ukraine, since the ICC warrant was announced. Putin will attend the Brics summit by videoconference, the Kremlin has said.

Ivan Cartwright said Flutter Entertainment\u2019s controls \u201cwere and are inadequate\u201d to protect people with a gambling problem. He accused the company of doing only what was necessary to meet regulatory requirements, rather that following best practice to prevent harm. Flutter has 56 days to respond. Cartwright issued the warning in a letter to Flutter\u2019s chief executive, Peter Jackson, who has been paid \u00a311.3m over the past two years. He also copied the letter to the Gambling Commission and to the culture secretary, Lucy Frazer, who is overseeing government proposals to reform gambling regulation. Last month the Leicestershire coroner issued a landmark ruling in the 2021 suicide of Luke Ashton, who took his own life after a period of addiction during which he placed up to 100 bets a day online and racked up \u00a318,000 in debts. The ruling, in which gambling disorder was determined to be a factor in Ashton\u2019s death, is believed to be the first of its kind. In a conclusion to accompany the verdict, issued last month, Cartwright said Betfair, which gave Ashton \u00a35 \u201cfree bet\u201d offers, had failed to \u201cinteract or intervene with Luke in any meaningful way\u201d in the period leading up to his death. Flutter, the \u00a328bn international gambling firm that owns Betfair, says it has significantly improved its safer gambling measures since then. But on Wednesday, in his letter to Jackson, Cartwright said he believed there was still a risk of future deaths due to \u201cinadequate\u201d safeguards. He said: \u201cIn my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\u201d Cartwright said the company\u2019s safer gambling tools \u201cdo not amount to any meaningful interaction\u201d with customers who may be showing signs of addiction. Cartwright said algorithms designed by Flutter to flag up customers gambling excessively appeared to have failed because they judged Ashton\u2019s gambling not to be \u201cexceptional\u201d, despite an increase in his playing time, deposits and losses. He added that Betfair \u201cappears to judge the extent of its responsibilities to gambling customers solely with regard to industry (regulatory) standards, rather than current good or best practice\u201d. Flutter, which also owns Paddy Power and Sky Betting &amp; Gaming, said it would respond formally. The company said it had made \u201csignificant changes to our controls since 2021 and will, of course, incorporate additional learnings from this tragic case into our systems and processes. \u201cWe wish to reiterate our sincere condolences to Mrs Ashton and her family. We are truly sorry for their loss.\u201d Ashton was a member of a Betfair \u201crewards\u201d scheme whose members were eligible for a \u00a35 \u201cfree\u201d bet each month. The Gambling Commission said it was reviewing such incentives, as part of the government\u2019s white paper on gambling reform. But the Commission will take no further action against Flutter. This is because Ashton\u2019s gambling took place while the company was in \u201cspecial measures\u201d triggered by separate incidents, which the regulator said had already led to the company improving its controls and paying a \u00a3635,000 penalty. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport said: \u201cOur thoughts are with Luke\u2019s family and friends. This tragic case shows the devastating impact gambling addiction can have on people\u2019s lives. \u201cGambling firms can and should be checking and intervening when customers show signs of being at risk of harm. \u201cWe are increasing protections for people experiencing gambling problems and the independent gambling regulator will toughen the obligations on firms to check if high-spending customers\u2019 losses are a sign their gambling could be out of control.\u201d \u2022 In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

It takes no account of first-in-family students, for whom attending their local university is a massive achievement. Most of these aren\u2019t Russell Group universities, but they are institutions valued by their local community. Many taking \u201clow-value\u201d degrees will be working class, ethnic minority, disabled or mature students, some of whom are unable to relocate for their higher education or any subsequent professional role due to a lack of resources or because of familial commitments. This policy fails to acknowledge deep-seated regional and structural inequalities, the lack of graduate roles in some parts of the country, and widespread discrimination in the job market against many of the types of students who study \u201clow-value\u201d degrees. Si\u00e2n Lawrence Mature, working-class, first-in-family PhD student, Durham University \u2022 Government proposals to cap the student numbers on what they define as low-value degrees show once again the limits of market-driven thinking when applied to education. The value of a university degree can manifest itself in many ways after graduation. Higher education is a public good as it produces better-informed citizens trained in academic methodologies, whether in Stem (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) or the humanities, who can make evidence-based decisions in their communities and families, thus strengthening and enriching our society as well as our economy. Other OECD countries recognise the benefits of mass education in the era of knowledge economies and have higher rates of participation than the UK. Julian Preece Council for the Defence of British Universities \u2022 One of the very many depressing things about our prime minister\u2019s crusade against low-value degrees is that value to him automatically means \u201ceconomic value\u201d. That makes a kind of sense in a context where degrees are funded by a fee-based model that encourages students to think of themselves as consumers buying a product. Yet there\u2019s an irony in that it\u2019s degrees that are often treated as low-value (such as the one I teach, English) that encourage students to reflect on the ways that different systems of value \u2013 moral, aesthetic, political, economic \u2013 overlap, pull apart and conflict with one another. It\u2019s a shame that conversations about degrees tend to prioritise one kind of worth over all others. Dr Chris Townsend Christ\u2019s College, Cambridge \u2022 Robin Walker MP, the chair of the education select committee, said: \u201cGiven the substantial amounts of public money that go into supporting students to go to universities, I think it\u2019s legitimate for government to look at where that delivers value.\u201d Would he like to look at the value of the Oxford degree in politics, philosophy and economics (PPE) given to three out of the last five prime ministers? David Cameron held the referendum that took us out of the EU. Liz Truss broke the economy. Rishi Sunak is not in line to reach his objectives. The track record of PPE suggests it is of low value to the country. Ann Lynch Skipton, North Yorkshire \u2022 The massive expansion in student numbers has meant that many young people now feel forced to go to university just to have the same career prospects as someone with A-levels or similar a few decades ago. Limiting the number of low-value degrees will reduce this pressure and be advantageous for 18-year-olds.

The story of a troubled virtuoso tormented by their own genius, turning to drink and drugs, then flaming out before their time has been told over and over again. And so in the making of Have You Got It Yet?, his new documentary about the Pink Floyd cofounder Syd Barrett, director Roddy Bogawa faced the peculiar task of fighting the ready-made drama of a man whose life story sounds like legend. Barrett led the group as guitarist and vocalist when they dubbed themselves The Pink Floyd Sound in 1965, and he spearheaded the creation of their groundbreaking debut album Piper at the Gates of Dawn two years later. But erratic behavior stemming from his deteriorating mental health had alienated his fellow band members, and ultimately led to his unceremonious dismissal not long afterward. There were murmurs that LSD had liquefied his brain, leaving him to slowly descend into madness while secluding himself in his country home. In the popular imagination, he became a symbol of squandered potential and larger-than-life tragedy. Look closer, however, and you\u2019ll find a biography with a stronger tether to Earth. In close study of Barrett\u2019s work, in visiting his old haunts, and especially in consulting those who knew him personally, Bogawa and his late co-director Storm Thorgerson acquainted themselves with a figure of fragile brilliance offset by modest humanity. Barrett shrugged off the spotlight in an effort to bring some measure of normalcy back to his life, a withdrawal that ironically drew in the curiosity of a loyal fandom. The relative lack of intel turned him into a palimpsest on to which any listener could scrawl their fantasies and anxieties, but Bogawa sought out the interior essence of an icon now more image than man. \u201cHis is a story of many artists and creative people: Brian Jones from the Rolling Stones, Brian Wilson, Daniel Johnston, even Kurt Cobain in some ways,\u201d Bogawa tells the Guardian from his home in Manhattan. \u201cThese are people who found a creative outlet to express the things that were inside them, then the combination of external and internal pressures built up these fractures. One of the things that makes Syd unique in this group is that he didn\u2019t die. He in fact did become a recluse, lived for 22 more years after recording his last record. He went back to painting. Nobody really knew what had happened to him \u2026 One of the things that\u2019s built Syd\u2019s image is people projecting their own feelings and thoughts or even worries on to his story. He was out of the limelight, so people could fill in that unresolved mystery how they like. That\u2019s compelling to people.\u201d Bogawa first restores mortality to Barrett by focusing on the mechanics of his music, breaking down his forward-thinking techniques spun out from jazz. He advanced the front lines of instrumental innovation alongside The Beatles \u2014 who worked on Sgt. Pepper\u2019s down the hall from Pink Floyd\u2019s Piper at the Gates of Dawn sessions at Abbey Road Studios \u2014 with his avant-garde forays into backwards guitar mixing and multi-track recording. \u201cHe was hanging out with AMM and Keith Rowe and all these people,\u201d Bogawa says. \u201cSome of the stuff we\u2019d call prepared piano or prepared guitar now, he was doing things other people weren\u2019t \u2014 rolling the ball bearings on the electric guitar, playing slide guitar with a Zippo lighter. I think Graham Coxon said this, which I thought was beautiful, that he was using his guitar as a sonic paintbrush. He wasn\u2019t a typical-minded musician. He\u2019d make chord shapes just by looking at his fingers, the shape of his hand. He hung out with some experimental people. Going into this as a film director instead of a fan, pairing his music with footage and edits, I listened more closely than I ever had. I was blown away by his inventiveness.\u201d Articulating the content of Barrett\u2019s character proved more complicated, a gradual process of getting to know someone long since passed away. As he conducted interviews with the subject\u2019s loved ones and Britpop luminaries inspired by his legacy, Bogawa came to realize that Barrett was reacting somewhat reasonably to the extreme pressures that ten-plus gigs per week on top of unceasing nagging from label executives for the next single can exert on someone in his twenties. The rumors that he took acid with breakfast every morning were quickly revealed as \u201ca crock of shit,\u201d though Bogawa surmises that there\u2019s a kernel of truth in the tall tale of Barrett walking fifty miles just to get home one night. Friends suggest that he hitchhiked as far as he could then walked the rest of the way, long enough to sustain the hideous blisters his sister recalls seeing on his feet. He was eccentric and temperamental, though one would be hard-pressed to find a great artist who isn\u2019t. Mostly, Bogawa saw someone repeatedly and uncharitably misunderstood. \u201cOne of the myths that was repeated, which we wanted to debunk, was from a neighbor who said they were taking out the trash and could hear Syd in his garage banging his head against the wall and screaming,\u201d Bogawa says. \u201cHe said \u2018howling like a dog,\u2019 I believe. This was taken as a sign that he was living by himself and going crazy. You see images of the stuff he had in his house, and you realize he was just doing construction projects!\u201d \u201cPeople think of him as being this hermit, but they have stories of seeing him ride his bike to the shops, going to the art store, riding to the local pub. He functioned on his own, living with his mother at first and then by himself after she passed away. His sister would come by to check on him and take care of him, but he did function. Some reporters tried to door-stop him over the years, so you get these photos where he looks freaked out, but that\u2019s because he suddenly had people on his doorstep yelling, \u2018Hey! You\u2019re Syd Barrett!\u2019 The photographs that exist, that made people think he\u2019d gone crazy, some of them just look like he\u2019s tired or a little stoned or just caught off guard. We\u2019ve all seen bad pictures of ourselves. If you see the full range of photos shot during his later sessions, in some of them, he looks great!\u201d While Bogawa does his part to course-correct posterity, he\u2019s nonetheless secure in the staying power of the first band he ever saw in concert. (\u201cAnimals Tour, which dates me,\u201d he chuckles.) He teaches film production at New Jersey City University, where he regularly sees undergrads in Pink Floyd T-shirts, and he was heartened to hear that his teenage son\u2019s classmates still go through the formative adolescent ritual of imbibing Dark Side of the Moon through a pair of high-end headphones. The sensitivity, perfectionism, and depth of feeling that made Barrett a singular talent also left him ill-equipped for the demands of his career, but he\u2019s not an also-ran footnote of history. He\u2019s survived by a generation-to-generation legion of admirers who recognize and respect his multi-dimensionality, a grounded form of worship exemplified by Bogawa\u2019s lifelong passion. \u201cAnimals was the first Floyd record I owned,\u201d Bogawa fondly recalls. \u201cAnd collecting records made me think for the first time about how I wanted to dress, how to wear my hair, what kind of kid I wanted to be. I grew up in LA during the late 70s, just as punk hit big, and I took a big right turn. I\u2019d go to clubs in Hollywood with an English friend, and I was like, \u2018Whoa! This is my misfit tribe!\u2019 Music was self-discovery for me, it helped me build an identity. I took photos at shows, played in a bunch of different bands, and the group I played in during college, our bassist loved Piper at the Gates of Dawn. Total Syd Barrett fanatic. We tried to learn his songs, and we never could figure them out.\u201d Have You Got It Yet? is out in New York cinemas and will open in LA on 21 July with a UK date to be announced"}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b223ba", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/19/liverpool-jordan-henderson-al-ettifaq-12m-saudi-arabia", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Liverpool agree to sell Jordan Henderson to Al-Ettifaq for initial \u00a312m", "lead": "Jordan Henderson is poised to join Steven Gerrard at Al-Ettifaq after Liverpool agreed a fee in principle of \u00a312m plus add-ons for their captain with the Saudi Pro League club", "author": "Andy Hunter", "datePublished": "2023-07-19 17:28:22", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.233277", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/6db1b58f6cef25c70908fee36b71d8a88dd81c6d/0_245_6729_4039/500.jpg", "body": "Jordan Henderson is poised to join Steven Gerrard at Al-Ettifaq after Liverpool agreed a fee in principle of \u00a312m plus add-ons for their captain with the Saudi Pro League club. Henderson was omitted from Liverpool\u2019s first friendly of pre-season on Wednesday, against Karlsruher SC in Germany, after a breakthrough in negotiations. The 33\u2011year\u2011old midfielder agreed a contract with Al\u2011Ettifaq last week and could undergo a medical within days. He will sign a two\u2011year contract with the option of a third on wages that will dwarf his current \u00a3200,000 a week at Liverpool. Liverpool and Al-Ettifaq, managed by the Anfield legend Gerrard, reached a compromise over the structure of the fee for a player who has two years on his contract. Henderson was initially reluctant to relocate with his family to Saudi Arabia but Al-Ettifaq\u2019s offer prompted a rethink. He also held talks over his first-team prospects with J\u00fcrgen Klopp before deciding in principle to end his 12-year stay on Merseyside. Liverpool have signed Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai for \u00a335m and \u00a360m respectively and Klopp was in the market for another midfielder even before Saudi Arabian interest in Henderson and Fabinho disrupted his pre-season plans. Liverpool remain in talks with Al-Ittihad over Fabinho\u2019s exit. Al-Ittihad, unlike Al-Ettifaq, are one of the four Saudi Arabian clubs owned by the country\u2019s Public Investment Fund. The Brazil international is expected to leave for about \u00a340m. Two other Liverpool players, Luis D\u00edaz and Thiago Alc\u00e2ntara, are attracting interest from the Saudi Pro League but the club is expected to resist any advances for the Colombia international. Klopp said about both deals: \u201cAs long as things are not really finally decided, we don\u2019t have to talk about it. There will be a moment where we probably have to talk about it, but it\u2019s not now. I don\u2019t know that anything is decided, which means nothing to say in the moment. In the end, all of these decisions are made by me. And because I respect the players a lot, it\u2019s usually with consent. It was in this case and it is all fine.\u201d The prospect of Henderson moving to a country where homosexuality is illegal has been condemned by Liverpool\u2019s official LGBT+ fans group, Kop Outs. Henderson has been a staunch supporter of the LGBTQ+ community as Liverpool captain \u2013 being nominated as \u201cFootball Ally\u201d at the LGBT+ Awards in 2021 \u2013 and has written in his programme notes about standing \u201cshoulder-to-shoulder\u201d with anyone who feels excluded."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b223bb", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jul/19/happy-holidays-but-the-tories-know-they-could-soon-be-on-permanent-vacation", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Happy holidays, but the Tories know they could soon be on permanent vacation | John Crace", "lead": "Today started well.

But just for today \u2013 make that just for half an hour \u2013 the Conservatives were prepared to put their existential futility on hold and try to live in the moment. To count their blessings while they still had them. Many Tory women seemed to have come as Barbie tribute acts. Certainly there was a greater profusion of pink on show than usual. If there were plenty of Barbie lookalikes, there was only one Ken. Step forward Michael Fabricant. The man with the cascading plastic hair. More Ken than Ken himself. The only reason Ryan Gosling got the part in the new movie was because Mickey Fab declared himself unavailable. Mickey is an icon for Barbie fans everywhere. He\u2019s got all the accessories. The Ken car. The Ken phone. Hell, he even talks like Ken. If you press the right button on his back. There was even a warmish welcome for Rishi Sunak, who looked a bit lost as he turned up for his first prime minister\u2019s questions in three weeks. Perhaps he was disoriented and couldn\u2019t remember where he was supposed to sit. That funny bit of green opposite the dispatch box? That\u2019s all yours, Rish!. But the Tories cheered his arrival regardless. Not because they were overwhelmed with excitement that inflation had fallen by 0.2 percentage points more than expected. No one expects Sunak to get any thanks even if he does manage to cut inflation in half by the end of the year. The UK\u2019s inflation is still far higher than that of the US and the eurozone and, besides, telling people to be grateful that things will become even more unaffordable a little more slowly is a tough sell. No, the reason for the whoops at Sunak\u2019s arrival was rather more mundane. It was just that he wasn\u2019t the hapless Oliver Dowden. At least with Rish!, if you are patient enough and wait, you can occasionally find flickers of life on an EEG. With Olive it\u2019s just a non-stop flatline. His synapses refusing to flicker. In Rish! there are primitive signs of sentient life. Something at least for his MPs to cling on to. Needs must. Keir Starmer, meanwhile, is on a roll. Fresh from his anointing at the feet of Tony Blair the day before \u2013 Labour Past and Labour Present meeting in Labour Future \u2013 he feels untouchable. At least by Sunak. At PMQs he believes himself to be in complete control. Ready to go toe to toe with his opponent on any area. The economy, the NHS, climate change. You name it, Keir reckons he\u2019s the boss. What\u2019s more, Sunak also knows it. He\u2019s read the opinion polls. Turns out the more people get to know the prime minister, the less they like or trust him. He knows this isn\u2019t going to end well. All he can do is manage the decline of the dog days of a Tory government. Which is not to say he likes it. He\u2019s been brought up to believe he\u2019s a master of the universe, and to be reminded of his weakness is a constant irritation. More than that, an acute pain. He can\u2019t quite accept that this is happening to him. That a man he rates as his inferior always has the better of the exchanges. The Labour leader kept it simple. Kept it classy. Rish! had promised to bring down hospital waiting lists. How was that going? Sunak mumbled. They were actually going up. But it was all the fault of the doctors on strike. Oh really, I could have sworn it might also have something to do with chronic underfunding of the NHS for the last 13 years. But what do I know? But even if it had been all to do with the strikes, you wonder why Sunak didn\u2019t accept the recommendations of the rigged independent pay review boards earlier. Or why he now refuses to talk to the doctors. It\u2019s almost as if it quite suits Sunak to have an excuse. \u201cYeah but no but yeah but what would you do about the doctors?\u201d said Sunak, sounding much like a 12-year-old. Starmer shrugged. Rish! had yet again failed to remember it was PMQs and that he was the PM. Not for long. Even the speaker joined in, observing that as Sunak liked to get away early from the Commons, it would help if he set about answering some questions. Rish! visibly sulked. Starmer went in for the kill. Labelling the government\u2019s NHS workforce plan unfunded. Which it is. And pointing out that most of the 40 new hospitals wouldn\u2019t be either new or a hospital. Sunak was left clutching at air. He hadn\u2019t even got round to checking Keir\u2019s age. Calling him 61 not 60. Small, maybe. But these things count. The SNP\u2019s Stephen Flynn went in hard on there being no difference between Labour and the Tories on the two-child benefit cap. Starmer looked delighted. Just what he wanted. No one was going to get to accuse Labour of unfunded promises. There would be no repeat of 1992 when John Major sneaked home. Some Labour supporters might not like it but Keir had his eye on a bigger prize. The rest of the session slipped by in something of a daze. Jacob Rees-Mogg and David Davis howled in outrage at Coutts closing Nigel Farage\u2019s bank account on the grounds he was perceived as a racist and a grifter. Quite right. Who knew that Coutts had any principles at all? Other than a person\u2019s right to be eye-wateringly rich. Mark Francois was furious about Tobias Ellwood\u2019s video for package holidays with the Taliban. Probably the first time the entire Commons had been in agreement with Francois. Ellwood was nowhere to be seen. Probably dozing in a poppy field in Helmand. Come the end, Sunak raced for the door. Things to do, foreign investors to sweet talk. Byelections to lose and a mayoral candidate to disown. The brand new idiot\u2019s idiot. Sadiq Khan can chill now he will face Susan Hall. Ministers to reshuffle. To be replaced by who, exactly? It was all going fabulously well.

But still, we are talking about 52C.\u201d Italy\u2019s health minister, Orazio Schillaci, said an information line would be activated amid concerns about deaths from heat-related illnesses. A man in his 60s is believed to have died of a heat-related illness after fainting in his bakery near the northern city of Padua, and a 44-year-old road worker died in Milan last week. \u201cYou can protect yourself against the heat in a major way by drinking lots of water, opting for a diet based on vegetables and fresh fruit and avoiding excessive consumption of fatty foods and alcohol,\u201d Schillaci said. \u201cSpecial attention should be paid to the most fragile, elderly and children.\u201d The carmaker Stellantis said it was monitoring the situation at its Pomigliano d\u2019Arco plant near Naples after workers were sent home early on Tuesday because it was too hot to work. Workers at the battery maker Magneti Marelli threatened an eight-hour strike at a plant in Sulmona, in the central Abruzzo region. A statement from unions said the \u201casphyxiating heat is putting the lives of workers at risk\u201d. The CGIL union said temperatures in factories in the southern region of Basilicata were nearing 40C. \u201cThe arrival of the heat is a serious problem for workers because it puts their health and safety at risk,\u201d it said. \u201cAfter the Stellantis case we are getting many signals from several factories across the region. For this reason we ask workers to turn to their unions if health and safety guarantees are not being met.\u201d Unions have also expressed concern for agricultural workers, most of whom are seasonal workers from outside the EU, and construction workers. Farm workers in Marsica, Abruzzo, are working 4am-11am shifts as a way of avoiding the hottest hours. In Greece, staff at the Acropolis and other ancient sites will stop work for four hours a day from Thursday in protest at working conditions. Access to the Unesco-listed Acropolis had been restricted for three days from last Friday but the measures were lifted on Monday as the thermometer dropped before a new heatwave was predicted from Thursday. \u201cGiven the problems we have faced \u2026 in recent days, measures have been unanimously decided to protect the health of the security staff \u2026 as well as visitors,\u201d the PEYFA union said.

The crown estate, an ancient portfolio of land and property across England and Wales, paid Dan Labbad almost \u00a31.6m last year, up by two-thirds from the year before, when he took home a pay packet of \u00a3945,000. The chief executive\u2019s latest payday was three times his equivalent full-year pay of \u00a3517,000 for 2019 when he stepped into the role, and almost \u00a31m more than what his predecessor, Alison Nimmo, was paid in her final year at the helm. The rise puts Labbad\u2019s salary well above the remuneration typically awarded to those who manage taxpayer funds, and in line with his pay in his previous role as chief executive of Lendlease, a multinational for-profit construction and real estate company. Labbad has presided over a major increase in revenues, as the crown\u2019s ownership of the seabed around the British isles has turned into a big money spinner. In a series of auctions, the crown estate has raised billions from electricity operators wanting to lease sections of the ocean floor for offshore windfarms. The property manager revealed last month that the auctions had helped generate record profits of almost half a billion pounds, while the value of its portfolio had doubled to nearly \u00a316bn over the past decade. The crown estate has pledged to use the income from its vast portfolio \u2013 which includes more than 200 sites in central London, as well as historic parks and coastlines \u2013 for \u201cthe benefit of the nation, its finances, and its future\u201d. Molly Scott Cato, the finance and economy spokesperson for the England and Wales Green Party, said the pay hike was \u201ca disgrace\u201d and called for \u201cwide-scale reform\u201d of the crown estate to make sure its income benefits the country. \u201cManaging the crown estate is a public service and one would expect to see the CEO\u2019s pay reflect that. At a time when so many are struggling with the cost of living crisis it is a disgrace that his salary has risen by nearly two-thirds this year alone and that he is now paid three times what his predecessor was paid for the same job.\u201d \u201cA wide-scale reform of the crown estate is long overdue to ensure that our national resources are managed with a focus on long-term sustainability and that such egregious remuneration at the public\u2019s expense is ended once and for all,\u201d she added. The portfolio belongs to the reigning monarch \u201cin right of the crown\u201d, but it is not the king\u2019s private property. Under current rules, the crown estate hands its profits to the Treasury before 25% is returned to the royal household in the form of the sovereign grant. The crown estate\u2019s recent accounts said it had hired advisers to review its approach to remuneration after the \u201csignificant transformation\u201d of the business in recent years due to the boom in offshore wind on its seabeds. It said the review had concluded that its pay policy was \u201cneither realistic nor appropriate\u201d given the scale and commercial context in which it now operates. But it added that it had a responsibility to recruit \u201ca world-class leader\u201d who would recognise that \u201csome form of remuneration discount\u201d was \u201cappropriate to leading an organisation that serves the nation\u201d. A spokesperson for the crown estate said it had undergone a \u201csignificant transformation\u201d, growing in scale and complexity, and that it competed with the private sector. \u201cWe went through a rigorous process, including working with independent advisers, to develop a new remuneration package with a significant discount to relevant benchmarks, as set out in our annual report. This will ensure we can attract and retain a world-class chief executive to help realise our legal obligations to deliver value to the nation, its finances and its future.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b223be", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jul/19/daniel-morgan-met-admits-failings-and-pays-damages-in-settlement-with-family", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Daniel Morgan murder: Met admits failings and pays damages in settlement with family", "lead": "Force had faced being sued over 1987 axe killing, with corruption and errors blamed for failure to convict perpetrators", "author": "Vikram Dodd Police and crime correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-07-19 17:11:32", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.233475", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/c30be94329b3feba75324a005544ae94633c0f00/0_0_2000_1200/500.jpg", "body": "The Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir Mark Rowley, has admitted the force prioritised its reputation in its handling of the Daniel Morgan murder case over 36 years, as a cycle of corruption, incompetence and defensiveness blighted the search for justice. The admissions by Britain\u2019s top police officer came as a settlement was announced on Wednesday, which both sides hope will end the Morgan family\u2019s gruelling struggle after the 1987 unsolved murder of the private detective. Rowley admitted liability for the Met\u2019s errors and corruption, and will pay damages, declaring the family were fobbed off with \u201cempty promises\u201d as well as accepting \u201cmultiple and systemic failings\u201d. Morgan was found dead in March 1987 in a south London pub car park with an axe through his head. His family believe he was about to expose police corruption when he was silenced. Rowley met the family last week and in his statement accepted their suffering had been made worse by having to fight the Met for justice. The commissioner vowed to root out corruption blighting the force he had inherited. The Met has previously admitted that police corruption helped shield Morgan\u2019s killers, and no one has been convicted of the murder. The Morgan family accepted a financial settlement made by the Met after the force faced being sued and potentially embarrassing court hearings. The family would have been armed with the findings of an official inquiry ordered by Theresa May when she was home secretary, which reported in June 2021. It found that Rowley\u2019s predecessor, Cressida Dick, had obstructed the panel appointed by the government to investigate claims that corruption blighted the hunt for Morgan\u2019s killers and that the Met had failed to root it out. It also found the Met was institutionally corrupt, having placed protecting its reputation above uncovering embarrassing wrongdoing. The Met had rejected the key findings. On Wednesday, Rowley struck a different tone, saying: \u201cThis case has been marred by a cycle of corruption, professional incompetence, and defensiveness that has repeated itself over and over again. Daniel Morgan\u2019s family were given empty promises and false hope as successive investigations failed and the Metropolitan police prioritised its reputation at the expense of transparency and effectiveness.\u201d Morgan and his business partner at the time of his death, Jonathan Rees, ran an investigation agency called Southern Investigations. Rees later carried out extensive work for the News of the World, owned by Rupert Murdoch, which was shut down due to the phone-hacking scandal. The Morgan family\u2019s civil claim issued in December 2021 alleged misfeasance in public office as well as breaches of the Human Rights Act. The claim dated back to alleged wrongdoing immediately after the 1987 killing, when one of the suspects was a detective who worked for a short period on the murder investigation, with police failings continuing through to recent years. The Met announced in 2007 that the motive for the murder was probably that Morgan \u201cwas about to expose a south London drugs network possibly involving corrupt police officers\u201d. It is understood the Met paid \u00a32.25m in costs and damages to settle the case, though the family and force have said the amount remains confidential. Last Thursday, Rowley met the Morgan family at a mediation session in central London, which led to the agreement. Rowley said: \u201cI unequivocally and unreservedly apologise for the failure of the Metropolitan police service to bring those responsible for the murder of Daniel Morgan to justice. From the earliest stages, his family have been repeatedly and inexcusably let down by the Metropolitan police. \u201cNo words can do justice to the pain and suffering that has been a feature of the family\u2019s lives for more than three decades as they have fought for justice, a fight which no family should have to endure. Their tenacious campaigning has exposed multiple and systemic failings in this organisation. \u201cI have met with the family and listened to vivid and moving accounts of the devastating impact those failings have had on their lives. They have explained how their trust in policing has been eroded. The personal commitment I made to tackling corruption in this organisation when I took over as commissioner has never been stronger.\u201d Despite all the errors, corruption and the Met placing its reputation over the search for justice, as found by the 2021 inquiry, no officers faced action or any formal sanction. The Morgan family join a list of grieving British families turned campaigners \u2013 from the family of Stephen Lawrence, to those caught up in the Hillsborough disaster \u2013 who fought the police and authorities for decades to get answers and a measure of justice. In a statement issued through their lawyers, the Morgan family said: \u201cThe family of Daniel Morgan, deceased, proposed to bring civil claims arising out of his murder on 10 March 1987 and the ensuing investigations into that murder against the Metropolitan police commissioner. As a result of a formal mediation process in July 2023, the parties were able to agree a mutually satisfactory settlement of the proposed claims, including an admission of liability on behalf of the commissioner in respect of the conduct of his officers in response to the murder.\u201d In a Guardian interview in 2017, Morgan\u2019s brother, Alastair \u2013 who spearheaded his family\u2019s fight against the state for justice \u2013 said: \u201cI\u2019ve been in the wilderness. It has been horribly frustrating and painful for decades.\u201d He said he felt it was not only the Met that had failed his family, but other organs of the state that were supposed to hold it to account. He told the Guardian: \u201cI had a duty to my brother, to my family and to society not to give up. What has emerged has vindicated me. It is worryingly corrupt, in ways that are subtle, but very powerful.\u201d Two sticky plaster strips were wrapped around the axe handle used to murder Morgan in an attempt to prevent fingerprint evidence being left behind. The last investigation into the murder ended in 2011, with the case against the accused collapsing in court before a jury could hear any evidence. That led to the then acting commissioner, Tim Godwin, admitting that police corruption in the first investigation had been a significant factor in the failure to bring to justice those responsible for the murder. Godwin also said Morgan\u2019s family were entitled to an apology for the repeated failure of the police to acknowledge this corruption. It would take much longer \u2013 more than another decade \u2013 for the Met to finally reach a deal with Morgan\u2019s family. The Met said it still hoped to catch Morgan\u2019s killers and a \u00a350,000 reward announced in 2021 for information leading to a conviction remains on offer. The force said a forensic review continues. \u201cWe have not given up on this case. There still remains a possibility of solving this murder. Our work to make that happen will not stop no matter how much time passes. \u201cWe also know there are people who hold vital information who have been unable for whatever reason to pass that to us.\u201d Anyone with information should contact CrimeStoppers anonymously on 0800 555 11."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b223bf", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/19/womens-world-cup-2023-fans-around-the-world-preview-the-tournament", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Women\u2019s World Cup 2023: fans around the globe preview the tournament", "lead": "How will your team perform at this summer\u2019s World Cup?

I\u2019d be thrilled to see them reach the last 16. It\u2019s so exciting to see the ripple effect this tournament is already having on women and girls participating in football more widely \u2013 both in Australia and New Zealand. The media coverage of women\u2019s football has also improved massively. The focus is now mostly on the players\u2019 on-field achievements rather than their personal lives or what they wear. The potential for this tournament is huge. Danene Norway Having had to go through a bit of a rebuild after the disastrous performances at Euro 2022, I expect them to survive the group stage \u2013 but not go much further than that. Sander Philippines For us, just being at the tournament is something of a miracle given the state of the game in our country. If we score a goal or two, kept a clean sheet, or managed to get at least one point, that would be another miracle. If we win one match, that would be an even greater one. Our key player is defender Angela Beard. She has previously played in Denmark before transferring to Australian team Western United where she has become a vital player for them at the back. She\u2019ll be even more vital for the Philippines. Chino Switzerland We haven\u2019t been in the greatest form under coach, Inka Grings, and are still finding our feet in this era. The opening match against the Philippines will be an indication of where we are, and we\u2019ll relish the chance to play against co-hosts New Zealand. Reaching the knockout stage is the expectation, making it to the quarter-finals would be a dream. Euro 2022 was underwhelming. We absolutely could have reached the knockout stages and competed with Sweden and Netherlands in our group, but a lack of concentration and clinical finishing was our downfall. This summer is a chance to set the record straight. Lia W\u00e4lti is the captain of the team and her return from injury is crucial. We are a totally different team without her. The experienced heads of Ramona Bachmann and Ana-Maria Crnogorcevic will nicely complement rising star Alisha Lehmann in attack, though cohesion will be key if we want to get on the scoresheet. Watch out for Coumba Sow in midfield, looking to build on her impressive Euros campaign last summer, and Ga\u00eblle \u201cGaga\u201d Thalmann, this being the veteran goalkeeper\u2019s last dance before she hangs up her gloves after the World Cup. Nischal Australia The head says semi-finals is probably the expected result but the heart says we go all the way with the nation behind us. The ticket sales and advertising already make it seem like we have what could be a landmark event in store for the world, one that moves the needle for the women\u2019s game even further. This will surely be striker Sam Kerr\u2019s tournament \u2013 Australia\u2019s GOAT. Cream rises to the top and I\u2019m not the only one who expects her to be the Golden Boot winner. James Canada It depends on whoever we meet after getting through the group stage. If we draw the right opposition in the last 16, I\u2019m expecting an improvement on our 2019 World Cup performance when Sweden proved too strong in the second round. We are the reigning Olympic champions though, so who knows? Callum Nigeria We reached the last 16 at the 2019 tournament despite comfortably losing to Norway and France. I really expect them to perform better this time around and go further. Keep an eye out for Asisat Oshoala. The Barcelona forward will be key for Nigeria up front. Olalekan Japan Japan should be one of the favourites to advance from Group C. I expect us to beat both Costa Rica and Zambia, so Spain will be our strongest rivals. But the Spanish team are still recovering from a conflict between their coach and the players, which has been going on since last September, so they might still not be at their best. The Japanese team could defeat them if we take our chances \u2013 the solidarity within our squad will be as strong as ever. I am looking forward to seeing attacking midfielder Yui Hasegawa. Currently at Manchester City, she is a highly experienced player. She\u2019s the closest we have to a playmaker with her quick movement and accurate passing. She\u2019ll be joined by West Ham\u2019s Risa Shimizu, another very exciting player. Eiko Spain I think Spain will put on a great show. Women\u2019s football in Spain is getting stronger and stronger. The continuing growth of Liga F is bringing more quality to our game and that will be very apparent in this competition. I want Alexia Putellas to have a great tournament after all the injury struggles she has been through. She\u2019s our best player. But also, since I am a Real Madrid fan, I can\u2019t wait to see the exciting young forward Athenea del Castillo on the big stage. Miriam Denmark My expectations for the Danish team is to get out of the group. Denmark are in a transitional phase and might not invest as heavily in women\u2019s football as other countries, so I am a bit anxious to see how we fit in at this World Cup. But qualifying second in the group would be expected, if all goes well. The players I\u2019m most excited to see are Pernille Harder, Josefine Hasbo, Nicoline S\u00f8rensen and Janni Thomsen. Amalie England Brutally my expectations are low(ish). Despite the success of last summer, and it was a true and golden success, we are without two of our key players who made such a huge impact last year \u2013 Leah Williamson and Beth Mead. Missing our top goalscorer and captain is probably going to alter England\u2019s final outcome. When it comes down to it, you need luck to win a tournament (and we certainly had some extremely lucky moments last year) as well as talent and, this year, it feels like the cards are stacked against us. I\u2019d consider reaching the semi-finals a success. But in reality I think we might go out in the quarter-finals \u2013 probably against Australia. Christie Netherlands Modestly, I think we\u2019ll reach the last 16. The Dutch women were on an upwards trajectory under Sarina Wiegman, but the uninspired appointment of her successor, Mark Parsons, was a big mistake. After a disappointingly inconsistent Euro 2022 showing, Parsons has since been replaced with the more likeable and experienced Andries Jonker, who worked alongside Louis van Gaal for years. But we have a long way to go to the days when only the USA could beat us (Euro 2017, World Cup 2019, Tokyo Olympics). Losing Vivianne Miedema through an ACL injury hasn\u2019t helped. USA are favourites to win our group and Portugal are a potential banana skin. But finishing second in the group is doable and it would mean possibly facing an under-par Sweden in the first knockout round. Win that and the draw could open up nicely for us. Eric USA My expectation is to make at least the semi-final. But another World Cup win is the ultimate goal. In the past people have said the two best team\u2019s in the world are the USA\u2019s first team and the USA\u2019s second team. I don\u2019t think that is true anymore, but that adage will definitely be tested with the squad being beset by so many injuries, both short and long-term; Becky Sauerbrunn, Catarina Macario, Mal Swanson, Sam Mewis and Christen Press are all missing. Despite the injuries, we can field an extremely strong squad with plenty of young talent like Sophia Smith. I think that makes us third favourites behind Germany and England. A special mention should go to midfielder Julie Ertz. Returning from an injury and the birth of her son, she is a destroyer in the best sense of the term. A suitable replacement was never found, so her surprising return was a godsend. Chris Vietnam I hope we\u2019ll score at least a goal against the USA or the Netherlands and manage a draw against Portugal. That would be enough for me because I know we have no chance of advancing to the knockout stage. If we were to score a goal, it would be a surprise not to see Huynh Nhu on the scoresheet. She has won five Vietnamese Golden Balls and is our star player. Binh France I\u2019m hoping that with our new coach, Herv\u00e9 Renard, we can go further than in 2019, when the US proved too strong for us in the quarter-finals. The last eight has been our limit in the past, but hopefully this time we can go further. I\u2019m worried about injuries affecting some of our most important players. I hope Renard can build a strong team and find some team spirit that has been severely lacking in the past. There needs to be a game plan for next year, when we\u2019ll be playing in the Olympics as hosts. Sophia Argentina The earthly expectation of this Argentina team is to win their first game in World Cup history. After that we can hope that this win will be enough to advance into the knockout stages. Andres Colombia I\u2019m optimistic. Nelson Abad\u00eda, who has been the Colombian women\u2019s coach since 2017, has put together a very strong group over the last six years. Progress has been steady and participation in tournaments should now become a regular thing. Despite being in a strong group with Germany as the favourites, I think Colombia will qualify to the second round \u2013 as group winners! Real Madrid forward Linda Caicedo\u2019s performances will be vital. Our defence is usually strong, giving us a platform to push on and get the results we need.

If the former US defence secretary\u2019s identification of \u201cknown knowns\u201d relates for the manager to his current squad, more critical is grappling with the \u201cknown unknowns\u201d of who could still be signed and how the \u201cunknown unknowns\u201d caused by United\u2019s stalled sale could affect his 2023-24 project. For the future of the club to remain uncertain because of the Glazers\u2019 procrastination is the direst possible scenario for Ten Hag. If continuity is the base requirement managers crave for team-building, then instability is the great fear, making United\u2019s state of limbo eight months into a process billed as being resolved by the end of March (the end of fiscal quarter one) a migraine-like headache he hardly deserves. As Ten Hag plots for next season in New Jersey, San Diego, Houston and Las Vegas \u2013 a blur of four matches in 11 days across three time zones against Arsenal, Wrexham, Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund \u2013 he has no clue whether his paymasters will change and how this could affect his attempt to engineer success. Yet the Dutchman has to somehow prevent this from having a pervasive effect. It may already be doing so. Ten Hag is operating in an environment where staff wonder whether they will have a job at the end of the American family\u2019s tomorrow-never-comes vending process, and who have been told zero throughout. It does not make for a positive, vibrant workplace. On the trip around the US there will be approximately 200 employees whose roles could be in jeopardy \u2013 from the football director, John Murtough (if he makes the trip), to Ten Hag\u2019s media team, those in charge of day-to-day logistics, the catering staff and the manager himself. Because although Ten Hag is not an obvious candidate for removal \u2013 the Dutchman has been a roaring success \u2013 football can be a wild west as Thomas Tuchel will testify after his sacking by the new Chelsea ownership four months into its proprietorship, and 18 after winning the club the Champions League. Depending on your take Ten Hag either overachieved or did what was required last season in breaking a six-year trophy drought (claiming the Carabao Cup), losing another final (FA Cup) and taking United back into the Champions League via a third-place finish. The view here is that he overachieved and that should Ten Hag replicate the silverware and top-four finish next season this, again, is success. For though United \u201cshould\u201d be competing for the title and to add a third Champions League to the honours board, each requires a miracle of management. Ten Hag is good, sure \u2013 but this good? Here we arrive at the quaint case of the abandoned chase for his summer transfer priority, Harry Kane, and the \u00a360m spend on Mason Mount. Quaint because the Tottenham and England captain is the goal-plunderer supreme whose addition, Ten Hag informed Murtough, would offer the best hope of the step change required to challenge Manchester City\u2019s domination. The logic of not wanting a months-long pursuit of Kane that was always fruitless owing to the unwillingness of the Spurs chairman, Daniel Levy, to sell and would replicate the failed quest last year to sign Barcelona\u2019s Frenkie de Jong is understandable. But might this have been identified and abandoned far earlier to save time, and Ten Hag\u2019s frustration? The buying of Mount compounds all of this because an attacking midfielder/wide operator is not a priority when the manager has Bruno Fernandes, Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Christian Eriken and Jadon Sancho. Next on the list after Kane is Rasmus H\u00f8jlund, Atalanta\u2019s 20-year-old centre-forward who has a single season of Serie A experience, scoring nine goals in 32 appearances, and six goals in six Denmark appearances. Unlike Kane, he is young and unproven in the Premier League, yet Atalanta are demanding about \u00a385m \u2013 an eye-watering sum to gamble on what is the definite known unknown of how H\u00f8jlund would fare. Ten Hag\u2019s bombing out of David de Gea and agreeing a deal to sign Internazionale\u2019s Andr\u00e9 Onana as the new first-choice goalkeeper for about \u00a347m complicate any move for H\u00f8jlund. It means the sale of fringe squad members such as Harry Maguire, Anthony Elanga, Fred, Scott McTominay (possibly), Donny van de Beek, and Alex Telles is required. Paris Saint-Germain entering the race for H\u00f8jlund is one more obstacle. This is a tangle Ten Hag has to unravel and is reminiscent of every close season for every post-Sir Alex Ferguson manager. It has become a deja vu experience that is as tired as the Glazers\u2019 past decade of ownership: a quasi-absent tenure which sets Champions League qualification as the bar for success. For optimism Ten Hag can look inwards, at the current group, as he prepares to send out a first stateside XI, against Arsenal on 22 July at New Jersey\u2019s MetLife Stadium. Garnacho, just 19 and after last season\u2019s breakthrough campaign, could, in the upcoming season, be a consistently turbo-paced defence-breaker from out wide; another X-factor footballer alongside Fernandes, Casemiro, Lisandro Mart\u00ednez and Rashford. Onana, too, has the character and bravery to transform Ten Hag\u2019s wish to create attacks from the back \u2013 this is the hope, anyway. And, in Kobbie Mainoo, Ten Hag has an 18-year-old Stockport-born midfielder whose style is in the Casemiro mould and who may be next season\u2019s Garnacho: a \u201cbonus\u201d factor in his matchday plans. Another unknown, though, is the future of Mason Greenwood. If he stays this would, presumably, solve Ten Hag\u2019s No 9 issue, but the 21-year-old\u2019s situation is complex after he was arrested in January 2022 and charged the following October with attempted rape, controlling and coercive behaviour and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. He denied the charges, which were dropped in February, when the club launched an investigation into his conduct. After Arsenal, United face Wrexham on 25 July at San Diego\u2019s Snapdragon Stadium with a junior side, before the next day a senior team take on Real in Houston at NRG Stadium. Ten Hag will hope that before United fly home from Las Vegas after the final game, against Dortmund on 31 July at Allegiant Stadium, he will have secured an alpha striker and that, just maybe, there will finally be clarity over who owns the club. At this juncture, though, he has no way of knowing whether he will know and what else he does not yet know he does not know.

After six weeks of hearings at the UK Covid-19 public inquiry, the evidence about the UK\u2019s preparedness for the Covid pandemic is in. The nation was caught badly off guard. That much was probably obvious. By 1 March 2021 the UK had suffered more than 180 Covid deaths per 100,000 people; in South Korea, the number was just three. But after hearing the evidence, the bereaved families put it bluntly: we were \u201ccatastrophically unprepared\u201d. The inquiry chair, Lady Hallett, wanted to know why. After all, the pandemic \u201cchanged lives on a scale unseen in modern history\u201d, said her lead counsel, Hugo Keith KC. There was ample evidence the UK had been made more vulnerable by the twin storms of austerity and Brexit. George Osborne strongly denied the former (\u201cMost certainly not. I completely reject that\u201d) while the pro-Brexit Michael Gove claimed Whitehall\u2019s pre-Covid focus on a no-deal EU exit that meant pandemic planning was halted had actually made the country \u201cmatch-fit\u201d for the pandemic. There was a strong whiff of old battles still raging and the defence of legacies. Did the sheer churn of government, with its revolving cast of ministers and mandarins, leave responsibility for resilience far too scattered? Judging by the organogram of the UK\u2019s pandemic preparedness and response structures that was repeatedly flashed on the inquiry room screens, yes. It was so bewildering it became known as the \u201cbowl of spaghetti\u201d chart. But first came a more fundamental question: had we planned for the \u201cwrong pandemic\u201d? \u2018A flawed doctrine\u2019 The UK had a plan for pandemic flu because it topped the national risk register. The fear was it would sweep through the country killing 800,000 people. It wasn\u2019t transferable largely because flu carriers tend to be symptomatic and so know when to isolate. With Covid-19 and Sars (which had struck east Asia in 2002-4) asymptomatic transmission makes mass testing vital to stopping it. Such emerging threats were further down the list, and the national plan, set out in 2011, was specifically for pandemic influenza. The thinking was that flu wouldn\u2019t be stopped in its tracks. Morgue capacity and economic resilience, rather than Test and trace, were on the agenda. There was no planning for lockdowns or quarantine. This was a \u201cflawed doctrine\u201d, said Matt Hancock, health secretary from July 2018 to June 2021. \u201cInstead of a strategy for preventing a pandemic having a disastrous effect, it is a strategy for dealing with the disastrous effect of a pandemic.\u201d So why didn\u2019t he do anything to change it? When Hancock became health secretary he was informed of stockpiles of anti-viral drugs for flu but not a non-influenza pandemic. Couldn\u2019t he have pressed civil servants to order them? \u201cThis was an unprecedented pandemic \u2026 nobody was to know,\u201d he said. Obesity was the number one issue, he was told. And anyway, he was assured, UK pandemic preparedness was \u201cone of the best in the world\u201d. The national risk assessment had identified in 2019 a \u201cmoderate\u201d risk of a \u201ccatastrophic\u201d but containable outbreak of an emerging respiratory coronavirus infection in the UK, but thought it would only kill 2,000 people. They were \u201chopelessly wrong\u201d, said Pete Weatherby KC, representing families of many of the UK\u2019s 228,492 Covid victims. This was not to say flu wasn\u2019t a real danger, stressed Prof Dame Sally Davies, chief medical officer from 2010 to 2019. \u201cThe question is what else we do over and above that,\u201d she said. \u201cClearly we could have done more thinking\u201d. Several witnesses called for a generic plan for a viral pandemic that could be flexed depending on the threat at hand. But \u201cgroupthink\u201d gripped the political and health establishment. The mantra was: \u201cready for flu, ready for anything\u201d, said Sir Chris Wormald, permanent secretary at the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC). Oliver Letwin, the minister in charge of national resilience from 2011 to 2016, didn\u2019t look into the state of pandemic flu planning because he was assured we were \u201cas well prepared to deal with a pandemic flu as any country\u201d. The World Health Organization had also rated the UK\u2019s pandemic plans highly. But this was \u201csimply wrong\u201d, the inquiry heard. So there was little if any consideration given to the measures such as shielding, employment support, managing disruption to schools, borders and lockdowns. This was partly because a viral pandemic was framed as a medical, epidemiological problem. Therefore plans lacked focus on \u201cthe socioeconomic implications, even though these were well known\u201d, said David Alexander, professor of risk and disaster reduction at University College London. This brought up the question of how lockdowns were planned for. \u201cThere was a complete lack of imagination about what the public would put up with to keep them safe,\u201d said Hancock. The consensus of behavioural science had been that the public would lack toleration. Sir Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, agreed there was a lack of \u201cradicalism\u201d in pre-pandemic thinking, but said it would be \u201cvery surprising\u201d for a scientific committee, between emergencies, to suggest a lockdown \u2013 an \u201cextraordinarily major social intervention with huge economic and social impact ramifications\u201d. That would need the request of a senior politician. His predecessor, Davies, also said \u201cno one thought about lockdown\u201d and, visibly emotional, she apologised: \u201cWe have damaged a generation and it is awful\u201d. Cygnus and Alice \u2013 the 2016 pandemic exercises The government took the flu plan for a test drive in 2016 with nearly 1,000 civil servants involved in Exercise Cygnus. The results were bad: \u201cthe UK\u2019s current preparedness \u2026 is not sufficient to cope with the extreme demands of a severe pandemic\u201d. But there was secrecy. The full report wasn\u2019t published until October 2020 after a version was leaked to the Guardian. Wormald warned Hancock in June 2020 release could trigger \u201ccriticism of our preparedness in a number of areas \u2026 such as PPE supply, adult social care\u201d. A \u201cclosed institutional culture\u201d reduced the \u201cchallenge to orthodoxies\u201d, lawyers for the bereaved said. Cygnus resulted in 22 calls for action. But when Covid hit, only eight had been fully addressed by DHSC. Hancock admitted his department had failed to act, but argued the flu plan \u201cwouldn\u2019t have helped much\u201d with Covid and said: \u201cCygnus did not recommend that we should be prepared to stop the spread of a pandemic\u201d. It did, however, call for \u201cplans for social care facilities to support clients who are discharged from hospital\u201d. During Covid, difficulties in this area likely contributed to many care home deaths. The DHSC board, including Davies and Wormald, knew in 2016 that \u201ceven a moderate pandemic would overrun the system\u201d and the government\u2019s emergency response function would be \u201cvery rapidly overwhelmed\u201d by a major disease outbreak. It didn\u2019t seem much was done. When civil servant Emma Reed subsequently took charge of emergency preparedness and health protection at the DHSC in 2018, \u201cthere was no discussion with me about quarantining\u201d and \u201cno discussion with me about track and trace\u201d. Chris Whitty, chief medical officer from October 2019 but, before that, chief scientific adviser at the DHSC, said: \u201cwe did not give sufficient thought to what we could do to stop in its tracks a pandemic on the scale of Covid\u201d. \u201cThere was a groupthink that we knew this stuff best,\u201d said Jeremy Hunt, health secretary from 2012 to 2018. \u201cThere was a sense that, perhaps with the exception of the United States, there wasn\u2019t an enormous amount we could learn from other countries.\u201d A smaller pandemic wargame in 2016, Exercise Alice, modelled an outbreak of the coronavirus Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome). The report was \u201cliterally the only place\u201d where quarantine and testing were discussed, according to Hunt. But he was not even briefed on it. It had called for a briefing paper on the South Korean outbreak of Mers, \u201cwith a view to considering the direct application of their experience and methods to the UK (which included the 17,000 quarantine cases and port of entry screening)\u201d. The recommendations never reached his desk. Plus the world knew plenty about Sars CoV-1, which killed at least 773 people when there was an epidemic in 2002-4. Davies said she tried to challenge the \u201cgroupthink\u201d. \u201cFollowing a visit to Hong Kong where I learned a lot about Sars, I did ask unofficially \u2018what about doing a Sars review?\u2019 and was told \u2018oh no, it won\u2019t come here\u2019.\u201d Brexit When Covid hit, large parts of the civil service \u2013 including 70 DHSC staff \u2013 had been diverted to Operation Yellowhammer to brace the country for the fallout of a feared no-deal Brexit. Food and medicine supplies were under threat if the UK \u201ccrashed out\u201d of the EU. Sixteen separate pandemic preparation projects were \u201cstopped\u201d or reduced as a result. Planning for a \u201chealthcare surge\u201d, benchmarking the NHS\u2019s preparedness against other nations and a \u201cpandemic influenza strategy refresh\u201d (which was supposed to examine how countries in Asia, such as South Korea, had dealt with previous coronavirus pandemics) were all shelved. Also deprioritised were plans agreed by the chief medical officer \u201cto augment adult social and community care during a pandemic\u201d. Keith asked Reed: \u201cWhy did no one say, \u2018we cannot afford to stop the pandemic preparedness\u2019?\u201d No-deal was a \u201creal and present and credible threat\u201d while a pandemic was \u201cthe risk of a threat\u201d, she said. Brexit meant the UK\u2019s pandemic flu readiness board did not meet for over a year before Covid. Senior government officials in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland also cited Brexit planning as a reason for deprioritising pandemic plans. Nicola Sturgeon, then Scotland\u2019s first minister, said the consequences of a no-deal Brexit were assumed to be \u201cgrim, and extremely worrying\u201d. Several ministers argued the Brexit planning had helped. Michael Gove, said it had a \u201cdaily battle rhythm\u201d and made the government more \u201cmatch-fit\u201d for Covid. Hancock said work to safeguard medicine supplies post-Brexit meant the UK only just avoided running out of medicines for intensive care. Austerity, public health and the \u2018syndemic\u2019 Public Health England, the body then responsible for keeping the nation healthy, suffered deep budget cuts as austerity bit. There was a 13% cut in staff employed for the protection from infectious diseases; the public health grant was cut from more than \u00a33.5bn in 2015-16 to just over \u00a33bn in 2020-21. Over the PHE\u2019s eight-year life, central government funding was cut by 40% in real terms, said Prof Dame Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health and Security Agency. While the NHS was to a greater extent protected from austerity, PHE scientists had to do private paid work that \u201cdid not focus on strengthening the wider health protection system,\u201d Harries revealed. \u201cRather than having a critical system for the UK founded on a substantial grant that could maintain it, it was trying to pedal fast to keep up generating income,\u201d she said. Council health leaders said they were \u201cignored\u201d by ministers in pandemic planning and in the early stages of the pandemic. Despite their local knowledge and expertise in contact tracing, they found out about new policies only by watching daily Downing Street briefings on TV. The government\u2019s changes to the health service in 2012 had \u201cfractured the links between public health specialists and NHS\u201d, the British Medical Association said. Dr Richard Horton, editor of the Lancet, who had written a book called The Covid-19 Catastrophe, said: \u201cWe do have an excellent National Health System which is able to address people who present with particular diseases. But what we have not got is an effective public health system that is able to focus on health promotion and health and disease prevention, and it\u2019s that disabling of the public health system that left us particularly vulnerable to Covid-19.\u201d Davies said that, compared with similar countries, the UK was bottom of the table on numbers of doctors, nurses, beds, intensive care units, respirators and ventilators. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have the resilience,\u201d she said. The BMA said the state of the system was \u201cbrutally exposed\u201d by the pandemic. But the architects of austerity weren\u2019t having it. \u201cYour health system is only as strong as your economy, because one pays for the other,\u201d said David Cameron. Cutting the deficit \u201chad a material and positive effect on the UK\u2019s ability to respond\u201d to Covid, said Osborne. Horton used the term \u201csyndemic\u201d to describe two pandemics happening at once: Covid and poor public health, which put people at greater risk. \u201cThe UK entered the pandemic with its public services depleted, health improvements stalled, health inequalities increased and health among the poorest people in a state of decline,\u201d said the epidemiologist Sir Michael Marmot and Clare Bambra, a professor of public health. Horton warned if we don\u2019t think about a pandemic as a syndemic, \u201cwe will not be truly resilient to future threats."}, {"_id": "64b9400d51ac331da0b223c2", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/jul/19/two-child-benefit-cap-labour-economic-inheritance-rachel-reeves-pmqs-rishi-sunak-conservatives-uk-politics-latest", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Sunak refuses to rule out cabinet reshuffle on Friday amid Tory fears over byelection defeats \u2013 as it happened", "lead": "Prime minister refuses to answer question on possible reshuffle", "author": "Andrew Sparrow", "datePublished": "2023-07-19 16:42:19", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:09:17.233607", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/dd285b0b8dc66f29ff82e557751fb1ed6d09c6d0/1129_579_2820_1692/500.jpg", "body": "Rishi Sunak has refused to rule out having a government reshuffle on Friday. The Conservatives fear they will lose three byelections tomorrow, including in two seats where they had majorities of around 20,000 in 2019, and there is considerable speculation that Sunak may respond by bringing forward a reshuffle originally scheduled for September. (See 3.26pm.) Rishi Sunak and Ben Wallace have formally apologised to the Commons for the decades-long ban on LGBT people serving in the UK armed forces, after the publication of a government-commissioned review. UK inflation fell further than expected in June to 7.9% amid a sharp fall in petrol prices, easing forecasts for how aggressively the Bank of England will raise interest rates over the coming year. The Conservatives have selected Susan Hall as their candidate for next year\u2019s London mayoral election, with the strongly pro-Boris Johnson, Donald Trump-supporting assembly member likely to be seen as an outsider to defeat Sadiq Khan. Nick Macpherson, the former permanent secretary at the Treasury, has joined those criticising Coutts for the way it has treated Nigel Farage. In an interview with LBC\u2019s Tonight with Andrew Marr, Macpherson said: I think this is a worrying development. I also am worried that the bank had commented on Mr Farage\u2019s income and wealth in public, at least it appeared to brief newspapers last week or the week before. And I think the government is responding to wider unease amongst all of us. Getting a good service out of your bank is difficult enough at the best of times, but if they\u2019re just going to make, on the face of it, fairly arbitrary decisions about your beliefs or politics, I think that is quite a dangerous development. Rishi Sunak is addressing Tory MPs at a private meeting of the Conservative 1922 Committee. The Mirror\u2019s Lizzy Buchan says the traditional table banging that greeted his arrival was rather over the top. Without being in the room, it is hard to judge what this means. Maybe it was a sign that Tory MPs think he is doing brilliantly. Or maybe it was because they think it\u2019s all going pear-shaped, but they feel under a duty to cheer him up. At PMQs Rishi Sunak was twice asked about Nigel Farage having his bank account closed by Coutts. (See 10.22am and 10.44am.) In response, he said people should not lose access to banking services because of what they said, but he did not sound overly-outraged about what had happened. (See 12.28pm and 12.37pm.) Subsequently, in a post on Twitter, Sunak firmed up his criticism. \u201cNot right\u201d became \u201cwrong\u201d. Sunak said: This is wrong. No one should be barred from using basic services for their political views. Free speech is the cornerstone of our democracy. The Conservatives have complained to the Evening Standard about its \u201ccontemptible\u201d front page coverage of the selection of Susan Hall as the Tory candidate to be the capital\u2019s mayor, PA Media reports. Nickie Aiken, the Conservative party\u2019s deputy chair, said the selection of the full-page picture of the London assembly member was \u201cclear mockery\u201d, suggesting there was a \u201cwhiff of misogyny\u201d. The accompanying headline asked \u201cAnd the winner is?\u201d, with further text suggesting that Labour incumbent Sadiq Khan is \u201codds-on to seal third victory\u201d. Tory party chairman Greg Hands backed Aiken\u2019s complaint to Standard editor Dylan Jones, saying the coverage was \u201cextremely disappointing\u201d. In her letter shared on Twitter, Aiken said: I am writing to you to express my sincere disappointment in your front page today. Your choice of photo of Susan Hall is a clear mockery, and it is contemptible, especially as the first female candidate for London mayor from either of the two main parties. In his pooled interview at the Jaguar Land Rover HQ, Rishi Sunak was also asked when the guidance for schools on how to deal with trans pupils would be issued. It was due this week, but has reportedly been delayed because No 10 and Kemi Badenoch, the equalities minister, are pushing for restrictive guidance that would not comply with the Equality Act. (See 11.49am.) Sunak replied: This is a really complex and sensitive issue because it affects the wellbeing of our children, and it\u2019s important that we get it right given those complexities and sensitivities. I am committed to bringing forward that guidance. But I want to make sure that we\u2019ve taken the time to go through it properly, and when we do bring it forward, it will be well thought through. Rishi Sunak has said it was not just taxpayer money that enticed Tata to announce a new \u00a34bn battery factory in the UK which will create thousands of jobs. Speaking at the Jaguar Land Rover HQ in Warwick, he said: When I was chancellor, I set up the automotive transformation fund, which was always there to provide targeted investment in strategic industries where we thought it would make sense. But what is crucial about an investment like this is it\u2019s not just going to be about that, it\u2019s going to be about the quality of the workforce that we have here, the quality of our infrastructure, the road and rail connections, the approach to regulation, the competitiveness of our tax regime, which we have changed to make it more attractive for businesses to invest. Downing Street has confirmed that the government has offered subsidies to the Tata Group, the owner of Jaguar Land Rover, to secure the investment. But it has not yet said how much money is involved. (See 2.26pm.) Rishi Sunak has refused to rule out holding a reshuffle later this week. With speculation growing that a long-planned reshuffle will take place on Friday, immediately after the three byelections the Tories are expected to lose, instead of in September, Sunak was asked this afternoon on a visit in Warwickshire if he would rule out such a move. He replied: You would never expect me to comment on things like that. What I\u2019m determined to do is just deliver on the priorities that I set out for the country \u2013 halve inflation, grow the economy, reduce debt, cut waiting lists and stop the boats \u2013 today what we saw with the inflation figures is that our plan is working. In fact, prime ministers are happy to rule out imminent reshuffles when it suits them. Aubrey Allegretti has a good account of why a reshuffle seems increasingly likely. He quotes a government source saying No 10 has been asking for resources \u201conly used during reshuffles\u201d. That sounds like a reference to the whiteboard Downing Street uses to show who might go where. Rishi Sunak has given his backing to Susan Hall, elected today as the Tory candidate for London mayor, while not endorsing some of her views. Speaking at the post-PMQs lobby briefing, the PM\u2019s press secretary said Hall had Sunak\u2019s \u201cfull support\u201d. But, when asked if Sunak, like Hall, was a supporter of Liz Truss\u2019s mini-budget last year, the press secretary said: [Sunak] has made the point that unfunded tax cuts and increased borrowing would fuel inflation. Since he has been prime minister, he has taken a different approach and has done the right thing, and you can see from the statistics today that the plan is working. Asked whether Sunak thought Hall was right to compare Donald Trump supporters storming the Capitol to remainers refusing to accept the result of the Brexit referendum, the press secretary said: \u201cI don\u2019t think the prime minister would characterise it in that way.\u201d And asked if Sunak agreed with Hall that Boris Johnson was an \u201cawesome\u201d prime minister, the press secretary said: The prime minister has spoken about the many successes of the previous prime minister, including the rollout of the vaccine, getting Brexit done and his staunch support for Ukraine. Asked if Hall would be a liability to the Conservative party, the press secretary replied: No. She has shown great commitment to bettering London with the Conservatives and highlighting the many failures of Sadiq Khan, including his desire to charge people \u00a312.50 a day \u2013 as the prime minister said \u2013 just to visit their GP. Britain\u2019s counter-terrorism strategy needs to do more work on the \u201cviolent trend\u201d emerging from so-called incel (involuntary celibate) culture, Suella Braverman, the home secretary, has said. She was responding to Plymouth MP Luke Pollard, who linked the actions of the killer behind the 2021 Plymouth shootings to incel culture and violent misogyny and questioned why the trend currently fell out of the scope of Prevent, which aims to identify would-be terrorists. There was only one mention of the incel threat in the government\u2019s update to Contest, the UK\u2019s counter-terrorism strategy, which was published yesterday and was the subject of an urgent question in the Commons after PMQs. The Contest update said: It is possible that violent adherents to movements and subcultures, such as Involuntary Celibacy (incels), could meet the threshold of terrorist intent or action, should the threat or use of serious violence be used to influence the government, or to intimidate the public. Bravermen offered to meet with Pollard to discuss what further steps could be taken, telling him: Incel culture is not strictly within the Contest apparatus if you like but it does need work. I readily accept this a violent trend. It is a radicalising influence. It is promoting a culture that is totally at odds with a free and safe democratic society that we all love and want to cherish. I am very happy to speak to him about what further steps we could do. At the post-PMQs lobby briefing the PM\u2019s spokesperson refused to say what the government was spending in subsidies to bring the Tata Group\u2019s gigafactory to the UK. Asked about claims taxpayer support for the project could amount to \u00a3500m, or even \u00a31bn, the spokesperson said: Some of this stuff is commercially sensitive, it\u2019s not in the UK\u2019s interests to get into all the detail when negotiating with companies, but what shouldn\u2019t be lost is the massive investment into the UK \u2013 \u00a34bn, 4,000 direct jobs, thousands more indirect jobs. Details would eventually emerge \u201cas part of the regular transparency data\u201d, he said. But he also pointed out that the government had committed \u00a3850m to an automotive transformation fund. He went on: In general, we are acting in line with our approach. We have the automotive transformation fund to develop these sorts of supply chains and unlock private investment in gigafactories such as this one. The spokesperson said the use of public money was \u201can efficient way to drive massive investment into the UK, not only to help with net zero but to create jobs\u201d. Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, is making a statement to MPs about the review, chaired by Lord Etherton, about the impact of the ban on LGBT people serving in the military before the year 2000. The report says compensation should be paid to people affected, with the total being paid out capped at \u00a350m. It says: An appropriate financial award should be made to affected veterans notwithstanding the expiry of litigation time limits. The government\u2019s overall exposure should be capped at \u00a350m. In his statement Wallace repeated the apology issued by Sunak. He said: I was struck by one particular quote in the report from a veteran who said: \u2018I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m a veteran, I\u2019ve never asked for help, I don\u2019t feel like my service was recognised.\u2019 Today we want to say to all those ex-soldiers, sailors and aviators, many now in retirement: you are one of us, you belong in our community and in choosing to put yourself in harm\u2019s way for the good of your colleagues, your community and country, you have proven yourselves the best of us. I say again to the veterans\u2019 community I\u2019m deeply sorry for what happened to you. The very tolerance and values of western democracy that we expected you to fight for, we denied to you, it was profoundly wrong. I am determined as defence secretary, and as a veteran, to do all I can do today to right those historic wrongs so that you can once again take pride in your service and inspire future generations to follow in your footsteps. Wallace said that the government in principle accepted \u201cthe vast majority\u201d of the recommendations in the report, although he said it was still considering them. One of the recommendations was that the PM should deliver an apology in parliament. Earlier I said Sunak did not have to deliver the apology at PMQs, but, having now read the recommendation, I think it would have been embarrassing for him if he had ignored it. The last PMQs before the summer recess matters a bit more than usual because, in normal circumstances, if a leader does badly, they can make up for it a week later. But if you flop just before the summer adjournment, you cannot redeem yourself until September, and your MPs will spend the summer with a reminder of your uselessness fresh in the memory. With that in mind, Keir Starmer should be feeling very comfortable this afternoon. Even those former advisers involved in the unlikely, even bonkers, leadership challenge plot described by the i this week would probably have to concede that he did a good job. There were plenty of reasons why Starmer won this comfortably. He started with a conventional, simple question-that-involves-having-to-admit-something-embarrassing, and this made a decent point about hospital waiting lists, and he needled Rishi Sunak with a question about non-dom status. Much more memorable, though, were two jibes about Sunak missing PMs twice in a row, at least one of which sounded spontaneous, and both of which were funny. Pointing out that Sunak had got his age wrong too was a clear hit, not least because it does make you wonder why they can\u2019t add up in No 10. Starmer\u2019s date of birth is not a secret; it\u2019s on Wikipedia. What was much more important, though, was Starmer\u2019s decision to attack the NHS workforce plan on the grounds that the government has not explained how it will be funded. This is what he said when he raised the point for the second time. When [Sunak] said the workforce plan was fully costed, I have never seen the chancellor more bewildered. It\u2019s less than a year since his party crashed the economy with their unfunded spending commitments and he hasn\u2019t learnt a thing. So, let me ask it another way: is his uncosted spending coming from more tax rises, more cuts, or is it just the latest promise to fall from the Tories\u2019 magic money tree? In response, Sunak said the autumn statement would show where the money was coming from, which half-confirmed Starmer\u2019s point. As of now, it is not clear where the funding is coming from. When opposition parties are weak or nervous, they stick to familiar territory. When they are on the ascendant, they attack on issues supposedly owned by their rivals. The Conservatives have in the past suggested they want to fight the election on economic responsibility, but Starmer and his colleagues have now in effect declared: \u201cBring it on\u201d, with Rachel Reeves trying to outperform George Osborne on fiscal responsibility, Lucy Powell only yesterday appropriating \u201cno money left\u201d as an argument and now Starmer branding the Tories as the party of the magic money tree. The economics of Labour\u2019s positioning may be highly questionable. But the politics are clear; Starmer is hijacking electoral territory where the Tories thought they were impregnable. Sunak had a difficult PMQs but it could have been a lot worse. He is probably about to lose three byelections, and his approval ratings have hit their lowest level, according to YouGov, since he became PM. In these circumstances, the fact that he could sort of hold his own, and the fact that his MPs did not turn on him, must count as a bonus. Sunak\u2019s main line of attack was to challenge Starmer to say whether or not he thinks that hospital consultants deserve a higher pay rise than they are getting. In the context of PMQs, this is a weak ploy, because is not Starmer\u2019s job to answer questions, and at least twice the speaker reprimanded the PM for going \u201coff topic\u201d. But that does not mean these questions don\u2019t have salience. Starmer can avoid them at PMQs, and not in an interview studio. What was also interesting was Sunak\u2019s unlikely emergence as a gay rights champion. He did not have to announce the apology to LGBT veterans at PMQs, and he condemned conversion practices unexpected strongly in response to a question from Alicia Kearns. (See 12.32pm.) Maybe this is just an attempt to quash claims that the government\u2019s trans guidance for schools (see 11.49am) will mark the start of an ugly culture war campaign, but even if you doubt his sincerity, it is interesting that he felt the need to present his liberal credentials like this. UPDATE: The final paragraph probably overstates the significance of Sunak\u2019s decision to issue his apology to LGBT veterans at PMQs. He did not have to do it, but the Etherton review did recommend an apology by the PM in parliament, and it would have been embarrassing for Sunak to ignore this. However, the report did not specify how the apology should be worded. Sunak chose to describe the ban as \u201can appalling failure of the British state\u201d. (See 12.03pm.) Rishi Sunak has been forced to respond to questions about his expenses declaration over the funding of private jet travel to Tory events after Labour challenged him at prime minister\u2019s questions about \u201cwhy his story keeps changing\u201d. It comes after the Guardian reported that he was facing transparency questions over the travel and thousands of pounds in Conservative party donations after they were recorded as coming from a small company linked to a multimillionaire businessman. Last week, he changed his expenses declaration over the funding. In the third change for the declaration, it now names the donor of \u00a338,500 to pay for air travel by the prime minister and staff as Akhil Tripathi, a British-Indian medical tech entrepreneur who made a fortune from an anti-snoring device. At PMQs the Labour MP Neil Coyle asked him: Every single member of this house is required by law to confirm the true source of a donation before it is accepted or declared, so can the prime minister tell us if he followed all the rules all the time before he took thirty eight and a half thousand pounds of free air travel on 28 April and if so, why does his story keep changing about who paid? Sunak replied: All donations are declared in the normal way and as the honourable gentleman knows if there are administrative changes to that they are quickly corrected. Carla Lockhart (DUP) asks about support for children with cancer. Sunak says he can imagine how difficult it is for families with a child with cancer. He will look at the issue Lockhart has raised, he says. And that\u2019s it. PMQs is over. David Davis (Con) says NatWest\u2019s customers should be worried about what happened to Nigel Farage. (NatWest owns Coutts). He says banks should be required to say how many accounts they have closed for similar reasons. Sunak says the government is continuing to look at this issue. UPDATE: Sunak said: I know that [Davis] has spoken to the chancellor about this issue, and that he will continue to have those conversations. In the short term, having consulted on the payment service regulations, we intend to crack down on that practice by toughening the rules around account closures. In the meantime, the Financial Ombudsman Service is available for people to make complaints to. Lee Anderson, the Tory deputy chair, asks about Keir Starmer\u2019s stance on the two-child benefit cap. Sunak says he does not think anyone believes Starmer supports the policy he is now backing. Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker, says Sunak has no responsibility for what Starmer does. Barry Sheerman (Lab) says John Major has condemned Brexit as a catastrophic decision. Does Sunak agree? Sunak says it was seven years ago. He says since the UK left the single market, the economy has grown faster than Germany\u2019s. Alicia Kearns (Con) asks if the government is still committed to a ban on conversion practices. Sunak says \u201cconversion therapy\u201d is an \u201cabhorrent practice\u201d. He says the equalities minster will update MPs on what is happening in due course. UPDATE: Kearns said: Conversion therapy is quackery packaged up by bigots seeking to promote their hate and to profit from it. On 19 January, a minister promised at the dispatch box to bring forward a ban against conversion therapy and ensure that pre-legislative scrutiny was completed before the end of this parliamentary term. How does [Sunak] plan to continue that? And Sunak replied: I agree that conversion therapy is an abhorrent practice, and we need to do everything we can to stamp it out wherever we see it. [Kemi Badenoch, the equalities minister] will continue to keep the house updated on her progress. Mark Francois (Con) says 457 members of the armed forces were killed in Afghanistan. He says he was stunned to see a video posted by Tobias Ellwood, the Tory chair of the defence committee, praising the Taliban government. Francois says this was \u201csilly and naive\u201d. He asks Sunak to condemn it. Sunak pays tribute to servicemen and women. The government will continue to call out human rights abuses, he says. But he says the government also has dialogue with regimes \u2013 without condoning what they do, he says. He says he will look at the case Francois mentioned. Jacob Rees-Mogg (Con) asks if there will be an inquiry into the cancellation of a bank account by a bank with the government as a shareholder. He seems to be referring to the Nigel Farage case, although he does not name him. Sunak says people should not have their accounts closed for exercising the right to free speech. The rules are being tightened, to stop this happening, he says. In the meantime, people can complain to the ombudsman, he says. UPDATE: Sunak said: It would not be right if financial services were being denied to anyone exercising their right to lawful free speech. Our new Financial Services and Markets Act 2023 puts in place new measures to ensure that politically exposed persons are being treated in an appropriate and proportionate manner, and having consulted on the payments services regulations, we are in the process of cracking down on that practice by tightening the rules around account closures. But in the meantime, any individual can complain to the Financial Ombudsman Service, which has the power to direct a bank to reopen their account. Sunak says the government has delivered the number one ask of the BMA, lifting the cap on pensions contributions. Doctors should get back to work, he says. Greg Clark (Con) asks about the gigafactory announcement, and asks if the government will bring more such factories to the UK. Sunak says this is one of the biggest investments in the car industry in the UK. Dame Diana Johnson (Lab) asks why Sunak has been summoned to give evidence to the infected blood inquiry next week. Sunak says the scandal should never have happened. He is due to give evidence shortly, so it would be inappropriate to say more now, he says. Shailesh Vara (Con) says, if Labour favours economic migration, it should say so. He suggests young men arriving on small boats are not genuine asylum seekers. (In fact, based on the number who actually do got their asylum applications considered, a majority of them are.) Sunak says Vara is right. He says Labour does not have a plan to deal with illegal immigration. Stephen Flynn, the SNP leader at Westminster, says the two-child benefit cap has left 250,000 children in poverty. Does the PM take comfort from Labour\u2019s support for it? Sunak says he welcomes Labour\u2019s support for it. But Keir Starmer has never kept a promise he has made, he says. Flynn says Scots expect child poverty from the Tories. But not from Labour. A shiver is running along the Labour frontbench, he says, looking for a spine to go up. Sunak says the best route out of poverty is through work. He says the government will reduce child poverty. He does not want to see any child grow up in poverty. Starmer says he is 60, not 61. He asks about the \u201c40 new hospitals\u201d. But there are not 40, they are not new, and many are not hospitals, he says. Sunak claims 40 new hospitals are being built. Referring to Hillingdon hospital (which serves Uxbridge), he says Labour wants to charge people visiting a hospital. He is talking about the Ulez extension, a key issue in tomorrow\u2019s Uxbridge byelection. Starmer asks if Sunak is so committed to non-dom status that he won\u2019t let the government raise money for the NHS by getting rid of it, as Labour would. Sunak says Labour has promised to spend the non-dom money on five different things. He says he wants people to study maths until 18. Maybe, in Starmer\u2019s case, they should be studying it until they are 61, he says. He says Labour did set out plans for the workforce. But Labour\u2019s plans did not cover retention of staff and NHS reform, he says. Starmer says Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, looked \u201cbewildered\u201d when Sunak said the plan was fully funded. Where is it coming from? The magic money tree? Sunak says when the autumn statement is published, it will show the plan is fully funded. He says, while Labour MPs are \u201cback on the picket lines\u201d, Starmer refuses to take a position. Starmer should \u201cstop taking inspiration from his friends outside and unglue himself from the fence\u201d. Starmer says Sunak has been away from PMQs for so long he has forgotten how it works. He says Sunak nicked his NHS staffing plan from Labour. But, unlike Labour, Sunak has not said how he would pay for it. \u201cWhere is the money coming from?\u201d Sunak says the plan is fully funded. And it was welcomed by 43 NHS stakeholders, he says. He starts quoting figures about what the plan will achieve. A&amp;E waiting times in England are the best for two years. But in Wales NHS waiting times are the worst in the UK, he says. Starmer says we do not get any more answers from Sunak when he is here than when he is not here. We know the answer, he says. (It is about 7.5m). Why is the government failing more patients than ever before? Sunak says Starmer did not answer the question. If Starmer looked at what is happening, he would see the plans are working. Waits of one and a half years have been virtually eliminated. Ambulance waiting times are falling. But it has all been held up by industrial action in the NHS. Does Starmer agree doctors should accept the recommendations of the pay review bodies. Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker, tells Sunak the opposition asks the questions. Keir Starmer welcomes the apology from Sunak. He says a constituent affected by it is in the chamber to hear what Sunak said. There is more detail about the apology here. He says the NHS waiting list was 7.2 million when Sunak took office. What is the figure today? Sunak says cutting the waiting list has been affected by the strike action. Does Starmer agree consultants and junior doctors should accept the government\u2019s pay deal? Sajid Javid, the former health secretary, asks when the suicide prevention strategy will be published. Sunak says it will come later this year. He says he knows how much this matters to Javid because of his brother. Rishi Sunak starts by saying the ban on LGBT people serving in the military until 2000 was a stain on the country. He says a report out today makes this clear. He goes on: Today, on behalf of the British state, I apologise. UPDATE: Sunak said: The ban on LGBT people serving in our military until the year 2000 was an appalling failure of the British state decades behind the law of this land. As today\u2019s report makes clear, in that period many endured the most horrific sexual abuse and violence, homophobic bullying and harassment, all while bravely serving this country. Today, on behalf of the British state, I apologise. I hope all those affected will be able to feel proud parts of the veteran community that has done so much to keep our country safe. PMQs is starting soon. Here is the list of MPs down to ask a question. Government guidance for schools in England on how to deal with pupils who want to transition has been delayed because No 10 and Kemi Badenoch, the equalities minister, have been pushing for a tough version that would be unlawful under the Equalities Act, Steven Swinford reports in a story for the Times. Swinford says: The draft guidance stated that children should be allowed to socially transition with the consent of their parents, meaning that they could choose another pronoun or name and wear the uniform of the opposite sex. But the government then commissioned legal advice from Victoria Prentis, the attorney general, about whether a ban on social transitioning in schools was possible. Last week she concluded that such a move would be unlawful and said that the government would need to pass new legislation if it wanted to go further \u2026 A Whitehall source said that No 10 and Badenoch had put forward a series of proposals to strengthen the guidance. The strongest \u2014 and a reflection of the government\u2019s concerns \u2014 was a blanket ban on social transitioning \u2026 Prentis said that a blanket ban would be unlawful because the Equalities Act states that gender reassignment is a \u201cprotected characteristic\u201d, regardless of age. In a thread on Twitter, ITV\u2019s Paul Brand says this illustrates how uneasy Rishi Sunak is dealing with \u201cculture war\u201d issues. Keir Starmer has joined mourners in London for the funeral of Margaret McDonagh, Labour\u2019s first female general secretary, PA Media reports. PA says: Lady McDonagh died in June aged 61 and was hailed for her key role in Labour\u2019s 1997 landslide election victory. Her sister Siobhain McDonagh is the current Labour MP for Mitcham and Morden in south London. Figures from across the party gathered for the service, including former prime ministers Sir Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. Other faces from the New Labour era, including Lord Mandelson, attended the Mass at St Boniface RC Church in Mitcham, alongside current shadow cabinet members including Emily Thornberry, Yvette Cooper, Ed Miliband and David Lammy. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, was also in attendance. My colleague Aubrey Allegretti says the SNP has been distributing mugs to journalists at Westminster suggesting \u201ccontrols on family sizes\u201d is now Labour policy. So it is not hard to work out what Stephen Flynn, the SNP leader at Westminter, will be raising at PMQs. The head of MI6 has urged Russians angry at Vladimir Putin\u2019s war in Ukraine to spy for the UK, PA Media reports. Speaking in Prague, Sir Richard Moore said that while artificial intelligence (AI) was being used to help target the Kremlin\u2019s war machine, technology would never replace human agents. Moore said: There are many Russians today who are silently appalled by the sight of their armed forces pulverising Ukrainian cities, expelling innocent families from their homes and kidnapping thousands of children. They are watching in horror as their soldiers ravage a kindred country. They know in their hearts that Putin\u2019s case for attacking a fellow Slavic nation is fraudulent, a miasma of lies and fantasy. Moore said \u201cmany Russians are wrestling with the same dilemmas and the same tugs of conscience\u201d as their predecessors did in 1968 when Soviet tanks crushed the Prague spring uprisings. He went on: I invite them to do what others have already done this past 18 months and join hands with us. Our door is always open. We will handle their offers of help with the discretion and professionalism for which my service is famed. Their secrets will always be safe with us. And together we will work to bring the bloodshed to an end. Just Stop Oil protesters staged a protest on Westminster Bridge this morning. Chris Philp, the policing minister, has welcomed the intervention by the police, who cleared the road after eight minutes. He posted a tweet saying: Glad the Police cleared the road in 8 mins. Westminster Bridge leads to a major A&amp;E department at St Thomas\u2019s Hospital. JSO are deliberately preventing people getting to hospital (and work, school etc) because they can\u2019t win the argument by normal democratic means Nigel Farage, the former leader of Ukip and the Brexit party, is encouraging people to read the full set of documents about him he obtained from Coutts using a subject access request. (See 10.22am.) They have been published by MailOnline. Farage told PA Media: It is a document that is full of every negative thing that has ever been said about me, it is prejudicial in a way that only the metropolitan elite can do. He also claimed that, if banks were allowed to reject customers because of their views, the UK was heading for Chinese-style authoritarianism. He said: I think that the march of woke corporatism needs to be checked and if it is not then we will finish up with a Chinese-style social credit system. Only those with acceptable views will be able to participate fully in society. I am effectively de-banked. How do I pay my gas bill? What have I done wrong? I haven\u2019t broken the law. I happen to have an opinion on issues that is more popular outside the M25 than it is in inner London postcodes. Susan Hall has been chosen as the Conservative candidate for next year\u2019s London mayoral election, after a turbulent selection process in which a series of early favourites were excluded or stepped down, Peter Walker reports. My colleague Pippa Crerar says Sadiq Khan, the incumbent Labour mayor who will be fighting for an unprecedented third term next year, will be thrilled. Khan\u2019s team view Hall as a \u201chard-right\u201d figure out of touch with London\u2019s values, she says. A few weeks ago Nigel Farage, the former leader of Ukip and the Brexit party, claimed that his bank account was being closed because of his political views. At first he did not name the bank involved, but as the controversy escalated, with anti-bank stories appearing prominently in the pro-Brexit papers, the elite bank Coutts let it be known that it was closing Farage\u2019s account. The BBC and other news organisations reported that Farage was being told to take his custom elsewhere, not because of his political views, but because there was not enough money in his account. Now Farage has got hold of a document from the bank that suggests that this account was, at the very best, misleading. After making a subject access request, Farage obtained 40 pages of material held by the bank about him, including minutes from a meeting of Coutts\u2019 wealth reputational risk committee. A full account has been published in the Daily Telegraph. According to the Telegraph, the minutes of a meeting of the wealth reputation risk committee held on 17 November 2022 say: The committee did not think continuing to bank NF [Nigel Farage] was compatible with Coutts given his publicly-stated views that were at odds with our position as an inclusive organisation. This was not a political decision but one centred around inclusivity and purpose. There are more details in our version of the story here. The Telegraph also says the committee was told that Farage\u2019s account was \u201csufficient to retain on a commercial basis\u201d \u2013 although the bundle of documents released to Farage also included an email sent in March this year saying his account had been \u201cbelow commercial criteria for some time\u201d. This morning, responding to the new revelations, Grant Shapps, the energy secretary, said that Coutts\u2019 treatment of Farage had been \u201cdisgraceful\u201d. In an interview with Sky News, he said: I think it is absolutely disgraceful. I don\u2019t have to agree with everything Nigel Farage says to recognise that free speech is a very important part of our domestic life. What has happened with some of these banks through this regime, which is known as the PEP [politically exposed persons] regime, or politically exposed people, is really actually scandalous. People shouldn\u2019t have their bank accounts closed because of their political or any other view. And banks shouldn\u2019t be refusing to open accounts on that basis as well. Yet there is a very long-running problem within this country where banks are misapplying the guidance and rules. And not just closing accounts, but refusing to open them in the first place, and that should not be the case. In her Today interview Rachel Reeves said that tackling child poverty was \u201cat the heart\u201d of the document published by Labour earlier this month setting out details of its \u201cbreaking down barriers to opportunity\u201d mission. (See 9.31am.) That was not immediately obvious to readers. The document runs to 22 pages, but the phrase \u201cchild poverty\u201d only appears three times, in this passage. Child poverty reduction: Dedicated professionals across our education system go above and beyond every day to deliver for our children, but the barriers that too many children face \u2013 from the lack of a secure home, to not having books to read or pens to draw with \u2013 are not theirs to fix. As part of the Opportunity Mission cross-government task force, we will involve child poverty reduction specialists at the heart of this work. Labour will put a focus on reducing child poverty at the centre of how we secure opportunity for children and young people from every background and every corner of our country. There are three other explicit references to reducing poverty in the document. At the press conference where this was launched, my colleague Peter Walker asked Keir Starmer why poverty reduction did not feature more prominently as a goal. In response, Starmer said that targeting poverty was \u201cthe foundation on which these missions sit\u201d and that his government would be \u201claser-focused on poverty\u201d. Good morning. Yesterday Keir Starmer delivered an uncompromising message, at shadow cabinet and at the Tony Blair Institute conference, to critics in his party unhappy about his declaration that the two-child benefit cap will have to stay. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, was on the Today programme this morning and, while she did not contradict her leader, she presented Labour\u2019s stance in a very different manner. Tackling child poverty would be a priority, she said. She told the programme: Tackling child poverty is in Labour\u2019s DNA. When we were last in government, under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, hundreds of thousands of children and pensioners were lifted out of poverty. Keir Starmer and Bridget Phillipson set out our opportunity mission just a couple of weeks ago. Child poverty was at the heart of that. Reeves made the point in an interview with Nick Robinson during which she also said Labour would have \u201cthe most dire economic inheritance of any incoming government\u201d. The party could not promise to do things, like lifting the two-child benefit cap, without having the money to pay for them, Reeves said. When Robinson put it to her that a Labour colleague had said there were six other policies, like axing the two-child cap, that the party would like to implement, but could not afford to, Reeves replied: The truth is there\u2019s more than six things that an incoming Labour government won\u2019t be able to do. We\u2019re going to have the most dire economic inheritance of any incoming government. The level of debt in the UK economy is the same size as everything we produce in the economy on an annual basis. Our interest rates and inflation are a staggering high levels and our economy is barely growing. It\u2019s barely grown these last 13 years \u2026 It is our duty to get control of the public finances and ensure we\u2019ve got a stable economy. It\u2019s not a \u2018nice to have\u2019, it is the rock of stability upon which all other policies have to be built. There will be nothing in a Labour manifesto there\u2019s not fully costed and fully funded. But Reeves also said this did not mean Labour was not committed to tackling child poverty. That\u2019s when she used the \u201cin Labour\u2019s DNA quote\u201d. Robinson then suggested that Starmer is only saying now he will keep the two-child cap because he wants to sound tough. Do you really think that, when you are in office, you will not be able to get rid of that? Reeves replied: Tackling child poverty is in Labour\u2019s DNA. When we were last in government, under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, hundreds of thousands of children and pensioners were lifted out of poverty. Keir Starmer and Bridget Phillipson set out our opportunity mission just a couple of weeks ago. Child poverty was at the heart of that. That sounded like a very strong hint that, eventually, under Labour, the two-child benefit cap would go. Reeves was giving an interview after the publication of today\u2019s inflation figures. As Richard Partington reports, the headline rate fell further than expected in June, to 7.9%. Graeme Wearden has more on this on his business liveblog.
