He stood up calmly, placing his notes on the historic despatch box, telling her firmly, \u201cNo,\u201d before adding, \u201cthe guidance was followed and the rules were followed at all times\u201d.But just a few hours earlier, two of Mr Johnson\u2019s top aides had urged him against making this very claim.

He agreed to delete the reference to the guidance.\u201dIn a statement to the Commons opening PMQs, Mr Johnson said: \u201cI have been repeatedly assured since these allegations emerged that there was no party and that no Covid rules were broken.

She said she suffered guilt over the way they had died.Another woman said she had \"lost everything\", while others described suffering anxiety.People also told how they had not hugged each other at family funerals because they were sticking to Covid social distancing rules laid down by the government.UK may not have been prepared for pandemicThe UK may not have been \"very well prepared at all\" to deal with the coronavirus pandemic, the official inquiry\u2019s lead lawyer has said as public hearings began.Lead counsel Hugo Keith KC questioned on Tuesday whether the nation was equipped to offer substantial protection to the public as leaders had promised.In his opening statement, Mr Keith said that near the start of the pandemic in March 2020 the Department of Health and Social Care, along with the three devolved governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, published a Covid-19 action plan \"setting out how they planned to tackle the coronavirus outbreak\". Hugo Keith KC says UK may not have been prepared for pandemic  (Covid 19 Inquiry)\"The plan stated that the United Kingdom was well prepared to respond in a way that offered substantial protection to the public. Whether that was actually the case will be examined in module one.\"Even at this stage before hearing the evidence it is apparent that we might not have been very well prepared at all.\"Mr Keith said the inquiry would look at whether health inequalities contributed to the UK death toll and levels of hospitalisation.\"Did the high levels of heart disease, diabetes, respiratory illness and obesity render us more vulnerable?\u201d he said. \u201cHad there been a slowdown in health improvement in the decade before? Had health inequalities widened?\u201dVery little thought given to impact of lockdownsMr Keith said there was \u201cvery little thought\u201d given to the impact lockdowns could have on the country.\"Extraordinary though it may seem, given that it\u2019s a word that\u2019s forever seared in the nation\u2019s consciousness, there was very little debate pre-pandemic of whether a lockdown might prove to be necessary in the event of a runaway virus, let alone how a lockdown could be avoided.\"Very little thought was given to how, if it proved to be necessary, how something as complex, difficult and damaging as a national lockdown could be put in place at all.\"Equally, there appears to have been a failure to think through the potentially massive impact on education and on the economy in trying to control a runaway virus in this way.\"Mr Keith also questioned whether past experiences could have led to complacency in planning.He added: \"Was there an element of complacency based on our recent experiences, including the ranking in the Global Health Security Index? Or our response to swine flu in 2009 and the UK\u2019s undoubted successes in ensuring Sars and Mers did not spread?\"Did our experience of the 2009 swine flu lead to concerns about overreacting?\"Brexit could have \u2018crowded out\u2019 planning for pandemicHugo Keith KC suggested to the Covid inquiry that preparing for Brexit \"crowded out and prevented\" the work that was needed to improve pandemic preparedness.He said: \"The pandemic struck the United Kingdom just as it was leaving the European Union.\"That departure required an enormous amount of planning and preparation, particularly to address what were likely to be the severe consequences of a no-deal exit on food and medicine supplies, travel and transport, business borders and so on.\"It is clear that such planning, from 2018 onwards, crowded out and prevented some or perhaps a majority of the improvements that central government itself understood were required to be made to resilience planning and preparedness.\"Did the attention therefore paid to the risks of a no-deal exit - Operation Yellowhammer as it was known - drain the resources and capacity that should have been continuing the fight against the next pandemic, that should have been utilised in preparing the United Kingdom for civil emergency?Evidence likely to show \u2018chaos\u2019 in governmentEvidence is likely to show a lack of responsibility in Government and \"chaos\" which led to a slow reaction to a pandemic where \"lost time is measured in lost lives\", the Covid inquiry has been told.Pete Weatherby KC, of Covid Bereaved Families for Justice UK, said: \"The families expect the evidence will show a lack of responsibility in Government for civil emergency preparedness, with little or no ministerial leadership and the chaos of committees which led to poor planning and ultimately a reactive rather than proactive response to the virus.RecommendedGovernment WhatsApps about \u2018frothy\u2019 coffee, not big decisions, former health ministerBoris Johnson hands over his WhatsApps and asks for them to be given to Covid inquiryBoris WhatsApp row descends into farce as senior Tories call for Sunak to end dispute\"We anticipate the evidence will show that the most fundamental consequence of this was a slow reaction.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeCrime writer Sir Ian Rankin said it was \u201cabsolutely thrilling\u201d to be honoured with a knighthood at Buckingham Palace.Sir Ian, creator of Detective Inspector John Rebus and winner of several national and international awards, was knighted for services to literature and charity on Tuesday.The University of Edinburgh graduate, 63, is known across the world for his crime novels focused on Rebus, which are mostly based in and around the Scottish capital.Knots & Crosses, the first in the series, was published in 1987 and Rebus now features in 26 books.The novels have been translated into 22 languages and become bestsellers on several continents.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveAfter getting his gong from the Princess Royal, Sir Ian said he was initially \u201cbemused\u201d when told about the knighthood \u201cbecause a few years ago I was given an OBE and I probably thought that\u2019s about as much as I can expect\u201d.He said: \u201cSo I was very happy with that \u2013 but this was absolutely thrilling.\u201cAnd the fact that it was for charity work, or charitable giving, as well as the output of books was especially good because my wife and I have run a charitable foundation for quite a few years now but anonymously.\u201cWell, someone\u2019s outed us now, I guess. Someone must have put me forward for this.\u201dSir Ian commented on the warm weather in London, saying: \u201cHot. Hot. Hot. Coming from Edinburgh, we knew it was going to be warm in London but it\u2019s absolutely roasting.\u201cIt\u2019s fantastic. The sense of occasion, the grandeur of the surroundings. And it\u2019s always lovely to meet the Princess Royal.\u201dSir Ian said he is having a year off from writing at the moment and spending time holidaying.In September or October he will begin thinking about the next book, which will be another Rebus novel.\u201cRight now they\u2019re filming a new TV series of Rebus in and around Edinburgh,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cI\u2019m still hoping to get a cameo but they\u2019ve not invited me yet.\u201dSir Ian said he was surprised to hear from some palace staff that their families are fans of his books \u201cbecause you sit in your room and you\u2019ve got no idea who is reading your books or where they\u2019re being read\u201d.He said: \u201cAnd to find them being read in Buckingham Palace is quite extraordinary.\u201dHe said the Queen is a fan, with Camilla telling him her whole family read his books.\u201cYou write a book for yourself and you don\u2019t realise the reach your books have got until someone tells you something like that,\u201d he said.Sir Ian said he reads all sorts, both fiction and non-fiction, adding: \u201cI\u2019m excited for the next Jilly Cooper, I\u2019ve got to say.\u201cShe keeps saying she\u2019s got a new book on the way.

Both Scott and Howell had denied Alfie was \u201cdunked\u201d in the water as part of a \u201csinister\u201d regime of correction at his mum\u2019s address in Droitwich.Jurors at Coventry Crown Court heard that Alfie had 50 injuries all over his body, with only a handful likely to be attributed to normal childhood bumps and scrapes.RecommendedWho is Christian Brueckner? Madeleine McCann suspect and the accusations against himTwo men charged over murder and disappearance of Chloe Mitchell, 21, in Ballymena\u2018Funny and loving\u2019 couple who were found dead at home pictured for first time as man charged with murderMedical experts previously told the jury that seven of the injuries to his head and face were likely to have come from four different blows.On the day of his death, Scott rang 999 at 2.24pm and told the call handler that \u201cAlfie had fallen asleep in the bath\u201d. Howell was not at the house when officers arrived, with Scott later claiming to have found the boy \u201csubmerged\u201d and that he had previously \u201chit his head\u201d.Alfie was \u2018dunked\u2019 in a cold bath as punishment, a court heard  (Supplied/West Mercia Police)Scott, 35, denied murdering her son and told her trial that she had not \u201cbelted\u201d Alfie, while her partner claimed to have attempted CPR to revive the schoolboy. He also told jurors that he had not beaten the schoolboy nor attempted to stage a cover-up.Jurors at Coventry Crown Court took 10 hours and 13 minutes of deliberation to find 35-year-old Scott guilty of Alfie\u2019s manslaughter, returning a majority verdict of 11 to one on Tuesday.She was cleared of his murder. Howell, 41, was found guilty of Alfie\u2019s murder by unanimous verdict.The judge, Mr Justice Wall, remanded both defendants into custody to be sentenced at 11am on Thursday.Following the verdict, Alfie\u2019s grandad, Paul Scott, paid tribute to his grandson.\u201cOur precious grandson Alfie was a charming, funny and inquisitive young boy whose kindness and cheeky smile was enough to melt your heart.\u201cHe had a unique personality that made him a treasure to be around, whether it was his comical phrases or his quirky dance moves, he knew how to make you laugh and cry joyous tears.\u201cIt fills us with immense sadness that we will never be able to see that same cheeky smile again. Losing Alfie has left a massive void in our lives; to think that we will never be able to hug him and watch him grow into an accomplished young man causes much anguish. We miss him so much.\u201dMother Carla Scott and stepfather Dirk Howell have both been convicted  (West Mercia Police)After the verdict, the senior investigating officer who led the case, Detective Chief Inspector Leighton Harding, said: \u201cAlfie suffered the most horrifying physical and emotional abuse at the hands of Scott and Howell. It is unimaginable to consider the fear and distress Alfie must have felt during the events that led to his collapse and death in his home on the morning of 18 February 2021. \u201cThe physical violence he suffered at the hands of Scott and Howell, which involved being forced into a cold bath and his head held under water, caused his death.\u201cThe court heard evidence of a culture of excessive punishment of Alfie by Scott and Howell. Punishment amounted to beating Alfie with a belt and a slider until he was black and blue with bruising. He was often woken in the early hours of the morning and made to stand outside where Scott and Howell threw jugs of cold water over him.\u201cHe was often grounded for excessive periods, made to stand for hours inside and outside his home, food removed from him, banished to his room, repeatedly forced into a bath of cold water and his head held under.\u201cThe conduct of Scott and Howell was nothing less than serious physical and emotional abuse, inflicting the most cruel and inhumane treatment of Alfie.\u201cAlfie should have expected unconditional love and protection of Scott, yet she deliberately neglected his needs, choosing to prioritise her own needs and relationship with Howell, knowing the cruel treatment he was inflicting upon Alfie.\u201cScott and Howell did nothing to protect Alfie and inflicted or permitted the torrent of physical and emotional abuse to continue time and time again.\u201cBoth continued to lie to social services and police to protect themselves from their abuse being discovered, and even confronted and threatened neighbours and members of the public who reported concerns over their treatment of Alfie. At no stage has either of them shown any remorse or acceptance of responsibility for their actions.\u201cToday\u2019s verdict will never undo the dreadful abuse Alfie suffered but it will mean those responsible for inflicting such terror and pain will face the consequences of their sickening actions.\u201d"}, {"_id": "6488a01051ac33a3962e176a", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/robin-walker-amanda-spielman-mps-schools-naht-b2356555.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "MPs launch inquiry into school inspections by Ofsted following criticism", "lead": "The watchdog has faced pressure to reform after headteacher Ruth Perry took her own life when her school was downgraded to the lowest rating.", "author": "Eleanor Busby", "datePublished": "Tue, 13 Jun 2023 16:14:05 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:57:52.359464", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-13T16:14:05+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/13/12/34269501f45744aeb06ca49b2f1647d4Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg2NzM4Mjg3-2.71869255.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeMPs are launching an inquiry into Ofsted\u2019s school inspections and whether they can be improved.The watchdog has faced pressure to reform after headteacher Ruth Perry took her own life after her school was downgraded to the lowest Ofsted rating.The inquiry \u2013 by cross-party MPs on the Commons Education Select Committee \u2013 will look into concerns that the one-word ratings that Ofsted gives to schools may not be conducive to helping schools improve.MPs will consider the impact of Ofsted inspections on the workload and wellbeing of teachers, school leaders and pupils as part of the inquiry.Robin Walker, chair of the committee, acknowledged that there has been a \u201cnotable groundswell of criticism\u201d towards Ofsted about the impact of inspections and single-word judgments on school staff.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveHe said: \u201cOfsted plays a particularly vital role when it comes to safeguarding but ensuring that inspections are proportionate, timely and reasonable is essential to build trust, especially after the tragic passing of headteacher Ruth Perry.\u201dThe inquiry will not examine the events that preceded the death of Ms Perry, the former headteacher of Caversham Primary School in Reading, Berkshire, as an inquest is due to commence later this year.An Ofsted report found Caversham School to be \u201cgood\u201d in every category apart from leadership and management, where it was rated as \u201cinadequate\u201d.Since Ms Perry\u2019s death in January there have been calls for one-word ratings to be abolished.On Monday, Ofsted announced a series of changes, including launching a consultation on reforms to the complaints system and giving schools more information around the timing of their inspections.Schools graded inadequate overall due only to ineffective safeguarding \u2013 but where all other judgments were good or better \u2013 will be revisited by inspectors within three months of a report being published as part of the reforms.\n\nI think it is fair to say that a great deal of that pressure does relate to the perceived consequences of inspection - it's not just about the process itselfAmanda Spielman, Ofsted's chief inspectorBut Amanda Spielman, Ofsted\u2019s chief inspector, said on Monday that scrapping one-word judgments would not solve the \u201cunderlying discomfort\u201d among headteachers if the consequences of the inspection remain the same.As part of the inquiry, MPs will explore the impact of Ofsted judgments on schools and pupils \u2013 and the adequacy of the support schools can access to enable them to improve following an Ofsted judgment.The effectiveness of Ofsted\u2019s complaints process will also be explored.Mr Walker added: \u201cSome have argued that Ofsted\u2019s role should be expanded to provide more support to schools that need to improve, amid concerns around the impact that receiving a negative rating can have on a school\u2019s morale and reputation.\u201dAddressing the Commons Education Select Committee on Tuesday, Ms Spielman welcomed the launch of the inquiry.She said Ofsted was focused on how it \u201ccan contribute to reducing the pressure that is undoubtedly felt by school leaders around inspection\u201d.\u201cI think it is fair to say that a great deal of that pressure does relate to the perceived consequences of inspection \u2013 it\u2019s not just about the process itself,\u201d Ms Spielman added.But she told MPs that the consequences of school inspection \u2013 such as intervention or support \u2013 \u201csit with Government\u201d rather than Ofsted.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders\u2019 union the NAHT, said: \u201cThe changes already announced by Ofsted do not go far enough to address the concerns the profession have or to mitigate the harm inspections can cause.\u201cIt is becoming increasingly clear that there is an overwhelming desire for meaningful change.\u201cWe hope the Education Select Committee will listen carefully to the experiences and concerns of the profession and help bring about much-needed change.\u201dProfessor Julia Waters, sister of Ms Perry, said: \u201cI am pleased to see that MPs will be looking into ways that Ofsted inspections can be improved.RecommendedNorthern European allies agree to step up efforts to protect underwater cablesData shows a majority of councils missed accounts deadline as reserves fallBrides get \u2018hitched\u2019 thanks to police escort to wedding venue\u201cSince Ruth\u2019s death, our family has been overwhelmed with the outpouring of anger and distrust of Ofsted from teachers and headteachers.\u201cIt is clear that a rigorous and independent review of the system is necessary, and I am glad that this inquiry will look into a wide range of important issues.\u201d"}, {"_id": "6488a01051ac33a3962e176b", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/cost-of-living-payment-dwp-universal-credit-b2356653.html", "primaryCategory": "Home News", "subCategories": "test", "title": "July dates for DWP cost of living payments, benefits and pensions", "lead": "<p>Food prices increasing at their fastest rate in almost 45 years, ONS has warned </p>", "author": "Joe Sommerlad", "datePublished": "Tue, 13 Jun 2023 16:09:35 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:57:52.584280", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-13T16:09:35+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/05/23/07/cc940d8bba255e9a0fc72c4dae9574abY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg0OTA3ODA3-2.34653035.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Get the free Morning Headlines email for news from our reporters across the worldSign up to our free Morning Headlines email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticePeople across Britain are still struggling to meet their financial obligations as the cost of living crisis continues to eat into household budgets, with a recent Financial Conduct Authority study putting the total number of those up against it as high as 10 million.While inflation did finally drop down from 10.1 per cent to 8.7 per cent in May, the cost of goods in supermarket aisles and on high street shelves remains high as domestic finances continue to be stretched following a long winter of sky-high energy bills.The most recent Office for National Statistics (ONS) data shows food prices increasing at their fastest rate in almost 45 years for the year to April, with around 44 per cent of adults saying they have responded by spending less on the groceries and essentials, typically by opting for cheaper alternative brands, according to the ONS.Further to that, 50 per cent pf shoppers say they are buying fewer items altogether, 67 per cent say they have noticed an increase in their cost of living within the past month and 97 per cent say they have been impacted by rising grocery costs.Below, we look at what support is available to households this July.RecommendedDespite accelerating wage rises, Britons are getting poorerBanks should increase returns on savings amid interest rate rises, says top ToryAsda freezes prices on more than 500 products until end of AugustHomeowners warned to expect more mortgage pain after wage growth shoots upExtra \u00a31,350 of support being paid outDespite the expiration of Rishi Sunak\u2019s Energy Bill Support Scheme at the end of March (an initiative that handed out \u00a3400 in monthly instalments of \u00a366 and \u00a367), millions of households on low incomes will receive further cost of living support from the government this year worth up to \u00a31,350 in total.Eight million eligible means-tested benefits claimants, including people on universal credit, pension credit and tax credits, will receive \u00a3900 in instalments from this spring, with the money going directly to bank accounts in three tranches, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has said.There will also be a separate \u00a3150 payment for more than six million people with disabilities and an extra \u00a3300 for over eight million pensioners.Here are the payment windows that have been announced so far, with more precise dates expected later in the year:\u00a3301 \u2013 First cost of living payment \u2013 already issued between 25 April and 17 May (or 2 to 9 May for people on tax credits but no other

can expect in July \u2013 if last year\u2019s record-breaking heatwave is anything to go by \u2013 might not be comfortable for everyone but it will at least greatly reduce the need for having the central heating switched on, which proved such an expense over the course of the winter just gone.The government\u2019s Energy Price Guarantee (EPG) \u2013 introduced by Liz Truss last September to ensure households paid no more than \u00a32,500 for their electricity and gas, with the government subsidising the remainder owed to providers under Ofgem\u2019s Energy Price Cap (EPC) \u2013 was extended by chancellor Jeremy Hunt in his Budget of 15 March for a further three months.Mr Hunt had reportedly been tempted to increase the EPG to \u00a33,000, a considerably less generous offer that would have eased the burden on the state, but ultimately thought better of it, extending the guarantee into April, May and June.Now that the EPG has finally expired, consumers will once more be paying the EPC rate, although Ofgem has announced that will be \u00a32,074 from 1 July, a huge fall from the \u00a33,280 it was set at during the second quarter, from which households were shielded by the intervention of the government\u2019s overriding guarantee.That 17 per cent decrease reflects recent drops in wholesale energy prices \u2013 the amount energy firms pay for electricity and gas before supplying it to households \u2013and, although it is a significant drop from the eye-watering rates of the last two years, the figure remains more than \u00a31,000 a year above pre-pandemic levels.As for what might happen next, consultancy firm Cornwall Insight predicts that July\u2019s fall will be followed by another drop in October, when it expects the typical annual bill to be \u00a31,976.RecommendedBudget 2022: Hunt says UK in recession as he announces huge tax risesJeremy Hunt increases energy windfall tax in budgetJeremy Hunt freezes tax allowances and hits 45p rate payersUnfortunately, it believes the typical bill will then rise again in January 2024 to \u00a32,045 and Cornwall does not expect energy prices to return to pre-Covid levels before the end of the decade at the earliest.It has also warned customers that prices remain subject to wholesale market volatility, with the UK\u2019s reliance on energy imports meaning that geopolitical incidents like the war in Ukraine could continue to have a detrimental impact."}, {"_id": "6488a01051ac33a3962e176c", "url":

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeSinger Lee Ryan has successfully applied to withdraw his guilty plea for drunkenly assaulting a police officer during his arrest for abusing a black flight attendant.A hearing in January was told the singer, 39, was \u201cslurring his words and staggering around\u201d after drinking a bottle of port before a British Airways flight from Glasgow to London City Airport on July 31 last year.After being refused more alcohol on the plane and told to return to his seat, Ryan made comments about attendant Leah Gordon\u2019s looks, calling her a \u201cchocolate cookie\u201d, before grabbing her wrists.Police footage showed Ryan \u201csnarling\u201d and swearing after allegedly trying to bite a Pc Bryett as officers attempted to arrest him on his arrival at the airport.He was found guilty at Ealing Magistrates\u2019 Court in January of racially aggravated common assault by beating and behaving in an abusive way towards the cabin crew member, while pleading guilty to assaulting a police officer by biting him.But appearing at Westminster Magistrates\u2019 Court on Tuesday, Ryan was told it would be \u201cunjust\u201d for him not to be allowed to withdraw the guilty plea after he claimed he received bad advice from his solicitor Mike Rainford.Keima Payton, representing Ryan, earlier said her client has autistic spectrum disorder and \u201cslow processing skills\u201d, leading to \u201cimpairments in understanding what is said to him\u201d, according to a psychological report.She said text messages sent by Ryan on the day of the hearing showed he was made to feel like he \u201chad to\u201d plead guilty by Mr Rainford, \u201ceven though he (Pc Bryett) had me by the neck\u201d.\n\nIn these circumstances I am in real doubt as to whether it was an informed admission of guilt or a following of instructionsDeputy chief magistrate Tan IkramGiving evidence on Tuesday, Ryan said he initially chose not to plead guilty to assaulting a police officer at a hearing in November, when he admitted to being drunk on an aircraft, saying: \u201cI didn\u2019t do it. I didn\u2019t bite him. That\u2019s the reason why I pleaded not guilty.\u201dDescribing the moment he pleaded guilty at a second hearing in January, when a trial was due to start, he said: \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe the words coming out of my mouth.\u201cThere was no conviction. It wasn\u2019t true. I was being made to do it.\u201dRuling Ryan could withdraw the plea on Tuesday, deputy chief magistrate Tan Ikram said: \u201cThere is a feature of this case that makes it slightly different.\u201cMr Ryan was diagnosed with ADHD. He has subsequently been diagnosed with Asperger\u2019s.\u201cOne of the challenges that people with high-functioning autism can have is slow processing of information and responding inappropriately to what is said.\n\nIt would be unjust not to allow him to withdraw his guilty pleaDeputy chief magistrate Tan Ikram\u201cMr Ryan was advised. He received that advice as an instruction.\u201cIn these circumstances I am in real doubt as to whether it was an informed admission of guilt or a following of instructions.\u201cIt would be unjust not to allow him to withdraw his guilty plea.\u201dRyan entered a second not guilty plea at the hearing and elected to be put on trial.A decision on whether or not Ryan will face a trial will be made at a fresh hearing in July."}, {"_id": "6488a01151ac33a3962e176f", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/government-data-research-iain-wright-england-b2356776.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Data shows a majority of councils missed accounts deadline as reserves fall", "lead": "Two-thirds of councils had not published details of spending by the date set by the Government as concerns are raised over audits and transparency.", "author": "Jonathan Bunn", "datePublished": "Tue, 13 Jun 2023 15:43:05 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:57:53.440050", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-13T15:43:05+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/13/16/88087251a9878b5813038580d790c4fcY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg2NzU1NzY3-2.70401727.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeLess than a third of councils published draft accounts by this year\u2019s deadline amid concerns over town hall finances and audit delays undermining local democracy.Research shared with PA news agency shows 94 of 314 local authorities in England released accounts for 2022/23 by the required date of May 31, with a further 5% publishing by June 2.Of the 205 councils that had not published, 112 issued delayed publication notices, according to data provided by LG Improve.The most common reason cited was a problem with the auditing accounts for the previous financial year. The process of valuing of assets such as infrastructure and inadequate resources in finance departments were also referenced.While 19% of councils had their accounts for 2020-21 signed-off by auditors, 13% have not, leaving limited opportunity for public scrutiny of councils\u2019 spending and financial health.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveWoking recently become the latest council to issue a section 114 notice declaring effective bankruptcy after accruing a \u00a32 billion debt driven by risky borrowing.This has highlighted the potential consequences of widespread problems in audit processes and a lack of transparency.Woking and other councils that have recently said they are cannot meet their legal requirement to balance the books, such as Slough, Croydon and Thurrock, have not published audited accounts for at least the last two years.LG Improve warned that the perilous state of local government finances further emphasised the need for open accountability.\u201cAt a time when there are well reported issues of poor local government financial health, it is not a good situation that the majority of accounts are unavailable,\u201d it said.A recent report by the National Audit Office said cumulative delays to external audits meant that 632 opinions remained outstanding for all years as of November 30 last year.Councils have been required to appoint private firms to undertake their audits since 2018 following the abolition of the Audit Commission.But the changes have coincided with a significant decline in the number of councils able to publish accounts by the deadlines set by government.This has raised questions over both the viability of the audit market due to the level of fees offered and the complexity of work required to provide independent sign-off on accounts.LG Improve found most councils that had failed to publish on time this year said they would do so when \u201creasonably practicable\u201d, raising the prospect that detailed scrutiny will be delayed for some time.There was variation in the proportion of different types of councils that had published their accounts by June 2.Just a quarter of 32 local authorities in London had done so, compared to nearly half of county councils.Appearing before a committee of MPs earlier this month, experts warned that audit delays threatened to undermine public trust in local democracy and processes of accountability.Gareth Davies, controller and auditor general at the National Audit Office, said: \u201cIt is absolutely essential for timely, high quality accounts to explain how the money has been raised, how it is being used, and whether the authority is in a robust financial position.\u201dAlso appearing before the Levelling Up, Housing and Communities Committee, Iain Wright, a director at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, warned that problems with audits undermine vital transparency.\u201cCouncil tax payers want to know how their money is being spent and, ultimately, local authorities accounts are the best way of being able to distil that,\u201d he said.The LG Improve research also highlighted evidence that raises questions over the ability of many councils to weather an unexpected crisis at a time of rising demand and costs.Based on the 109 accounts available on June 2, cash reserves available to councils as a percentage of net revenue expenditure \u2013 a key indicator of resilience \u2013 fell by an average of 11% in 2022/23 compared to the previous year.This fall is reduced when temporary funding for business rates relief allocated to reserves is taken into account, but this money cannot be used on day-to-day spending.Across the board, 80% of councils saw some reduction in reserves but the size of the fall varied across different types of councils.County councils saw an average annual reduction of 1% in 2022/23 while districts experienced a 10% drop.Reserves available to district councils collectively still amounted to 173% of their net revenue expenditure, compared to an average of 59% for all councils.London councils, unitaries and metropolitan boroughs saw annual revenue reductions of between 13% and 18%.LG Improve said the data shows reserves falling \u201cmore rapidly and consistently\u201d in areas with higher levels of deprivation and demand for services.RecommendedBrides get \u2018hitched\u2019 thanks to police escort to wedding venueHeatwave threshold exceeded

for real concern about financial health.\u201dThe Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities has been approached for comment."}, {"_id": "6488a01151ac33a3962e1770", "url":

We must smash Labour at the next election.\u201cNothing less than absolute victory and total Brexit will do \u2013 and as the great Arnold Schwarzenegger said, I\u2019ll be back.\u201dThe message echoed Mr Johnson\u2019s sign-off during his final appearance at Prime Minister\u2019s Questions last year, when he told MPs: \u201cHasta la vista, baby\u201d \u2013 the catchphrase of Schwarzenegger\u2019s cyborg character in the 1991 movie Terminator 2: Judgment Day.That reference similarly left the door open for a possible comeback, but the former Uxbridge and South Ruislip MP remained on the back benches until quitting the Commons on Friday.Meanwhile, Sir Keir Starmer warned that Tory infighting between the two erstwhile allies is damaging the UK\u2019s reputation internationally and putting off investors.The Labour leader said the three by-elections triggered by Ms Dorries, Mr Johnson and Nigel Adams were effectively \u201cpolitical tantrums\u201d.RecommendedTwo officers served with gross misconduct notices over Ely e-bike crashPolice keeping an \u2018open mind\u2019 over motive for deadly knife and van attackBBC boss: Eight equal pay cases currently open is an \u2018achievement\u2019Beyond the potential neglect of UK-wide issues like the cost of living, focus on the turmoil could also have more far-ranging implications, he suggested.Speaking to business chiefs at London Tech Week, he said: \u201cThere\u2019s a deeper price because there\u2019s a reputation hit to the UK.

Mr Keith said that \u201cvery little thought\u201d was given to the impact lockdowns could have on the country.The inquiry heard from bereaved families in a series of moving video interviews, which included harrowing stories of people dying alone from Covid. Lady Hallett vowed that those who suffered in the pandemic will \u201calways be at the heart of the inquiry\u201d.Evidence is likely to show a lack of responsibility in government, and a state of \u201cchaos\u201d which resulted in a slow reaction to a pandemic where \u201clost time is measured in lost lives\u201d, the inquiry has been told by representatives of the bereaved.Pete Weatherby KC, of Covid Bereaved Families for Justice UK, said there had been \u201clittle or no ministerial leadership, and the chaos of committees, which led to poor planning and ultimately a reactive rather than proactive response to the virus\u201d.The first module \u2013 investigating the country\u2019s preparedness for the crisis \u2013 will include evidence on \u201cany impact arising from the UK\u2019s departure from the European Union\u201d.The inquiry team will also scrutinise the vaccine programme under module four, examining whether Britain\u2019s vaccines response was more effective as a result of the UK being outside the\u00a0EU.Mr Johnson and Tory ministers have argued that Brexit allowed the UK to chart its own course with the vaccines, both when it came to licensing and also when buying up doses.While the UK\u2019s vaccine rollout was faster than that of the EU, Kate Bingham, the former head of the government\u2019s taskforce, said that the speedy approval had \u201cnothing to do with Brexit\u201d.RecommendedWatch live: Covid inquiry hears evidence on first day of investigationFormer PM\u00a0David Cameron\u00a0and former chancellor George Osborne are expected to appear at an inquiry hearing next week.

You can replicate it anywhere.\u201dCentrepoint aims to build 300 properties in total in London and Manchester in the coming years to help young people escape from homelessness and allow their circumstances and careers to develop so they can move on to the next stage of their lives.When William stood by a young sapling in a pot, which symbolised the launch, he told the guests the project was \u201cinspirational\u201d.He added: \u201cIt starts to show everyone how we really can prevent homelessness and it\u2019s a really amazing solution, practical solution, tangible solution, to how to help young people get back on their feet, to help themselves get back towards their new life.\u201dEarlier, in one of the flats, William chatted to a group of young people living in the block and spoke to Ruffine, a 21-year-old working in digital marketing and originally from Coventry, who was living temporarily with friends before securing a property.She said afterwards: \u201cIt\u2019s a good space, your own little space for a single person, and a nice place to start your life and build a foundation.\u201dSeyi Obakin, Centrepoint\u2019s chief executive officer, hosted the royal visit and said afterwards he believed what was unique about the project was, no other organisation had built a similar development run on the same rental structure.He described the project as a \u201c\u2026stepping stone accommodation \u2013 a bridge between supportive housing and the private rental sector \u2013 this is a bridge that currently doesn\u2019t exist\u201d.Mr Obakin added: \u201cI think this is a big piece of the jigsaw to help solve homelessness \u2013 the flats are self-contained, the young people absolutely love being here, and it gives them a big platform to help build their own careers.\u201cYet nationally we actually don\u2019t have the policy framework that enables this kind of thing to be built.\u201dRecommendedHeatwave threshold exceeded across the UKPortrait of John Lennon by ex-Beatle Stuart Sutcliffe up for auctionPolice keeping an \u2018open mind\u2019 over motive for deadly knife and van attackThe chief executive explained annual utilities were only about \u00a3200 for the young residents, who must be working or in an apprenticeship, and the small size of the homes were easier for them to look after.He said: \u201cA 19-year-old apprentice, who only gets paid the apprenticeship wage, would earn about \u00a38,500 a year.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeNeighbours had raised concerns for months before a nine-year-old boy was killed by his mother and her partner, who have been convicted over his death, with a safeguarding review now under way.Alfie Steele had 50 injuries all over his body and was found submerged in a bath in Droitwich, Worcestershire.Carla Scott, 35, has been found guilty at Coventry Crown Court of his manslaughter and 41-year-old Dirk Howell found guilty of his murder on February 18 2021.In a 999 call made six months before he was killed, a neighbour told police: \u201cIt sounds like my neighbours are doing something bad to their kid in the bath.\u201cLike they are really hurting them.\u201cIt sounds like someone thrashing around in the bathtub.\u201cIt sounds like you can hear he\u2019s being hit and held under the water or something \u2026 and like loads of thrashing around.\u201cIt\u2019s concerning because I know they have got social services involvement as well and the police have been before a few times.\u201dThe call was played to jurors, along with further audio of an emergency call in 2020 in which a concerned resident told the operator \u201csomething strange is going on\u201d.In another call, it was reported that a family known to police had \u201cgot a young lad outside\u201d and \u201chad him in the garden standing like a statue\u201d.Another piece of evidence put before the jury was a video filmed by a neighbour in August 2019, recording Alfie\u2019s voice as he pleaded to be allowed back into his home for around 25 minutes.Despite a social services plan barring Howell from staying overnight at her home to protect Alfie, Scott frequently flouted this rule and allowed Howell to stay over regularly, the CPS said.Neighbours also witnessed Howell aggressively shouting and swearing at Alfie in the street while Scott stood by and let it happen.Prosecutors said that\u00a0Alfie was repeatedly assaulted, beaten and put in a cold bath as part of a cruel and \u201csinister\u201d regime of correction by Scott and Howell.A multi-agency review is now under way into the safeguarding of\u00a0Alfie.Stephen Eccleston, independent chair of Worcestershire Safeguarding Children Partnership, said: \u201cMembers of the Worcestershire Safeguarding Children Partnership are shocked and saddened by the death of Alfie.\u201cOn behalf of the partnership I would like to take this opportunity to pass on our condolences to Alfie\u2019s family.\u201cFollowing his death, we began a process of conducting a local Child Safeguarding Practice Review.\u201cWith the completion of the trial, we will now be asking the independent reviewer to complete the review.\u201cThe report is due to be published later this year and we will consider further comment at that time.\u201dJurors took 10 hours and 13 minutes to convict Scott and Howell over the killing.\n\nThe suffering that Alfie Steele endured in the months before he died is heart-breaking; a cruel \u2018punishment\u2019 regime inflicted by Dirk Howell and Alfie\u2019s mother Carla Scott which culminated in his tragic deathNSPCCScott was found guilty of manslaughter by a majority of 11-1, and cleared of his murder, with jurors returning their verdicts on Tuesday.Howell was found guilty of\u00a0murder by unanimous verdict.Scott was also found guilty of four counts of child cruelty, while Howell had previously admitted child cruelty.Opening the case last month, prosecutor Michelle Heeley KC said that the pair thought it was acceptable to hit\u00a0Alfie\u00a0with \u201cbelts, or a slider, like a heavy-duty flip flop, and use other more sinister forms of punishment\u201d.The six-week trial was told Scott and career criminal Howell tried to cover up the killing by delaying calling 999 after\u00a0Alfie\u00a0was either drowned, asphyxiated or went into cardiac arrest.The court heard\u00a0Alfie, who was found lifeless with a body temperature of 23C, may have been put back in a warm bath as the couple tried to pass off the murder as an accidental drowning.Scott, of Vashon Drive, Droitwich, and Howell, of Princip Street, Birmingham, had denied the charges against them.The judge, Mr Justice Wall, remanded both defendants into custody to be sentenced at 11am on Thursday.An NSPCC spokesperson said: \u201cThe suffering that Alfie Steele endured in the months before he died is heart-breaking; a cruel \u2018punishment\u2019 regime inflicted by Dirk Howell and Alfie\u2019s mother Carla Scott which culminated in his tragic death.\u201cIt\u2019s vital that a thorough review into the circumstances around Alfie\u2019s death establishes whether more could have been done by professionals to protect this little boy.\u201cThis is so important because such findings can help prevent future tragedies.\u201d"}, {"_id": "6488a01451ac33a3962e177b", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/nottingham-incident-today-roads-closed-b2356440.html", "primaryCategory": "Home News", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Nottingham major incident \u2013 latest: Counter-terror police called in as force \u2018keeping open mind\u2019 on killings", "lead": "<p>Three people were found dead on streets around the city centre in the early hours of the morning </p>", "author": "Tara Cobham,Holly Evans and Maryam Zakir-Hussain", "datePublished": "Tue, 13 Jun 2023 14:38:01 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:57:56.998328", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-13T14:38:01+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/13/09/SEI160062200.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "\u2715ClosePolice prepare to raid Nottingham property following 'major incident'Get the free Morning Headlines email for news from our reporters across the worldSign up to our free Morning Headlines email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

He used to be a drug dealer.\u201dThe defendant drew a stickman wearing a cast on one leg before confirming that his father hit and broke his leg.The incident caused him to feel a \u201cbrewing\u201d inside of him which he could not further explain, the court heard.De Zoysa went on to say he hit his father on the head using a metal rod in an apparent separate incident and did it out of \u201cpanic\u201d \u2013 a feeling which he said was \u201cpossibly\u201d caused by his autism.He was arrested for \u201cfighting\u201d his father in June 2019.Jurors watched police body-worn video of De Zoysa\u2019s 2019 arrest in which an officer could be heard saying: \u201cHe\u2019s kicked his father off his bike.\u201dAsked about the incident, De Zoysa said his dad was upsetting him and talking \u201ctoo loud\u201d.The jury heard more about the defendant\u2019s home life including an inference that he liked eating dinner alone because there was \u201cviolence\u201d at the dinner table with his \u201cfamily\u201d which was \u201ccrazy\u201d.He confirmed that he broke the stairs in his family home and set a carpet on fire because he was \u201cupset\u201d.The court also heard he smoked cannabis because of \u201cstress\u201d which helped him feel \u201cmellow\u201d.Jurors were told De Zoysa was bullied at school, the defendant explaining that his peers threw chains at him because he was \u201cvulnerable\u201d and an \u201ceasy target\u201d.But he received three A\u2019s at A-Level for Chemistry, Physics and Maths and attended University College London \u2013 although he did not finish his degree.He worked in coding at HMRC and told the jury he got on well with his colleagues.The defendant had been arrested on London Road, Norbury, south London, during the early hours of September 25 2020, after a stop and search by officers found he had cannabis and seven rounds of ammunition.Officers did not know De Zoysa, of Banstead, Surrey, had a gun until it was used to shoot Sgt Ratana.Jurors have been told they will have to consider whether De Zoysa deliberately fired the revolver and the question of diminished responsibility.Mr Khan previously told the jury that the defendant was suffering an autistic meltdown at the time of the shooting.The trial continues."}, {"_id": "6488a01651ac33a3962e1780", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/first-minister-michelle-thomson-snp-europe-police-scotland-b2356671.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Sturgeon is Europe\u2019s \u2018most impressive\u2019 politician despite her arrest \u2013 Yousaf", "lead": "The First Minister spoke about his predecessor less than 48 hours after she was arrested by police.", "author": "Pa Scotland Political Reporters", "datePublished": "Tue, 13 Jun 2023 14:20:46 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:57:58.179073", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-13T14:20:46+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/13/14/aa9291305fa9ac581842b9dbf6aa591bY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg2NzQ5NTYy-2.71544566.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

She was released, of course, without charge.\u201dThe First Minister also said he would call for a \u201cunified voice\u201d among the party over the decision not to suspend the whip from his predecessor.Speaking about his predecessor, who spent more than eight years in the top job in Scottish politics,\u00a0he said: \u201cNicola Sturgeon is the most impressive politician I think we have seen in Europe, she is an asset to our movement,\u00a0and to our party.\u201cIt\u2019s obviously a difficult time, it\u2019s a very very difficult time for her and a difficult time for our party and personally painful to many of us.\u201dMr Yousaf, who held a meeting with SNP MSPs in Holyrood on Tuesday told journalists he \u201cdid not read the riot act\u201d to those who disagreed, adding: \u201cI was listening, I was engaged as any good leader would do. I had a really constructive conversation with the SNP group.\u201dSNP depute leader Keith Brown backed Mr Yousaf\u2019s decision to allow Ms Sturgeon to remain in the party and said the SNP group had shown \u201cvery strong support\u201d following her arrest.The group also decided they will send flowers to the former first minister as a show of support.Mr\u00a0Brown added that other cases, where the party\u2019s elected representatives had been suspended while allegations around them were being investigated, involved \u201cdifferent circumstances\u201d.Mr Brown told BBC Radio Scotland: \u201cI think it\u2019s in the interest of natural justice, which is the principle which Humza, the First Minister, is following.\u201dSNP MSP Michelle Thomson was among those calling for Ms Sturgeon to resign from the whip while the investigation was ongoing.Ms Thomson argued that she herself had needed to resign the whip while an MP in 2015, despite not being \u201cpersonally under investigation\u201d and \u201ccertainly not arrested\u201d.However, Mr Brown claimed that Ms Thomson had taken\u00a0the decision to remove herself from the SNP group at Westminster.\u201cThere are different circumstances in each of these situations,\u201d\u00a0 he said.\u201cI accept that, and that\u2019s bound to be the case, but in relation to the current case, Nicola\u00a0Sturgeon has not been charged \u2013 she has not been accused, in fact, of anything.\u201cThe arrest I appreciate is a dramatic thing to have happened.\u201cIt\u2019s perhaps not as well understood that arrest is just a way of making sure that the interview and information gathering by the police is put into formal footing.The SNP depute leader said Ms Sturgeon had given a \u201cstrong defence\u201d of her own innocence and added he was not aware of any complaints being made to the party\u2019s member conduct committee.However, the\u00a0Scottish Conservatives said some of Mr Brown\u2019s claims were \u201cabsurd\u201d.Deputy leader Meghan Gallacher said: \u201cKeith Brown\u2019s desperate spinning in defence of Humza Yousaf will only pour petrol on the bitter civil war between SNP MSPs and MPs over Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s preferential treatment.\u201cHis claim that Michelle Thomson had voluntarily given up the SNP whip when she was under investigation amounts to gaslighting, as she has said very clearly she had the whip removed from her by Nicola Sturgeon.\u201dRecommendedPolice keeping an \u2018open mind\u2019 over motive for deadly knife and van attackBBC boss: Eight equal pay cases currently open is an \u2018achievement\u2019Johnson \u2018was updated on resignation honours list by Cabinet Office before June\u2019She added: \u201cNo amount of spin can disguise the fact that Humza Yousaf is so compromised by his closeness to Nicola Sturgeon that he is having to move the goalposts on internal discipline.\u201dFormer SNP\u00a0leadership contender Ash Regan, and MP Angus MacNeil, both of whom were critics of Ms Sturgeon,\u00a0are also amongst those who have suggested that she should be suspended."}, {"_id": "6488a01651ac33a3962e1781", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/cardiff-crash-riot-ely-police-b2356665.html", "primaryCategory": "Home News", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Gross misconduct probe for police who followed boys killed in Cardiff crash that sparked riot", "lead": "<p>Kyrees Sullivan, 16, and Harvey Evans, 15,\u00a0died last month, shortly after they were captured on CCTV being followed by a police van in Ely  </p>", "author": "Martha McHardy", "datePublished": "Tue, 13 Jun 2023 14:14:31 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:57:58.411174", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-13T14:14:31+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/05/24/17/Kyrees%20Sullivan%20Harvey%20Evans.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Get the free Morning Headlines email for news from our reporters across the worldSign up to our free Morning Headlines email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeJunior doctors in Scotland have voted to reject the Scottish Government\u2019s \u201cfinal\u201d pay offer, increasing the threat of strikes.BMA Scotland announced on Tuesday that 71.1% of those who voted on a 66.3% turnout rejected the deal \u2013 with strike dates now set for July 12 to July 15.The Scottish Government offered a 14.5% pay increase over two years last month and has now called for an urgent meeting between Health Secretary Michael Matheson and the junior doctors.In offering the deal last month, Mr Matheson said it would represent a more than \u00a360 million investment, describing it as a \u201cfinal offer\u201d.According to the union, 2,311 junior doctors voted to reject the deal, compared to just 939 who backed it.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveDr Chris Smith, chairman of the BMA\u2019s Scottish junior doctor committee, said: \u201cOur membership has once again spoken decisively and clearly.\u201cIt is beyond doubt that they do not consider this offer sufficient to begin the process of addressing the pay erosion we have suffered since 2008 \u2013 when pay for a junior doctor was some 28.5% higher.\u201cThat is why today we can confirm that we are now forced to act on the incredibly strong mandate given to us by members in our preceding strike ballot and announce a full withdrawal of labour for three days from Wednesday July 12.\u201dDr Smith said the action was being taken reluctantly and the gap between the announcement and the walkouts would provide the health service with enough time to put a plan in place to deal with disruption, and for the Government to improve its offer.Junior doctors, he said, are asking for a \u201cviable path to righting the historical wrong of pay erosion\u201d, which amounts to 26.5% in real terms in the past 15 years under the recent offer, claiming the NHS \u201csimply won\u2019t be here\u201d in the future without investment in staff pay now.\u201cTo show that they recognise this and the importance of investing in the medical workforce, the Scottish Government must take the steps needed to secure, retain and appropriately value Scotland\u2019s junior doctors,\u201d Dr Smith added.\u201cWe cannot go on losing doctors to countries where they feel more valued and are paid fairly.\u201cOur NHS simply won\u2019t be here for the people of Scotland in the long term if there is not action and investment now.\u201cThat is why our message to the Scottish Government today is stark. Come back with an improved offer and we can still avert the need for strikes, and the disruption they will cause us all, and patients in particular.\u201cThe ball is now firmly back in the Government\u2019s court and I hope they respond urgently and positively.\u201dThe Health Secretary said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d with the rejection, adding that strikes are \u201cin no one\u2019s interest\u201d.\u201cI respect the outcome of the ballot. We negotiated in good faith, addressing concerns from junior doctors but this was only the start of the journey, not the end,\u201d Mr Matheson said.\u201cThis was the biggest investment in junior doctor pay for the last 20 years and a step forward to modernising pay bargaining, restoring confidence amongst junior doctors and ensuring that their contribution to our healthcare system is appropriately recognised.\u201cMy door remains open, and I will meet with BMA Scotland later this week to discuss how we move forward.\u201dScottish Tory health spokesman, Dr Sandesh Gulhane, said junior doctors were \u201cat their wits\u2019 end\u201d, adding: \u201cMichael Matheson has a duty to urgently address the poor conditions junior doctors are facing, such as guaranteeing they will get hot, nutritious meals at night and that rotas will be done six weeks in advance.\u201cThe onus is on the SNP Government to get back round the table and find a solution to this dispute and deliver the modern, efficient and local health service that patients and staff need in Scotland.\u201dScottish Labour deputy leader Jackie Baillie urged the Health Secretary to restart negotiations.RecommendedBBC boss: Eight equal pay cases currently open is an \u2018achievement\u2019Johnson \u2018was updated on resignation honours list by Cabinet Office before June\u2019Sturgeon is Europe\u2019s \u2018most impressive\u2019 politician despite her arrest \u2013 Yousaf\u201cThe responsibility for this strike lies solely with Michael Matheson,\u201d she said.\u201cToday, I am urging Michael Matheson to get around the table with the BMA and act to avert this strike by providing fair pay and conditions for junior doctors.\u201d"}, {"_id": "6488a01751ac33a3962e1786", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/nadine-dorries-boris-johnson-rishi-sunak-prime-minister-chief-whip-b2356243.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Dorries says she was \u2018bullied\u2019 by No 10 and accuses Sunak of blocking peerage - old", "lead": "The former culture secretary and Boris Johnson loyalist denied \u2018knifing the party\u2019 by triggering a by-election in her Mid Bedfordshire seat.", "author": "Nina Lloyd", "datePublished": "Tue, 13 Jun 2023 13:44:42 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:57:59.625035", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-13T13:44:42+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/12/22/230b0548d3a68fad81f0c36783ffcc26Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg2NjkxODE3-2.62440664.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up for the View from Westminster email for expert analysis straight to your inboxGet our free View from Westminster email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

It\u2019s important that we constantly evolve, and some people will leave and we give opportunities to new people, and the BBC has always done that.\u201dShe added: \u201cThe competition is such at the moment that there\u2019s huge competition out there and a lot of people choose to leave for very good commercial reasons, and I wish them well, but we therefore have to move the schedules and evolve the schedules and that\u2019s something editorially we do all the time and have always done.\u201dMr Davie admitted he did not want Ken Bruce to leave BBC Radio 2, where he had presented his mid-morning show for 31 years, but feels Vernon Kay is an \u201coutstanding broadcaster\u201d to replace him.Asked if the BBC was not catering to a diverse audience, he added: \u201cYou have to look after your loyal audience, the BBC has to do that and it\u2019s critical.\u201cIf you look at our employee record but also our playlists, there will always be people who have issues with our playlists, different artists, different ages. I\u2019ve got plenty of up-and-coming young talent who would love to be on the radio on playlist, and there\u2019ll be 80s artists that will be annoyed that they\u2019re not getting the playlist.

It was repeated stabbing \u2013 four or five times. The lad collapsed in the middle of the road.\u201cThe girl stumbled towards a house and didn\u2019t move. The next minute she had disappeared down the side of a house, and that\u2019s where they found her.\u201cI\u2019d say it all happened within five or six minutes. The attacker then just walked off up Ilkeston Road towards town, as calm as anything.\u201dThe man said he called the police, who arrived within five minutes, before paramedics tried for 40 minutes to revive the pair.Police activity continued in various locations along Ilkeston Road on Tuesday, with parts of the street cordoned off and armed officers deployed, some of whom came from Derbyshire Police and South Yorkshire Police.Two women were taken away from one commercial property in a police van shortly before 1pm.A terraced property was also under police guard, with staff at a neighbouring hairdresser saying it had been raided last year.Witnesses in Bentinck Road described the suspect struggling as officers dragged him out of a white van.Student Demi Ojolow, who lives in the road, said: \u201cI just saw the police shouting at him to get out of the car and get on the floor.\u201cAnd they dragged him out of the car and he just fell on the floor. He was still pretty wrestling at the point.\u201cThey dragged him away and that was about it.\u201dMs Ojolow said police were pointing some kind of weapons at the man but she was not sure whether it was a Taser or firearm.Damage could be seen to the bonnet and windscreen of the van which was left at the scene.Another Bentinck Road resident, Dimitrious Lawani, arrived at the scene just as the man was being pulled out of the van.He said: \u201cThere\u2019s two of them pulling him and two behind pointing at him \u2013 I think those were Tasers.\u201dThe witness said they shouted: \u201cGet down, get out, stop fighting.\u201dMr Lawani said: \u201cHe was being quite resistive \u2013 very resistive from what I could tell \u2013 and he was also making a lot of noise, but I couldn\u2019t really distinguish what he was saying.\u201dRoad closures have been put in place covering a wide area of Nottingham city centre, including Ilkeston Road, Milton Street, Maples Street and Woodborough Road, from the junction with Magdala Road into the city, Magdala Road and Maid Marian Way at the junction of Parliament Street.The tram network was also disrupted with all services suspended on the Nottingham Express Transit (NET) as the police investigation continued.Nottinghamshire Chief Constable Kate Meynell said: \u201cThis is a horrific and tragic incident which has claimed the lives of three people.\u201cWe believe these three incidents are all linked and we have a man in custody.\u201cThis investigation is at its early stages and a team of detectives is working to establish exactly what has happened.\u201cWe ask the public to be patient while inquiries continue.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeEditor-in-chief of British Vogue, Edward Enninful, has revealed the challenges he faced while coming to terms with his sexuality as a young man from a religious background.Writing exclusively for The Independent during Pride month, the Ghanaian-born British former model turned stylist and journalist, has described the years in which he began to embrace his identity as a gay man. Enninful, 51, has been responsible for shifting British Vogue\u2019s creative and editorial output towards representing people across the spectrum of LGBT+, disability and race. In turn, the media mogul has been credited for influencing representation in the fashion industry as a whole.He has announced he is stepping down to take up a new position as editorial advisor to British Vogue and global creator and cultural adviser to Vogue.Enninful recalls the first time he ever encountered someone who was \u201copenly\u201d gay, when he was aged 16, in 1980s London but laments that he feared the prospect of ever coming out himself.RecommendedBritish Vogue\u2019s Edward Enninful: How I learnt to overcome fear when I came outThe Independent Pride List 2023: The LGBT+ people making change happenBritish Vogue editor-in-chief Edward Enninful steps down to take on new role\u201cI was 16 when I encountered the first person I\u2019d ever met who actually called themselves gay,\u201d he writes. \u201cI was a sheltered Ghanaian immigrant \u2013 a good, Christian schoolboy who kept his head down, worked hard and always had his father\u2019s words thundering in his ears: \u2018If any of those gays come into this house it will be over my dead body.\u2019\u201dHe observes that fashion changed not only his career prospects but allowed him to express himself in a way he never thought would be possible.\u201cSuddenly, I was a teenager in London and meeting gay and trans people everywhere; photoshoots, parties, gigs, clubs,\u201d he says. \u201cBut did I feel pride? It was probably more complicated than that.\u201dEnninful writes that he was \u201cpetrified\u201d of coming out as gay, especially given his religious upbringing, and feared \u201cenernal damnation\u201d if he revealed his sexuality.\u201cThe fire and brimstone that would rage in church seemed so real that I genuinely thought I was going to hell and that a life \u2013 and afterlife \u2013 of eternal damnation awaited me. This is the way for a lot of young LGBT+ people still today, especially in religious communities. The feelings are terrifying and real seeming.\u201dAt the age of 21, Enninful told his mother he was gay, and was thankful for her reaction. Eventually, he writes, his father \u201ccame around\u201d to the idea of him being gay.\u201cI was extremely fortunate to have the mother I had,\u201d he writes. \u201cShe loved me - I knew that always - and when I eventually told her I was gay at the grand old age of 21, having returned to London after a romantic epiphany on a New York dance floor, there was no question of me being exiled by the family,\u201d he writes.But in London in the Eighties and Nineties, he says, others were not as \u201clucky\u201d as he was.\u201cI saw friends and relations in my community thrown out of their family homes. Meanwhile, the infamous AIDS adverts, with their looming tombstones and terrifying iceberg visuals, were everywhere. Gay London \u2013 gay life \u2013 felt like it teetered on a knife\u2019s edge.\u201d\u200bThroughout and beyond Pride month, British Vogue, under Enninful\u2019s leadership, will represent different LGBT+ stories, including pop star Janelle Monae, British-Australian actor Miriam Margoyles and The Last Of Us actor Bella Ramsey, exclusively revealed here by The Independent.Throughout Pride month, British Vogue will represent different LGBT+ stories, including Janelle Monae, British-Australian actor Miriam Margoyles, and Rina Sawayama.

Today, those efforts must be acknowledged and appreciated in what is truly a landmark development.\u201dMr Mackin paid tribute to Mr Clarke as a \u201clarger-than-life character who had unrivalled generosity and charisma\u201d.\u201cThis apology is a testament to that character and tenacity, in demonstrating that where there is a will, there is always a way,\u201d he added.\n\nToday proves nobody is above the lawDarragh Mackin, Phoenix LawHowever, he urged that the Government and Ministry of Defence also issue an apology.\u201cToday proves nobody is above the law,\u201d he said.Meanwhile, former Hooded Men Liam Shannon and Jim Auld described the apology from the police as \u201ctoo little, too late\u201d.In a statement they also called for an apology from Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and the UK Government.\u201cThis apology in some ways is too little, too late. It ought to have been delivered long before now and is only coming on the back of latest legal challenges against the police over their failure to investigate the criminality of the State,\u201d they said.\u201cWe see this as another step on the road to vindication.\u201cWe now call upon the PSNI to remove their objection to our judicial review challenge listed in a few weeks\u2019 time.\n\nWe also now call upon the State to withdraw its insensitive attempt to stop our rightful claims for proper compensation for the horrendous treatment suffered by usFormer Hooded Men Liam Shannon and Jim Auld\u201cWe also now call upon the State to withdraw its insensitive attempt to stop our rightful claims for proper compensation for the horrendous treatment suffered by us.\u201cThis apology must be seen in its proper context. It will only have any real effect if it will be replicated in all outstanding legal cases and leads to the Government apologising as well. Otherwise it looks like the Government passing the buck and seen as hollow.\u201dIn a statement the PSNI expressed sympathy to the family of Mr Clarke.Detective Chief Superintendent Ian Saunders, head of\u00a0the Legacy Investigation & Disclosure Branch, said the police have written to a number of individuals and next of kin of deceased Hooded Men.\u201cIn this letter, we have acknowledged the findings of the United Kingdom Supreme Court that, by today\u2019s standards, the treatment of these men at that time would likely be characterised as torture,\u201d he said.RecommendedUK firms operating in Russia \u2018complicit in war crimes\u2019 against Ukraine, says MPState agencies accused of \u2018deliberately delaying\u2019 information release over deathWitnesses describe screams as two victims stabbed in deadly Nottingham attacks\u201cThe Police Service of Northern Ireland has formally apologised for the actions and omissions of police officers involved in their treatment whilst in police custody in 1971.\u201cThe Police Service recognise the significant step taken today in issuing this apology.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe UK Covid-19 Inquiry opened its first public hearing on 13 June in London, beginning a three-year investigation into the British government\u2019s response to the coronavirus pandemic.The inquiry will seek to understand the decision-making that led to the imposition of strict lockdown measures on the public, how our evolving understanding of the virus guided policy, what the government got right and what mistakes were made, with a view to being better prepared for future pandemics and public health emergencies.When then-prime minister Boris Johnson announced the first \u201cstay at home\u201d order on 23 March 2020, British citizens came together in a rare moment of national unity, for the most part, diligently adhering to social restrictions introduced to help stop the spread of the contagious respiratory disease.That meant living in isolation from friends, family and colleagues, working from home, wearing face masks and standing apart in public and, in many cases, battling Covid symptoms in hospital or in quarantine amid an atmosphere of intense loneliness and anxiety.But the legacy of that brave response has been tarnished in the intervening years by the \u201cPartygate\u201d scandal that subsequently engulfed Mr Johnson\u2019s government, which has left many, particularly those grieving lost loved ones, feeling betrayed, embittered and in search of answers.RecommendedWatch live: Covid inquiry hears evidence on first day of investigationUK may \u2018not have been well prepared at all\u2019 for pandemic, Covid inquiry hearsCovid inquiry will be the thorough investigation the UK deserves, chair vowsBereaved families hold pictures of loved ones in vigil outside Covid inquiryCovid inquiry to look at Brexit impact on pandemicBy pouring over hundreds of documents, scrutinising the details and hearing testimony on all aspects of the UK\u2019s response to a global disaster that claimed more than 227,000 British lives, the inquiry hopes to draw clear conclusions and perhaps provide a degree of closure for those traumatised or in mourning.Here is everything you need to know about its upcoming hearings.Who is chairing the inquiry?Mr Johnson first announced the inquiry in May 2021. It was established and is being paid for by the government but is being run by an independent chair.That is Baroness Heather Hallett, a retired Court of Appeal judge and crossbench peer, who led the inquests into the Islamist terror attacks on London on 7 July 2005.She will oversee the process, from the hearings to the publication of final reports and has the power to order the production of documents and call witnesses to give evidence under oath.But Baroness Hallett has already run into trouble by demanding Mr Johnson and members of his former Cabinet hand over their private WhatsApp messages from 2020 to the inquiry, which has been resisted by the PM\u2019s successor, Rishi Sunak, and sparked an awkward legal battle.UK Covid-19 Inquiry chair Baroness Heather Hallett (UK Covid-19 Inquiry/PA)The Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group, which has almost 7,000 members, has also complained of feeling marginalised by Baroness Hallett after putting forward a list of 20 people it wanted to appear as witnesses, none of whom have been called so far.However, a spokeswoman for the inquiry said the chair \u201chas been clear she hasn\u2019t ruled out calling testimony from bereaved people in later investigations, for example with the use of do not resuscitate orders\u201d.The group\u2019s members congregated outside the inquiry\u2019s first public hearing on Tuesday to hold aloft pictures of lost loved ones and make their feelings abundantly clear.What format will the inquiry take?The hearings are taking place at the UK Covid-19 Inquiry Hearing Centre at Dorland House in west London and they are open to the public. You can find out more about reserving seats via the inquiry\u2019s official website.Tuesday\u2019s session began with an opening statement from Baroness Hallett vowing that those who suffered will \u201calways be at the heart of the inquiry\u201d. It was followed by a 17-minute film presenting bereaved families telling their stories of the pandemic, which was billed beforehand as \u201cdifficult to watch\u201d.The process is being divided into \u201cmodules\u201d, each of which will last approximately six weeks and be devoted to a different aspect of the UK\u2019s Covid experience in loosely chronological order.The National Covid Memorial Wall in London (Yui Mok/PA)The first is on Britain\u2019s preparedness for the pandemic while the second concerns government decision-making as the outbreak took hold and is subdivided into additional chapters looking at how the response in England compared to the decisions taken by the devolved governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.The third module will look at the impact the crisis had on the NHS and how prepared the UK\u2019s health sector was to tackle its onset and the fourth at the handling of the vaccine rollout from December 2020 onwards.Further modules, about which more details are expected closer to the time, are set to address other important aspects of the pandemic. This includes the impact on the care sector, the government\u2019s approach to awarding contracts for the production of personal protective equipment, how the state approached its responsibilities to the economy and how Covid\u2019s impact on communities was dictated by pre-existing social inequalities.What questions will it attempt to answer?Among the key lines of inquiry the hearings are expected to pursue are: how might Britain better protect its citizens when the next pandemic rolls around, did the UK\u2019s social restrictions become too complex and confusing and what more should have been done to support children who missed out on months of schooling and other crucial opportunities because of quarantine rules?It might also tackle questions such as how lockdowns can be avoided in the future and how staffing shortages within the NHS can be addressed.Who will give evidence?No full list of witnesses has been published so far, although senior government ministers and officials are widely expected to give evidence under oath.The likes of Sir Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK government\u2019s chief medical adviser and chief scientific adviser respectively during the pandemic, are likely to appear.Meanwhile, members of the public are being encouraged to share their own experiences of Covid as part of the inquiry\u2019s Every Story Matters project.How can I follow the inquiry\u2019s progress?RecommendedRishi Sunak to meet King Charles as Truss defends her record - liveJohnson was \u2018begging people for votes\u2019 in a \u2018demeaning\u2019 way, says IDSWelcome, PM Sunak \u2013 the last best option to take over from TrussThe Independent will be bringing you all the latest breaking news lines and analysis\u00a0from the\u00a0UK Covid-19 Inquiry.

It is understood that he has a mental health history.Unverified footage showed a man being detained outside a convenience store in Bentinck Road at around 5.30am on Tuesday.Student Demi Ojolow, who lives in the road, said: \u201cI just saw the police shouting at him to get out of the car and get on the floor.\u201cAnd they dragged him out of the car and he just fell on the floor. He was still pretty wrestling at the point.\u201cThey dragged him away and that was about it.\u201dMs Ojolow said police were pointing some kind of weapons at the man but she was not sure whether it was a Taser or firearm.Damage could be seen to the bonnet and windscreen of the van which was left at the scene.Road closures have been put in place covering a wide area of Nottingham city centre, including Ilkeston Road, Milton Street, Maples Street and Woodborough Road, from the junction with Magdala Road into the city, Magdala Road and Maid Marian Way at the junction of Parliament Street.The tram network was also disrupted with all services suspended on the Nottingham Express Transit (NET) as the police investigation continued.Nottinghamshire Chief Constable Kate Meynell said: \u201cThis is a horrific and tragic incident which has claimed the lives of three people.\u201cWe believe these three incidents are all linked and we have a man in custody.\u201cThis investigation is at its early stages and a team of detectives is working to establish exactly what has happened.\u201cWe ask the public to be patient while inquiries continue.

she went out for a cigarette and stood with a group of people.Footage played to the court showed a man walk round the corner from the car park of the pub and open fire, injuring five people and killing Ms Edwards.He was using a Skorpion sub-machine gun, a Czech firearm designed for the security services and the army, the court heard.RecommendedNottingham major incident \u2013 latest:

by two bullets which entered the back of the left side of her head.\u201dThe jury was told after the shooting Chapman drove a stolen Mercedes to the home of his friend and co-defendant Thomas Waring, 20, in Barnston, Wirral.In CCTV footage shown to the court a man, alleged to be Chapman, was seen walking towards Waring\u2019s house.Mr Power said the man appeared to ruffle his long hair as he walked.He said: \u201cWhat we suggest is, as the man, who is in the stolen car that had been in the car park, from which the shooting had taken place, as he ruffles his hair he dislodges the gun that had just carried out the murder, which drops to the floor and then he picks it up.\u201dTim Edwards with his daughter Elle, who was shot dead in a pub in Wallasey, Merseyside on Christmas Eve (Sky

of events, including injunctions preventing Chapman associating with named individuals, including Mr Duffy and Mr Salkeld, as well as a burglary in November and two shootings in December.The court heard the day before the shooting, on December 23, Mr Duffy and Mr Salkeld, from the Ford estate, assaulted Sam Searson, from the Woodchurch estate.Mr Power said: \u201cWhat we say it shows is that what otherwise might have been viewed as a random or inexplicable shooting of a wholly innocent woman, Elle Edwards, was in fact the culmination of an ongoing feud between people from, on the one hand, the Woodchurch estate, and on the other hand, from the Ford Estate, which included Jake Duffy and Kieran Salkeld, who were the intended victims of the shooting.\u201dAbout a dozen members of Ms

Skorpion sub-machine gun with intent to endanger life and possession of ammunition with intent to endanger life.Waring, of Private Drive, Barnston, Wirral, denies possessing a prohibited weapon and assisting an offender by helping Chapman to dispose of the car.The trial continues."}, {"_id": "6488a01b51ac33a3962e1797", "url":

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeA man who admitted being in charge of two American bulldogs which mauled an elderly woman to death in her own garden has been jailed for nearly five years.Darren Pritchard, 44, was sentenced on Tuesday after earlier pleading guilty to owning two dangerously out of control dogs, possessing cannabis with intent to supply, and producing the drug at an address in the street in Rowley Regis, West Midlands, where Lucille Downer was pronounced dead.Wolverhampton Crown Court heard that Pritchard\u2019s 85-year-old next-door neighbour, who had dementia, suffered fatal injuries to her neck when she was attacked by the dogs, which are legal to own in the UK, on the afternoon of April 2 2021.Howard Searle, prosecuting, told the court that Pritchard was at work when the animals got into Mrs Downer\u2019s garden through a hole in the fence and started \u201cmauling\u201d her, leaving her with deep wounds to her left leg and the left side of her neck.Neighbours reported hearing screaming and thought Mrs Downer may have fallen so, along with the pensioner\u2019s daughter who lived nearby and cared for her mother, went to her house, where they found one of the dogs attacking her.Mr Searle said: \u201cOne of the dogs held her by the neck and dragged her from side to side. The dog was mauling and pulling Mrs Downer. The other dog had blood around its mouth, suggesting a joint attack.\u201dThe neighbours and Mrs Downer\u2019s daughter had to retreat inside the house and block the door with a wheelie bin, while a neighbour tried to distract the animals with dog biscuits.The court also heard that paramedics could not help Mrs Downer until Pritchard himself returned home and got the dogs away from her.When Pritchard was arrested and his house searched, police discovered bags of cannabis with an estimated street value of just under \u00a320,000, as well as 10 to 12 cannabis plants in the loft and around \u00a335,000 in bundles of cash.Neighbours had previously witnessed Pritchard hitting one of the dogs \u201crepeatedly\u201d on one occasion, and \u201cgoading\u201d one of the animals while it was on a rope leash on another, Mr Searle told the court.Another neighbour reportedly informed the RSPCA after seeing the dogs left outside in the cold.During a police interview, Pritchard said he kept the dogs in the house and did not muzzle them because he did not think they were aggressive. He accepted that the dogs had escaped into neighbouring gardens before.Defending Pritchard, Morgan Pirone said the defendant was \u201cunder no illusions\u201d that he would be going to prison and was remorseful for what had happened.He said: \u201cOn April 2 2021, his actions destroyed the Downer family. Nothing can repair the damage he has done. He knew Mrs Downer for seven years. He cannot forget or forgive himself for what happened.\u201dSentencing Pritchard, who wore black jeans, a black T-shirt and black trainers and carried a holdall into the dock with him, Judge Michael Chambers KC said Mrs Downer was the victim of a \u201cdreadful and sustained attack\u201d.\n\nWhat occurred was entirely foreseeableJudge Michael Chambers KC, Wolverhampton Crown CourtHe said: \u201cOnly a matter of weeks previously, the dogs had escaped into another neighbour\u2019s garden. What occurred was entirely foreseeable.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeRishi Sunak has no plans to alter abortion laws despite calls for reform after a mother-of-three was jailed for using abortion tablets to end her pregnancy illegally during the coronavirus lockdown.Caroline Nokes, the Conservative who chairs the Commons Women and Equalities Committee, joined women\u2019s rights groups in calling for changes to the 1861 legislation used to prosecute Carla Foster.The 44-year-old was given a 28-month extended sentence after she admitted illegally procuring her own abortion when she was between 32 and 34 weeks pregnant.\n\nCases like this, although tragic and fortunately very rare, do throw into stark relief that we are reliant on legislation that is very, very out of date. I think that makes a case for Parliament to start looking at this issue in detailCaroline NokesAbortions are generally only legal before 24 weeks and are carried out in clinics after 10 weeks of pregnancy.Dame Diana Johnson, the chair of the Commons Home Affairs Committee, urged the Government to \u201cstep up\u201d and decriminalise abortions so women cannot be jailed in such cases.Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court heard Foster was sent the drugs by the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) after she lied about how far along in her pregnancy she was during 2020\u2019s pandemic lockdown.The prosecution said Foster made a number of internet searches between February and May 2020, including \u201chow to hide a pregnancy bump\u201d, \u201chow to have an abortion without going to the doctor\u201d and \u201chow to lose a baby at six months\u201d.Foster was initially charged with child destruction and pleaded not guilty.She later pleaded guilty to an alternative charge of section 58 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861, administering drugs or using instruments to procure abortion, which was accepted by the prosecution.The sentencing on Monday has prompted a backlash.Ms Nokes told BBC Radio 4\u2019s The World Tonight programme: \u201cThis is not something that has been debated in any great detail for many years now.\u201cAnd cases like this, although tragic and fortunately very rare, do throw into stark relief that we are reliant on legislation that is very, very out of date.\u201cI think that makes a case for Parliament to start looking at this issue in detail.\u201dDame Diana said both society and healthcare have \u201cmoved on\u201d since the existing abortion laws were put in place.The Labour MP told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cI think Parliament has a role now to look at reforming our abortion laws. There\u2019s no other country in the world, as I understand it, that would criminalise a woman in this way.\u201cThe Government should step up and say we should decriminalise, we should reform abortion law, take the criminal law out of this, but that doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t have regulation.\u201dBut Downing Street said there were no plans to change abortion laws or sentencing guidelines.The Prime Minister\u2019s official spokesman said: \u201cThrough the Abortion Act, all women have access to safe abortions on the NHS up to 24 weeks and we have made changes so that now includes taking abortion pills at home.\u201cWe think this approach provides the right balance and \u2026 there are no plans to change this.\u201dThe spokesman added: \u201cWe recognise that this is a highly emotive issue and obviously we recognise that the strength of feeling on all sides.\u201dFormer chief crown prosecutor for the North West Nazir Afzal argued it was not in the public interest to prosecute the mother of three.Citing public feeling towards laws restricting abortions and her mitigating factors, he told Today: \u201cHad I been involved, had I been doing this particular case, I would not have prosecuted it.\u201cThis whole terrible event took place during the pandemic and people were making some terrible choices during that period that perhaps they regret now.

We miss him so much.\u201dMother Carla Scott and stepfather Dirk Howell have both been convicted  (West Mercia Police)After the verdict, the senior investigating officer who led the case, Detective Chief Inspector Leighton Harding, said: \u201cAlfie suffered the most horrifying physical and emotional abuse at the hands of Scott and Howell. It is unimaginable to consider the fear and distress Alfie must have felt during the events that led to his collapse and death in his home on the morning of 18 February 2021. \u201cThe physical violence he suffered at the hands of Scott and Howell, which involved being forced into a cold bath and his head held under water, caused his death.\u201cThe court heard evidence of a culture of excessive punishment of Alfie by Scott and Howell. Punishment amounted to beating Alfie with a belt and a slider until he was black and blue with bruising. He was often woken in the early hours of the morning and made to stand outside where Scott and Howell threw jugs of cold water over him.\u201cHe was often grounded for excessive periods, made to stand for hours inside and outside his home, food removed from him, banished to his room, repeatedly forced into a bath of cold water and his head held under.\u201cThe conduct of Scott and Howell was nothing less than serious physical and emotional abuse, inflicting the most cruel and inhumane treatment of Alfie.\u201cAlfie should have expected unconditional love and protection of Scott, yet she deliberately neglected his needs, choosing to prioritise her own needs and relationship with Howell, knowing the cruel treatment he was inflicting upon Alfie.\u201cScott and Howell did nothing to protect Alfie and inflicted or permitted the torrent of physical and emotional abuse to continue time and time again.\u201cBoth continued to lie to social services and police to protect themselves from their abuse being discovered, and even confronted and threatened neighbours and members of the public who reported concerns over their treatment of Alfie. At no stage has either of them shown any remorse or acceptance of responsibility for their actions.\u201cToday\u2019s verdict will never undo the dreadful abuse Alfie suffered but it will mean those responsible for inflicting such terror and pain will face the consequences of their sickening actions.\u201d"}, {"_id": "6488a01d51ac33a3962e179e", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/dna-court-of-appeal-peterborough-watson-old-bailey-b2356613.html", "primaryCategory": "Crime", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018Wholesale loss\u2019 of evidence in Rikki Neave murder case, appeal court told", "lead": "James Watson made a bid to overturn his murder conviction at the Court of Appeal on Tuesday.", "author": "Jess Glass", "datePublished": "Tue, 13 Jun 2023 12:23:58 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:58:05.280446", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-13T12:23:58+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/13/13/b1de8d6bb57031ca7a3dc8d280b8a5ceY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg2NzQzMjc0-2.67572004.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThere was a \u201cwholesale loss and destruction\u201d of evidence in the 1994 murder of Rikki Neave, the Court of Appeal has heard as the man jailed for the killing challenged his conviction.The murder of the six-year-old, who was strangled to death in woods near Peterborough, was among the most high-profile cold cases on police files until DNA was identified on the victim\u2019s clothes following a re-examination of the case two decades later.James Watson, 42, who was 13 at the time of the killing, denied murder but was found guilty by a jury and sentenced to life with a minimum term of 15 years at the Old Bailey in June last year.He appeared at the Court of Appeal in London on Tuesday via video link from Wakefield prison to challenge his conviction.Jennifer Dempster KC, for Watson, told the court there had been a \u201ctotal disregard\u201d towards preserving exhibits in the case.She said: \u201cThe reality we submit was that this was a wholesale loss and destruction of evidence, so much so that a fair trial of this applicant is no longer possible.\u201cIt closed down completely any opportunity for the defence to explore the potential of other suspects.\u201dThe barrister described how the wheelie bin where Rikki\u2019s clothes were found was \u201clast seen\u201d in an underground car park before it went missing, preventing the ability to search it for DNA or fingerprint evidence.Ms Dempster continued: \u201cIt is the developments in DNA technology that have taken place that enabled the Crown to bring this applicant to trial, but it is those very same advances in technology that the applicant has been completely deprived of.\u201dHowever, John Price KC, for the Crown, told the hearing that there was no evidence that Watson\u2019s case had been affected.He said: \u201cThe applicant failed to demonstrate that there was any prejudice caused to him by the loss of the material that has been identified.\u201cIf there was\u2026 we do not accept that it was not capable of being ameliorated in the usual way.\u201dMr Price added: \u201cThe loss of a speculative position is not prejudice.\u201dAt the end of the hearing, Lord Justice Holroyde, sitting with Mr Justice Morris and Judge Angela Morris, said they would give their decision in writing at a later date.\u201cWe will do it as soon as we can,\u201d the judge said."}, {"_id": "6488a01d51ac33a3962e179f", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/jon-moss-boy-george-culture-club-burton-london-b2356607.html", "primaryCategory": "Crime", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Culture Club members given more time to sort \u00a31.75m debt amid bankruptcy bid", "lead": "Boy George and bassist Michael Craig are in debt to former drummer Jon Moss after a previous court ruling.", "author": "Tom Pilgrim", "datePublished": "Tue, 13 Jun 2023 12:14:37 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:58:05.482148", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-13T12:14:37+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/13/13/abe0991cc1b9f29b99af4729139bb2e9Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg2NzQwODQz-2.21255449.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeCulture club singer Boy George and the group\u2019s bassist Michael Craig have been given more time to try and avoid a bankruptcy bid brought against them by former bandmate Jon Moss over a \u00a31.75 million debt from a legal dispute.Boy George \u2013 whose real name is George O\u2019Dowd \u2013 and Mr Craig are both in debt to Culture Club\u2019s ex-drummer after a judge previously ordered Mr Moss should be paid \u00a31.75 million by the band as part of a resolved battle over the group\u2019s profits.A hearing at a specialist court in London on Tuesday was told that Mr Moss is bringing bankruptcy petitions against Boy George and Mr Craig in relation to the judge\u2019s ruling in March.Insolvency and Companies Court judge Catherine Burton was asked by Hugh Miall, lawyer for Boy George and Mr Craig, to adjourn the hearing so that creditors could consider proposals for an Individual Voluntary Agreement (IVA) \u2013 a formal agreement which lets people repay debts in a bid to avoid bankruptcy.Amanda Hadkiss, for Mr Moss, and Edoardo Lupi, representing the IVA nominees, did not oppose the adjournment.Judge Burton ordered that the next hearing in the case should be on June 27.Tuesday\u2019s short proceedings, at which no band members were present, comes after a High Court battle between Mr Moss and his ex-bandmates over the group\u2019s profits was resolved a week before trial.The drummer, a founding member of the group, had previously brought legal action against Boy George, guitarist Roy Hay and Mr Craig, after allegedly being \u201cexpelled\u201d by their manager in September 2018 after 37 years playing together.A six-day trial was due to start in late March to determine the value of the Culture Club name, the profits made by the band since Mr Moss\u2019s alleged expulsion, and the amount he might be entitled to receive.But a court order issued on March 21 said that the group had agreed that a judgment should be made in favour of Mr Moss, with his ex-bandmates required to pay him \u00a31.75 million immediately.The order approved by Mrs Justice Joanna Smith said that Mr Moss had agreed to \u201crelinquish\u201d any right to the Culture Club name and its use, including in connection with concerts and merchandise.The High Court previously heard that the band had settled a dispute over whether there was a \u201ccontinuing partnership\u201d since the formation of Culture Club \u2013 a group best known for hits such as Do You Really Want To Hurt Me and Karma Chameleon \u2013 with Boy George, Mr Hay and Mr Craig conceding there was until Mr Moss\u2019s departure.The abandoned trial over the outstanding issues of the group\u2019s value and profits was also due to cover Mr Moss\u2019s additional claim to an \u201coutstanding balance\u201d of 246,000.17 dollars (\u00a3201,000) under the terms of a band agreement reached over the operation of its 2018 Life Tour.Boy George, Mr Craig and Mr Hay were all previously defending the claims.Last year, the court was told that Mr Moss was amending his legal challenge to include allegations that Boy George \u201cconspired to defraud\u201d him over the Life Tour money, after he learnt that funds were released to a US company, You Give Me Life, Inc (YGML), following the settlement of legal proceedings in America in January 2021.YGML and another English company, Other Places Drama LLP (OPD) \u2013 both said to be Boy George\u2019s personal service companies \u2013 had brought proceedings against Agency for the Performing Arts (APA) in California claiming to be entitled to the money it held.Mr Moss had originally launched litigation seeking a court declaration that the outstanding balance money was being held for him by APA, acting as his agent.The drummer claimed that Boy George, YGML and/or OPD, were allegedly in breach of the \u201cdeal memo\u201d that he said meant each band member would receive a fee of 600,000 dollars (\u00a3491,000) for up to 80 concerts on the Life Tour.Boy George previously accused Mr Moss of making a \u201cpersonal attack on me\u201d and \u201cthe most unfounded and hurtful allegations\u201d, which were \u201centirely untrue\u201d."}, {"_id": "6488a01e51ac33a3962e17a0", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/hull-crown-court-east-yorkshire-b2356598.html", "primaryCategory":

I was making f****** tea\u201d, Mr Macdonald said.In her pre-prepared statement to officers the next day, Hanson said her husband was \u201cverbally and mentally abusive\u201d and that this was \u201cworse when he drinks\u201d.She said she had been in the kitchen preparing a meal when Mr Hanson came into the kitchen in \u201ca bad mood\u201d.\u201cThis normally happens when I mention his drinking,\u201d she said.\u201cHe came alongside me shouting.

The inquest began in March.The proceedings are taking place against the backdrop of a proposed controversial Government Bill on the legacy of the Northern Ireland Troubles.An amendment to the draft legislation, introduced by the Government last week, stated that all ongoing legacy inquests, other than those at the point of verdict, will cease on May 1 2024.A number of nationalist politicians, including Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O\u2019Neill and SDLP MLA Matthew O\u2019Toole were at the Royal Courts of Justice in Belfast to support the Brown family during the review hearing.Counsel for the coroner Joseph Aiken KC told the hearing that it had been planned to hold two days of evidence in the inquest this week.However, he said this had not been possible due to the size of the witness schedule, pointing out that there were 420 potential witnesses in the case.He then updated the court on disclosure issues around outstanding sensitive and non-sensitive material about Mr Brown\u2019s death from the PSNI and Ministry of Defence.Mr Aiken then set out a timetable, agreed by the coroner, for when the process of handing over the outstanding material should be completed over the coming months.Mr Aiken said the full inquest would resume on January 8 2024 for four consecutive weeks of hearing and would conclude by February 2.\n\nI can't allow the internal processes, however difficult they are, to dictate the path of this inquestMr Justice KinneyPSNI barrister Mark Robinson said that a public immunity interest (PII) process was to be carried out and said it should be \u201cconducted properly\u201d.He told the court that he believed that dates imposed within the agenda \u201ccannot be met\u201d.Coroner Mr Justice Kinney said: \u201cThe fact is this is a matter where we are not at a standing start today looking at this process.\u201cThis has been a process that has apparently been under way in some form for almost a year and what I am being told today still seems to remain that process that will dictate the timetable even though that process is opaque.\u201cI can\u2019t allow the internal processes, however difficult they are, to dictate the path of this inquest.\u201dHe added: \u201cIn short, a best endeavour submission today is not sufficient and it will not cut the mustard. There is a timetable which I certainly appreciate is challenging, but it is challenging because so little has been done in the past.\u201cThat has to change. So, the timetable stands.\u201dBarrister for the Brown family Stephen Toal, said the PSNI position was an \u201cinsult\u201d to the Brown family.He said: \u201cThe PSNI and the security forces have had 26 years to collate those documents.\u201cThe prominence afforded to this inquest arises from the depth of feeling within the wider community about this horrendous murder and the way this proud family have been treated to this point.\u201cToday in court we see an outpouring of support for this family.\u201d\n\nThis continued delay now has a realisable prize. Reach May 1 and the years of stonewalling will have been a successStephen ToalReferring to the Government\u2019s announcement of its amendment to its legacy Bill, Mr Toal said: \u201cIt did come as quite a shock to the Brown family to learn that all of their years of heartache and struggle in trying to get this inquest opened would be met with that cynical, cruel amendment from the Tories that we only learned about in the past week.\u201dHe said there was \u201cvery real concern\u201d from the family that the inquest would be stopped if it could not be concluded by next May.He said: \u201cWe find the Secretary of State (Chris Heaton-Harris) being in a position of being a partisan cheerleader for the ruthless and morally corrupt legacy litigation Bill that has the potential to take this inquest away from this family before it is concluded.\u201cSean Brown\u2019s family fear that the deliberate delaying tactics that have proved so successful for the state agencies to this point will now be continued until their end point of May 1 2024.\u201dThe barrister added: \u201cThis continued delay now has a realisable prize.

Another woman said she had \"lost everything\", while others described suffering anxiety.UK may not have been prepared for pandemicThe UK may not have been \"very well prepared at all\" to deal with the coronavirus pandemic, the official inquiry\u2019s lead lawyer said.Lead counsel Hugo Keith KC questioned whether the nation was equipped to offer substantial protection to the public as leaders had promised when the Department of Health and Social Care, along with the three devolved governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, published a Covid-19 action plan. Hugo Keith KC says UK may not have been prepared for pandemic  (Covid 19 Inquiry)\"The plan stated that the United Kingdom was well prepared to respond in a way that offered substantial protection to the public. Whether that was actually the case will be examined in module one.\"Even at this stage before hearing the evidence it is apparent that we might not have been very well prepared at all.\"Very little thought given to impact of lockdownsMr Keith said there was \u201cvery little thought\u201d given to the impact lockdowns could have on the country.\"Very little thought was given to how, if it proved to be necessary, how something as complex, difficult and damaging as a national lockdown could be put in place at all.\"Equally, there appears to have been a failure to think through the potentially massive impact on education and on the economy in trying to control a runaway virus in this way.\"Mr Keith also questioned whether past experiences could have led to complacency in planning, adding: \"Did our experience of the 2009 swine flu lead to concerns about overreacting?\"Brexit could have \u2018crowded out\u2019 planning for pandemicHugo Keith KC suggested to the Covid inquiry that preparing for Brexit \"crowded out and prevented\" the work that was needed to improve pandemic preparedness.He said: \"The pandemic struck the United Kingdom just as it was leaving the European Union. That departure required an enormous amount of planning and preparation, particularly to address what were likely to be the severe consequences of a no-deal exit on food and medicine supplies, travel and transport, business borders and so on.\"It is clear that such planning, from 2018 onwards, crowded out and prevented some or perhaps a majority of the improvements that central government itself understood were required to be made to resilience planning and preparedness.\u201dEvidence likely to show \u2018chaos\u2019 in governmentEvidence is likely to show a lack of responsibility in government and \"chaos\" which led to a slow reaction to a pandemic where \"lost time is measured in lost lives\", the Covid inquiry has been told.Pete Weatherby KC, of Covid Bereaved Families for Justice UK, said: \"The families expect the evidence will show a lack of responsibility in Government for civil emergency preparedness, with little or no ministerial leadership and the chaos of committees which led to poor planning and ultimately a reactive rather than proactive response to the virus.\"We anticipate the evidence will show that the most fundamental consequence of this was a slow reaction. And with a pandemic, time is of the essence and lost time is measured in lost lives.\"NHS England \u2018failed to prepare PPE stocks\u2019Failures of planning and preparation for personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare staff \"led to the ludicrous spectacle of doctors making aprons from bin liners\" during the pandemic.Brian Stanton, lawyer for the British Medical Association, listed the ways in which medical workers had to improvise due to the lack of adequate protective clothing.He said: \"Frontline staff often had to go without PPE, buy their own, use homemade, donated or expired items, and reuse single-use items. Staff also had to use items that were out of date, with multiple expired stickers visibly layered on top of each other.\"Many felt pressured to work without adequate protection, with consequences for their mental and physical health.\"Politicians presided over \u2018chaos\u2019The barrister representing bereaved families in Scotland told the inquiry that political leaders \"stand accused of presiding over a carousel of chaos\".Claire Mitchell KC demanded answers as to whether politicians in the UK and devolved administrations could put aside political differences and act in the public interest, as well as justifications for delays in lockdown and the Eat Out to Help Out scheme.RecommendedGovernment WhatsApps about \u2018frothy\u2019 coffee, not big decisions, former health ministerBoris Johnson hands over his WhatsApps and asks for them to be given to Covid inquiryBoris WhatsApp row descends into farce as senior Tories call for Sunak to end disputeShe told the inquiry \"at best, those in charge sought to prepare for the wrong pandemic\" and the UK was \"woefully under-prepared for the virus that swept our shores\".The inquiry is covering the whole of the UK, although Scotland will hold its own probe."}, {"_id": "6488a01f51ac33a3962e17a6", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/bbc-tim-davie-mps-tv-industry-gary-lineker-b2356535.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "BBC boss tells MPs there are imbalances of power in \u2018strange\u2019 TV industry", "lead": "Tim Davie appeared in front of MPs on the Culture, Media and Sport Committee on Tuesday to answer questions on a wide range of topics.", "author": "Ellie Iorizzo", "datePublished": "Tue, 13 Jun 2023 11:35:02 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:58:07.627980", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-13T11:35:02+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/13/11/6ecf6b26f990f70ee0ef8c0e24790aa9Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg2NzM1ODI1-2.72592277.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

What\u2019s been a concern is getting the social media review to a point where it can be delivered flawlessly, and that is not easy.\u201dHe added that he is expecting the report back \u201cpretty soon\u201d.Earlier in the session, Mr Davie said the BBC doesn\u2019t always get its obligation to impartiality right, but it has had a \u201cgood year\u201d amid \u201cenormous pressure\u201d around the world for free press.He told MPs: \u201cAs editor in chief, my orders are very clear: we report without fear or favour with due impartiality.\u201cI\u2019ve never claimed we get it perfect all the time, and sometimes we don\u2019t get it right, but overall and the vast majority of occasions, I think we\u2019ve had a good year in maintaining impartiality in a world where there are fierce storms around us.\u201dDuring the session, Mr Davie confirmed he expected the investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct against DJ Tim Westwood to be completed in the \u201cnext couple of months\u201d, while being questioned on alleged bullying and harassment within the corporation.The director-general added that there is also an ongoing review into Top Gear as presenter Andrew \u201cFreddie\u201d Flintoff continues to recover from an accident which occurred during filming at the programme\u2019s test track at Dunsfold Aerodrome in December.Similarly, he addressed the row over cuts to local radio services, describing changes as \u201cvery difficult and unpopular\u201d but adding: \u201cLocal radio is precious.\u201dLast year, the BBC proposed plans for local radio stations to share more content and broadcast less programming.Mr Davie said: \u201cI believe we\u2019re doing the right thing in a situation in which we understand and are listening and have already made some adjustments to our plans to make sure we\u2019re making the right choices with very limited money.\u201dHe said he is \u201cempathetic\u201d to BBC journalists who are currently on strike because change it \u201cstressful\u201d and it has been a \u201cvery difficult time for people working in local radio\u201d.\u201cI\u2019ve been through restructures myself and it\u2019s not nice, so I understand it. I am utterly committed to BBC local growing for the long term,\u201d he said.BBC director of editorial policy and standards David Jordan and chief content officer Charlotte Moore were also at the scrutiny session.Asked about the future of chamber choir The BBC Singers, chief content officer Ms Moore told the select committee: \u201cWe are absolutely committed to our classical musical and performing group provision at the BBC,\u201d adding that they \u201cspend \u00a360 million annually on classical music\u201d.RecommendedWitnesses describe screams as two victims stabbed in deadly Nottingham attacksRobison appears to drop public sector staff shrinking policyLight aircraft crashes off South Wales coastThe broadcaster had previously announced plans to scrap its in-house chamber choir and reduce salaried orchestral posts across the BBC English Orchestras by around 20%.In April, it U-turned, and said it is committed to exploring \u201calternatives\u201d to cutting classical performer jobs at the corporation."}, {"_id": "6488a01f51ac33a3962e17a7", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/government-experts-prime-rishi-sunak-joe-biden-b2356554.html", "primaryCategory": "UK Politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Starmer says UK needs to be prepared for \u2018rapid change\u2019 with AI", "lead": "The Labour leader said the UK could make a success of the AI revolution, but measures are needed to reskill workers.", "author": "David Hughes", "datePublished": "Tue, 13 Jun 2023 11:21:57 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:58:07.882600", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-13T11:21:57+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/13/12/629420d073ee41bb1db9281d2914b394Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg2NzM4MTkz-2.72360442.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up for the View from Westminster email for expert analysis straight to your inboxGet our free View from Westminster email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

I could be in a wheelchair by then.\u201dHe is taking on the challenge to raise funds and awareness for Muscular Dystrophy UK, the national charity that supports those with muscle wasting conditions.Earlier this year, Mr Stennett took part in the Marbella 70.3 half Ironman and the TCS London Marathon, with Ironman Austria to be his third major challenge in three months.Ahead of the ironman challenge, he said: \u201cLiving with a condition can be challenging.\u201cFSHD continues to sap my strength, but I remain strong-minded.\u201cCompleting the open water swim with front crawl is a small concern because the muscles in my core are weak and I struggle with snaking in the water when I\u2019m tired.\u201cI am a proficient breaststroke swimmer, so I have no doubt I will complete the swim, but by doing breaststroke I fatigue my legs before the cycle element even starts!\u201dKiera Santry, senior challenge events officer at Muscular Dystrophy UK, said: \u201cChris has an inspiring story \u2013 and he has not let his diagnosis stop him from taking on multiple challenge events, including running the London Marathon in April 2023 for the charity.\u201cWe\u2019re so grateful to Chris for his ongoing support.RecommendedStars pay tribute to actor Treat Williams after death in motorcycle accidentBereaved families hold pictures of loved ones in vigil outside Covid inquiryMost early-stage breast cancer patients will become long-term survivors \u2013 study\u201cThe funds raised will continue to help Muscular Dystrophy UK support people living with muscle-wasting conditions and fund further research and treatment.\u201dMr Stennett can be sponsored at https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/fshd-ironman2"}, {"_id": "6488a02251ac33a3962e17b3", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/courts-mps-government-lord-chancellor-alex-chalk-b2356264.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Courts to gain powers to throw out lawsuits designed to silence critics", "lead": "Legal threats known as Slapps are often used by the rich and powerful to intimidate and financially exhaust opponents.", "author": "Sophie Wingate", "datePublished": "Tue, 13 Jun 2023 09:25:37 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:58:10.415772", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-13T09:25:37+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/13/00/7dc5dc9167a08edc36d4eb36a48106c8Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg2NjY2OTU5-2.72310993.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Thank you to everyone for your support \u2013 it really helps.\u201dFollow all the latest updates on The Independent\u2019s liveblogHere is a reminder of the events of the case.RecommendedMadeleine McCann news \u2013 latest: Soil from reservoir compared to samples from prime suspect\u2019s vanHow Madeleine McCann search at reservoir unfolded \u2013 and what police foundRead Madeleine McCann suspect Christian Brueckner\u2019s bombshell prison letters for the first timeThe story began when the McCanns \u2013 affluent doctors Kate and Gerry, their three-year-old daughter Madeleine and her two-year-old twin siblings Amelia and Sean \u2013 joined a group of seven family friends and their five children on holiday at the Ocean Club in the village of Praia da Luz on the southwestern tip of Portugal on 28 April 2007.After a pleasant spring break by the sea, the adults in the party went out for dinner at the resort\u2019s open-air tapas bar on 3 May, gathering at 8.30pm. The children were left behind sleeping in their respective apartments with the doors unlocked and a rota system in place among the parents to ensure that someone returned every half-hour to check on them.When Kate McCann took her turn and returned to her apartment at 10pm, she raced back to the restaurant screaming \u201cMadeleine\u2019s gone! Someone\u2019s taken her!\u201d The police were quickly called and 60 staff and fellow guests searched the complex, calling out the girl\u2019s name in vain until daybreak the following morning.Border police and airport staff were put on alert and hundreds of volunteers joined the efforts to find the missing girl over the coming days, the case fast becoming a sensation.The Portuguese authorities would later attract criticism over their conduct in the crucial earliest hours of the investigation when the trail might still have been warm, accused of making rudimentary mistakes like failing to conduct a house-by-house search of every local residence or interview all of the other guests at the resort, acting slowly to erect roadblocks and potentially compromising forensic evidence at the crime scene.Madeleine McCann (PA)The police initially stated that they believed Madeleine was still alive and had been abducted from the room by a stranger as the parents described their \u201canguish and despair\u201d over her vanishing, a worst fear realised for any parent.On 26 May, police issued a description of a suspicious man seen on the night of the girl\u2019s disappearance. The individual in question was spotted by Jane Tanner, one of the McCanns\u2019 dining companions, who said she had seen a Mediterranean man with dark hair and beige trousers carrying a child close to the apartment when she went to check in on her own children. Scotland Yard would later come to dismiss the sighting as a red herring.The search continued as the summer progressed amid a wild media circus and with huge fundraising activities underway, the McCanns setting up Madeleine\u2019s Fund on 15 May to raise cash to support further investigation and keep the profile of the case high, attracting generous donations from celebrities like Richard Branson, Simon Cowell, JK Rowling and Coleen Rooney. By 30 May, the case was such a cause celebre that they were being flown out to meet the Pope at the Vatican in Sir Phillip Green\u2019s Learjet.A local man, Robert Murat, subsequently became its first suspect and had his house and car searched, his swimming pool drained and his electronic devices confiscated but no evidence was found to link him to Madeleine and the matter was soon dropped.By June, the Portuguese police admitted that they had failed to protect potentially useful evidence at the scene as frustration with the lack of developments grew and the media began to question whether the McCanns themselves had been involved in the matter. Lurid tabloid allegations suggested the couple and their friends might have been swingers and that the McCanns, as physicians, might have been in the habit of sedating their children, while others claimed inconsistencies in their version of events.The intensity of the hostility towards the parents would later be described by Roy Greenslade of The Guardian as \u201cno journalistic accident, but a sustained campaign of vitriol against a grief-stricken family\u201d, singling out The Daily Express and Daily Star for particular condemnation.In July, assistance offered by former South African police officer Danie Krugel \u2013 who claimed his handheld \u201cmatter orientation system\u201d could help to find Madeleine \u2013 was rubbished, while British police sent over two springer spaniel sniffer dogs to search for DNA. Gerry and Kate McCann (PA)Relations with the local authorities would ultimately sour as the latter came to resent British intrusion into a Portuguese inquiry, according to Anthony Summers and Robbyn Swan\u2019s book Looking for Madeleine (2014).By August, Madeleine has been missing for 100 days and police admitted for the first time that she may never be found. They also told the McCanns that they were no longer considering the matter an abduction case but, rather, a murder inquiry.The McCanns themselves were interviewed as \u201carguidos\u201d (suspects) by Portuguese police in September, with the parents told that the dogs had discovered DNA evidence from the missing girl in the boot of their holiday rental car, lines of inquiry that had already been leaked to the British press. They vehemently denied having any part in her disappearance.Despite being listed as suspects (a designation that would linger until the following July), the McCanns were allowed to return to Britain on 9 September. A day later, chief inspector Tavares de Almeida of the Policia Judiciaria in Portimao signed a nine-page report concluding that Madeleine McCann had died in their apartment as a result of an accident, that the tapas dinner and rota checks on the McCann children had been part of a planned cover-up, that the family\u2019s friends had helped to mislead the police and that the McCanns had concealed the body and then faked an abduction. A public prosecutor subsequently applied for the confiscation of Kate McCann\u2019s diary and Gerry McCann\u2019s laptop plus the group\u2019s phone records.On 2 October, chief inspector Goncalo Amaral was removed from the case and transferred after alleging that the British police were only interested in pursuing leads favourable to the McCanns. He would later publish a book, Maddie: The Truth of the Lie, the following summer, resulting in a lengthy libel battle with the McCanns that would run back and forth through the courts until March 2017.Back in Britain, Gerry McCann issued a video that November in which he speculated that his family had been watched by a \u201cpredator\u201d during their stay at Praia da Luz. His wife had come to believe that a potential perpetrator could have seen a note in the resort\u2019s guest book visible to all in reception noting their dining arrangements on the evening of Madeleine\u2019s disappearance. The couple followed up on 20 January 2008 by releasing a sketch of a \u201ccreepy man\u201d they said other holidaymakers had said they had seen loitering at the Ocean Club.In April, a month before the one-year anniversary of the fateful night, Portuguese police travelled to Leicestershire to conduct further interviews with the McCanns\u2019 friends.RecommendedWhat happened to Madeleine McCann? Five possible scenarios as Netflix documentary releasedThen, on 21 July, Portugal\u2019s attorney general, Fernando Jose Pinto Monteiro, announced that there was no evidence to link either the McCanns or Robert Murat to the disappearance and closed the case, unsolved.With the trail cold and no closure in sight, the McCanns continued to publicise their cause, issuing computer-generated images of how Madeleine might look now that she had aged on 3 November 2009 and condemning the release of previously unseen Portuguese police files \u2013 detailing possible sightings of their daughter \u2013 to British newspapers in March 2010.The McCanns published a book of their own about their ordeal in May 2011, entitled simply Madeleine, which was serialised in The Sun as the newspaper led a campaign calling on British prime minister David Cameron to launch a new inquiry. He did so. Commenced by then-home secretary Theresa May, the Metropolitan Police\u2019s Operation Grange would be led by commander Simon Foy and comprise a team of three detective inspectors, five detective sergeants, 19 detective constables and six civilian staff.It began to yield results in 2013, with Scotland Yard formally announcing a new investigation in July and saying in October it had identified 41 potential suspects. That same month, BBC Crimewatch released an e-fit image of a man of particular interest who had been seen in Praia da Luz with a child matching Madeleine\u2019s description in May 2007.Detectives arrived in Portugal in January 2014 promising new arrests and finally searched the village in June, interviewing four people the following month but without unearthing new information. The quartet would be definitively ruled out in April 2017, before the UK government said it would continue to fund the investigation until 2020, having already admitted it had cost \u00a310m in its first four years of operation.That investment had enabled detectives to have tens of thousands of documents translated, investigate over 8,000 potential sightings, take 1,338 statements, collect 1,027 exhibits and investigate 650 sex offenders and 60 persons of interest, all without definitively establishing the truth.The Madeline McCann case lay dormant before suddenly exploding into life in June 2020 when German media revealed that Christian Brueckner, a 43-year-old prisoner with a track record of child abuse and drug trafficking, had been identified as a new suspect by the public prosecutor of the German city of Braunschweig. Christian Brueckner (AFP/Getty)He had reportedly been living in a Volkswagen camper van in the Algarve at the time of Madeleine\u2019s disappearance and one woman has since come forward to suggest she saw a girl that might have been Madeleine speaking German in a supermarket in Portugal in 2017.German investigators classified their probe into his movements as a murder inquiry, saying they were working on the assumption that Madeleine is dead and reporting in July 2021 that they had found an abandoned cellar beneath his former allotment near Hanover where she could, theoretically, have been held captive.Hans Christian Wolters, the prosecutor leading the investigation into Brueckner, has said he was \u201cvery confident\u201d the inmate is responsible for kidnapping her. \u201cIf you knew the evidence we had you would come to the same conclusion as I do but I can\u2019t give you details because we don\u2019t want the accused to know what we have on him \u2013 these are tactical considerations,\u201d he told the BBC. It was subsequently revealed that Madeleine\u2019s Fund still had \u00a3773,629 to spend as of 31 March 2020, meaning the McCanns can continue to bankroll a private investigation to find their daughter long after the police hunt is finally drawn to a close, should they choose to.Brueckner was formally made a \u201carguido\u201d in relation to the case on 21 April 2022.On 19 September, the McCanns lost their libel case against Mr Amaral, the former chief inspector who had investigated the disappearance, before the European Court of Human Rights. The couple had attempted to argue that Mr Amaral was responsible for damaging their reputation and breaching their rights to respect for their private life and to be presumed innocent after taking exception to his book and associated media appearances in which he had repeatedly suggested they were responsible for the vanishing.Their complaint also argued that Portugal\u2019s Supreme Court had failed to allow them proper redress over the alleged libel by Mr Amaral after judges threw out their earlier claim in 2017.The verdict left the McCanns with three months to appeal against the decision.In February 2023, a Polish woman called Julia Faustyna made headlines by claiming she was Madeleine, using the Instagram name @iammadeleinemccann.Ms Faustyna, 21, did not provide any supporting evidence but sought DNA tests to prove her origins. The results ultimately revealed that she was entirely of Polish origin, with no British heritage, disproving her claims for good. In April 2023, a court in Braunschweig dropped a rape charge against Brueckner, unrelated to the Madeleine McCann case, concluding it did not have jurisdiction.Police in Germany continue to claim they have \u201cconcrete evidence\u201d that Madeleine is dead but this has still not been confirmed and their investigation is ongoing, with Brueckner still not charged in the McCann case. Investigators explore the Barragem do Arade beauty spot (EPA)Like her parents, Madeleine\u2019s sister Amelie, now 18, observed the 16th anniversary of her disappearance in May 2023.Speaking publicly for the first time at a prayer meeting in Rothley, she said: \u201cIt\u2019s nice that everyone is here together but it\u2019s a sad occasion.\u201dAmelie McCann reportedly joined in with chants including \u201cNever never give up\u201d, \u201cleave no stone unturned\u201d, \u201cdon\u2019t forget about me\u201d and \u201cstill missing, still missed\u201d.Later that month, the case unexpectedly lurched back into life in when investigators launched a major search operation at a reservoir in the Algarve, with Mr Wolters saying they were acting on \u201ccertain tips\u201d from Brueckner, whom the prosecutor said he remains \u201cvery confident\u201d holds the key to Madeleine\u2019s disappearance.With help from Portuguese police and with Scotland Yard detectives watching on, German investigators carried out a thorough examination of the Barragem do Arade beauty spot in Silves.They combed the shoreline and surrounding grasslands with sniffer dogs, rakes, spades and pickaxes and inspected the water in a rigid-hull inflatable boat. A no-fly zone was put in place in the skies overhead to allow police drones to survey the region undisturbed.The site is located approximately 30 miles northeast of the Ocean Club resort, from which the missing girl first disappeared.In their most recent update, the investigators said they were comparing soil samples from the reservoir with others taken from Brueckner\u2019s VW camper van in an attempt to establish for certain that he was in the area during the timeframe of interest in order to try to \u201cclose the net\u201d around him."}, {"_id": "6488a02651ac33a3962e17c1", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/eberechi-eze-gareth-southgate-roy-hodgson-crystal-palace-north-macedonia-b2356798.html", "primaryCategory": "Football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Eberechi Eze feels injury nightmare gave him platform for England recognition", "lead": "The Crystal Palace midfielder is eyeing a senior debut after being included in Gareth Southgate\u2019s squad for the Malta and North Macedonia games.", "author": "Nick Mashiter", "datePublished": "Tue, 13 Jun 2023 16:29:17 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:58:14.692496", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-13T16:29:17+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/13/17/c73e18e1130c0a54cf9c4464f3289e41Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg2NzU3Njk3-2.72593556.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Miguel Delaney\u2019s Reading the Game newsletter sent straight to your inbox for freeSign up to Miguel\u2019s Delaney\u2019s free weekly newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeChris Eubank has opened up on his split from his son\u2019s team, claiming that Chris Eubank Jr \u2018has never listened\u2019.A rift emerged between Eubank and his son in October, ahead of a planned fight between Eubank Jr and Conor Benn \u2013 a bout that collapsed after the revelation that Benn had failed two drug tests.Eubank Jr went on to lose to Liam Smith via fourth-round TKO in January, with the pair\u2019s scheduled rematch then falling through due to an injury sustained by Smith. As such, Eubank Jr, 33, is currently without a fight.Addressing the current state of Eubank Jr\u2019s career, his father \u2013 a British boxing icon \u2013\u00a0told Talksport on Tuesday (13 June): \u201cDavid Haye called me the other day and said [Eubank Jr] doesn\u2019t spar, he does everything that he wants to do, he\u2019s got \u2018yes men\u2019 around him.\u201cAnd so it seems to me, by what David Haye tells me, that he\u2019s still not listening. If you won\u2019t listen, then life will teach you what it taught many of the other fighters. It is arrogance when you shut your ears, and what arrogance gets you is what it got him in his last fight.

Junior on my watch is not supposed to lose to Liam Smith; on the watch of these PE teachers anything can happen, and anything did. He has never listened. \u201cMy son could have been a tremendous fighter, he electrified me when watching him, but he hasn\u2019t because he doesn\u2019t listen, and if you don\u2019t listen then you have to feel. The truth will set you free. I did not go missing, he sent me away, you gave me the ability to go away and live my own life. Of course I will accept anything he asks me, but you have to have the humility to ask. Dad is no longer chasing you.\u201dAddressing a past comment made by Simon Jordan, in which the Talksport host labelled Eubank Jr a \u2018charlatan\u2019, Eubank Sr said: \u201cIn the world of honesty, how can I disagree with you? I guess my silence says it all. Truth is truth.\u201dDiscussing the role he played in helping his son secure significant paydays, Eubank, 56, added: \u201cWithout me, you can\u2019t make the money that he\u2019s made. \u201cThere were three fights he had [...] with fighters who were like [Avni] Yildirim; $9 million, I got him that.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeMoeen Ali admits there is only one captain and one series that would have tempted him to overturn his Test retirement.Moeen won the last of his 64 England caps almost two years ago and was content with his decision to step away from a format that has exacted a physical and psychological toll on him over the years.The 35-year-old even rejected a no-strings-attached offer to tour Pakistan in December, concluding that he did not have the required motivation to commit to one more leg of a lengthy winter on the road.But things all changed when England\u2019s first-choice spinner Jack Leach was unexpectedly ruled out for the summer. England skipper Ben Stokes, who spent the best part of two months with Moeen during their time together at Chennai Super Kings in this year\u2019s Indian Premier League, set the wheels in motion for a comeback and little more than a week later Moeen was sitting in his new England whites taking questions at his home ground of Edgbaston.RecommendedThe gaps in Australia\u2019s armour to encourage England before the AshesEngland were playing \u2018Bazball\u2019 during 2005 Ashes series win \u2013 Michael VaughanNothing is going to change \u2013 Ben Stokes vows to stay true to beliefs in AshesAsked if there was any other captain he would have returned for, he said: \u201cProbably not, no.\u201cI\u2019ve obviously spent a lot of time with Stokesy in India\u2026he didn\u2019t mention anything about coming out of retirement, it was just about the Ashes and how he was looking to take the team. But he obviously watched me train out there and thinks I can bowl decently.\u201dStokes convinced Ali to return to the England fold for the Ashes (PA Wire)As for his motivation for one last crack at an Australia side who have provided him with some of the most challenging moments in international cricket, Moeen was more keen to focus on the draw of being back involved in one of his sport\u2019s marquee rivalries.\u201cIt\u2019s such a big series\u2026it\u2019s the Ashes, to be part of it would be amazing. It is a free hit. I\u2019m not playing for my spot. There\u2019s no pressure, really. All the things I ever wanted to do in Test cricket I\u2019m going to try to do in these games.\u201dThe pros and cons of the Moeen call-up are clear. On the positive side, none of England\u2019s other slow bowling options such as Will Jacks, Liam Dawson or Rehan Ahmed, come close to his experience or tally of 195 Test wickets.Yet there are those who see his long absence from red-ball cricket as a potential red flag and who would rather see a promotion for someone currently active in the County Championship.Moeen Ali has not played Test cricket since September 2021 (PA Archive)\u201cIt\u2019s a difficult one for me because I never picked myself. I just got the call,\u201d he said.\u201cObviously there are players out there that are playing and doing alright, but I think they (England) know me quite well and it\u2019s not just having the character and the person in the changing room that you want. The results do matter, the process, the matches. I\u2019ve got to perform and make some important impacts in the game.\u201dMoeen offered a remarkably honest assessment of his own style, openly accepting his limitations as a containing bowler and welcoming the freedom he is likely to be given to focus on attack.RecommendedJos Buttler believes Moeen Ali will thrive on return to England\u2019s Test side\u2018Mercurial\u2019 Moeen Ali tipped to make England stronger after Ashes returnMoeen Ali comes out of retirement to join England Ashes squad\u201cI\u2019ve never been able to hold an end up,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I have it\u2019s because I\u2019ve been taking wickets.

Among those sanctions was a decision by the World Boxing Council (WBC) not to recognise Russian and Belarusian fighters, including champions.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeTakeover broker Raine has continued talks with all bidders for Manchester United this week, as the prospective sale of the club enters its protracted final stages. Buyers have been reluctant to give a timescale on when they expect the process to be completed, as so many superficial deadlines have already passed.While most of the focus has been on Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Qatar\u2019s Sheikh Jassim-fronted bid, those bidding for a minority are still in the race. Most notably, no party currently sees themselves as out of it, even though the general feeling has been we are approaching the time when the Glazers are moving to \u201ccomplete\u201d.This confidence is most conspicuous in Qatar, given their camp didn't have that feeling two weeks ago. There was a widespread belief they were out of the race. The so-called \u201cfinal take-it-or-leave-it\u201d offer changed some thinking, and improved discussion. It is understood that bid is still of a lower overall value than that of Ineos, but the very fact that Qatar upped it at all is viewed as a strategic success for the Glazers.The involvement of Paris Saint-Germain\u2019s Nasser Al Kehlaifi is also instructive, as it displays the Glazers\u2019 intent to get Qatar to up the price.There is a view within industry circles that the United owners have long seen Ratcliffe as a \u201cstalking horse\u201d and that, if they are to actually sell, the intention has been to just gradually move Qatar up to the \u00a36bn valuation. While Ratcliffe has made his valuation clear and can't really go past a certain point, after all, the Glazers are naturally conscious of Qatar's ultimately limitless wealth. It has ensured the process has become \u201ca game\u201d, in the words of many sources.RecommendedSheikh Jassim bid still on table as Manchester United takeover tests patienceThe year that sportswashing won: A season that changed football foreverFA Cup final reveals key summer questions for Manchester UnitedIt is also why Qatar increasing their offer after the supposed last deadline is seen as a minor strategic victory for the Glazers. At the same time, there remains optimism within the Ineos camp, especially given the range of potential options they are giving the family. Avram and Joel Glazer, who are most attached to the club, could yet stay on.Industry insiders and sources connected to the situation put Monday night's flare-up down to Qatari media reports of online speculation.There remains confidence in the Jim Ratcliffe camp about their bid  (PA Wire)Chris Davidson, an academic expert on the Gulf who is a fellow at Durham University, believes the entire Qatar bid is a highly calibrated approach that has been influenced by the purchase of Harrods in 2010. Now owned by the Qatar Investment Authority, the flagship department store was sold to Qatar Holdings for a reported \u00a31.5bn. Sheikh Jassim\u2019s father, the then Qatari prime minister Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani, actually flew to London to finalise the deal with Mohammed Al Fayed.The senior Jassim said at the time that Harrods would add \u201cmuch value\u201d to Qatar\u2019s portfolio of investments, especially as a \u201chistorical place\u201d, although Davidson points out how the state was derided for overpaying at the time. He believes this has influenced the United takeover process in two ways, both related to the image of the state.One is over the symbolism of the price. The second is over the idea of giving the impression of some separation, to put more searching questions at a distance.\u201cThey\u2019re just calibrating their bid,\u201d Davidson told The Independent. \u201cThey could blow anyone out of the water, but they\u2019re calibrated to always be just a little bit around Ratcliffe.\u201cIt\u2019s a very different approach. I think this is an example of Qatar learning a lesson they found out the hard way on Harrods, where they were repeatedly pilloried for having overpaid. They really wanted Harrods. It\u2019s a particularly glamorous brand for people from the Gulf. The status it has given them among their Gulf rivals \u2013 not so much in the UK \u2013 is enormous. They were willing to overpay for that. I\u2019m sure they\u2019d be willing to overpay for Man United, too, but I think this was a case of having learnt their lesson.\u201dThis then plays into another strategic purpose, which is putting a perceived difference between the bid and the state. It is all the more important given the greater focus on state ownership in sport, especially with Manchester City\u2019s landmark treble victory and Saudi Arabia\u2019s recent escalation in its sporting investments. One of the points that has been made about the Ratcliffe offer is that it would be much quicker and cleaner to do, as there would be no resistance from other clubs, nor human rights-related issues. The Premier League in March updated its Owners and Directors Test to include a new provision based on Global Human Rights Sanctions Regulations in 2020. Qatar has faced huge criticism from groups such as Amnesty and FairSquare, with that debate framing the entire 2022 World Cup.Qatar have been careful to separate the Man Utd takeover bid from the state  (AP)\u201cBy calibrating it, it just allows them to hover under the radar of being so obviously a state-backed entity, \u201c Davidson explains. \u201cIf they said, \u2018right, we want it\u2019 just as they did with Harrods, and did a bid that blew everyone out of the water, it would be pilloried for being an uncompetitive offer that reflects badly on Qatar. It\u2019s an ongoing calibration as far as I can see\u2026 enough to win the bid without attracting too much negative attention or too much attention, it is ultimately state wealth.\u201cIf they calibrate their offer, one of the talking points becomes that it essentially can\u2019t be state backing. Otherwise, they\u2019d throw even more of it. It\u2019s clearly a stalking point bidding process.\u201dIneos is optimistic that this is not the case and that it has a real chance. Much will depend on how greatly the Glazers actually want to sell, which has remained a huge question throughout all of this.There remains a belief within the club itself that the Glazers\u2019 preference is to just raise enough investment to redevelop Old Trafford but retain control. It is the poor state of the ground that has actually brought them to this point, after all, as it has started to affect revenue. Many in United\u2019s hierarchy have taken note of just how impressive the new Tottenham Hotspur Stadium is, and what a revenue machine it is for the London club. The current Old Trafford can\u2019t offer that, and it was symbolic that it has been passed over for the Euro 2028 plans.That awareness runs alongside a persistent belief at the top of the game that elite clubs will see their value greatly rise in the years to come, particularly with the evolution of telecommunications and virtual reality technology. One industry source says that the new Chelsea owners were so keen to invest in the club \u2013 even for the much-pilloried \u00a3600m last season \u2013 because they believe they have bought an asset that could soon be worth \u00a39bn for \u00a32.5bn.The Glazers are conscious of this, too. While there had previously been a belief that the market for clubs had bottomed out, and that a sale now could offer a remarkable sum for each of the six siblings, there is also the view that this could just be a bad time to sell. They may miss out on huge future earnings.RecommendedFootball rumours: Arsenal closing in on Declan Rice for club-record feeMichael O\u2019Neill expects Ethan Galbraith to flourish after Manchester United exitManchester City\u2019s treble winners arguably greatest ever English team \u2013 Joe RoyleWhile this has been discussed among the Glazers, nobody really knows what they are thinking.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeWho doesn\u2019t love a little transfer speculation, Kylian Mbappe, arguably the world\u2019s most valuable footballer, finds himself yet again amidst transfer rumours worldwide. PSG miraculously managed to keep the star after it looked all but guaranteed that the speedy Frenchman would be taking his talents to Madrid. Mbappe was granted more than money in Paris as he was awarded a seat at the so-called table; given the power to help decide on manager, sporting director, and squad decisions. The Parisians believed this three-year deal would be more than enough to keep the World Cup winner happy in Paris.A letter Mbappe recently sent to the club stating his intention not to sign a contract extension after the conclusion of the 2023-2024 season shattered any dreams that PSG ownership or fans had of the starboy prolonging his stay in Paris.What was originally believed to be a three-year contract extension signed last summer has turned out to be a two-year deal with the option lying with Mbappe to extend after that 2023-2024 season. With Mbappe\u2019s intentions now clear, PSG must enter scramble mode as they risk losing their prime asset, one which they bought for \u20ac180 million, for free after the conclusion of next season.The situation presents the Parisians with two clear options for dealing with Mbappe: sell him this summer to the plethora of suitors, or convince him just as they did last summer of the advantage of staying in his home city. Here we look at the likely options for Mbappe this summer:RecommendedKylian Mbappe alerts Premier League clubs with surprise announcement about his futureHow Jude Bellingham can become the anti-Haaland for Real MadridLiverpool\u2019s must-add midfielder and Haaland 2.0 to Man Utd: Transfer targets for every Premier League clubReal MadridReal Madrid appears to be the obvious choice for a player who has long been tied to the historic club. After trying endlessly last summer to secure the rights to the star Frenchman, Madrid came out with nothing but false hope. For months it felt as though Mbappe lighting up the Bernabeu week after week would be a guarantee but Mbappe saw the Parc Des Princes as having too much to offer at that time to leave. One summer later the Madridistas believe they have found solace as they become yet again the frontrunner to sign Mbappe. Coming off a slightly disappointing season by Madrid standards that included a Copa Del Rey trophy, a second place La Liga finish, and a semi-final defeat to eventual champions Manchester City, Real Madrid are also set to lose legendary No 9 Karim Benzema. This represents a perfect transition period for Madrid as they look to bring in the hyper-talented Mbappe to replace the lost goals from Benzema\u2019s departure.Saudi ArabiaA mere few years ago the idea that a player of Mbappe\u2019s caliber in the prime of his career would go to a league such as the Saudi\u2019s would seem rooted in fantasy. Yet, as we have all learned money talks and the Saudi League sure has a lot. The PIF, or Public Investment Fund, is Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund that has been largely investing in sport over the past few years. This has seen them creating LIV Golf, purchasing 80 percent of Newcastle United in the premier league, and now, purchasing four of their home nation\u2019s 16 Saudi Pro League teams. With the wealth that these teams now possess and the high-profile names that have gone to Saudi Arabia in the past year, there seems to be at least a chance that Mbappe could venture to the Middle East.Al Hillal, Al-Nassr, Al-Ittihad, and Al-Ahil represent the four clubs that the PIF has taken over. Cristiano Ronaldo plays for Al-Nassr, while Lionel Messi was recently connected to Al-Hillal, which reportedly offered a three-year 1.6 billion euro deal to the Argentinian. Madrid\u2019s Benzema and Mbappe\u2019s Les Bleus teammate N\u2019golo Kante have signed with Al-Ittihad and Al-Ahil has just ventured up through promotion to the Pro League. If Mbappe were to venture to the Persian Gulf, Al-Hillal seems like an obvious choice with the empty spot and money left behind when Messi chose Miami over the Saudis. While the money for both PSG and Mbappe would be abundant it still seems a little far-fetched that a player of Mbappe\u2019s level, who still is in the beginning of his prime, would sojourn to one of these clubs. Recent history has taught us not to underestimate the lure of Saudi money; yet again there always remains a chance that the Saudi\u2019s offer a deal neither PSG nor Mbappe could refuse.PSGWhile Mbappe has made his intentions clear that he does not want to renew his contract into 2025, PSG still have the opportunity to convince their star to stay on yet again. Mbappe has enjoyed much success in Paris domestically, finishing as the league\u2019s top goal scorer in five straight seasons as well as securing five of six Ligue 1 trophies with the club.Yet, with PSG entering each Ligue 1 season as massive favorites, this domestic success does not seem to be enough to keep Mbappe happy. Success in the illustrious Champions League which defines Europe\u2019s best seems to be the next step for Mbappe who has seen his club flame out in back-to-back Round of 16\u2019s. How can PSG convince Mbappe of their future in this tournament with a jettisoned Messi and an aging Neymar must be the No 1 question in Paris. While it seems to be quite clear Mbappe has no intention of staying on, this same sentiment was echoed repeatedly just a year ago. One thing we can trust is that Mbappe will do what he sees as best for his future whether that is financially or on the pitch.Manchester United or the Premier League?

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeNikola Jokic completed one of the most improbable journeys in NBA history after guiding the Denver Nuggets past the Miami Heat 94-89 in a thrilling victory, securing a gritty series win and a first-ever championship.The Serb was named Finals MVP, joining New York Knicks legend Willis Reed as the only other second-round pick to win the award. Jokic averaged 30 points, 13.5 rebounds and 9.5 assists in 20 games in the 2023 playoffs.He is now one of 11 players who have secured two regular-season MVPs and at least one Finals MVP, joining legends such as Michael Jordon, Tim Duncan, Stephen Curry, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Moses Malone, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, LeBron James, Wilt Chamberlain and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.Denver went 16-4 during its playoff run, and Jokic led the playoffs in all points, rebounds and assists. No player in NBA history has ever achieved this during the playoffs. Jokic is unique. \u201cIt puts him in the legendary category for what he\u2019s done statistically in the Finals,\u201d Isiah Thomas, the former Detroit Pistons star, told ESPN. \u201cI don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anyone who\u2019s ever had a statistical run in the NBA Finals as a centre as he had in these categories.\u201dNikola Jokic celebrates winning the NBA championship and Finals MVP with the Denver Nuggets  (Getty )RecommendedMiami Heat mascot hospitalised after Conor McGregor punchDenver Nuggets with one hand on NBA trophy after taking 3-1 finals series leadMiami Heat rally late against Denver Nuggets to even NBA finals series\u201cThe job is done and we can go home now,\u201d said an earnest Jokic.Having grown up in a cramped two-bedroom apartment that he shared with his parents, two brothers and grandmother in northern Serbia, his basketball abilities were honed playing with his two older brothers, Strahinja and Nemanja. His father worked as an agricultural engineer to help provide for the family.When he was four years old, Nato troops bombed Serbia for 11 weeks in 1999 at the tail end of a war between Yugoslavia\u2019s six neighbouring states: Serbia, Slovenia, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. \u201cI remember things like sirens, bomb shelters, always turning off the lights,\u201d Jokic recalled in 2017 in a conversation with Bleacher Report. \u201cWe practically lived in the dark. Even at like 9am, everything was turned off.\u201dJokic left home when he was just 16 to play with Mega Leks, a Serb basketball team in the Adriatic League. By his third year, he was named league MVP, a sign of things to come. Nicknamed \u201cthe Joker\u201d, Jokic was selected by the Nuggets with the 41st pick in the second round of the 2014 NBA draft. His moment was slightly overshadowed when his name was called during a Taco Bell commercial, and the 6ft 11in star opted to remain in Eastern Europe for an extra season and finally arrived in Denver in 2015.Jokic competes with Miami Heat centre Bam Adebayo during the NBA Finals (AP)During the draft, Jokic was fast asleep in Serbia when he received a call in the middle of the night from his older brother, Nemanja. Nemanja informed his younger brother that he had been drafted into the NBA while popping a bottle of champagne. Jokic came into the league without draft pedigree. He was never supposed to be where he is today. Now he is arguably the best player in the NBA.The future Hall of Famer redefines modern-day positionless basketball as his unconventional playmaking and slick scoring blur the lines between a point guard quarterbacking the offence and a high-scoring big man. The NBA champion has proven to be unstoppable in the pick-and-roll. He bends defences with his smooth passing and soft touch around the basket. His man-to-man defence is unconventional, slow and ugly but it still gets the job done.Throughout his historic trip to the NBA finals, Jokic has surprassed Wilt Chamberlain for the most triple-doubles in a single playoff run. The two-time MVP also won the championship without a single all-star teammate. The Joker has etched his name in history with his dominating playoff run, but he couldn\u2019t have done it without his co-star Jamal Murray.Jokic celebrates after the team won the NBA Championship (AP)Murray has averaged 26.1 points, 7.1 assists and 5.7 rebounds in 20 games in the 2023 playoffs. The Nuggets also put together a strong supporting cast of roleplayers that were tailor-made to play with the dynamic duo. The supporting cast, headlined by Aaron Gordon, included Michael Porter Jr, Bruce Bowen and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope to help propel the team into a championship calibre squad. The group has a chance to repeat as champs next year if they remain focused and don\u2019t suffer from complacency.RecommendedMiami Heat mascot hospitalised after Conor McGregor punchDenver Nuggets with one hand on NBA trophy after taking 3-1 finals series leadMiami Heat rally late against Denver Nuggets to even NBA finals seriesThe entire team orbits around their all-time great player as Jokic has revolutionised basketball with his offensive prowess, changing the way teams gameplan around one player. He is cut from the same cloth as Michael Jordan, LeBron James and Stephen Curry, as opposing teams create a game plan around stopping him. In the 2020 Orlando bubble, after the Denver Nuggets lost to LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers in the Western Conference Finals, it was clear that the Nuggets had the blueprint to be a championship contender. After empathically sweeping the Lakers in this year\u2019s conference finals, the team realised their full potential and came out on top.The NBA title ought to solidify Jokic\u2019s status as the best player in the NBA. Despite winning two regular-season MVPs, critics doubted if he could anchor a championship-level defence, and now he has silenced all who dismissed him."}, {"_id": "6488a02b51ac33a3962e17d4", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/transfers-midfield-bellingham-rice-mount-mac-allister-b2356154.html", "primaryCategory": "Football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Bellingham gone but who\u2019s next?

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeIt was not the first time Youri Tielemans had made headlines on the day of a major final. A couple of years after he decided the FA Cup with a superlative strike against Chelsea came something that was rather less of a bolt from the blue. It may be presented as a bolt to the claret and blue, given his move to Aston Villa had seemed increasingly likely, but it became fact a few hours before the Champions League final kicked off.A few days earlier came confirmation of a rather costlier move: Jude Bellingham\u2019s transfer from Borussia Dortmund to Real Madrid. Before the transfer window had officially opened, it was announced that Alexis Mac Allister was bound for Liverpool. European finals occurred amid thoughts of goodbyes and to a backdrop of uncertainty. No sooner had West Ham won the Conference League than chairman David Sullivan admitted what was long known: that Declan Rice will leave, providing an appropriate offer comes in. There is the possibility that either the out-of-contract Ilkay Gundogan or Bernardo Silva will bow out of Manchester City having won the Champions League in his valedictory appearance.They could form part of what looks like being a massive midfield merry-go-round. If transfers are a staple of every summer, and discussions about them seemingly a global fixation, 2023 should appear particularly busy in the centre of the pitch.Others seen in the Premier League this season who are either definitely or at least quite likely to be swapping clubs include Mason Mount, Mateo Kovacic, N\u2019Golo Kante, Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Granit Xhaka, Moises Caicedo, Romeo Lavia, James Ward-Prowse, James Maddison, James Milner, Naby Keita, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Tyler Adams, Scott McTominay, Fred, Jefferson Lerma, Joao Moutinho and Ruben Neves. That is before factoring in others whose departures might not be a genuine shock, a group that could include Conor Gallagher, Amadou Onana, Kalvin Phillips, Wilfred Ndidi and Brenden Aaronson, while Tottenham have their annual problem of what to do with Tanguy Ndombele and Giovani Lo Celso. And, given the Premier League\u2019s status as huge net importers, there is every chance of arrivals from abroad. Borussia Dortmund\u2019s Mo Dahoud seems likely to replace Mac Allister at Brighton. Borussia Monchengladbach\u2019s Manu Kone and Nice\u2019s Khephren Thuram are potential targets for others.RecommendedHow Jude Bellingham can become the anti-Haaland for Real MadridReplacement for Granit Xhaka and a No9 for Mauricio Pochettino: Transfer targets for every Premier League clubLiverpool begin midfield overhaul by completing Alexis Mac Allister signingA host of reasons are colliding, and not merely because high-level players are less likely to look for upheaval in tournament summers, making this probably busier than 2024. If there is the usual wish to upgrade, it is particularly pronounced at several clubs. Liverpool delayed their midfield rebuild, paid a price and only exacerbated their need for reinforcements. Erik ten Hag began overhauling Manchester United\u2019s midfield last year but it was always envisaged he would want at least one signing there this summer. Arsenal\u2019s swift improvement in the rest of the team highlighted the midfield as an area where, despite Xhaka\u2019s best season in London, they could be better and Rice would appear better. Newcastle\u2019s transformation into a Champions League club can bring a necessity to find alternatives, and potential superiors, to Eddie Howe\u2019s worthy workhorses, Sean Longstaff and Joe Willock. Maybe Ange Postecoglou will want to give Tottenham an injection of creativity.Declan Rice could be a key midfield domino to fall  (PA Wire)Then there is also a phenomenon that has been apparent for a while: it may be a sign of the Premier League\u2019s strength in depth or a failing on the part of some of the superpowers that some of the outstanding midfielders have not been at the supposed big six. Rice may be the most expensive example but the Brighton double act of Mac Allister and Caicedo, who attracted January bids from Arsenal and Chelsea, are other cases in point. Neves has been a player with enviable class who has shown admirable loyalty to Wolves but has been open in his desire for Champions League football.Indeed, one of the division\u2019s dynamics this season, which in turn should speed up the revolving door of midfielders, is the relegation of sides with quality performers. The precocious Lavia never seemed likely to stay at Southampton for long but Ward-Prowse, whose consistency and set-piece delivery had drawn bids before, could have been a Saints lifer had they stayed up forever. Likewise, it is hard to envisage Adams in the Championship with Leeds. Their contractual situations may have meant Leicester would have always lost Maddison and Tielemans but demotion reduces their bargaining power for the Englishman.The Belgian belongs in two categories. Some of the midfield business comes because an unusually high number of talents are available on free transfers. Gundogan could be the most prominent of them, unless City persuade their captain to re-sign. Liverpool\u2019s frustration with the injuries of Keita and Oxlade-Chamberlain meant neither was offered deals.Then there is Kante, who is also part of another cause: Chelsea\u2019s great disruptors, committed to inexplicable revolution. Todd Boehly and co may be taking a wrecking ball to a Champions League-winning team without intending to. Kante highlights the sudden emergence of supersized offers from Saudi Arabia as a new element in the market. But if Kovacic goes, it will be in part because Chelsea have contrived to alienate their existing players with their incessant focus on the new. If Mount and Gallagher are sold, they are enforced moves to try and balance the books \u2013 especially for Financial Fair Play regulations \u2013 after ludicrous spending. Meanwhile, of course, Chelsea will carry on bidding: indeed if most of Kante, Kovacic, Loftus-Cheek, Gallagher and Mount depart, they could somehow end up short of midfielders and needing to spend again, a few months after paying \u00a3107m for Enzo Fernandez.RecommendedManchester City quintet set to arrive for England duty on Tuesday eveningJoelinton discloses that he suffered racist abuse after loss to ArsenalArsenal forward misses out on fourth World Cup after being cut from squadOthers have more legitimate reasons to buy: just to replace. City will, if Gundogan goes. West Ham must look for a future beyond Rice and, as the reality is they will not recruit someone of his calibre, that may entail bringing in two midfielders. In turn, that can keep money swirling around, powering the merry-go-round. Some of the available players may find themselves in limbo for a while due to the excellence of others: those stuck on shortlists below Rice or Gundogan or Maddison or Lavia or Mount may have to wait to see where they go and when and what that means. The sheer number of compelling options available could make it a buyer\u2019s market, even if some sizeable fees are inevitable. Some of the more astute recruiters seem to have done fine business early, in Tielemans, Mac Allister and Bellingham. Some European clubs may delay to pick up bargains at the end of the summer.The guarantee is there will be plenty more moves. Because by the time the window closes, virtually every midfield is likely to look different, some completely. After a Champions League final decided by a midfielder, this could be the summer of many midfielders."}, {"_id": "6488a02b51ac33a3962e17d5", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/cricket/michael-vaughan-edgbaston-marcus-trescothick-freddie-flintoff-kevin-pietersen-b2356635.html", "primaryCategory": "Cricket", "subCategories": "test", "title": "England were playing \u2018Bazball\u2019 during 2005 Ashes series win \u2013 Michael Vaughan", "lead": "The current England team have developed into an attacking and entertaining Test unit under the guidance of coach Brendan McCullum \u2013 nicknamed Baz.", "author": "Andy Hampson", "datePublished": "Tue, 13 Jun 2023 12:56:40 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:58:19.976348", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-13T12:56:40+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/13/14/0a2f784e77ef9fcf7907bc6cfc56d87aY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg2NzQ1NDA1-2.2523265.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free sport newsletter for all the latest news on everything from cycling to boxingSign up to our free sport email for all the latest news\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

That\u2019s kind of true of me on the rugby pitch as well \u2013 a lot of people say my tries are walk-ins, but you\u2019ve got to be there in the right position.\u201cHaaland is always lurking. He\u2019s a great finisher and a great footballer, but for me it\u2019s his ability to know where to be that stands out.\u201dMurley\u2019s 15 touch downs last season \u2013 he was also second-highest try scorer behind Max Malins in 2021-22 \u2013 have put him in contention for World Cup selection and he could win his first cap during the four warm-up Tests.While possessing a nose for the line and surprising power for a 23-year-old who is 5ft 8in and weighs 15st 2lbs, developing familiarity with his team-mates has been just as instrumental to his consistency as a finisher.He added: \u201cA lot of it comes down to who you are playing with and if you know them well enough. Do you know what they\u2019re going to do?\u201cFor example, I know that Andre Esterhuizen and Alex Dombrandt will probably make gainline and will look for off-loads, so fishing in and around those two is very good.\u201cAnd of course Marcus Smith can pull a crossfield kick out of anywhere. He likes me to be in certain positions on the touchline \u2013 if he has a couple of looks and there\u2019s space there then I know he\u2019s going to do that.\u201cThose relationships are really important, but there are also other things that you need to practise day in day out on the training field.\u201cMainly I do one on ones. I\u2019m a bit different to other wingers. I don\u2019t have the best feet out there, but I\u2019m also more powerful than some. So I practise grabbing bigger people and practise finishing drills.\u201cMy power has come from when I played back row when I was younger. I was never the biggest so I\u2019ve always had to punch above my weight.\u201dRevitalised by a mandatory five-week rest period that included 10 days spent in Marbella, Murley has been selected in England\u2019s first training squad of the summer with clear instructions from head coach Steve Borthwick on what is expected.\u201cSteve has given general instructions to all the back three. He wants us to be aerially dominant, so he\u2019s asked us to always work on the high ball,\u201d he said.\u201cThe way the international game is going, there is a lot more kick chase, but they want that to be done at as high a speed as possible so we\u2019ve been doing lots of sprint repeats.RecommendedManchester City quintet set to arrive for England duty on Tuesday eveningIt\u2019s all about legacy \u2013 Richard Riakporhe on using his platform to help othersNottingham Open to commence as normal despite \u2018horrific\u2019 incident in city centre\u201cSteve also wants us to be physical \u2013 the most physical wingers in the world.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeWith the 2022/23 season completed and Premier League clubs now focused on the summer transfer window, WhoScored.com take a look at which players suit each team\u2019s biggest need over the next eight weeks.You can see the first part from Arsenal to Fulham here.LiverpoolWhat do they need - central midfielderWho should they sign - Manu KoneLiverpool have signed Alexis Mac Allister from Brighton, but the Argentine won't be the only new central midfielder to make the move to Anfield this summer. Khephren Thuram and Manu Kone are also on the club's radar, with the latter the latest to be linked with a switch. Kone returned the seventh best dribble success rate (60%) in the Bundesliga last season, while he ranked 10th for possession won in the midfield third (109) and 15th for tackles per 90 (2.5) with the Gladbach star emerging as one of Liverpool's top midfield targets.RecommendedHow Jude Bellingham can become the anti-Haaland for Real MadridAlexis Mac Allister believes he can add to trophy collection with LiverpoolReplacement for Granit Xhaka and a No9 for Mauricio Pochettino: Transfer targets for every Premier League clubLutonWhat do they need - strikerWho should they sign - Antonio-Mirko ColakCarlton Morris was the leading light in Luton's successful play-off push having scored 20 league goals for the Hatters last season. However, beyond Morris, Luton have few attacking alternatives to ease the burden on the 27-year-old. For context, centre-back Tom Lockyer was their third-highest scorer, with four goals. Promoted teams often make the mistake of prioritising attack over defence, but Luton can ill-afford to rely on Morris to keep them up. Antonio-Mirko Colak started the Scottish Premiership season brightly, and ultimately ended the campaign with 14 league goals, but injuries hampered his long-term impact, so much so that he hasn't started a league game since March. The Croat could prove a crucial signing in the final third were they to make a move for the Rangers man.Manchester CityWhat do they need - right wingerWho should they sign - Wilfried GnontoWhile a team chasing a historic treble is unlikely to really need to strengthen in the off-season, Manchester City could certainly use the summer to bring in another right winger. Riyad Mahrez is now the wrong side of 30, and while a success under Pep Guardiola, the champions need to plan for life beyond the Algerian. Relegated Leeds will be aware they need to cut costs, with Wilfried Gnonto a sellable asset on the books at Elland Road. The Italy international works hard off the ball, too, as evidenced by a return of 1.8 tackles per 90, and this would certainly appease Guardiola.Manchester UnitedWhat do they need - strikerWho should they sign - Rasmus HojlundHarry Kane may be the priority for Erik ten Hag as the Manchester United boss seeks an overhaul of his attack, but with Real Madrid also interested in the Tottenham hitman, the Carabao Cup winners can't afford to be dragged into a bidding war. Rather, they should focus their efforts on securing the services of star-in-the-making Rasmus Hojlund. The Dane ended the 2022/23 Serie A season with a respectable nine goals and two assists to his name despite starting just 20 of 38 league matches. At 20 years of age, there is more to come from Hojlund, and fans should be desperate to see the Atalanta man develop into a world-class striker at Old Trafford.Rasmus Hojlund has impressed for Atalanta (AP)NewcastleWhat do they need - attacking midfielderWho should they sign - James MaddisonFollowing their Champions League return, Newcastle need to add quality bodies to the squad as they gear up to compete on multiple fronts following a successful season under Eddie Howe. James Maddison is one linked with a move to St. James' Park and having scored 10 and provided nine assists, the 26-year-old certainly proved his worth for a relegated Leicester side. Able to cover a number of roles in the final third, Newcastle won't have a straight shot at Maddison, but he's one who'd boost their chances of another top-four finish and silverware next season.Nottingham ForestWhat do they need - goalkeeperWho should they sign - Dean HendersonNottingham Forest were fortunate enough to convince Keylor Navas to join on loan from PSG in January to ease Dean Henderson's injury, though the Costa Rican is unlikely to make a permanent switch to the City Ground. As such, Forest should explore the possibility of signing Henderson once the transfer window opens. The 26-year-old is unlikely to establish himself as first choice at parent club Manchester United, who themselves are looking to sign a new shot-stopper, so would be open to Henderson's sale.Sheffield UnitedWhat do they need - attacking midfielderWho should they sign - Carney ChukwuemekaWhile it remains to be seen whether Sheffield United can retain the services of on-loan Manchester City pair James McAtee and Tommy Doyle, the Blades could maximise the loan market once more in order to bring fresh blood into the side. Chelsea spent big to sign Carney Chukwuemeka from Aston Villa, and he is very much one for the future. However, he needs game time to continue his development, something that may prove hard to come by at Stamford Bridge next season. New boss Mauricio Pochettino will likely want a first look at Chukwuemeka before making a decision on his future, but if the Blades are unable to keep McAtee and Doyle, the former Aston Villa teenager would help ease their respective returns to City.TottenhamWhat do they need - goalkeeperWho should they sign - David RayaTottenham are set to undergo a major rebuild this summer under Ange Postecoglou, and the best position to start is in goal. Hugo Lloris is set to leave north London, so the Frenchman's successor should be the priority. A ball-playing goalkeeper is key, with David Raya rightly their number one target. Brentford have already signed Raya's replacement in Mark Flekken, and that may soften their stance on the Spaniard. The 27-year-old ranked first for saves (154) and third for accurate long balls (410) in Europe's top five leagues this season, and could prove the perfect new goalkeeper for Spurs.Brentford goalkeeper David Raya is wanted by Tottenham (PA Wire)West HamWhat do they need - central midfielderWho should they sign - James Ward-ProwseGiven Declan Rice's likely exit once West Ham's Europa Conference League campaign is done and dusted, the Hammers will need a new midfielder to ease the England international's exit. West Ham will command a huge fee for Rice, so they need to be wise in the summer market in order not to be priced out of a move for a successor. That being said, Southampton will likely have demanded a big price for James Ward-Prowse anyway, with the Saints captain set to leave on the back of their relegation. The 28-year-old ranked seventh for key passes (74) in the Premier League last season and he could prove the right player to help pick up the pieces if, or when, Rice departs.WolvesWhat do they need - strikerRecommendedTalking points as England look to turn tables on Australia in Women\u2019s AshesKylian Mbappe alerts Premier League clubs with surprise announcement about his futureJack Grealish revels as Manchester City parade trebleWho should they sign - Folarin BalogunLike Chelsea, Wolves' primary issue was the inability to hit the back of net. Indeed, they scored fewer goals (31) than any other Premier League side last season, and with Raul Jimenez and Diego Costa unlikely to be Wolves players once the summer window closes, they need investment in attack. If they can convince Arsenal to sell Folarin Balogun, then the USA international could be what they need to reignite their stagnant frontline. Balogun scored 21 league goals from Reims last season and after a taste of regular first-team action, is unlikely to settle for a spot on the bench at the Emirates. RB Leipzig had been linked with a move for the 21-year-old, but their decision to firm up their interest in Lens hitman Lois Openda means Wolves may yet have a chance to sign Balogun."}, {"_id": "6488a02d51ac33a3962e17da", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/boxing/joe-joyce-interview-career-record-b2356577.html", "primaryCategory": "Boxing", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Joe Joyce on heavyweight knockouts, oil painting, and teaching 60-year-olds to swim", "lead": "<p><strong>Exclusive interview: </strong>The Briton reflects on the creative endeavours that gave way to a \u2018destructive\u2019 career in the ring</p>", "author": "Alex Pattle", "datePublished": "Tue, 13 Jun 2023 11:49:49 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:58:21.094706", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-13T11:49:49+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2022/10/27/15/newFile-5.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free sport newsletter for all the latest news on everything from cycling to boxingSign up to our free sport email for all the latest news\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeFor someone who is such a monolith of a man, there are a surprising number of layers to Joe Joyce. At certain points during our half-hour conversation, Joe Joyce the heavyweight boxer is speaking; at others, it\u2019s Joe Joyce the fine-art student, the swimming instructor, the cheerleader, or the trumpet player.\u201cWhen I was a swimming and diving teacher, it was a really great feeling to have someone who was really afraid of the water and to get their head under the water \u2013 or have them swimming three, four strokes by the end,\u201d the Londoner tells The Independent. \u201cTo have people who have spent their life not being able to swim, and to get them to even put their head under the water in their late sixties and seventies, that\u2019s something I found really rewarding. \u201cI also played trumpet for quite a few years, I was in the choir at school. I could do a little bit of percussion; I used to go on music holidays. My little brother is the more musical one; he\u2019s at uni doing something musical and was in the Brit School; he was also in Thriller Live. My dad\u2019s an art teacher, he restores antique mirror frames, and my mum was into pottery; she does a series of African-esque heads. Growing up, music and sport was encouraged, as was art. I did my first oil painting when I was seven years old.\u201cIt would be nice to make more art and create more things, be more creative than the destructive boxing side.\u201dThese other sides to Joyce are all \u201cauthentic\u201d elements of the 37-year-old, as he puts it.RecommendedJoe Joyce arrives at boxing\u2019s top table with brutal knockout of Joseph ParkerTyson Fury: Joe Joyce \u2018couldn\u2019t lace my boots\u2019 but beats Anthony Joshua and Oleksandr UsykTyson Fury to record \u2018Sweet Caroline\u2019 cover for mental health charity\u201cI wake up Joe Joyce, I go to sleep Joe Joyce. I\u2019d like to inspire the next generation coming up and teach them, lead by example. It\u2019s good to give back. I\u2019d like to lead a movement, like how Muhammad Ali transcended boxing and is one of these pivotal names in history \u2013 like Bruce Lee, Bob Marley, Michael Jordan. That\u2019s the kind of thing I\u2019d like to leave behind, or at least something close to that.\u201dThey are huge aspirations for a man who comes across so humbly, but while there is some way for Joyce to go in achieving such status, his profile swelled significantly in the aftermath of his knockout of Joseph Parker in September 2022. \u201cOvernight I saw the change, where people were kind of putting me in the top five [at heavyweight] and were interested and excited about certain match-ups with these top fighters,\u201d he says.Joyce stopped Parker in the 11th round in Manchester  (PA Wire)Joyce, who claimed silver for Great Britain at the 2016 Olympics in Rio, hammered Parker to the canvas with a left hook in the 11th round in Manchester to become interim WBO champion. \u201cWhen I was in there, I couldn\u2019t remember what shot I stopped him with; it wasn\u2019t until I got back to the changing room and they showed me the clip of it. I was like, \u2018Woah!\u2019\u201d The final shot capped off an indefatigable performance from Joyce, who marched down the New Zealander relentlessly and was unperturbed by Parker\u2019s best strikes. \u201cHe did his best, he put his best effort in, and it wasn\u2019t enough,\u201d Joyce says matter-of-factly, before morphing his voice into a fine impression of a 1970s professional wrestler: \u201cAnd it\u2019s gonna take a wrecking ball to take me down, I\u2019ll tell you that much!\u201d he bellows, making a whipping motion with his index finger, before his voice cracks into a laugh.Unfortunately for the Briton, Zhilei Zhang became that wrecking ball in April. While the Chinese heavyweight did not quite take down Joyce, he battered the \u201cJuggernaut\u201d\u2019s right eye to the point of closure, forcing the referee to wave off the bout in Round 6.With the result, Joyce lost the WBO Interim belt and saw his professional record fall to 15-1 (with 14 of his wins having come via knockout). The clashes with Parker and Zhang, similar to Joyce\u2019s bout with rising heavyweight Daniel Dubois in 2020, were risky affairs on paper. But in a business in which the best rarely do battle with one another, Joyce has shown no trepidation in confronting tough combatants. At 37, he cannot afford to waste time on tune-up fights or meaningless match-ups.Joyce became interim WBO heavyweight champion by beating Parker  (Getty)\u201cI\u2019m not out here just to earn money or be heavyweight champion of the world,\u201d he insists. \u201cIt\u2019s about taking them challenges on and overcoming them. I think some of that can be lost in the sport. It\u2019d be good to bring back those good times of everybody fighting everybody. People don\u2019t wanna lose their \u20180\u2019. I don\u2019t know where that mentality came from... Maybe from Floyd Mayweather? That\u2019s why a lot of the [big] fights don\u2019t happen.\u201dIt is a trend that is at odds with what fans want \u2013 one that goes against basic fighting instinct, Joyce argues.\u201cThere\u2019s that excitement when you\u2019re at school, and someone in the playground shouts, \u2018Fight!\u2019 It kicks off, and the whole school gathers around... It\u2019s that primordial excitement that people get, it\u2019s that kind of raw entertainment. When I was in primary school, I had quite a few fights \u2013 two on one, or they\u2019d start the fight and I\u2019d finish it. I was always a head taller than everyone. Early days of rugby, there\u2019d be five or six guys hanging on to me, trying to slow me down.\u201dIronically, a criticism of Joyce has been his perceived lack of speed, but if that is a valid critique then it has not prevented the Juggernaut from building momentum in fights through his pressure and the volume of his output. Before Joyce\u2019s meeting with Zhang, there was a clamour for the Briton to face the likes of Tyson Fury and fellow Olympian Anthony Joshua. The visual of Joyce being scaled by school students on the rugby pitch, coupled with discussions around Fury and Joshua, leads us naturally onto whether Joyce would rather fight five smaller Furys or one gargantuan Joshua.Joyce celebrates with his team after stopping Parker (Getty)\u201cFive little Furys would be a pain in the ass, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d he laughs. \u201cThat\u2019d be so annoying, being surrounded by them!

Buyers have been reluctant to give a timescale on when they expect the process to be completed, as so many superficial deadlines have already passed.While most of the focus has been on Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Qatar\u2019s Sheikh Jassim-fronted bid, those bidding for a minority are still in the race. Most notably, no party currently sees themselves as out of it, even though the general feeling has been we are approaching the time when the Glazers are moving to \u201ccomplete\u201d.This confidence is most conspicuous in Qatar, given their camp didn't have that feeling two weeks ago. There was a widespread belief they were out of the race. The so-called \u201cfinal take-it-or-leave-it\u201d offer changed some thinking, and improved discussion. It is understood that bid is still of a lower overall value than that of Ineos, but the very fact that Qatar upped it at all is viewed as a strategic success for the Glazers.The involvement of Paris Saint-Germain\u2019s Nasser Al Kehlaifi is also instructive, as it displays the Glazers\u2019 intent to get Qatar to up the price.There is a view within industry circles that the United owners have long seen Ratcliffe as a \u201cstalking horse\u201d and that, if they are to actually sell, the intention has been to just gradually move Qatar up to the \u00a36bn valuation. While Ratcliffe has made his valuation clear and can't really go past a certain point, after all, the Glazers are naturally conscious of Qatar's ultimately limitless wealth. It has ensured the process has become \u201ca game\u201d, in the words of many sources.RecommendedSheikh Jassim bid still on table as Manchester United takeover tests patienceThe year that sportswashing won: A season that changed football foreverFA Cup final reveals key summer questions for Manchester UnitedIt is also why Qatar increasing their offer after the supposed last deadline is seen as a minor strategic victory for the Glazers. At the same time, there remains optimism within the Ineos camp, especially given the range of potential options they are giving the family. Avram and Joel Glazer, who are most attached to the club, could yet stay on.Industry insiders and sources connected to the situation put Monday night's flare-up down to Qatari media reports of online speculation.There remains confidence in the Jim Ratcliffe camp about their bid  (PA Wire)Chris Davidson, an academic expert on the Gulf who is a fellow at Durham University, believes the entire Qatar bid is a highly calibrated approach that has been influenced by the purchase of Harrods in 2010. Now owned by the Qatar Investment Authority, the flagship department store was sold to Qatar Holdings for a reported \u00a31.5bn. Sheikh Jassim\u2019s father, the then Qatari prime minister Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani, actually flew to London to finalise the deal with Mohammed Al Fayed.The senior Jassim said at the time that Harrods would add \u201cmuch value\u201d to Qatar\u2019s portfolio of investments, especially as a \u201chistorical place\u201d, although Davidson points out how the state was derided for overpaying at the time. He believes this has influenced the United takeover process in two ways, both related to the image of the state.One is over the symbolism of the price. The second is over the idea of giving the impression of some separation, to put more searching questions at a distance.\u201cThey\u2019re just calibrating their bid,\u201d Davidson told The Independent. \u201cThey could blow anyone out of the water, but they\u2019re calibrated to always be just a little bit around Ratcliffe.\u201cIt\u2019s a very different approach. I think this is an example of Qatar learning a lesson they found out the hard way on Harrods, where they were repeatedly pilloried for having overpaid. They really wanted Harrods. It\u2019s a particularly glamorous brand for people from the Gulf. The status it has given them among their Gulf rivals \u2013 not so much in the UK \u2013 is enormous. They were willing to overpay for that. I\u2019m sure they\u2019d be willing to overpay for Man United, too, but I think this was a case of having learnt their lesson.\u201dThis then plays into another strategic purpose, which is putting a perceived difference between the bid and the state. It is all the more important given the greater focus on state ownership in sport, especially with Manchester City\u2019s landmark treble victory and Saudi Arabia\u2019s recent escalation in its sporting investments. One of the points that has been made about the Ratcliffe offer is that it would be much quicker and cleaner to do, as there would be no resistance from other clubs, nor human rights-related issues. The Premier League in March updated its Owners and Directors Test to include a new provision based on Global Human Rights Sanctions Regulations in 2020. Qatar has faced huge criticism from groups such as Amnesty and FairSquare, with that debate framing the entire 2022 World Cup.Qatar have been careful to separate the Man Utd takeover bid from the state  (AP)\u201cBy calibrating it, it just allows them to hover under the radar of being so obviously a state-backed entity, \u201c Davidson explains. \u201cIf they said, \u2018right, we want it\u2019 just as they did with Harrods, and did a bid that blew everyone out of the water, it would be pilloried for being an uncompetitive offer that reflects badly on Qatar. It\u2019s an ongoing calibration as far as I can see\u2026 enough to win the bid without attracting too much negative attention or too much attention, it is ultimately state wealth.\u201cIf they calibrate their offer, one of the talking points becomes that it essentially can\u2019t be state backing. Otherwise, they\u2019d throw even more of it. It\u2019s clearly a stalking point bidding process.\u201dIneos is optimistic that this is not the case and that it has a real chance. Much will depend on how greatly the Glazers actually want to sell, which has remained a huge question throughout all of this.There remains a belief within the club itself that the Glazers\u2019 preference is to just raise enough investment to redevelop Old Trafford but retain control. It is the poor state of the ground that has actually brought them to this point, after all, as it has started to affect revenue. Many in United\u2019s hierarchy have taken note of just how impressive the new Tottenham Hotspur Stadium is, and what a revenue machine it is for the London club. The current Old Trafford can\u2019t offer that, and it was symbolic that it has been passed over for the Euro 2028 plans.That awareness runs alongside a persistent belief at the top of the game that elite clubs will see their value greatly rise in the years to come, particularly with the evolution of telecommunications and virtual reality technology. One industry source says that the new Chelsea owners were so keen to invest in the club \u2013 even for the much-pilloried \u00a3600m last season \u2013 because they believe they have bought an asset that could soon be worth \u00a39bn for \u00a32.5bn.The Glazers are conscious of this, too. While there had previously been a belief that the market for clubs had bottomed out, and that a sale now could offer a remarkable sum for each of the six siblings, there is also the view that this could just be a bad time to sell. They may miss out on huge future earnings.RecommendedFootball rumours: Arsenal closing in on Declan Rice for club-record feeMichael O\u2019Neill expects Ethan Galbraith to flourish after Manchester United exitManchester City\u2019s treble winners arguably greatest ever English team \u2013 Joe RoyleWhile this has been discussed among the Glazers, nobody really knows what they are thinking.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeGabri Veiga, tipped to be the next young star of Spanish football, has a long list of skills and abilities, but if one thing sticks out about this supremely confident 21-year-old then it\u2019s his ability to strike a ball. The secret to his ball-striking abilities, however, may surprise you. \u201cI began playing football because of pumpkins,\u201d he has explained.Playing at his uncle\u2019s house when he was a toddler, he discovered a pumpkin on the kitchen floor and started to kick it \u201cout of curiosity\u201d. From then on, all he wanted to do was kick balls and he joined his first football club aged four.Later, as a 12-year-old, he was enrolled in the famed A Madroa academy of local Galician club RC Celta and now, in 2022/23, the attacking midfielder has emerged as one of the team\u2019s key players, working up a profitable partnership with Iago Aspas, the team\u2019s most senior and exceptional player and another who also came through the club\u2019s academy many years ago.Fast forward to this term and Veiga scored the two crucial goals on the final day of the season to see Celta Vigo beat champions Barcelona and secure their top-flight status.That could yet turn out to be his last action at Balaidos, with the likes of Liverpool, Chelsea and Newcastle United all being heavily linked with a move and the talented attacker sitting high on their list of priorities for this summer\u2019s transfers. Veiga\u2019s release clause is set at \u20ac40million (\u00a334.4m) - though it\u2019s perhaps worth noting that Celta have only sold one player for more than \u20ac15m since Nolito left for Man City in 2016.RecommendedJude Bellingham uses pain of England\u2019s near misses in bid for Euro 2024 glorySheikh Jassim waiting to hear if final offer to buy Man Utd has been successfulJoelinton: I received racist insults after Arsenal gameEleven goals - top ten among Europe\u2019s U21 playersBetween them, Aspas and Viega were responsible for scoring 23 of RC Celta\u2019s 43 LaLiga Santander goals in 2022/23 and the veteran striker has done his part in making the youngster feel comfortable, personally setting up two of the midfielder\u2019s 11 goals.Veiga\u2019s goal count this campaign, his first full season in the first team, is nothing short of stunning. Nobody scored more goals from midfield in LaLiga this season.In his age category, Veiga is truly standing out. Of all the Under-21 players in Europe\u2019s top five leagues, Veiga finished with the seventh-highest goal tally, only trailing the likes of Bayern Munich\u2019s Jamal Musiala and Arsenal\u2019s Bukayo Saka. Also, he is the Under-21 player with the second-most goals produced in LaLiga 22/23 (11 goals and four assists), only one behind Villarreal\u2019s Nicolas Jackson (12 and four). (LaLiga Celta Vigo CSM Gabri Veiga)Veiga is about much more than his goals, however. He has proved his versatility throughout his youth career, playing in every position aside from goalkeeper, centre-back and left-back.It is perhaps that rich variety of experience which has seen him to develop into the player he is today: a midfielder with remarkable vision and ability to make the final pass, with the courage and pace to take players on and the timing to run in behind defences and latch on to through balls.\u201cIn my career I\u2019ve only seen one or two players who have the characteristics of Veiga,\u201d said RC Celta coach Carlos Carvalhal, who has been in management for 25 years. \u201cHe is a very complete player. He has a different profile to all the other midfielders in Spain, who are usually about touch and possession. Gabri breaks games open.\u201dA player who can score different types of goalsAs Carvalhal alluded to, Veiga\u2019s qualities make him the ideal link between midfield and attack and his 11 goals this season showcased his various attributes.The two most eye-catching goals were his long-range rockets against Real Betis and UD Almer\u00eda, with the former being his first goal in front of the home fans at Bala\u00eddos, when he rounded three defenders before pinging the ball into the far bottom corner, while the latter goal was a thumping drive from outside the area with hardly any back-lift, which cannoned in off the crossbar. (LaLiga Celta Vigo CSM Gabri Veiga)His first goal had come against Atl\u00e9tico de Madrid, a first-time finish which crept in at the near post, while he produced an ice-cool shot to score against Sevilla FC after racing on to a through ball from Aspas.His best individual display yet, however, came in the thrilling 4-3 win at Real Betis earlier this month. He scored RC Celta\u2019s second goal with a cheeky lob right in front of goalkeeper Rui Silva after creating the danger himself with two clever headers. He then gave his side the lead by appearing at just the right time to knock in Jorgen Strand Larsen\u2019s cross from the byline.RecommendedJude Bellingham uses pain of England\u2019s near misses in bid for Euro 2024 glorySheikh Jassim waiting to hear if final offer to buy Man Utd has been successfulJoelinton: I received racist insults after Arsenal gameWhat next for Veiga? He was believed to be under consideration by Luis Enrique as a potentially surprise call-up for the World Cup and, even if he didn\u2019t go to Qatar, his debut for Spain\u2019s senior team cannot be far away. He is in the U21 squad for this month\u2019s fixture against Mexico.An international debut is bound to further raise Veiga\u2019s profile and confirm what everyone at RC Celta already knows: that he has what it takes to make it to the very top."}, {"_id": "6488a02f51ac33a3962e17e4", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/alf-ramsey-jude-bellingham-england-gareth-southgate-bobby-moore-b2356516.html", "primaryCategory": "Football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Jude Bellingham uses pain of England\u2019s near misses in bid for Euro 2024 glory", "lead": "The national team are in the midst of their most successful period since Sir Alf Ramsey led Bobby Moore\u2019s heroes to World Cup glory in 1966.", "author": "Simon Peach", "datePublished": "Tue, 13 Jun 2023 10:00:03 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:58:23.293230", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-13T10:00:03+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/13/11/b2af8576834523b10641b90866f5f1eaY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg2NzI5MDQ1-2.72455162.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Miguel Delaney\u2019s Reading the Game newsletter sent straight to your inbox for freeSign up to Miguel\u2019s Delaney\u2019s free weekly newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

The last one was a bit disappointing, but we probably played a harder opponent than the previous ones.\u201cThe way we went out was disappointing, but you take confidence in the fact that you can go toe-to-toe with one of the better teams in Europe.\u201cIt stands you in good stead when you know there\u2019s not many better teams on paper \u2013 you\u2019d like to think \u2013 that are better than us.\u201cSo, you take that confidence and you take the experience that we\u2019ve gained from the last few.\u201cThe goal is always to try and win it. That should be the goal for all of us going into it and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll try and do.\u201dBellingham does not lack confidence and nor should he given England\u2019s performances in Qatar.A narrow defeat to eventual finalists and Euro 2024 favourites France did for Southgate\u2019s side in the desert, where the midfielder says their progress was no mirage.\u201cI felt so confident going into that France game that we\u2019d get a result,\u201d said Bellingham, speaking in his role as ambassador for McDonald\u2019s Fun Football programme \u2013 which provides free, inclusive football coaching for children aged five to 11 across more than 1,500 locations in the UK.\u201cI think probably we fell short in the big moments for their goals and obviously the penalties and moments like that.\u201cThe majority of the game we didn\u2019t have clear chances, but when we did, we could have been a bit more decisive maybe. But, like I said, it\u2019s an experience to take into the next ones.\u201cI just really enjoyed the experience as a whole \u2013 relishing being away, playing in such a good team, having that pressure on me and on the team. It\u2019s something that I really enjoyed.\u201dBellingham underlined his place as one of the greatest talents in the world in Qatar, flourishing in England\u2019s midfield after a restricted but valuable role at Euro 2020.Aged 17 he became the youngest English player to feature in a major tournament, making three substitute appearances in a crash course summer of learning.\u201cIt was a bit of weird one for me because I didn\u2019t play (much),\u201d Bellingham said. \u201cIt was my first major tournament and I didn\u2019t play too much.\u201cBut I was still like a sponge while I was there, trying to learn from everything that was going on around me, having it in England as well.\u201cYou could see the pressure up close almost and you went to the games and the atmosphere was incredible. We fell short at the final hurdle, so you take a lot of experience from that.\u201cBut there\u2019s also a level of\u2026not regret but motivation that you can take from the tournament.\u201cI think, for me, the pain that I felt after that final and after the World Cup will definitely drive me in the tournaments to come.\u201dYou certainly would not back against ambitious Bellingham and his talented England team-mates as they look to finally land silverware in Germany.\u201cI\u2019d just say stick with us, really,\u201d the 24-cap teenager said when asked what his message to supporters would be.\u201cEngland fans can feel it themselves, They\u2019re ambitious, but they\u2019re not stupid. There\u2019s a reason for the kind of expectation and the hype around the team at the minute.\u201cThe truth is that we are delivering.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeJulianna Pena has labelled Amanda Nunes a \u2018coward\u2019 for retiring at UFC 289.Nunes, 35, retained the bantamweight title with a points win over Irene Aldana on Saturday, before calling time on a career seen by many as the greatest in women\u2019s mixed martial arts history.One of the few blemishes on the Brazilian\u2019s career came in 2021, when Nunes \u2013 who also holds the UFC women\u2019s featherweight title \u2013 was submitted by Pena with the bantamweight belt on the line. Nunes avenged the upset loss by dominating the American in 2022, and the pair were due for a trilogy bout at UFC 289 until Pena withdrew due to injury.Pena, 33, was in attendance in Vancouver to see Nunes retire, and the former champion said on The MMA Hour on Monday: \u201cThere was a part of me that really wanted to storm the cage. I had so many people like, \u2018Yes, we\u2019ll do it, we\u2019ll throw you over the gate!\u2019 Then my coach was like, \u2018Don\u2019t do it. Be classy and don\u2019t do it.\u2019 So, I let her have my moment, but it was really difficult for me, because there were so many times where my urge was to go, \u2018Now is the time, go, go go.\u2019\u201cBut at the end of the day, she\u2019s retired, she\u2019s off in the sunset, she\u2019s dead to me at this point, and we\u2019ve just got to keep the division moving. Now we\u2019re stepping into day one of the \u2018Pena Power\u2019 era. I\u2019m the champ, I\u2019ve always been the champ in my heart and in my head [...] It\u2019s just a matter of time before the belt\u2019s around my waist again.RecommendedMMA great Amanda Nunes retires after win over Irene Aldana at UFC 289Miami Heat mascot hospitalised after Conor McGregor punchMeet Charles Oliveira, the UFC\u2019s miracle man\u201cI\u2019ve been telling you from the beginning: She\u2019s been wanting to retire, she was one foot out the door the entire time. \u201cShe even said it herself: She was going to retire after she tapped to me, but she didn\u2019t, because she decided I\u2019m too good looking and she doesn\u2019t want me to have the belt. Seriously, she\u2019s got a problem with me.\u201dPena has not fought since losing the bantamweight title to Nunes last July. The rivals were set to headline UFC 289 until a rib injury forced Pena out of the bout, leading Aldana to step in.Nunes has retired from MMA as a double UFC champion (Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press/AP) (AP)\u201cAt the end of the day, Amanda didn\u2019t want the fight,\u201d Pena said. \u201cThe whole time, the UFC asked her to make the trilogy, she didn\u2019t want to make it, and they made that clear to me. They said, \u2018She doesn\u2019t want to fight you.\u2019 That\u2019s why it took so long to book the trilogy, and when I fell out because of injury, she said it was \u2018less heavy\u2019 for her. \u201cHopefully she comes back. That would be best-case scenario, so we can squash this thing and finish this trilogy. It was literally going to be the greatest trilogy in women\u2019s MMA. It\u2019s never happened before, and she lost that opportunity to make it happen. I lost that opportunity because I got injured, she lost that opportunity because she wants to retire early.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeWith the 2022/23 season completed and Premier League clubs now focused on the summer transfer window, WhoScored.com take a look at which players suit each team\u2019s biggest need over the next eight weeks.You can see the first part from Arsenal to Fulham here.LiverpoolWhat do they need - central midfielderWho should they sign - Manu KoneLiverpool have signed Alexis Mac Allister from Brighton, but the Argentine won't be the only new central midfielder to make the move to Anfield this summer. Khephren Thuram and Manu Kone are also on the club's radar, with the latter the latest to be linked with a switch. Kone returned the seventh best dribble success rate (60%) in the Bundesliga last season, while he ranked 10th for possession won in the midfield third (109) and 15th for tackles per 90 (2.5) with the Gladbach star emerging as one of Liverpool's top midfield targets.RecommendedHow Jude Bellingham can become the anti-Haaland for Real MadridAlexis Mac Allister believes he can add to trophy collection with LiverpoolReplacement for Granit Xhaka and a No9 for Mauricio Pochettino: Transfer targets for every Premier League clubLutonWhat do they need - strikerWho should they sign - Antonio-Mirko ColakCarlton Morris was the leading light in Luton's successful play-off push having scored 20 league goals for the Hatters last season. However, beyond Morris, Luton have few attacking alternatives to ease the burden on the 27-year-old. For context, centre-back Tom Lockyer was their third-highest scorer, with four goals. Promoted teams often make the mistake of prioritising attack over defence, but Luton can ill-afford to rely on Morris to keep them up. Antonio-Mirko Colak started the Scottish Premiership season brightly, and ultimately ended the campaign with 14 league goals, but injuries hampered his long-term impact, so much so that he hasn't started a league game since March. The Croat could prove a crucial signing in the final third were they to make a move for the Rangers man.Manchester CityWhat do they need - right wingerWho should they sign - Wilfried GnontoWhile a team chasing a historic treble is unlikely to really need to strengthen in the off-season, Manchester City could certainly use the summer to bring in another right winger. Riyad Mahrez is now the wrong side of 30, and while a success under Pep Guardiola, the champions need to plan for life beyond the Algerian. Relegated Leeds will be aware they need to cut costs, with Wilfried Gnonto a sellable asset on the books at Elland Road. The Italy international works hard off the ball, too, as evidenced by a return of 1.8 tackles per 90, and this would certainly appease Guardiola.Manchester UnitedWhat do they need - strikerWho should they sign - Rasmus HojlundHarry Kane may be the priority for Erik ten Hag as the Manchester United boss seeks an overhaul of his attack, but with Real Madrid also interested in the Tottenham hitman, the Carabao Cup winners can't afford to be dragged into a bidding war. Rather, they should focus their efforts on securing the services of star-in-the-making Rasmus Hojlund. The Dane ended the 2022/23 Serie A season with a respectable nine goals and two assists to his name despite starting just 20 of 38 league matches. At 20 years of age, there is more to come from Hojlund, and fans should be desperate to see the Atalanta man develop into a world-class striker at Old Trafford.Rasmus Hojlund has impressed for Atalanta (AP)NewcastleWhat do they need - attacking midfielderWho should they sign - James MaddisonFollowing their Champions League return, Newcastle need to add quality bodies to the squad as they gear up to compete on multiple fronts following a successful season under Eddie Howe. James Maddison is one linked with a move to St. James' Park and having scored 10 and provided nine assists, the 26-year-old certainly proved his worth for a relegated Leicester side. Able to cover a number of roles in the final third, Newcastle won't have a straight shot at Maddison, but he's one who'd boost their chances of another top-four finish and silverware next season.Nottingham ForestWhat do they need - goalkeeperWho should they sign - Dean HendersonNottingham Forest were fortunate enough to convince Keylor Navas to join on loan from PSG in January to ease Dean Henderson's injury, though the Costa Rican is unlikely to make a permanent switch to the City Ground. As such, Forest should explore the possibility of signing Henderson once the transfer window opens. The 26-year-old is unlikely to establish himself as first choice at parent club Manchester United, who themselves are looking to sign a new shot-stopper, so would be open to Henderson's sale.Sheffield UnitedWhat do they need - attacking midfielderWho should they sign - Carney ChukwuemekaWhile it remains to be seen whether Sheffield United can retain the services of on-loan Manchester City pair James McAtee and Tommy Doyle, the Blades could maximise the loan market once more in order to bring fresh blood into the side. Chelsea spent big to sign Carney Chukwuemeka from Aston Villa, and he is very much one for the future. However, he needs game time to continue his development, something that may prove hard to come by at Stamford Bridge next season. New boss Mauricio Pochettino will likely want a first look at Chukwuemeka before making a decision on his future, but if the Blades are unable to keep McAtee and Doyle, the former Aston Villa teenager would help ease their respective returns to City.TottenhamWhat do they need - goalkeeperWho should they sign - David RayaTottenham are set to undergo a major rebuild this summer under Ange Postecoglou, and the best position to start is in goal. Hugo Lloris is set to leave north London, so the Frenchman's successor should be the priority. A ball-playing goalkeeper is key, with David Raya rightly their number one target. Brentford have already signed Raya's replacement in Mark Flekken, and that may soften their stance on the Spaniard. The 27-year-old ranked first for saves (154) and third for accurate long balls (410) in Europe's top five leagues this season, and could prove the perfect new goalkeeper for Spurs.Brentford goalkeeper David Raya is wanted by Tottenham (PA Wire)West HamWhat do they need - central midfielderWho should they sign - James Ward-ProwseGiven Declan Rice's likely exit once West Ham's Europa Conference League campaign is done and dusted, the Hammers will need a new midfielder to ease the England international's exit. West Ham will command a huge fee for Rice, so they need to be wise in the summer market in order not to be priced out of a move for a successor. That being said, Southampton will likely have demanded a big price for James Ward-Prowse anyway, with the Saints captain set to leave on the back of their relegation. The 28-year-old ranked seventh for key passes (74) in the Premier League last season and he could prove the right player to help pick up the pieces if, or when, Rice departs.WolvesWhat do they need - strikerRecommendedTalking points as England look to turn tables on Australia in Women\u2019s AshesKylian Mbappe alerts Premier League clubs with surprise announcement about his futureJack Grealish revels as Manchester City parade trebleWho should they sign - Folarin BalogunLike Chelsea, Wolves' primary issue was the inability to hit the back of net. Indeed, they scored fewer goals (31) than any other Premier League side last season, and with Raul Jimenez and Diego Costa unlikely to be Wolves players once the summer window closes, they need investment in attack. If they can convince Arsenal to sell Folarin Balogun, then the USA international could be what they need to reignite their stagnant frontline. Balogun scored 21 league goals from Reims last season and after a taste of regular first-team action, is unlikely to settle for a spot on the bench at the Emirates. RB Leipzig had been linked with a move for the 21-year-old, but their decision to firm up their interest in Lens hitman Lois Openda means Wolves may yet have a chance to sign Balogun."}, {"_id": "6488a03051ac33a3962e17ea", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league-transfer-news-arsenal-chelsea-b2355891.html", "primaryCategory": "Football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Replacement for Granit Xhaka and a No9 for Mauricio Pochettino: Transfer targets for every Premier League club", "lead": "<p>From Arsenal through to Fulham, here are the first ten top-flight teams and the players they should sign </p>", "author": "Ben McAleer", "datePublished": "Tue, 13 Jun 2023 09:06:47 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:58:24.592615", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-13T09:06:47+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/12/13/Collage%20Maker-12-Jun-2023-01-08-PM-793.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Miguel Delaney\u2019s Reading the Game newsletter sent straight to your inbox for freeSign up to Miguel\u2019s Delaney\u2019s free weekly newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

First up: from Arsenal to Fulham.ArsenalWhat do they need - central midfielderWho should they sign - Moises CaicedoWith Granit Xhaka set for a Bundesliga return, Arsenal need at least two central midfielders this summer. Declan Rice remains the priority for the Gunners, yet the West Ham star can\u2019t be the only middle man that arrives this summer ahead of their return to the Champions League. Moises Caicedo is another linked with Arsenal and would offer an ball-carrying outlet from deep as well as terrific defensive capabilities to help fill the void that will be left once Xhaka departs.RecommendedTalking points as England look to turn tables on Australia in Women\u2019s AshesKylian Mbappe alerts Premier League clubs with surprise announcement about his futureJack Grealish revels as Manchester City parade trebleAston VillaWhat do they need - wingerWho should they sign - Harvey BarnesHaving secured a return to European football on the final day of the season, Aston Villa are aware they need to add strength in depth in the off-season ahead of Unai Emery\u2019s first full season at the Villa Park helm. A right-back, winger and striker are the priorities for the Villans this summer, with Harvey Barnes one who\u2019ll tick off a problem position. Barnes\u2019 goal exploits were overshadowed by James Maddison\u2019s form, but the 25-year-old still managed an commendable 13 league goals for the relegated Foxes.BournemouthWhat do the need - central midfielderWho should they sign - Tyler Adams (PA Wire)Bournemouth boss Gary O\u2019Neil worked wonders in the Cherries hotseat following his appointment as Scott Parker\u2019s successor, but if they are to avoid a relegation dogfight, they need to strengthen in key areas. One of those will be in the middle of the park, particularly with Jefferson Lerma departing following the culmination of his contract. Bournemouth could do a lot worse than raid relegated Leeds for Tyler Adams, the American having ranked third for tackles per 90 (3.7) in the Premier League last season.BrentfordWhat do they need - strikerWho should they sign - Viktor GyokeresIvan Toney\u2019s suspension leaves Brentford a little light up top. Granted, while the Bees have performed well in his absence, they can\u2019t head into the new season without the services of their 20-goal frontman until January. While a short-term addition would suit all parties, Brentford may instead seek to bring Viktor Gyokeres up to the Premier League. Coventry\u2019s failure to secure promotion means the Swede is seemingly up for grabs and having scored 21 and provided 12 assists last season, Thomas Frank\u2019s side would certainly benefit from the 25-year-old\u2019s addition.BrightonWhat do they need - central midfielderWho should they sign - Enzo Le FeeBrighton are set to lose both Alexis Mac Allister and Moises Caicedo this summer and while Mahmoud Dahoud and James Milner are tipped to arrive, the Seagulls still look a little light in the middle of the park. Enzo Le Fee was a standout performer for Lorient this season, yet will depart the French side in the coming weeks, and Brighton would be foolish not to consider the 23-year-old. Le Fee ranked third for tackles (108) and seventh for dribbles (68) in the 2022/23 Ligue 1 campaign, while an additional five goals and five assists has helped boost his reputation.BurnleyWhat do they need - central midfielderWho should they sign - Albert Sambi-LokongaBurnley will need an overhaul in central midfield this summer. They can\u2019t rely on 33-year-old Jack Cork to help beat the drop next season, and so a player who has worked under Vincent Kompany in the past would be a viable option for the Clarets. Albert Sambi-Lokonga spent the second half of last season on loan at Crystal Palace, though still struggled for minutes at Selhurst Park. Arsenal are unlikely to rely upon Lokonga next season, noted by their pursuit of high-profile midfielders, so another short-term move would certainly benefit the Belgian.ChelseaWhat do they need - strikerWho should they sign - Victor Osimhen (AP)To put it bluntly - Chelsea need a player to put the ball in the back of the net. Christopher Nkunku is set to sign for the Blues, but another striker would certainly aid their quest to launch a sustained title push under Mauricio Pochettino. Victor Osimhen wouldn\u2019t come cheap, the Nigerian having scored more goals (26) than any other player in Serie A this season, yet with Todd Boehly willing to loosen the purse strings, Osimhen could prove the perfect frontman for Chelsea, and one to rid them of the dreaded No.9 curse.Crystal PalaceWhat do they need - right-backWho should they sign - Sacha BoeyCrystal Palace were able to muddle through the season with Joel Ward and Nathaniel Clyne at right-back, but the pair are now 33 and 32 years of age, respectively, and the Eagles could do with some investment in defence ahead of the new season. While he has been linked with Arsenal, Sacha Boey could prove a shrewd capture for the Eagles. The 22-year-old was key in Galatasaray\u2019s title triumph and has made the second most tackles (86) in the Super Lig this season, so a committed body to shore up the defence would certainly be welcomed at Selhurst Park.EvertonWhat do they need - strikerWho should they sign - Alfredo Morelos (Getty Images)Everton have been linked with a move for Wout Weghorst, the Dutchman having worked under Sean Dyche during their short time together at Turf Moor, as the Toffees seek to sign another striker. However, Weghorst has a poor record in England having scored just two goals in 37 league appearances, so they may be better off perusing the free market. Alfredo Morelos will leave Rangers this summer upon the culmination of his contract and having scored 11 goals and provided five assists in the Scottish Premiership last season, the hot-headed Colombian could prove a handy pick up.FulhamWhat do they need - centre-backWho should they sign - Harry MaguireRecommendedManchester City\u2019s trophy parade in picturesRain and threat of lightning fail to dampen Manchester City\u2019s trophy paradeEverton fans get their wish as club \u2018sack the board\u2019Centre-back is hardly a problem position for Fulham, with Tim Ream, Tosin Adarabioyo and Issa Diop all performing admirably for the Cottagers as they beat the drop last season, but with the former now 35, some fresh blood would benefit Marco Silva\u2019s side. Harry Maguire is unlikely to be a Manchester United player once the summer transfer window closes and with their ongoing pursuit of Kim Min-Jae, the England international is expected to leave sooner rather than later.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeEngland will attempt to end a miserable past few years in the Women\u2019s Ashes and topple Australia for the first time since 2013-14 when the multi-format series starts next week.Here, the PA news agency assesses some of the burning issues ahead of the curtain-raising one-off Test at Trent Bridge which begins next Thursday.The greatest showHeather Knight recently harked back to making her England debut in Mumbai in 2010 \u201cin front of one man and his dog\u201d and, as a student, having to explain to her tutor why she would be absent for a month. Thankfully those days are over. The England captain was given equal billing alongside men\u2019s counterpart Ben Stokes on a Tower Bridge projection last week and ticket sales for the \u2018WAshes\u2019 have already exceeded a combined 70,000 for the seven matches. Even if there is still just a solitary Test, it will span five days in a break from the customary four-day affair \u2013 giving both teams a chance to claim a first Ashes win in whites since 2015. Barriers continue to be breached for Knight\u2019s side as they will also play T20s at Edgbaston, the Kia Oval and Lord\u2019s for the first time.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveLanning absence evens the odds?Issy Wong may have only played on 13 occasions for England but the fast bowler seems to revel in being tormentor-in-(mis)chief, remarking last month about Australia: \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty good time to play them.\u201d On the surface, this seems a peculiar comment given Australia\u2019s all-out dominance for much of the last decade. They are the double world champions and have held the urn for the last eight years, beating England on their own patch twice in that time. But there is a little substance to Wong\u2019s claims with Rachael Haynes retiring last year and now totemic captain Meg Lanning withdrawing from the upcoming series due to medical issues. Are Australia more vulnerable now? Unquestionably. Lanning is an exceptional captain and batter who has been in red-hot form. But her temporary successor Alyssa Healy is also a quality player, as are Ellyse Perry, Tahlia McGrath, Beth Mooney, Ashleigh Gardner and Jess Jonassen. Australia are still overwhelming favourites to continue their stranglehold over England.Who is the leader of England\u2019s attack?While Wong\u2019s slightly provocative observation was rooted in Australia selecting one or two more unproven talents, England also look a little light in certain areas. Katherine Sciver-Brunt may have had a peripheral role given her scaling back of commitments but the seamer\u2019s retirement robs England of crucial experience. Wong has shown in the last 12 months she can step up and be counted when the heat is on \u2013 notably at this year\u2019s Women\u2019s Premier League \u2013 so it may be the 21-year-old steps into the considerable void left by Sciver-Brunt. Fellow quick Kate Cross\u2019 battle against a tropical disease has cut into her playing time so she may not be up to speed for the Test while Lauren Bell is relatively untested.\u2018Jonball\u2019 faces its acid testSince succeeding Lisa Keightley as England head coach late last year, Jon Lewis has attempted to instil a more attacking mindset into his charges. Lewis has taken his cues from working alongside Brendon McCullum and Ben Stokes in the embryonic stages of the pair transforming the men\u2019s Test side, sensing this is the best way to break Australia\u2019s stranglehold on women\u2019s cricket. \u2018Jonball\u2019 \u2013 the term coined by star all-rounder Nat Sciver-Brunt \u2013 has had modest returns so far with a semi-final exit at the 2023 T20 World Cup but it seems England will keep ploughing the same furrow when Australia are in town.RecommendedRob Page says Wrexham\u2019s Paul Mullin must prove himself in EFL to earn Wales callNothing is going to change \u2013 Ben Stokes vows to stay true to beliefs in AshesFootball rumours: Arsenal closing in on Declan Rice for club-record feePressure on Heather?The decision to jettison Charlotte Edwards and promote Knight as England captain a little over seven years ago was controversial at the time. But barely 12 months into the role, Knight justified her ascension by leading England to a seminal World Cup triumph. She has been unable to land a telling blow in the Ashes, with one drawn series and two heavy points defeats. A third this summer might draw scrutiny on her position even if Australia are one of the greatest sides of all time in women\u2019s sport. Knight remains the natural leader of this England team and her authoritative presence was missed at the sharp end of last year\u2019s Commonwealth Games, a tournament she sat out because of injury."}, {"_id": "6488a03151ac33a3962e17ec", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/us-sport/tori-bowie-cause-of-death-baby-autopsy-b2356371.html", "primaryCategory": "US Sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Tori Bowie: Pregnant US Olympic sprinter\u2019s cause of death revealed", "lead": "<p>US athlete was found dead in Florida after police carried out welfare check </p>", "author": "Graeme Massie", "datePublished": "Tue, 13 Jun 2023 08:39:50 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:58:25.010796", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-13T08:39:50+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/05/03/15/Three-time%20Olympic%20medallist%20Tori%20Bowie%2C%20dies%20aged%20320A.00_00_00_00.Still001.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free sport newsletter for all the latest news on everything from cycling to boxingSign up to our free sport email for all the latest news\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe final day of the Premier League season saw only the relegation battle still outstanding to be sorted, ultimately with Leeds United and Leicester City joining Southampton in dropping down to the Championship - while Everton, again, survived.Naturally there will be plenty of off-field developments at each of the relegated sides, with Leeds a good example after the agreement of a club sale to the owners of the San Francisco 49ers. Alongside that, the natural implication of failing to survive in the top flight is that bigger clubs will come calling for those players deemed too good to go down.Rumours have already circulated around a number of those names and Youri Tielemans has already agreed to join Aston Villa after deparing Leicester; here are 12 more who could easily attract a move to a top-flight club this summer if their present sides feel the need to sell to balance the books after departing the richest league on the planet.James Ward-ProwseStarting with the side who are already gone, central midfielder and dead-ball expert Ward-Prowse will certainly be in demand. An England international, the 28-year-old hasn\u2019t been at his best this term but failings around him haven\u2019t helped. Still has eight goals and four assists in a dismal team, and it\u2019s hard to see him spending even a season in the Championship.RecommendedPremier League 2022/23 season awards: Best player, manager, transfer flop and breakthrough actAston Villa sign Youri Tielemans from LeicesterMan City secure landmark Champions League victory that stretches beyond historic trebleArmel Bella-KotchapWhile Saints\u2019 defensive unit as a whole has been far too porous, individually there are a couple of players who have impressed. Centre-back Bella-Kotchap is one, with some tenacious displays earning him strong reviews earlier in the campaign. Put him alongside a more experienced player in a more cohesive unit and it\u2019s safe to say his career is on an upward trajectory.Romeo Lavia (Getty Images)Another recent recruit, teenage midfielder Lavia is already interesting plenty of top-half clubs who have been impressed with his tactical intelligence as much as his ferocious defensive work, overstretched as he has been in the middle of the park and even with one or two errors on show, as is usual for young players. Considering this was a rookie season for him in the top flight he has acquitted himself very well and the Belgian is already capped at senior international level.Kyle Walker-PetersNot so much a star for the future this time, but Walker-Peters has long since proven his capabilities in the Premier League. Add in his versatility and the fact he has only two years left on his contract and this summer seems the right one for any clubs keen on him to make their move.Kamaldeen SulemanaOf all the January arrivals who failed to impact at Saints, former Rennes man Sulemana might be the biggest disappointment - and therefore potentially the bargain with the biggest upside. At age 21 there\u2019s a long runway for improvement for the Ghanaian, who can play wide or central in attack and showed what he\u2019s capable of on the final day with a brace against Liverpool - but then again perhaps a season as a guaranteed starter would actually prove more beneficial for him in the long run. If Saints keep hold of him he should be a standout star in the Championship.James MaddisonMoving onto the teams still fighting for survival, James Maddison looks to be one who might move on regardless of the final day. The creative attacker is certainly playing at a higher level than most of his Leicester teammates and has already been linked with the likes of Newcastle. Perhaps the only real factor at play here is the transfer fee; the Foxes might be able to ask for significantly more if they do beat the drop.Kiernan Dewsbury-HallMight be one Leicester hope to hang onto even if they are in the second tier, given he has a very long-term contract, but Dewsbury-Hall is almost certain to have top-flight admirers. Energetic, diligent in both halves of the pitch and with a sprinkling of magic about his play, the 24-year-old is too good for the Championship but might be too pricey to prise away.Harvey BarnesFinishing up at the Foxes, Harvey Barnes is already a known target - the Independentreported Aston Villa\u2019s keen interest in the left-sided attacking outlet this week. Despite Leicester\u2019s struggles he has 12 goals to his name this season and with two years remaining on his deal it\u2019s probably time to make a step up, since even if they survive this weekend, his club don\u2019t look like mounting a real revival any time soon.Timothy CastagneFar more wing-back than full-back, Timothy Castagne is a versatile defender who has had an up-and-down time at Leicester to be kind - but Arsenal have already reportedly eyed him up as a squad booster this summer, maybe on the cheap. The 27-year-old was a big-money recruit three years ago, and still has two years left on his deal. But relegation, along with the financial struggles the club have had over the past year or so, will lower the amount the Foxes can ask for.Tyler Adams (AP)Onto Leeds and the first probable departure is American midfield dynamo Tyler Adams. An excellent ball-winner, ball-carrier and team leader in the centre of the park, it\u2019s unthinkable he\u2019d drop down into the second division. An injury absence at the end of this season hasn\u2019t helped Leeds at all but he has long since shown himself a top performer.Luis SinisterraGiven the ability of some of their players, it\u2019s a bit of a wonder Leeds are down there at all - until you watch some of the defensive work, at least. At the other end of the pitch it can be a very different matter though and Sinisterra is another who, having fought around the top of the Eredivisie for Feyenoord before a \u00a325m last summer, surely won\u2019t be a Championship player. Injuries have hampered him this term but he\u2019s electric when fit.RecommendedKylian Mbappe alerts Premier League clubs with surprise announcement about his futureJack Grealish revels as Manchester City parade trebleManchester City\u2019s trophy parade in picturesWilfried GnontoOne of the bargains of the season, Leeds signed the Italian for about \u00a34m in September and he is a real gem in the making. Given the length of his deal and the fact he\u2019s only 19, perhaps he\u2019s one of those they\u2019ll hope to keep and shoot straight back up with - but other, bigger clubs have been impressed this season by Gnonto, make no mistake. He\u2019s already a senior goalscorer for Italy; he probably isn\u2019t going to be keen on facing Rotherham and Hull next term."}, {"_id": "6488a03151ac33a3962e17ee", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/ryan-reynolds-rob-mcelhenney-wrexham-preseason-b2356424.html", "primaryCategory": "Football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney confirm Wrexham USA tour to conclude in star\u2019s hometown", "lead": "<p>The Hollywood stars took over the non-league team and have overseen a promotion back to League Two </p>", "author": "Karl Matchett", "datePublished": "Tue, 13 Jun 2023 08:01:26 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:58:25.483788", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-13T08:01:26+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/13/08/GettyImages-1484215085%20%281%29.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Miguel Delaney\u2019s Reading the Game newsletter sent straight to your inbox for freeSign up to Miguel\u2019s Delaney\u2019s free weekly newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeMatt Fitzpatrick admits to being as confused as anyone about the direction golf is heading but insists it will not affect his thinking when he begins the defence of his US Open title on Thursday.The dust is still settling a week on from the shock announcement of the commercial merger between the PGA Tour, DP World Tour and PIF (Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund), which has been the backer of the breakaway LIV Golf.On the face of it golf\u2019s bitter civil war appears to be over but under the surface there are many so-far unanswered questions and residual feelings of resentment by a large section of the two main tours\u2019 membership at how they have been treated in the whole saga.But although several days have passed since PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan went on live network television in the United States with PIF governor Yasir Al-Rumayyan to announce the surprise deal there are very few details about how things will work, and that has led to dissent among the rank and file.\u201cI guess the whole thing is confusing. It was confusing last year,\u201d said the Sheffield golfer, who swerved a question about whether those players who remained loyal to the established tours should be suitably compensated for missing out on LIV\u2019s millions.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow live\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone knows what\u2019s going on.

Where is the wind?\u2019 That\u2019s all you\u2019re thinking about.\u201dFitzpatrick will have plenty of things to think about at the Los Angeles Country Club, which he last saw in February on a reconnaissance mission.\u201cNo, I think it\u2019s over-rated. I think you\u2019re not going to be stood on the first tee thinking \u2018Oh what\u2019s going on in the golf world?\u2019.That differs from Brookline, a course on which nine years earlier he had won the US Amateur.\u201cI seem to remember just last year just thinking about the tournament, just the US Open,\u201d he said.\u201cIt was obviously different because I had a tie to the golf course and the history there, so probably was easier for me to mentally focus on that and be in a better place than obviously all this confusion that\u2019s going on this week.\u201cI guess in this day and age you\u2019d like to think there might be some artificial intelligence you could use to kind of plot your way around.

had struck his first century for Lancashire, with Daryl Mitchell and George Bell contributing significantly to the hosts\u2019 first-innings 374 to give the home side a huge 232-run lead.A determined unbeaten second-wicket partnership between Fletcha Middleton (44 not out) and Nick Gubbins (45 not out) then helped take 95 runs off that advantage as Hampshire closed on 119 for one in their second

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe smallest sibling of the Primavera Sound superbrand, Porto\u2019s edition of the music festival sometimes feels as if it receives the headliner hand-me-downs of its Barcelona brother.This year, there\u2019s Blur, Halsey, Kendrick Lamar, Fred Again and Spanish superstar Rosalia \u2013 but Portugal misses out on a sprinkling of the big names who performed in Spain only days earlier, including Calvin Harris, Depeche Mode, and Christine and the Queens. To add insult to injury, all of those artists are on the bill for a third Primavera festival this year \u2013 the newcomer Primavera Madrid, which celebrates its first-ever outing the same weekend.Madrid\u2019s debut turns to disaster on 8 June when \u201csevere\u201d weather forces organisers to cancel the opening day. Thankfully, Porto avoids the same fate \u2013 but notably, not the torrential rain. There are other unfortunate glitches, not least a power failure during headliners New Order, interrupting a weekend that otherwise mostly delivers on its promise. Wednesday\u2019s headliner Kendrick Lamar is a spectacular live performer, although not the kind who spends much time interacting with the crowd. The rapper\u2019s set list spans 2011\u2019s woozy \u201cADHD\u201d and 2012\u2019s propulsive \u201cm.A.A.d city\u201d, plus covers of Pusha T\u2019s \u201cNosetalgia\u201d and The Weeknd\u2019s \u201cSidewalks\u201d. It\u2019s a crowd-pleasing concoction and one that would be even more pleasurable if we got a bit more from Lamar himself, especially given that his performance coincides with the most punishing downpour of the weekend, sucking the energy (and a decent chunk of the crowd) from the festival site.The following day brings better weather and, in fact, when the storm does return, it adds some drama to Fred Again\u2019s set during which the rainfall peaks amid the driving bassline of \u201cRumble\u201d. Perhaps it\u2019s the water or maybe it\u2019s his enthusiastic delivery, but Fred\u2019s pad controller breaks midway through his set, leaving him punching madly at buttons like a tweaking velociraptor, as samples fail to land in time. A replacement is quickly found.Recommended\u2018This is something we can continue to invest in\u2019: The future of live-streaming and festivalsThe 14 best music festivals in Europe, from Primavera Sound to Rock WerchterThe 11 best music festivals in the UK for 2023Thursday\u2019s headliner Rosalia is, by some margin, the highlight of the weekend. She is an innovative artist who manages to produce a pop vision that is at once so singular, confident, kooky, warm and feminine that it is strikingly out of step with her peers. On stage with her is an extremely zealous Steadicam operator who she pulls around like a giant hi-res selfie stick, beaming down the lens hypnotically. Whether she\u2019s swooning on the piano in huge single \u201cHentai\u201d or riding in circles with her scooter gang for \u201cChicken Teriyaki\u201d, nobody is having more fun. By Friday, the rain eases and the tension fades. Pusha T is known on record for possessing one of the coldest deliveries around, but his set is a total crowd-pleaser. The rapper flits from the 21-year-old Neptunes hit \u201cGrindin\u2019\u201d, taken from his Clipse days, to the Future single \u201cMove That Dope\u201d, and even a verse from Kanye West\u2019s \u201cRunaway\u201d.The stage is set for the Pet Shop Boys, who walk the line between cringe and cool better than anyone in pop. Tonight they are sensational, with outfit changes that include an iridescent mirrored anorak and a volley of singalong hits including \u201cCan You Forgive Her?\u201d, \u201cWhere The Streets Have No Name\u201d and \u201cLeft to My Own Devices\u201d.

To the abrasive boinging of the opening riff on \u201cPopscene\u201d, he bounds around the stage pumping his fist with a dynamism belying his 55 years. Alex James smokes his signature cigarette. It\u2019s a nostalgic set of no-nonsense and no filler that includes \u201cThere\u2019s No Other Way\u201d, \u201cGirls and Boys\u201d, \u201cCoffee and TV\u201d, \u201cSong 2\u201d and the soaring \u201cThis is a Low\u201d.

With its late-night headliners and limited shelter, this is an event optimised for sunshine. I am no irrigation expert, but I am far from the only one to notice that the rainfall streaming downhill from the tarmac to the grass of the main stage has mingled unappealingly with piss. By Friday, the main stage has marinated into a muddy bayou that wafts zephyrs of ammonia through the crowd. The toilets are finally closed on Sunday night, but a fishy odour hangs in the air throughout Blur\u2019s set.Primavera\u2019s line-up remains peerless, but this execution was a little out of step for what is considered by many to be the highlight of the entire global festival season. It\u2019s possible the team were spread too thin by their transition to three events and caught out by the surprise weather.

After two roundly well-received seasons in 2021 and 2022, Acapulco was renewed for a third run of episodes earlier this year.Access unlimited streaming of movies and TV shows with Amazon Prime Video Sign up now for a 30-day free trialSign upMy Kind of CountryReality TV has rightly been getting a bad rap lately, with singing competitions such as The X Factor or Britain\u2019s Got Talent coming under fire for their harsh treatment of contestants. This Reese Witherspoon and Kacey Musgraves-produced talent show, however, is a welcome respite. Judges Jimmie Allen, Mickey Guyton and Orville Peck nurture a roster of aspiring country singers through the rounds of this uplifting series, which subverts a lot of problematic time-worn trends about who gets to become a country music star.PlatonicIn Platonic, Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne play Will and Sylvia, two former best friends who reconnect in their early 40s after Will gets a divorce. There\u2019s much to like about this sitcom, which plays out with a Nora Ephron-esque lightness of touch. Rogen and Byrne, who formerly starred together in Bad Neighbours, make for an electric \u2013 and, as the title asserts, platonic \u2013 couple, while the series itself has plenty to say about life, relationships and ageing.Just friends: Rose Byrne and Seth Rogen in \u2018Platonic\u2019 (Apple TV+)RecommendedTom Holland works hard in clich\u00e9d, generic series The Crowded Room\u00a0\u2013 reviewThe best Apple TV+ shows to watch nowEmmy Rossum defends playing 27-year-old Tom Holland\u2019s motherLittle AmericaDeveloped by The Big Sick\u2019s husband-wife team of Kumail Nanjiani and Emily V Gordon alongside Jury Duty\u2019s Lee Eisenberg, this anthology drama series follows true stories rooted in the American immigrant experience.

Read our\u00a0privacy notice\u201cClash\u201d is a word that can cause any Glastonbury ticketowner to break out in cold sweats.When organisers first release the poster, which is fit to bursting musicians booked to perform at the Worthy Farm festival, there is nothing more fun than putting together a list of all the performances you plan on seeing.But then the set times are announced, and you come to the crushing realisation that you may have to skip a few of your favourites.Below, we run through the biggest clashes at the 2023 festival.However, don\u2019t fret \u2013\u00a0we\u2019ve also worked out some possible workarounds, meaning you may be able to see at least some of the sets you\u2019re sad about missing.RecommendedGlastonbury 2023: Full line up and stage timesGlastonbury Festival 2023: How to watch the BBC\u2019s live coverageFoo Fighters drop huge hint for mystery Glastonbury band in touching fan letterFriday 23 JuneArctic Monkeys (10pm-11.45pm) vs Hot Chip (10.20-11.30pm)Warpaint (9pm-10pm) vs Sparks (9.15pm-10.15pm)It\u2019s no stretch to assume that those wanting to witness Sheffield quartet Arctic Monkeys\u2019 third headline set since 2007 would have also liked to have bopped along to synthpop heroes Hot Chip. Sadly, this won\u2019t be able to happen unless you ditch Arctic Monkeys midway through their performance. Elsewhere, two titans battling for your attentions are Warpaint and Sparks, an unfortunate clash that will no doubt cause headaches among fans of both. The workaround here is watching half of Warpaint\u2019s set on Woodsies before trekking 15-20 minutes to Park Stage to catch the end of Sparks. You\u2019ll have to sneak around the back of the crowd, though, as Park notoriously gets busy once the first performance kicks off.Saturday 24 JuneLana Del Rey (10.30-11.45) vs Christine and the Queens (10.30-11.45)Rina Sawayama (9pm-10pm) vs Melanie C (9.35pm-10.35pm)Lewis Capaldi (5.35pm-6.35pm) vs Maggie Rodgers (5.15pm-6.15pm)Christine and the Queens  (Christopher Victorio/Shutterstock)Three huge clashes occur on the Saturday, the chief of which is perhaps Other Stage and Woodsides headliners Lana Del Rey and Christine and the Queens, who play at exactly the same time. This is yet another example of a head-scratching slice of scheduling that may or may not have been decided in an attempt to split the crowds, which last year somewhat marred the Glasto experience. Melanie C returns to Worthy Farm after a heroic welcome in 2021 \u2013 however, scheduling her at the same time as Rina Sawayama is a particularly cruel move as it\u2019s understandable that fanbases of each would have enjoyed watching both sets. ]We suggest leaving Sawayama after 30 minutes to catch the end of Melanie C. Similarly, those wanting to watch two exceptionally good singers croon away on a lazy afternoon will have to pick their fighters out of Lewis Capaldi and Maggie Rodgers. Whoever you select, if the sun is shining, it could be a terrific calm before the storm (hopefully metaphorical) that is the Saturday night of Glastonbury. Our suggestion? Pick one and enjoy them.Sunday 25 JuneElton John (9pm-11.05pm) vs Queens of the Stone Age (9.45pm-11.15pm)Phoenix (9.30pm-10.45pm) vs Alt-J (9.15pm-10.15pm)It\u2019s feasible that fans of all genres of music would opt to see Elton John considering it\u2019s \u2013 let\u2019s call it what it is \u2013 a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. However, the singer, who finally headlines the Pyramid Stage after a five-decade career, will test prospective viewers\u2019 loyalties: Queens of the Stone Age, Phoenix and Alt-J are all playing at the same time.

They were promoted as \u201cnew\u201d Beatles songs.McCartney seemingly turned to AI following the release of Peter Jackson\u2019s Beatles documentary Get Back in 2021. For the three-part series, dialogue editor Emile de la Rey used computers to \u201cextricate\u201d voices from existing recordings.\u201c[Jackson] was able to extricate John\u2019s voice from a ropey little bit of cassette,\u201d McCartney said in a new interview.\u201cWe had John\u2019s voice and a piano and he could separate them with AI.

Berry at the time was in the pomp of her stardom, having won the Academy Award for Best Actress just a few years previously. In its own ignominious way, Berry\u2019s Catwoman turn was also award-worthy: she picked up her Golden Raspberry award in person, joking in her light-hearted acceptance speech: \u201cIn order to give a really bad performance like I did, you need a lot of bad actors around you.\u201d Berry in the critically panned \u2018Catwoman\u2019  (Warner Bros/Dc Comics/Kobal/Shutterstock)Al Pacino \u2013 Jack and Jill (2011)One of the greatest actors to have ever lived, Al Pacino has nonetheless been known to give his fair share of questionable (over-)performances throughout the years. However, there\u2019s none that quite stick in the craw quite so jarringly as his brief cameo in the bleakly bad Adam Sandler vehicle Jack and Jill. Playing himself, Pacino mugs his way through a musical advertisement for a beverage called a \u201cdunkaccino\u201d. It\u2019s not very funny, and Pacino seems almost demeaned by his very presence in it.George Clooney \u2013 Batman & Robin (1997)There\u2019s no way the blame for this notorious superhero flop can be placed solely at Clooney\u2019s door; from head to bat-toes, this film was daft, indulgent and misconceived. But the Ocean\u2019s Eleven star certainly doesn\u2019t cover himself in glory with his take on the caped crusader, resulting in what might be the worst on-screen Batman in memory.Robert De Niro \u2013 Dirty Grandpa (2016)Once considered by many to be the best actor on the planet, De Niro\u2019s star has waned somewhat in recent years. Though he\u2019s still able to pull greatness out the bag (see: The Irishman), his recent output offers a litany of phoned-in performances, from Little Fockers to The Comedian. In terms of sheer, degrading \u201chow did it come to this\u201d moments, there\u2019s nothing on par with Dirty Grandpa, however, in which De Niro plays a randy septuagenarian who accompanies his grandson (Zac Efron) to Florida for Spring Break.Robert De Niro to star opposite himself in Wise GuysRussell Crowe \u2013 The Mummy (2018)The overall lacklustreness of this Tom Cruise vehicle helped disguise Crowe\u2019s performance as Dr Jekyll (of \u201cand Mr Hyde\u201d fame), which was quietly the worst supporting turn of Crowe\u2019s career. The scene in which Crowe wigs out and transforms from the sanguine doctor to the feral Mr Hyde is one of the most giddily over-acted in recent memory, and the dodgy CGI is just the icing on the cake. Had Warner Bros\u2019 planned (and prematurely announced) \u201cDark Universe\u201d panned out, Crowe would have got his own standalone film as the bifurcated literary character. What a horrible and ancient curse that could have been.Natalie Portman \u2013 Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones (2002)All three Star Wars prequels were blessed with an abundance of skilled actors; all three also featured some truly terrible performances, often by those same actors. Natalie Portman was never serviced well by Attack of the Clones\u2019s script, but this nonetheless endures as one of her worst performances. Sharing most of her scenes with Hayden Christensen\u2019s pouting Anakin, Portman\u2019s Padme Amidala is painfully wooden and devoid of charisma; turgid political plotlines set around the Galactic Senate also gave Portman no room to flex her considerable talents.Natalie Portman as Padme Amidala in \u2018Attack of the Clones' (LucasFilm)Robert Downey Jr \u2013 Dolittle (2020)There have been few men as naturally charismatic as RDJ; the camera loves him, and so do audiences. It\u2019s no small shame, therefore, that his acting career after the success of Iron Man has pretty much been confined to Marvel\u2019s Tony Stark \u2013 since The Avengers in 2012, his only sizable non-MCU roles have been The Judge and Dolittle, both of which could be charitably described as letdowns. His role as the animal-fluent doctor in Dolittle must be the worst, however \u2013 a charmless and insipid spin on a classic children\u2019s premise.Tom Hardy \u2013 Capone (2020)As an actor, Tom Hardy makes big choices. This is what makes him great; it\u2019s a big part of what imbued films like Bronson or Mad Max: Fury Road with such unique, specific energy. But these big choices don\u2019t always pan out, leading to bizarre results in films such as last year\u2019s strange Al Capone biopic. The film was savaged by viewers on social media, with one critic writing that Hardy \u201cgrunts, coughs and s***s his way through scenes that lack any form of direction, sympathy and/or purpose\u201d.Tom Hardy as Al Capone in \u2018Capone' (Vertical Entertainment)Adam Sandler \u2013 The Ridiculous 6 (2015)So many of the Sandman\u2019s performances can be described as broad, lowbrow, or just plain bad, it\u2019s easy to forget just how great an actor Sandler is. When he applies himself, either in his self-produced comedies, or in more dramatic projects (Punch-Drunk Love; The Meyerowicz Stories; Uncut Gems), he can be a force to be reckoned with. In the Ridiculous 6, however, he\u2019s not even a force to be tolerated. Playing a white orphan who was raised by Native Americans in the Old West, Sandler is, frankly, terrible. The film is similarly poor, and was the recipient of a rare zero per cent score on Rotten Tomatoes.Leonardo DiCaprio \u2013 J Edgar (2011)It\u2019s a testament to DiCaprio\u2019s consistency that there\u2019s not much to choose from by way of bad performances; J Edgar, however, is an outright stinker. Filmed back in the heady days before DiCaprio\u2019s Best Actor win, the turgid biopic was a transparent ploy for Oscar gold, and saw the actor don terrible prosthetics to play an elderly version of the controversial FBI director. He\u2019s scarcely much better as a younger J Edgar Hoover, mind \u2013 this is a bad, indulgent film, one which the Titanic star does not manage to elevate.Read more:\u00a025 brilliant films that bombed at the box officeMichael Caine \u2013 Jaws: The Revenge (1987)It should have been a coup to land Michael Caine for the fourth entry in the Jaws franchise. With Roy Scheider having left the franchise after Jaws 2,\u00a0 it was in need of some star presence. Alas, Caine did not exactly cover himself in glory. For his part, the British thespian was droll about the film\u2019s dubious merits, famously saying: \u201cI have never seen it, but by all accounts it is terrible. However, I have seen the house that it built, and it is terrific.\u201dMichael Caine in \u2018Jaws: The Revenge' (Universal Pictures)Naomi Watts \u2013 Diana (2013)This year has seen a superlative portrayal of the late Princess Diana on screen, when Kristen Stewart tackled the role for the bold, revisionist biopic Spencer. Previous attempts to capture the \u201cpeople\u2019s princess\u201d haven\u2019t proved quite so fortunate, however, with the 2013 biopic Diana standing as the nadir of Naomi Watts\u2019s career. The Mulholland Drive star is all sorts of bad in her attempt to inhabit the royal, but the film itself is a shoddy and ill-conceived piece of work.Idris Elba \u2013 Cats (2019)Glance at the screen during any frame of the 2019 musical Cats and you\u2019ll see a bad performance; this spot could equally have gone to Judi Dench, or Ian McKellen, or Ray Winstone. It\u2019s not necessarily Idris Elba\u2019s fault so much as the cursed CGI, but Macavity is a creepy, alien creation \u2013 and not in the ways he\u2019s supposed to be. The lofty heights of The Wire\u2019s Stringer Bell have never felt so far away.Idris Elba in \u2018Cats' (Universal Pictures)Meryl Streep \u2013 Into the Woods (2014)Meryl Streep\u2019s place in the Hollywood hall of fame has long been beyond doubt; she practically has Oscar nominations on a yearly subscription. Nonetheless, some of her performances and acting tics have drawn dubious reactions from critics \u2013 with her role as the witch in Into the Woods standing as one of her lowest ebbs. Stephen Sondheim\u2019s masterful musical was robbed of much of its charm and bite for this Disney-produced film adaptation, and Streep\u2019s performance is hammy and off-putting. The section in the opening song where she has to rap is also nightmarish.

You\u2019ll never be able to say \u201cbees\u201d in quite the same way again after watching this.To find out what others are saying and join the conversation scroll down for the comments section or click here for our most commented on articles\u00a0Access unlimited streaming of movies and TV shows with Amazon Prime Video Sign up now for a 30-day free trialSign upHalle Berry \u2013 Catwoman (2004)Produced before superhero films became as ubiquitous as oxygen, Catwoman was a notorious dud when it first came out. Berry at the time was in the pomp of her stardom, having won the Academy Award for Best Actress just a few years previously. In its own ignominious way, Berry\u2019s Catwoman turn was also award-worthy: she picked up her Golden Raspberry award in person, joking in her light-hearted acceptance speech: \u201cIn order to give a really bad performance like I did, you need a lot of bad actors around you.\u201d Berry in the critically panned \u2018Catwoman\u2019  (Warner Bros/Dc Comics/Kobal/Shutterstock)Al Pacino \u2013 Jack and Jill (2011)One of the greatest actors to have ever lived, Al Pacino has nonetheless been known to give his fair share of questionable (over-)performances throughout the years. However, there\u2019s none that quite stick in the craw quite so jarringly as his brief cameo in the bleakly bad Adam Sandler vehicle Jack and Jill. Playing himself, Pacino mugs his way through a musical advertisement for a beverage called a \u201cdunkaccino\u201d. It\u2019s not very funny, and Pacino seems almost demeaned by his very presence in it.George Clooney \u2013 Batman & Robin (1997)There\u2019s no way the blame for this notorious superhero flop can be placed solely at Clooney\u2019s door; from head to bat-toes, this film was daft, indulgent and misconceived. But the Ocean\u2019s Eleven star certainly doesn\u2019t cover himself in glory with his take on the caped crusader, resulting in what might be the worst on-screen Batman in memory.Robert De Niro \u2013 Dirty Grandpa (2016)Once considered by many to be the best actor on the planet, De Niro\u2019s star has waned somewhat in recent years. Though he\u2019s still able to pull greatness out the bag (see: The Irishman), his recent output offers a litany of phoned-in performances, from Little Fockers to The Comedian. In terms of sheer, degrading \u201chow did it come to this\u201d moments, there\u2019s nothing on par with Dirty Grandpa, however, in which De Niro plays a randy septuagenarian who accompanies his grandson (Zac Efron) to Florida for Spring Break.Robert De Niro to star opposite himself in Wise GuysRussell Crowe \u2013 The Mummy (2018)The overall lacklustreness of this Tom Cruise vehicle helped disguise Crowe\u2019s performance as Dr Jekyll (of \u201cand Mr Hyde\u201d fame), which was quietly the worst supporting turn of Crowe\u2019s career. The scene in which Crowe wigs out and transforms from the sanguine doctor to the feral Mr Hyde is one of the most giddily over-acted in recent memory, and the dodgy CGI is just the icing on the cake. Had Warner Bros\u2019 planned (and prematurely announced) \u201cDark Universe\u201d panned out, Crowe would have got his own standalone film as the bifurcated literary character. What a horrible and ancient curse that could have been.Natalie Portman \u2013 Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones (2002)All three Star Wars prequels were blessed with an abundance of skilled actors; all three also featured some truly terrible performances, often by those same actors. Natalie Portman was never serviced well by Attack of the Clones\u2019s script, but this nonetheless endures as one of her worst performances. Sharing most of her scenes with Hayden Christensen\u2019s pouting Anakin, Portman\u2019s Padme Amidala is painfully wooden and devoid of charisma; turgid political plotlines set around the Galactic Senate also gave Portman no room to flex her considerable talents.Natalie Portman as Padme Amidala in \u2018Attack of the Clones' (LucasFilm)Robert Downey Jr \u2013 Dolittle (2020)There have been few men as naturally charismatic as RDJ; the camera loves him, and so do audiences. It\u2019s no small shame, therefore, that his acting career after the success of Iron Man has pretty much been confined to Marvel\u2019s Tony Stark \u2013 since The Avengers in 2012, his only sizable non-MCU roles have been The Judge and Dolittle, both of which could be charitably described as letdowns. His role as the animal-fluent doctor in Dolittle must be the worst, however \u2013 a charmless and insipid spin on a classic children\u2019s premise.Tom Hardy \u2013 Capone (2020)As an actor, Tom Hardy makes big choices. This is what makes him great; it\u2019s a big part of what imbued films like Bronson or Mad Max: Fury Road with such unique, specific energy. But these big choices don\u2019t always pan out, leading to bizarre results in films such as last year\u2019s strange Al Capone biopic. The film was savaged by viewers on social media, with one critic writing that Hardy \u201cgrunts, coughs and s***s his way through scenes that lack any form of direction, sympathy and/or purpose\u201d.Tom Hardy as Al Capone in \u2018Capone' (Vertical Entertainment)Adam Sandler \u2013 The Ridiculous 6 (2015)So many of the Sandman\u2019s performances can be described as broad, lowbrow, or just plain bad, it\u2019s easy to forget just how great an actor Sandler is. When he applies himself, either in his self-produced comedies, or in more dramatic projects (Punch-Drunk Love; The Meyerowicz Stories; Uncut Gems), he can be a force to be reckoned with. In the Ridiculous 6, however, he\u2019s not even a force to be tolerated. Playing a white orphan who was raised by Native Americans in the Old West, Sandler is, frankly, terrible. The film is similarly poor, and was the recipient of a rare zero per cent score on Rotten Tomatoes.Leonardo DiCaprio \u2013 J Edgar (2011)It\u2019s a testament to DiCaprio\u2019s consistency that there\u2019s not much to choose from by way of bad performances; J Edgar, however, is an outright stinker. Filmed back in the heady days before DiCaprio\u2019s Best Actor win, the turgid biopic was a transparent ploy for Oscar gold, and saw the actor don terrible prosthetics to play an elderly version of the controversial FBI director. He\u2019s scarcely much better as a younger J Edgar Hoover, mind \u2013 this is a bad, indulgent film, one which the Titanic star does not manage to elevate.Read more:\u00a025 brilliant films that bombed at the box officeMichael Caine \u2013 Jaws: The Revenge (1987)It should have been a coup to land Michael Caine for the fourth entry in the Jaws franchise. With Roy Scheider having left the franchise after Jaws 2,\u00a0 it was in need of some star presence. Alas, Caine did not exactly cover himself in glory. For his part, the British thespian was droll about the film\u2019s dubious merits, famously saying: \u201cI have never seen it, but by all accounts it is terrible. However, I have seen the house that it built, and it is terrific.\u201dMichael Caine in \u2018Jaws: The Revenge' (Universal Pictures)Naomi Watts \u2013 Diana (2013)This year has seen a superlative portrayal of the late Princess Diana on screen, when Kristen Stewart tackled the role for the bold, revisionist biopic Spencer. Previous attempts to capture the \u201cpeople\u2019s princess\u201d haven\u2019t proved quite so fortunate, however, with the 2013 biopic Diana standing as the nadir of Naomi Watts\u2019s career. The Mulholland Drive star is all sorts of bad in her attempt to inhabit the royal, but the film itself is a shoddy and ill-conceived piece of work.Idris Elba \u2013 Cats (2019)Glance at the screen during any frame of the 2019 musical Cats and you\u2019ll see a bad performance; this spot could equally have gone to Judi Dench, or Ian McKellen, or Ray Winstone. It\u2019s not necessarily Idris Elba\u2019s fault so much as the cursed CGI, but Macavity is a creepy, alien creation \u2013 and not in the ways he\u2019s supposed to be. The lofty heights of The Wire\u2019s Stringer Bell have never felt so far away.Idris Elba in \u2018Cats' (Universal Pictures)Meryl Streep \u2013 Into the Woods (2014)Meryl Streep\u2019s place in the Hollywood hall of fame has long been beyond doubt; she practically has Oscar nominations on a yearly subscription. Nonetheless, some of her performances and acting tics have drawn dubious reactions from critics \u2013 with her role as the witch in Into the Woods standing as one of her lowest ebbs. Stephen Sondheim\u2019s masterful musical was robbed of much of its charm and bite for this Disney-produced film adaptation, and Streep\u2019s performance is hammy and off-putting. The section in the opening song where she has to rap is also nightmarish. Glenn Close \u2013 Hillbilly Elegy (2020)Glenn Close\u2019s turn in this patronising slice of rural Americana may just be one of the worst performances ever to be nominated for an Academy Award.RecommendedEvery movie and TV show coming to Netflix this monthThe One With.... Every Friends episode ranked worst to bestClose has proved herself one of the finest actors of her generation \u2013 delivering diverse but first-rate performances in everything from 2017\u2019s The Wife to the FX cop drama The Shield \u2013 but as hard-bitten grandmother \u201cMamaw\u201d in Hillbilly Elegy, Close is sadly over-indulged. Everyone seems to agree that Close is long overdue an Oscar win; thank God it didn\u2019t come for this.

The nuclear family\u2019s lives in suburban Cheltenham revolve around Marnie\u2019s care, an orbit that is thrown when a chest infection sends the youngest daughter to the ICU.

Horgan\u2019s Nicci is powerful, in a brittle way, and entirely convinced of her sole priority; Sheen\u2019s Andrew, conversely, is equivocal, drawn to a more cautious judgement. As a two-hander, they are terrific, both wholly believable in their frustration and grief. Oliver too gives a stellar performance as a teenager dealing with being overshadowed by incipient mourning, and Moriarty (who has cerebral palsy) is a revelation as Marnie.Of course, the acting is only one part of the puzzle, and projects like this require a real delicacy to the script.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe 76th Tony Awards have drawn to a close after a lively ceremony at which Liverpool\u2019s Jodie Comer was among the major winners of the night. The biggest night in Broadway took place on Sunday night (11 June) at the United Palace in Manhattan\u2019s Washington Heights neighbourhood. Hosted by Academy Award-winner Ariana Debose, this year\u2019s ceremony was noticeably different to its past iterations due to the ongoing Hollywood writers\u2019 strike. The strike was referenced both playfully and then in detail by DeBose in her opening segment, in which the actor showed support for her \u201csiblings\u201d at the Writers Guild of America. The West Side Story star explained to viewers that as a result of the strikes, neither herself nor anyone on stage would be reading from a script, since the scripts are typically written by members of the WGA.

But Hirsch, best known for playing the titular Speed Racer in the cult 2008 actioner and the tragic American nomad Chris McCandless in Sean Penn\u2019s Into the Wild (2007), still wanted to have some fun with it. \u201cI thought: \u2018OK, I\u2019ll just do an Elon Musk impression for the whole movie,\u2019\u201d the 38-year-old laughs, as if it was the most obvious idea in the world. \u201cIn fairness, it\u2019s probably not even a good Elon Musk impression. Because I don\u2019t think anybody actually got it.\u201d He grins, sighs and holds his hands up in mock regret.Pursuit, which is available for digital download now, is an incredibly stupid movie that gets by on its relentless insanity. Hirsch\u2019s Rick is erratic, noisy and covered in face tattoos, and if his dialogue seems particularly free-wheeling and nonsensical, that\u2019s pretty much because it was made up on the fly. \u201cOur director, he was like, \u2018yeah, don\u2019t worry about the script \u2013 just improvise your lines the whole time if you want.\u2019 So there are whole scenes where I\u2019m just, like, saying anything on camera.\u201dHirsch is at home in Los Angeles, groggy yet energetic after two weeks of night shoots on a poker movie called Degenerate. While his early career was dominated by auteurs (he\u2019d worked with William Friedkin, Ang Lee, Gus Van Sant and Lilly and Lana Wachowski all before he\u2019d turned 25), or teen sex comedies such as the surprisingly sweet The Girl Next Door (2004), his present-day career can be split into two halves. One is the smart indie pile, like his grisly 2016 two-hander with Brian Cox called The Autopsy of Jane Doe. The other is made up of straight-to-streaming action films, in which one or more of a very specific collection of men (Cusack, but also the likes of Stephen Dorff, Michael Madsen or Bruce Willis before he retired) hold big guns on the poster art. He\u2019s occasionally in a modern masterpiece, too \u2013 that was him, you may remember, as Sharon Tate\u2019s hairdresser Jay Sebring in Quentin Tarantino\u2019s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019).He just loves movies, he tells me. Watching them. Making them. Even if some of them are sort of terrible. \u201cI saw all the best stuff really young. I was one of those weird kids binge-watching movies and burning through all the sections of the video store. If I hang out with guys that know about football and every player\u2019s stats or whatever, I don\u2019t know what the f*** they\u2019re talking about \u2013 movies, though, I\u2019m like Mister Aficionado.\u201dEven when he\u2019s not rambling like a Twitter CEO and firing an Uzi while running around in his underpants \u2013 Pursuit, if I haven\u2019t sold it enough already, is a trip \u2013 Hirsch is a performer of near-feral intensity. He was, especially if you came of age in the late Noughties, synonymous with a particular strain of sun-kissed abandon. Few could watch Into the Wild and not also want to flee to the furthest outreaches of the world (many seduced by it would come to conveniently forget that the real McCandless died hungry and alone in the Alaskan wilderness). When he tore off his clothes to dance naked with hippies in Lee\u2019s Taking Woodstock (2009), you wanted to do it, too. Some of us even tried vainly to emulate his wispy, shoulder-length haircut as Seventies skateboarder Jay Adams in Catherine Hardwicke\u2019s Lords of Dogtown (2005), but let\u2019s not talk about that. And all of this is why it was so horrifying \u2013 and disappointing, and sad and confusing \u2013 when Hirsch seemed to throw it all away in a moment of violence.RecommendedJosh Hartnett on Black Mirror, Oppenheimer and saying no to celebrity: \u2018I was on a different path\u2019Hank Azaria: \u2018I didn\u2019t want to cave to so-called PC pressure\u2019Thomas Turgoose: \u2018He\u2019s one of the biggest stars in the world \u2013 but he wanted to go to Wagamama every night\u2019During the Sundance Film Festival in 2015, Hirsch attacked a female film executive in the middle of a busy party. In a statement, the executive said she was grabbed from behind, pulled to the floor, put in a chokehold by Hirsch so forcefully that she \u201ccouldn\u2019t breathe\u201d, and that it took two bystanders to pull him off her before police arrived. Charged with aggravated assault and intoxication, Hirsch pleaded guilty as part of a plea deal later that year, spent 15 days in jail, paid restitution to his victim and went to rehab. It was an act of violence that has justifiably reverberated through his career ever since, along with people\u2019s responses to him personally.\n\nIt was the worst moment of my whole life by far. The lowest. In the most public place possible\u201cIt was scary because it was so wrapped up in binge drinking,\u201d he says now. \u201cI had no memory of what happened. So I\u2019m reading the stuff the next day, like, \u2018What?\u2019 I was dumbfounded. Horrified. It\u2019s like if you drink too much and then you wake up and you\u2019ve done this horrible thing.\u201d He takes a long pause. \u201cIt\u2019s something that should have just never happened. Sometimes people \u2013 not everybody \u2013 have these moments where you let yourself down or you let other people down. And you can say you\u2019re sorry and mean it and move forward, and try to be the best parent and make a living for yourself and still love your art and still love your family and your friends. And that\u2019s sort of what I\u2019ve chosen to do. I think\u2026 I hope that I can be a better person as well.\u201dHe takes another long pause. \u201cIt was the worst moment of my whole life by far. The lowest. In the most public place possible. At the most famous film festival in America, you know?\u201d Has he ever figured out why he actually did what he did? \u201cI\u2019m hesitant to talk very specific about it, you know? Because I think, yeah\u2026\u201d He trails off. \u201cIt certainly led me to do a lot of the emotional work and the therapy that I think I probably should have been getting when I was younger, you know what I mean? Getting famous really young, having a harder time trusting people, I\u2019ve been able to learn my own mechanics more, and do a lot of the work that I put off doing when I was younger because I was scared.\u201d\u2018OK, I\u2019ll just do an Elon Musk impression for the whole movie\u2019: Emile Hirsch in \u2018Pursuit\u2019  (Grindstone Entertainment)The Emile Hirsch that first set foot in Hollywood was someone specifically determined to stay on the straight and narrow. He\u2019d got an agent at the age of seven, after discovering that he had a vague connection to many of the young actors he was watching on TV \u2013 dozens of them had been taught by his grandfather\u2019s brother and his wife, who were prolific teachers hired by Hollywood studios to educate child actors on sets. \u201cThey\u2019d say, \u2018Oh, yeah, we worked with Elijah Wood on this movie, or on this commercial \u2013 you could do that!\u2019\u201d That background, as well as his early watching of movies, made him keenly aware of the industry he was stepping into.Access unlimited streaming of movies and TV shows with Amazon Prime Video Sign up now for a 30-day free trialSign up\u201cComing into LA, I was ultra paranoid,\u201d he explains. \u201cI was wary of the \u2018dark underbelly\u2019 of Hollywood. I was distrusting of party-ers. My favourite actor was River Phoenix, and growing up knowing what happened to him, I felt like I had to learn from him in any way I could. Just out of respect. I wouldn\u2019t say I was a square or anything, but on the range of like, \u2018the party people\u2019, I was at the very low end.\u201dEarly interviews noted his precociousness. A 2002 New York Times piece, in which Hirsch described himself as looking like \u201ca cross between Leonardo DiCaprio and Jack Black\u201d (it\u2019s\u2026 oddly accurate), remarked that he was \u201c17 years old and gravely going on 40\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m way more chill now,\u201d he says. \u201cI think when you\u2019re young, some people have that chill already \u2013 I just had pretty intense angst.\u201d It was sort of inevitable he\u2019d end up crossing paths back then with Sean Penn, another teen actor turned deeply serious artiste, and someone else with just as complicated an image in the public eye.On the road: Hirsch as the late nomad Chris McCandless in 2007\u2019s \u2018Into the Wild\u2019  (Shutterstock)Hirsch was 21 when he made Into the Wild, and remembers matching Penn\u2019s ferocious commitment on set. \u201cWe both put maximum effort into that film. We left everything on the field.\u201d It resulted in one of those all-time great young-actor performances. Hirsch plays McCandless as both the romantic hero of his own story and a spoilt, destructive madman \u2013 over the course of the film he shrinks down to a near-skeletal body weight. You can practically see the lights go out in his eyes in real time; Hirsch seems barely alive as the film goes on (it took eight months to shoot). \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I was scarred by it,\u201d Hirsch says. \u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s like I grew new muscles. I got new strength from that movie. No trauma. No scars. Just strength and only that.\u201dRubbing his eyes, Hirsch tells me he doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019d like to do next. His sleep schedule is out of whack because of Degenerate, and he\u2019s conscious of losing sight of his health. \u201cI know what can bring me up and bring me down,\u201d he explains. \u201cI was chewing all this nicotine gum on set and now I\u2019m like, I gotta stop. I want to start weightlifting again, just head down to Venice Beach and reset.\u201d He has a nine-year-old son named Valor, who makes a cameo in Pursuit as his on-screen son \u2013 but found acting completely uninteresting. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t exactly chomping at the bit to do more after that, so I might have nipped it in the bud early,\u201d he says. \u201cYou want to be an actor?

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeWith dozens of Unesco World Heritage Sites, thousands of miles of coastline and a dizzying variety of towns and cities, Mexico has become one of the world\u2019s most popular countries for tourists.According to World Atlas, Mexico was the seventh most-visited country in the world in 2019, while in 2021 it welcomed over 31 million inbound visitors \u2013 more than Spain, Italy and the US \u2013 according to the United Nations\u2019 World Tourism Organisation.It\u2019s easy to see why people have started flocking to the North American nation. While Spanish influences are clearly visible in the country\u2019s language and way of life, its own complicated history, spectacular geography and vibrant culture have combined to make Mexico a modern-day marvel. Whether you\u2019d prefer learning about ancient civilisations at Chechen Itza or relaxing on the beaches of Cancun, we\u2019ve compiled a list of some of the best destinations in Mexico for an unforgettable trip. Mexico City RecommendedHow to spend a day in Condesa, Mexico City\u2019s on-trend neighbourhoodOaxaca city guide: Where to stay, eat, drink and shop Cartel violence is raging in Mexico - should you cancel your trip?The Popocatepetl volcano provides a dramatic backdrop for the Mexican capital (Getty Images/iStockphoto)Capital cities are often among the must-see destinations in any country, and the sprawling Mexican capital is no different. A city of almost nine million people, it is one of the oldest continually inhabited cities in the Western Hemisphere, standing on the ruins of the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan (founded in 1325). Nowadays, the city is a fusion of the country\u2019s history and culture, with several Unesco sites \u2013 including the historic centre and the Xochimilco canals \u2013 and several buildings and museums dedicated to some of the country\u2019s most famous people, such as the Frida Kahlo Museum.Of course, there\u2019s also no better place to experience Mexican cuisine and nightlife; exploring the city\u2019s neighbourhoods enables you to take in architecture ranging from colonial buildings and ancient ruins to skyscrapers and art deco museums. Roma is the \u2018foodie\u2019 centre of the city, while Condesa offers a more laid-back, trendy atmosphere than the bustling Centro Historico. When to visit Mexico CityTemperatures in the city are fairly consistent throughout the year, while rainfall is never too high. For a happy medium, try March. Crowds will be far less than at peak times, and with average highs of 24C it is one of the warmest months of the year, but is unlikely to get sweltering (average temperatures hover around 17C). CancunAn aerial view of some of Cancun\u2019s beaches  (Getty Images/iStockphoto)According to the country\u2019s tourist board, Cancun airport welcomed the highest number of visitors of any airport in the country in 2022, with nine million people passing through its gates. A spring break favourite across the pond, Cancun has a reputation as a resort brimming with buzzing nightlife spots, white sand beaches and turquoise waters as far as the eye can see. Located along the Mayan Riviera on the Caribbean coast, beaches such as Playa Defines and Chac Mool are calm and relaxed spots, offering several water sports and access to the Mesoamerican Reef (the second largest in the world). Visitors to Cancun also have the option of day trips to experience Mayan ruins \u2013 such as those at Tulum (more below) and Coba \u2013 and other areas of the Mayan Riviera, though many choose to (quite literally) stay in any one of its all-inclusive resorts. For those who have come to party, Avenida Kukulkan and Punta Cancun are some of the more popular areas. When to visit CancunTemperatures in Cancun can become sweltering between April and August, with average daily highs over 35C in each month. For lower temperatures (think max highs of 30C) and very little rain (less than 40mm per month), enjoy some winter sun by visiting between November and February.Read more on North America travel:USA travel guide: Everything you need to know before you goWhy Puebla is Mexico\u2019s coolest under-the-radar cityCanada travel guide: Everything you need to know before you goMerida The ruins at Uxmal are just one of several sites near Merida (Getty Images/iStockphoto)The capital city of the Yucatan Peninsula, Merida is slightly inland but lies less than 40 minutes away from the coast. The city makes an excellent base for those who want to explore ancient ruins, with several within less than two hours\u2019 drive. Chichen Itza is perhaps the most famous due to its size and mix of architectural styles, but Uxmal is well-known for the precision and condition of many of the structures that still stand today. There are also several cenotes (natural underground reservoirs) near the city, which make for perfect places to cool off when exploring the surrounding nature. Merida itself is a city that has retained many of its colonial features. Narrow, winding streets are lined with colourful buildings and open up onto large plazas and cathedrals, with several galleries, museums and dozens of cafes and restaurants dotted around the city. Pasejo Montejo is the perhaps the city\u2019s most iconic avenue (named after its founder), though the Plaza Grande is another of the city\u2019s most well-known (and safe) neighbourhoods. When to visit MeridaIts inland location means temperatures here can get close to 40C in April and May. For low chances of rain, lower temperatures (think average highs of 30C and average temperatures of 25C) and fewer crowds, visit in January or February. Los CabosLos Cabos is home to some of the most dramatic coastline in Mexico (Getty Images/iStockphoto)Los Cabos has become popular with Americans due to its proximity to the US border. The area is located in the Baja California region and contains two resorts \u2013 Cabo San Lucas and San Jose del Cabo \u2013 that are linked by almost 20 miles of coastline. Much of this contains breathtaking scenery and sweeping views of the Pacific Ocean (and Gulf of California), with large rock formations and rocky cliffs perfectly complementing the golden beaches and clear waters that they sit on. Many will choose to make the most of the beaches through a selection of water sports and activities such as fishing, diving and even whale watching, but don\u2019t miss out on visiting the two towns themselves. Both provide vibrant nightlife in their downtown and marina areas, but while they are very much resort towns, they offer an authentic, less Americanised taste of Mexico, from local cuisine to colonial architecture and charming town centres. When to visit Los CabosSummer temperatures here are not as off-putting as in the south, but it is still best to come in the shoulder seasons for more pleasant temperatures. April is a good choice, as it is one of the driest months but sees average temperatures of around 25C. TulumTulum is characterised by rugged coastal cliffs and inland cenotes  (Getty Images/iStockphoto)Another destination on the Yucatan Peninsula and the Mayan Riviera, Tulum is under two hours south of Cancun. The atmosphere here is more laid-back than other coastal resorts, though there are plenty of beach club and rooftop bar options for going out in the evenings. However, the focus here is on enjoying the surrounding nature and ruins. The inland area is characterised by the presence of dozens of cenotes that offer tranquil swimming opportunities (be sure to check out Gran Cenote and Two Eyes). The coastal areas are equally dramatic, with rugged cliffs and palm trees flanking long stretches of white sand and Mayan ruins giving spectacular views of the coast and the Caribbean Sea. The aforementioned ruins are contained in the Tulum Archaeological Site, an ancient walled city where El Castillo and the Temple of the Frescoes are the two most famous structures. The nearby areas and town itself reflect the surrounding nature and preserved history, providing a tranquil atmosphere; think yoga retreats, eco-friendly resorts and fresh, locally sourced culinary delights. When to visit TulumSimilar to Cancun, November to February is the best choice for avoiding sweltering heat and other tourists. Average highs around these times should be between 27C and 29C. Oaxaca CityMany of the streets in Oaxaca are lined with colourful, colonial buildings (Getty Images)Another more relaxed Mexican destination, Oaxaca (in the south of the country, roughly between Mexico City and the Yucatan) is a city celebrated for a rich cultural heritage that has preserved and celebrates its indigenous roots. Nowhere is this more visible than at Monte Alban, a site of ruins of the Zapotec and Mixtec peoples. In the city itself, traditional markets showcase unique arts and craftsmanship, while museums such as the Museum of Cultures of Oaxaca help to preserve the entire history of the area.The main centre of the city is yet another Unesco site, where colonial buildings line colourful cobbled streets. The Zocalo square is the heart of the city, where visitors and locals alike sit at bars and restaurants beside the city\u2019s cathedral and government palace. Like many other Mexican cities, Oaxaca is also blessed with several nearby natural beauty spots. More Zapotec villages can be found in the nearby Sierra Norte mountain range, and Hierve el Agua contains dozens of dramatic rock formations and waterfall-like structures. For beaches, Puerto Escondido (literally \u2018Hidden Port\u2019) is another popular tourist destination; it has some of the most scenic beaches on the Pacific coast if you need a seaside break. When to visit Oaxaca November through to April is Oaxaca\u2019s dry season, and temperatures can vary from highs of 32C to lows of 14C. Overall, April is probably the best choice, as while temperatures have the same variation, you\u2019ll get average highs of 32C and an average of only four days of rain in the entire month. Zihuatanejo-IxtapaIxtapa was once just a small, sleepy fishing village (Getty Images/iStockphoto)This destination is technically two separate places, but the recommendation stands due to their proximity and the great variety of activities and choices they offer between them. Ixtapa-Zihuatenejo (often shortened to Ixtapa) itself is more of a contemporary resort village, while Zihuatanejo is a peaceful, characterful beachside resort that lies just southeast. All-inclusive hotels line the streets and shores of Ixtapa, where beaches such as El Palmar are perfect for sunbathing and activities such as snorkelling, kayaking and surfing. Modern-day luxuries such as resort restaurants, golf courses and a marina area are popular here; if you\u2019re looking for something a little more traditional, head to Zihuatanejo itself. A smaller fishing village, Zihuatanejo offers similarly beautiful beaches (including La Ropa and Las Gatas), with fewer crowds but the same white sands and azure waters. The town itself has maintained its fishing roots; markets and restaurants sell local seafood and other produce, while people flock to either the seaside or town square for other dining and relaxed nightlife options. When to visit Zihuatanejo-Ixtapa RecommendedHow to spend a day in Condesa, Mexico City\u2019s on-trend neighbourhoodOaxaca city guide: Where to stay, eat, drink and shop Cartel violence is raging in Mexico - should you cancel your trip?Average highs in the area rarely drop below 30C, while average lows rarely drop below 20C. October to June is the high season, but seeing as the rainy season begins in July, you\u2019re better off visiting around April or May, when average temperatures will be around 25C.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeNorfolk isn\u2019t blessed with a large crop of spa and resort hotels \u2013 it\u2019s a rural county, and most of it is relatively far from the urban folk who crave the sort of pampering spa hotels promise. Indeed, often the resort hotels here are of the old-fashioned kind that existed long before experience showers and reiki treatments were even dreamed of. Having said that, there are a few little gems where you can enjoy all the delights of a decent spa \u2013 lots of treatments, a good pool and even a hot tub \u2013 alongside the real reasons people come to Norfolk: the beautiful coastline, big skies and the feeling of being far from the rat race. As such, it\u2019s perfect spa territory, and nowhere delivers hot tubs beneath dark skies with quite such aplomb.To make it even easier to find time to relax, we\u2019ve done the hard work for you and put together a list of the best spa hotels the county has to offer.RecommendedThe best hotels in Suffolk for boutique stays and seaside coolEight best log cabin holidays for a cosy UK staycationThe best dog-friendly hotels in the UK for 2023The best spa hotels in Norfolk 2023 are:Best for foodies: The Hoste ArmsBest spa hotel for walkers: The HarperBest spa hotel for shopping: Barnham Broom hotelBest luxury spa hotel: Congham HallBest budget spa hotel: The GroveBest for foodies: The Hoste ArmsLocation: Burnham MarketA spa cabin in the grounds of The Hoste Arms offers massages and facials  (The Hoste Arms)Several decades ago, the Hoste Arms almost single-handedly put North Norfolk on the chic coastal map, and it remains one of the county\u2019s most popular places to stay, with a perfect location at the centre of well-heeled Burnham Market. It\u2019s a fancy place to stay, no question, but the current owners have dialled down the swankiness a little bit, keeping in mind The Hoste\u2019s history as a terrific country inn that serves good food in a relaxed atmosphere. Here, fresh fish and seafood are cooked on a Josper grill, and you can also enjoy Norfolk charcuterie, locally smoked salmon and local beef and lamb. The Hoste lays on other comforts, too \u2013 not least a fancy spa cabin that offers all sorts of treatments, including reflexology, facials and the sort of deep-tissue massages you might need if you have been taking advantage of the great local walks in the area, including the nearby Peddars Way and Norfolk Coast Path.Best spa hotel for walkers: The HarperLocation: BlakeneyThe 32 guest rooms at The Harper have access to a decent size pool  (The Harper Hotel)This is a relatively new addition to the North Norfolk hotel scene, and it\u2019s a welcome one for walkers who like a bit of pampering, as it\u2019s right on the Norfolk Coast Path, which you can explore in both directions from here. The quaint coastal town of Blakeney is just a a couple of miles away, while a short drive inland lies the genteel Georgian town of Holt. The hotel\u2019s self-consciously cool coastal ambience is almost a clich\u00e9 in what is unashamed Chelsea tractor territory, but it does a pretty good job of catering for the well-heeled folk who like to come to this part of the coast, with a good-sized pool, steam room and sauna and lots of massages to melt away those hikers\u2019 aches and pains. It also has a cosy bar, a decent restaurant and 32 very comfortable guest rooms.Book nowBest spa hotel for shopping: Barnham Broom HotelLocation: Barnham BroomThere are two golf courses at this hotel, which is a 20-minute drive from Norwich  (Barnham Broom Hotel And Spa)You could easily spend a weekend at the Barnham Broom without leaving the grounds, enjoying its many facilities, which include 46 rooms that have been refurbished to a high standard in a contemporary style, and fitted out with Molton Brown toiletries, free wifi and robes, Freeview TV and proper baths in every bathroom. The hotel also has two golf courses \u2013 the tournament-quality Valley Course and less demanding Hill Course \u2013 a well-equipped fitness centre and spa, and an excellent restaurant. However, the hotel\u2019s position just outside Norwich means it\u2019s also a terrific base for that fine city, which is only 20 minutes away by car. Norwich has all the chain stores you could possibly need but it\u2019s also a rare haven of independent shopping, with a brilliant selection of local retailers, particularly with regard to men\u2019s fashion. Shop \u2019til you drop and then relax in the hotel\u2019s large pool, sauna or steam room, or enjoy a massage or other treatment.Best luxury spa hotel: Congham HallLocation: ConghamFloor-to-ceiling windows surround the indoor pool  (Congham Hall )An elegant and very peaceful small\u00a0country house hotel just 10 minutes from King\u2019s Lynn, Congham Hall features top-notch rooms, an excellent spa and other leisure facilities, and offers the sort of relaxed, weekend-in-the-country feel you may be looking for. It\u2019s not a large hotel. A handsome Georgian manor house, it has 31 rooms and suites divided between the main house, a dozen or so rooms grouped around a courtyard garden and five brand-new and very sumptuous cabins \u2013 each has a private terrace (looking out over the Hall\u2019s orchards), which comes with an outside bathtub that\u2019s ideal for a spot of star-gazing. The spa offers lots of treatments and has a lovely pool surrounded by floor-to-ceiling windows, together with a steam room, sauna, experience showers and a hot tub on the terrace outside. There\u2019s also a tennis court and the hotel can advise on any number of brilliant circular countryside walks. A visit to the hotel\u2019s two-AA-rosette restaurant will see you dining on ingredients from the kitchen garden and the immediate local area (80 per cent of everything comes from within a 20-mile radius). All in all, a venue for a perfect weekend in the country.Best budget spa hotel: The GroveLocation: CromerThe family-run Grove hotel has a massage hut in the garden  (The Grove)Tucked away among the trees on the edge of Cromer and Overstrand, The Grove is not really a spa hotel at all, but the facilities in this very welcoming and comfortable family-run establishment not only include a lovely indoor pool, housed in a separate building in the hotel\u2019s extensive gardens, but a massage hut too, which offers, yes, a range of massages, from a 45-minute session to a full 120-minute deep-tissue workout \u2013 a perfect end to the day if you\u2019ve been hiking the coastal path or indulging in a spot of power-swimming from the excellent beaches in the area. The hotel offers 16 lovely rooms, along with a handful of self-catering cottages and even glamping, and there\u2019s a good restaurant too, open for lunch and dinner.Read more of our UK hotel reviews:The best Norfolk boutique hotelsWhere to stay in OxfordshireThe best West Sussex hotelsRecommendedBest boutique hotels in Norfolk for a glorious 2023 break12 places you won\u2019t believe are in EnglandSeven of the best walks in Dorset: Where to wander and stay on a hiking holidayRead more about England travel:The best wild swimming stays in the UKThe best boutique hotels in BristolWhere to stay in the New Forest"}, {"_id": "6488a04551ac33a3962e1842", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/flight-cancellations-british-airways-easyjet-b2356545.html", "primaryCategory": "News &amp; Advice", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Flight cancellation misery: why is it so often British Airways at Heathrow and easyJet at Gatwick?", "lead": "<p><strong>Plane Talk: </strong>The UK's biggest airlines grounded hundreds of departures over three days while rival carriers axed only a handful</p>", "author": "Simon Calder", "datePublished": "Tue, 13 Jun 2023 16:29:53 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:58:45.333878", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-13T16:29:53+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/13/11/newFile-3.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Simon Calder\u2019s free travel email for expert advice and money-saving discountsGet Simon Calder\u2019s Travel email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeIn west London, a noisy night for residents spells a profitable night for any taxi and Uber drivers who are prepared to work into the early hours. After midnight on Monday morning at London Heathrow, a succession of planes touched down. Normally all arriving aircraft are tucked in by 11pm. The tardy half-dozen were British Airways Airbus jets arriving well behind schedule from Dublin, Glasgow, Naples, Pisa, Porto and Prague. Around 900 weary passengers then trudged through the echoing terminal buildings, discovering that the Underground and rail lines had closed for the night. As the Heathrow stragglers sorted out their onward travel arrangements and possibly grimaced at the cost, across at Gatwick thousands of easyJet passengers were still waiting for the chance to fly.On Sunday, easyJet had grounded more than 60 flights. They included a pair of departures to Cyprus, flights to various Greek islands and the 1,800-mile haul to Antalya.Monday\u2019s cancellations by Britain\u2019s biggest budget airline at its main base, London Gatwick, topped 40. Among the fallers: Lanzarote (again), Chania in Crete and Dalaman in Turkey.After I wrote about the disruption to the travel plans of tens of thousands of BA and easyJet passengers, \u201cCall me Frank\u201d on Twitter asked: \u201cWhere does the fault stem from?\u201dRecommendedAirline\u2019s new policy to suspend \u2018overweight\u2019 flight attendants faces backlash Emergency inflatable slide \u2018explodes\u2019 inside Delta Air Lines planeMan banned from flying with easyJet for 10 years \u2018because of his name\u2019Frank offered three possible explanations:Weather, some huge storms?Lack of aircraft or crew?Poor management/planning?Let me tackle them in order.Weather was the trigger. From a pilot\u2019s point of view, storms pose a serious threat. Aviation professionals are, I am glad to say, obsessed about safety. One very significant reason why UK and Irish airlines enjoy remarkable accident-free records is intolerance of risk. And that means avoiding cumulonimbus clouds of the kind that lashed the southern half of Britain on Sunday and Monday.Next, was there a lack of aircraft or crew? Evidently. An extended delay can turn into a cancellation if the crew reach their maximum duty times. Even if the trip goes ahead with a delay of, say, four hours, there are knock-on effects: strict rules on minimum rest for crew kick in; and a plane due to fly from A to B might still be on the ground in C.You (or Frank) might counter: surely resource shortages are the result of poor management/planning? Both BA and easyJet are, in my view, well run.The trouble is, resilience is expensive. Having large numbers of spare planes and crew on hand just in case may be a commendable goal, but it is unrealistic to expect an airline to be able seamlessly to recover from extreme weather disruption. Especially at Heathrow and Gatwick. And therein lies the real problem.British Airways and easyJet are united in one characteristic: having their main bases at airports bursting at the air-traffic control seams.BA\u2019s home at Heathrow is the busiest two-runway airport in the world. And Gatwick, where easyJet is the leading customer, is the busiest single-runway airport in the world, When schedules start to unravel, there is very little slack in the system. Weather disruption affects all airlines. But BA\u2019s Heathrow-based operation and easyJet\u2019s Gatwick network are especially susceptible.Recommended\u2018I\u2019m so confused\u2019: Woman resists being removed from Southwest flight by policeWoman sparks debate after \u2018embarrassing\u2019 plus size passenger on flightThese are the world\u2019s best airlines in 2023Consider Aer Lingus, which flies to both Heathrow and Gatwick.

I saw only two non-BA cancellations on Tuesday from Heathrow.For British Airways and easyJet, though, the scale of disruption is huge. So let me offer a fourth possibility: each airline has too many eggs in one vulnerable basket. But both carriers might say: we\u2019re just responding to customer demand. To reduce the risk of disruption, steer away from the most congested hubs \u2013 or at least the most dominant airlines.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeNorfolk may not seem the most obvious place to look for a boutique place to stay, but the fact is the county can lay claim to some of the best small boutique hotels in the country, especially in the chi-chi reaches of its fabled North Coast. As a county patchworked by country estates \u2013 most of them with fancy mansions built by local bigwigs \u2013 Norfolk scores particularly well on small and elegant country house hotels that have been gussied up with style and flair for the 21st century. It\u2019s also a county of brilliant pubs, and there are any number of revamped inns that have added cosy rooms and a special food offering. Indeed, Norfolk tends to be a region of small independent businesses rather than mega-chains, and there are one or two small pub groups that place a strong emphasis on high-quality accommodation and food of local provenance.To help you choose where to rest your head, we\u2019ve put together a list of the best boutique places to stay in the county.RecommendedBest family-friendly hotels in the UK for style, location and value for moneyThe best dog-friendly hotels in the UK for 2023The UK\u2019s best seaside hotels 2023The best boutique hotels in Norfolk 2023 are:Best for couples: The IronmongersBest hotel for familes: The GroveBest hotel for foodies: Morston hallBest hotel for walkers: Titchwell ManorBest hotel for shopping: The Assembly HouseBest budget hotel: The CliftonvilleBest for couples: The IrongmongersLocation: AylshamEnjoy a large four-poster in the Haberdashery room at The Ironmongers  (Ironmongers Hotel)Located in a historic Elizabethan house right at the heart of the small Norfolk town of Aylsham, The Ironmongers\u00a0is a perfect spot for a couple\u2019s tryst: totally private, with no reception, just a code to gain entrance, and eight beautifully designed guest rooms inspired by the town\u2019s historic trades \u2013 as well as ironmongery, the building has hosted a wine merchant, tailors shop and all sorts of\u00a0 different businesses over the years.\u00a0The large Haberdashery room has a four-poster and lots of fancy silks and satins, but all of the rooms are spacious and welcoming, with solid oak floors, smart TVs, good wifi, tea and coffee-making facilities and en-suite bathrooms with good-sized showers, fluffy towels and toiletries.\u00a0Heat and hot water are provided by air-source heat pumps, and dogs are welcome in two of the rooms. It\u2019s a B&B without the breakfast, but don\u2019t let that worry you: Norfolk folk swear by the local Bread Source bakery chain and there\u2019s a branch right downstairs, serving delectable croissants and other pastries, sweet and savoury. If that doesn\u2019t take your fancy, the Black Boys pub across the road does an excellent full English breakfast. Best hotel for families: The GroveLocation: CromerThe family-run Grove hotel has large, homely rooms  (The Grove)Situated between the Norfolk resorts of Cromer and Overstrand, this is not a beach hotel in the traditional sense \u2013 there are no sea views. But it has a tucked-away feel that is irresistible, and you can walk to the beach in a matter of minutes, escaping through the trees of the hotel\u2019s secluded garden as if en route to your own secret place. A family-run hotel, it has a welcoming and comfortable feel that can only be achieved after years in the business, with 16 well-appointed guest rooms split between the main house and the Orchard Rooms in the grounds, supplemented by a scattering of self-catering cottages, glamping yurts and a giant shepherds hut. The rooms are simple, understated and homely, with up-to-date furnishings and well-appointed en-suite bathrooms. There\u2019s also a consistently good restaurant, open for lunch and dinner, and service is terrific. Meanwhile, the grounds are home to a heated indoor swimming pool and a funky \u2018massage hut\u2019 offering various treatments.Best hotel for foodies: Morston HallLocation: MorstonMorston Hall has a Michelin-star restaurant  (Morston Hall)Just a few miles from picturesque Blakeney and just footsteps from Morston Quay in North Norfolk, Morston Hall sits surrounded by beautiful gardens \u2013 an oasis of calm in what can be a busy spot during the summer months. Once you\u2019re within the hotel\u2019s flint walls, you feel like nothing bad could happen to you, and you can enjoy the comfy rooms and on-point cooking of chef-patron Galton Blackiston. The rooms are very comfy indeed, divided between the main house and an annex in the garden, and have everything you could possibly need, from private terraces and smart TVs, to Nespresso machines and homemade cookies, fresh milk and still and sparkling water. En-suite bathrooms are large, with a walk-in shower,\u00a0robes and Noble Isle toiletries\u00a0and a separate bathtub with its own TV. But the rooms aren\u2019t really the point: you\u2019re paying for the glorious peace of the location, the gardens that surround the house in a fertile embrace and a restaurant where the devotedly local menu changes every day, depending on what\u2019s available and in season\u00a0\u2013 whether it\u2019s from the Hall\u2019s fecund kitchen garden or mini-smokehouse, or the various fish and seafood suppliers and local farmers that Galton deals with. The one thing you can predict is that Galton will cook your breakfast himself the following morning, when he likes to chat to guests and find out how they enjoyed their dinner the night before.Best hotel for walkers: Titchwell ManorLocation: TitchwellTitchwell Manor\u2019s Signature rooms feature super-king-size beds and private patios (Titchwell Manor)Looking out over the the salt marshes of the North Norfolk coast, Titchwell Manor is one of the best places to stay \u2013 and to eat \u2013 in an area that\u2019s not exactly short of options. Divided between a main building, cottage annexe and stable block, it houses 26 individually styled boutique rooms ranging from the cheapest \u2018Good\u2019 doubles through \u2018Better\u2019 up to \u2018Best\u2019 and \u2018Signature\u2019 rooms, featuring super-king-size beds, private patio areas, freestanding baths and separate showers. A couple even have their own terraces with private hot tubs. If that\u2019s not quite private enough, you can always opt for a shepherd\u2019s hut in the garden, with its own shower room, living area, hot tub and wood-burner.\u00a0All the rooms have good wifi,\u00a0 smart TVs, robes, tea- and coffee-making facilities and recently updated bathrooms. You can have an in-room massage, and a third of the rooms are dog-friendly \u2013 nice to know, given the excellent walks in all directions.\u00a0Work up an appetite on the Norfolk Coast Path before dining at the hotel\u2019s renowned 3 AA-rosette restaurant \u2013 or just pick up some fish and chips from its well-known sister business, Eric\u2019s.Best hotel for shopping: The Assembly HouseLocation: NorwichIn a beautifully renovated Georgian building, The Assembly House is full of luxury  (Assembly House)Run by revered local chef Richard Hughes and his wife Stacia, the Assembly House occupies a beautifully renovated Georgian building bang in the centre of Norwich \u2013 a boutique hotel, restaurant and cookery school that is one of the country\u2019s best places for an indulgent and cultural short break. Occupying two wings flanking the garden and entrance, the guest rooms are light and spacious and decorated in a classic-meets-contemporary style. Each one is different but all come with high-quality beds and linen, good wifi, flatscreen TVs and Bluetooth speakers. There\u2019s a car park next door, and you can start the day with one of Richard\u2019s superb breakfasts, served in the elegant ground-floor restaurant, where you can also enjoy a delicious afternoon tea. You couldn\u2019t be in a better location for exploring central Norwich, which is literally on your doorstep.Best budget hotel: The CliftonvilleLocation: CromerMost of the contemporary rooms at The Cliftonville have sea views  (Cliftonville Hotel)Situated right on top of the cliffs in resurgent Cromer, The Cliftonville is a landmark building that, until recently, was in need of a bit of TLC. Luckily for us, it has been renovated by the City Pub Company, which has turned The Cliftonville into an affordable and thoroughly up-to-date place to stay, just minutes from the town\u2019s beach. Most of the rooms have sea views and it\u2019s nice to know you can leave the car at home and come here by train from Norwich, leaving you free to focus on the seaside attractions of Cromer. The beach and the pier are right there, and there\u2019s another beautiful beach at Overstrand, a short walk away, where you can enjoy crab sandwiches in the clifftop caf\u00e9. Alternatively, try the Cromer crab or some of Norfolk\u2019s best fish and chips in No.1 or Mary Janes before following the Norfolk Coast Path to Sheringham, where you can sample some of the county\u2019s best ice cream at Ellie\u2019s. And the hotel? It\u2019s an Edwardian gem \u2013 think\u00a0sweeping staircases and stained-glass windows \u2013 that has been sensitively restored: it boasts a cosy bar; a contemporary restaurant that makes the most of the sea views and serves decent modern British food; and 30 guest rooms and suites with en-suite bathrooms, good wifi, flatscreen TVs and tea- and coffee-making facilities.Read more of our UK hotel reviews:Best spa hotels in NorfolkBest London hotelsBest Essex hotelsRecommended12 places you won\u2019t believe are in EnglandThe best wild swimming stays in the UKBest hotels in Somerset 2023: Where to stay for countryside charmRead more about England travel:Where to stay in NottinghamThe Lake District\u2019s best boutique hotelsBest hotels in the Cotswolds"}, {"_id": "6488a04651ac33a3962e1845", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/europe/france/best-coastal-camping-holidays-france-beach-b2355881.html", "primaryCategory": "France", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Where to go camping in France: Eight best coastal campsites for a beach holiday", "lead": "<p>Pitch up near sandy shores from Corsica to the Loire Valley </p>", "author": "Natalie Wilson", "datePublished": "Tue, 13 Jun 2023 12:19:41 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:58:46.109617", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-13T12:19:41+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/12/14/iStock-1008958392.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Simon Calder\u2019s free travel email for expert advice and money-saving discountsGet Simon Calder\u2019s Travel email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeA 1,024 square mile area of coves, castle ruins and dramatic coastline make Dorset a UK hotspot for an active staycation on England\u2019s southern shores.The diverse landscape of the British county includes Christchurch, Purbeck, Weymouth and Bournemouth, and the area has become known for its iconic rock formations from Durdle Door to Lulworth Cove.England\u2019s only natural Unesco World Heritage Site, the famous Jurassic Coast, stretches from Studland Bay to Exmouth in Devon and offers charming seaside villages, beaches littered with fossils and a vast space for long walks.With over 3,000 miles of trails and paths, the rolling rural hills and country lanes beg to be explored on foot as post-card towns and cosy pubs link bridleways and byways \u2013 and don\u2019t worry, signposts, maps and tours are available to guide you along the way.Here\u2019s\u00a0The Independent\u2019s\u00a0selection of simple strolls, challenging hikes and winding walking routes to accompany quaint stays on a Dorset walking holiday.RecommendedIndependent Traveller guide to best hotels and short breaksFamily-friendly hotels in the UK for style, location and valueBest UK hotels 2022Read more on UK travel:The best wild swimming stays in the UKWhy there\u2019s more to the Yorkshire Dales than the Three PeaksHow to do a classic Cotswolds weekend, car-freeGolden Cap Walk, SeatownA view to Golden Cap, Dorset  (Getty Images/iStockphoto)Starting short and simple, the famous South West Coast Path, the UK\u2019s longest National Trail, connects\u00a0Seatown to Golden Cap, the highest point on England\u2019s south coast and a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. This four-mile circular walk combines a steep climb with stunning views of Charmouth and Chesil Beach and ancient woodland on Langdon Hill. Beginning and ending in Seatown car park, return inland past the historic ruins of the 13th century St Gabriel\u2019s Chapel on the National Trust estate in Bridport.The Golden Cap walk takes on average just over two hours to complete and, while the multi-terrain can be challenging, this is a strong and easy-to-follow choice of coastal walk for families that is also perfectly situated for some post-climb pub grub in the Anchor Inn at Seatown.Where to stayCopse Gate Farm is a charming B&B set in Bridport, 4.2 miles from Golden Cap. Rooms feature countryside views and private bathrooms on the working farm with cattle, sheep, pigs and chickens. Old Harry Rocks Walk, Studland Old Harry Rocks in east Dorset  (Getty Images/iStockphoto)One of Dorset\u2019s best-known landmarks, Old Harry Rock, part of several rock formations carved from the waves, has stood alone with just a stump since Old Harry\u2019s Wife tumbled into the sea after eroding in 1896. Nonetheless, people still flock to this popular open vantage point that accommodates cyclists, picnickers and walkers year-round.This gentle walk is another circular coastal trail, 3.5 miles from South Haven Point in Studland to the chalk grasslands of Ballard Point and the Purbeck Way. South Haven marks the start (or end) of the 630 miles South West Coast Path. With the loop back to Studland, the walk will take you through Celtic earthworks and wildlife such as Peregrine falcons over roughly two hours. Ballard Point is a great place for picturesque views across Poole Bay to Bournemouth and Hengistbury Head, while grasslands and wildflower conservation fields dot the hillsides along the way.Where to stayStudland View Cottage\u00a0provides cosy accommodation with a private terrace and patio for al fresco dining. Set 450 yards from Knoll Beach, the cottage features an uninterrupted view of Old Harry Rock and direct access to the Jurassic Coastal Path.The Purbeck Ridgeway, Corfe Castle to SwanageThe ruins of Corfe Castle overlook the quintessentially English village of Corfe (Getty Images)This\u00a0route\u00a0highlights some of the best panoramic coastal views in Dorset. It starts at Corfe Castle, the ruins of a Norman stronghold, and follows a stretch of the\u00a0Purbeck Ridgeway\u00a0before joining the South West Coast Path into Swanage. The route itself takes four to five hours to walk and is almost eight miles long, taking in the Victorian obelisk on Ballard Down and Old Harry chalk stacks on the way. At the end of the linear walk, jump on the 20-minute steam train at Swanage for a much faster return inland. Swanage is home to more than just a railway; find Blue Flag beaches, seafood spots, scuba diving and coasteering adventures on the popular Dorset seafront, a rewarding end to the long stroll.Where to stayMortons Manor is housed in a 16th-century manor house in Corfe, close to Corfe Castle, with its own traditional restaurant, terrace and spacious rooms.Lulworth Cove to Durdle DoorThe famous stone archway of Durdle Door  (Getty Images)The region\u2019s defining Jurassic Coast is a 96-mile-long World Heritage Site, from the picturesque staycation destination of Exmouth in Devon all the way to the idyllic Studland Bay in Dorset. To experience just a slice of the prehistoric geology, this 6.2-mile\u00a0trail\u00a0is a great way to explore the coastline. From the start point, the route observes natural landmarks such as the crescent-shaped blue waters of the famous Lulworth Cove, the limestone arch at Durdle Door and Bat\u2019s Head picnic spot.There are many popular walks between the hotspots, all varied in length and difficulty, with equally stunning views for anyone who doesn\u2019t fancy embarking on the full 96-mile Jurassic Coast challenge. We recommend turning back inland from Durdle Door to see the most sights for your steps.Where to stayThe Castle Inn in West Lulworth is a beautiful setting just moments from Lulworth Cove beach. Each room features quirky decor, while the restaurant and bar, complete with al fresco dining spaces, offers English cuisine, buffet breakfasts and vegan options.Isle of Portland Circular WalkPortland Bill Lighthouse, Weymouth  (Getty Images/iStockphoto)This walk begins in the centre of the Isle of Portland, a tiny island tied to Weymouth by Chessil Beach and the southernmost point of Dorset. Active quarries have cut white Portland limestone since the Romans, with the stone seen in the architecture of both St Paul\u2019s Cathedral and Buckingham Palace.The eight-mile route, which takes between three to four hours, passes the Portland Bill Lighthouse before looping back to the historic buildings and coastal fortifications of Blacknor Fort and Rufus Castle. Stop at Portland Bill for lunch at The Lobster Pot before continuing the climb through wild beaches and steep ridges. On a clear day, the moderately challenging circular route boasts great views of crystal waters and seabirds in the English Channel on a complete lap of the island.Where to stayThe Sunset Lodge is a comfortable, seafront place to stay in Chiswell, Portland. It features three bedrooms, spectacular sea views and a terrace just 10 yards from Portland Beach.Hengistbury Head to SandbanksBeach huts at Hengistbury Head in Bournemouth (Getty Images/iStockphoto)Covering\u00a010 miles\u00a0of Dorset\u2019s coast, the promenade between Hengistbury Head and Sandbanks in Poole is a top choice for those wanting to explore some of the Dorset coastline at a gentle pace that doesn\u2019t involve hiking in the hills. The one-way walk starts in Hengistbury Head \u2013 an unspoiled pebble beach attached to Southbourne \u2013 but shorter\u00a0routes\u00a0to Mudeford and Alum Chine are plenty if the full stretch isn\u2019t for you. Possible stops include Southbourne Beach, Bournemouth Pier and Durley Chine, ideal for refuelling with lunch at a beachside kiosk or a swim in the sea during the three-hour-plus walk. The flat promenade makes for a gentle family stroll to get from A to B while enjoying the best of Bournemouth\u2019s beaches.Where to stayThe\u00a0Harbour Hotel\u00a0in Christchurch is set on the banks of one of Dorset\u2019s most picturesque estuaries, just 20 minutes by car from the heart of Bournemouth. It offers a luxury spa and award-winning restaurant wrapped up in an impressive Victorian building. Durlston Head to Dancing Ledge Soak in the views of the Dorset coast above Dancing Ledge  (Getty Images/iStockphoto)This is another relatively short\u00a0walk\u00a0at just under six miles from Durlston Head to Dancing Ledge. The route takes in two of the region\u2019s popular attractions, Durlston Head Country Park and Nature Reserve and Dancing Ledge natural pool and flat rock, off the South West Coast Path. From Durlston Head, take to the Purbeck coastline by following the path to the Great Globe onto the coastal path, passing caves, Anvil Point Lighthouse and finally scrambling down a stone wall to take a dip from Dancing Ledge.The almost six-mile round trip takes roughly two to three hours to complete due to the rocky terrain and the return route offers a journey through\u00a0Townsend Nature Reserve, where walkers will pass among the cattle and ponies grazing on the rare limestone grassland.Where to stayThe Lookout apartment in Swanage, less than a mile from Swanage Bay, benefits from views over the Purbeck Hills, modern appliances and proximity to several of Dorset\u2019s best hiking routes.RecommendedThe best dog-friendly beaches in the UK revealed10 most beautiful places to visit in the UK11 best parks in the UK for soaking up the summer sunRead our reviews of the best Dorset hotels"}, {"_id": "6488a04651ac33a3962e1847", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/europe/turkey/turkey-best-beach-breaks-b2350460.html", "primaryCategory": "Turkey", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Turkey\u2019s best beaches, as chosen by a local", "lead": "<p> With 5,000 miles of coastline, the country has holiday options to suit everyone; local expert <strong>Jennifer Hattam </strong>shares her favourites</p>", "author": "Jennifer Hattam", "datePublished": "Tue, 13 Jun 2023 11:46:13 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:58:46.569114", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-13T11:46:13+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/02/16/iStock-878709210.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Simon Calder\u2019s free travel email for expert advice and money-saving discountsGet Simon Calder\u2019s Travel email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeWhether your idea of a perfect beach break is sipping cocktails on a sun lounger, a family-friendly frolic in gentle waves, dancing on the sands to open-air DJ sets, or a super-active stint of kayaking, windsurfing, or scuba diving, Turkey has a summer holiday destination to fit the bill. The country\u2019s 5,000-plus miles of coastline encompasses broad sandy expanses along the Mediterranean Sea, Aegean villages with charm to spare, and the rugged Black Sea shores, where the crashing waves can be dramatically scenic (if not exactly alluring to swimmers).Direct flights from the UK to Izmir, Bodrum, Marmaris, Dalaman and Antalya put Turkish shores within easy reach, though you\u2019ll find more peace and quiet \u2013 and less-developed coastline \u2013 the further you venture away from these popular airports.

When you need a break from sun and sea, pop over to the nearby Antalya Archaeological Museum, filled with splendid finds from ancient cities all around this part of the coast. Antalya\u2019s pleasant old town (Kaleici) is just two miles away.Where to stayConveniently set two blocks inland from the beach, the adults-only Sealife Lounge Hotel gets high marks from guests for its friendly staff and tranquil vibe.Cesme Peninsula, IzmirAlacati Beach, Cesme  (Getty/iStock)Jutting out into the Aegean Sea and studded with olive trees, the Cesme Peninsula is a popular weekend break for residents of Izmir and Istanbul, with multiple towns suitable for a holiday base. Tiny Alacati is packed with picture-perfect boutique hotels and trendy restaurants serving seafood-heavy Aegean cuisine; its bay is prime windsurfing territory. Bustling Cesme has a 16th-century castle and better access to lovely sandy beaches like Altinkum and Pirlanta, both on the peninsula\u2019s westernmost tip.Where to stayBohemian-chic Gaia Alacat\u0131 blends comfort and relaxed cool for an intimate stay. The gourmet breakfast in the serene courtyard is a highlight.Iztuzu Beach, Dalyan Iztuzu Beach, Dalyan (Jennifer Hattam)Probably the best trip to the beach is the open-air boat service down a winding, reed-lined river to Iztuzu Beach near the western end of Turkey\u2019s Mediterranean coast. And what a beach it is: a protected nesting area for sea turtles, this gorgeous three-mile-long stretch of sand is super-clean and minimally developed. Dalyan itself is a laidback holiday town set between vast Lake Koycegiz and the ancient city of\u00a0Kaunos.Where to stayOn spacious, attractive riverfront grounds between town and the beach, the Dalyan Resort Hotel has a mildly maritimey vibe, tidy rooms, and amenities including a pool and spa.Doubles from \u00a3116 per night Book nowOludeniz, FethiyeOludeniz, Fethiye (Jennifer Hattam)Paragliders soar down from the peak of nearby Babadag to land along the white sands of Belcekiz Beach in this lively resort town, where the beachfront is lined with bars, restaurants, and cafes. (Head south about 2.5 miles to Kidrak Beach for more peace and quiet, with an equally beautiful setting.) Adventurers who prefer to keep their feet on the ground can hike part of the scenic Lycian Way trail for sweeping views over the area\u2019s famous \u201cblue lagoon\u201d.Where to stayHelpful staff and a great location just off Belcekiz Beach elevate the small, simple Tonoz Beach Hotel into a prime pick.Golturkbuku, BodrumBodrum, Turkey  (Getty/iStock)For a taste of the Turkish highlife, head to this secluded bay on the northern edge of the Bodrum Peninsula where the rich and famous go to play in high summer. The Turkbuku (north-western) end of the bay is where the real celeb-spotting happens while the Golkoy end is more understated. The public beach is small but many hotels have their own waterfront sunbathing platforms.Where to stayStylish, comfortable rooms, excellent food, and a private beach make the Flamm Bodrum a great get-away-from-it-all destination.Cleopatra Beach, AlanyaCleopatra Beach, Alanya (Jennifer Hattam)The clear, warm waters of the Mediterranean Sea lap against 1.2 miles of golden sand at one of Turkey\u2019s most (justifiably) famous beaches, fully equipped with cabanas, beach bars, kids\u2019 playgrounds, volleyball courts and other facilities. Alanya can reach scorching temperatures in high summer but on a cooler day it\u2019s well worth making the trek up the hill that overlooks the beach to the 13th-century castle on the summit, and the Seljuk-era shipyard and \u201cred tower\u201d on the other side.Where to stayThe adults-only Cook\u2019s Club Alanya, right on Cleopatra Beach, caters to a hip young crowd with DJs by the pool and a food-truck-inspired buffet.Patara Beach, KasPatara Beach, Kas (Jennifer Hattam)The longest and one of the wildest beaches in Turkey, the sands of Patara stretch for eight miles along the Mediterranean, with little to disturb sunbathers, swimmers and strollers. It\u2019s backed by dunes, behind which lie the atmospheric ancient ruins of Patara, thought to have been founded in the 1st century BC. You\u2019ll find mostly simple, family-run accommodation in the rural village of Gelemis, about 1.5 miles inland from the beach.Where to stayThe peaceful, family-friendly Pataros Hotel has simple rooms, a warm vibe, and an outdoor pool for those who can\u2019t be bothered to make the trip to the beach.Datca Peninsula, MarmarisDatca Peninsula, Marmaris (Jennifer Hattam)This narrow, hilly, windswept peninsula near where the Mediterranean meets the Aegean feels blissfully remote \u2013 and locals would like to keep it that way. Outside of the pleasantly lively Datca town, the winding coast is dotted with tranquil coves and beaches. Find your favourite... and don\u2019t spread the word too loudly.Where to stayPerched on a hill above Datca town, overlooking the turquoise sea, the Villa Asina hotel is an oasis within an oasis, treating guests to dramatic sunrises and delicious Aegean cuisine.RecommendedWhat it\u2019s like to do the night train from Sofia to IstanbulIs it safe to travel to Turkey\u2019s tourist resorts?Explore Istanbul in style \u2013 these are the 10 best hotels in the Turkish cityRead more of our best Istanbul hotel reviews "}, {"_id": "6488a04651ac33a3962e1848", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/uk/best-parks-uk-green-london-b2353151.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Best parks in the UK to enjoy the sun, from spacious city spaces to restored small-town spots", "lead": "<p>A place for all ages to enjoy, these top green spaces are some of the country\u2019s finest, as selected by parks afficionado   <strong>Christopher Beanland </strong></p>", "author": "Christopher Beanland", "datePublished": "Tue, 13 Jun 2023 11:11:40 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:58:46.822330", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-13T11:11:40+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/07/15/newFile-2.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Simon Calder\u2019s free travel email for expert advice and money-saving discountsGet Simon Calder\u2019s Travel email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeParks are more than just public spaces; they often set the scene for our most cherished memories, from first ice creams to first kisses. In recent years, lockdown reminded us just how important our humble local park was \u2013 suddenly it was the place where we exercised, socialised, dated, danced, played, cooked and relaxed. Parks have been the backdrop to all these activities for a century and a half, but they\u2019ve changed over the years, too: fancy at first, before becoming run down and even a little scary at times, they provided a haven for teenagers and punks in the 20th century.These days, as cities have regenerated, flat dwelling has mushroomed and tourism has thrived, parks find themselves in demand and awash with punters. From the High Line in New York to more traditional former hunting grounds like Richmond Park in London, the park is a place for all ages and weathers. But it\u2019s in summer, as the mercury rises and the prosecco corks pop, that flocking to the grass proves irresistable. You can enjoy watching the world go by in your local park, or travel further afield to see the UK\u2019s top open spaces.I spent a year recording my podcast Park Date, where each episode I take a stroll with a famous guest \u2013 like Shazia Mirza, Alexandra Haddow, Harriet Kemsley and Christopher Biggins \u2013 in a different park around the world.

Shaped like a Wellington boot and wedged between two canals and some gorgeous housing, the park is a marvel of Victorian benevolence. Its Chinese pagoda was thought of as wildly exotic when the park was built in the 17th century. It also had a lido until 1990, and now\u2019s the time to rebuild this outdoor swimming space. Victoria Park has plentiful cafes and pubs on its outskirts and is guarded by two Dogs of Alcibiades at the Bonner Street entrance \u2013 marble sculptures of Molossian Hounds donated by Lady Aignarth in 1912. It\u2019s even the venue for various music festivals like Field Day and, latterly, All Points East. Plus, the park has recently come to prominence again due to Gemma Reeves\u2019 eponymous novel about the people who live around its edges.Where to stayMama Shelter London Shoreditch makes a cool base a 10-minute walk from the park.Birkenhead Park, MerseysideNo delve into public parks could be complete without a look at Birkenhead Park on The Wirral. One of the world\u2019s original parks and possibly the first publicly funded civic park in the world, it opened in 1847 and was designed by Joseph Paxton of Crystal Palace fame. It became the template on which many parks around the world came to be based, with its Romanesque ruins and ornamental lake, mixed with lawns and flower beds. US landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted came to look around in 1850 and was so struck with Birkenhead\u2019s beauty that he used it as a template for many of his American and Canadian parks, including Montreal and Buffalo and, most notably, New York\u2019s Central Park.Where to stayHotel Indigo Liverpool is the other side of the River Mersey; hop on the 407 bus or take a leisurely 40-minute stroll to reach Birkenhead.The architect who created New York\u2019s Central Park used Birkenhead Park as his inspiration  (Getty Images/iStockphoto)The Walks, King\u2019s LynnThe Walks is a small-town park that was lovingly restored in 2007, after decades of being rather dilapidated. The handsome Victorian bandstand set on an island surrounded by a moat from the diverted Gaywood River is a nice touch. Meanwhile, there\u2019s a town wall, gates, and 15th-century Red Mount Chapel, built for pilgrims en route to Walsingham. Together, these have gained The Walks a Grade II listing from Historic England for its long history and unusual combination of landscapes and buildings. There\u2019s even a football stadium in The Walks, and this is home to the plucky Linnets \u2013 a non-league King\u2019s Lynn Town FC, who are on something of a Wrexham-esque roll of late.Where to stayThe Duke\u2019s Head Hotel is an affordable place to lay your head that\u2019s a convenient 15-minute walk from the park.Woodhouse Moor, LeedsA tonic for generations of Leeds University students, Woodhouse Moor\u2019s windswept uplands sit high on a hill and feel slightly wild. In summer, parties, picnics and sports dominate, while during the less warm months (of which Leeds has more than its fair share) you can spot other things in the park \u2013 like the statues of dignitaries with traffic cones on their heads and the gardeners toiling at the allotments. Sometimes students call it Hyde Park, which is not hugely surprising, as the park\u2019s official branding is pretty minimal and there\u2019s a big traffic junction at the northern edge called Hyde Park Corner. All the streets overlooking the park are almost entirely student rentals, while the former toilet block was transformed into Akmal\u2019s, a popular student tandoori venue.Where to stay The DoubleTree Leeds puts you right in the city centre while being a half-hour stroll from the park.Botanic Gardens, BelfastBelfast\u2019s Botanic Gardens play host to the Ulster Museum and Palm House  (Getty Images)Belfast\u2019s Botanic Gardens is as much of a treat as a bag of cheese and onion Tayto crisps and it hosts two very different buildings. On one side sits the Ulster Museum with its radical 1972 brutalist extension by Francis Pym, an aggressive gesture built during the most tumultuous period in the province\u2019s history. In contrast, you\u2019ll also see the monumental Palm House designed by Charles Lanyon\u2019s, dating from 1840. Inside this steamy, tropical greenhouse you can find all sorts of exotic delights like the globe spear lily. The park sits next to Queen\u2019s University and even has its own station, Botanic, which is on the Northern Ireland rail network.Where to stayAC Hotel enjoys a prime waterfront location by the River Lagan, and is 25 and 35 minutes away from the gardens on public transport or on foot respectively.Sutton Park, BirminghamSutton Park\u2019s most alluring asset is the mainline railway, which unusually stretches out down its entire length and provides much amusement to kids. As do the donkey sanctuary and activity centre. A lido used to be here until 2003 and if you\u2019re listening Birmingham City Council, it\u2019s high time to get it re-opened. In the absence of the lido there are still plenty of ponds to explore and dive into. The BBC Radio 1 Roadshow \u2013 which was the previous incarnation of BBC Radio 1\u2019s One Big Weekend \u2013 played here in 1992 to celebrate the station\u2019s 25th anniversary. One wonders what Henry VIII would have made of it all, as he gifted the former royal hunting park at Sutton to its people. Where to stayStaying Cool, housed in the high-rise Rotunda, is bang in Birmingham city centre, a half-hour drive from Sutton Park.Holyrood Park & Arthur\u2019s Seat, EdinburghHolyrood is a mountainous park overlooking the Scottish capital  (Getty Images/iStockphoto)Holyrood is an extremely unusual example of a mountainous park within a city. Were it not for the thousands of others who will also join you on this odyssey through Edinburgh\u2019s wildest and windiest slice of land, you\u2019d almost believe you were in the Highlands. The extinct volcano of Arthur\u2019s Seat broods right over the centre of the Scottish capital, whose dour architectural seems to honour and magnify the greyness of Salisbury Crags. At the foot of the hill, you can find the Scottish Parliament, while in the park itself there are colonies of fulmars, stonechats and hares, plus orchids. During festival season you\u2019ll spy narcissistic hungover stand-up comic, and over-exuberant experimental student theatre practitioners alike slogging up to the top of Arthur\u2019s Seat, ciggies and vodka in hand. Where to stayIbis Styles St Andrew Square is two minutes from Princes Street and a 20-minute amble from the edge of the park.Crystal Palace Park, LondonThe highlight of any visit to Crystal Palace Park is spotting the sculptures of dinosaurs, which don\u2019t look quite like the real thing and are a real feat of Victorian bravado. At that time, the natural world was being relentlessly studied in the name of science \u2013 so here we have a collection of slightly woozy and sleepy iguanodon, teleosauras, megalosaurus and more, on an island in a lake. They\u2019re the perfect accompaniment for Joseph Paxton\u2019s Crystal Palace, which was also out of this world. The glass palace showcased booty, biology, engineering, art and ideas from around the British Empire. It began life in Hyde Park in 1851 on the site of the Great Exhibition, before coming to South London in 1854, and giving its name to the park, suburb and football team. Alas, the palace stood proud until being ravaged by flames in 1936.Where to stayArt\u2019otel London Battersea Power Station is a new opening, from where you can hop on a 23-minute Southern train to Crystal Palace.Hampstead Heath, LondonThe wonders of the Heath include the atmospheric Pergola garden  (Getty Images/iStockphoto)The Heath \u2013 as Londoners know this spot\u2013 is so big and wild that exploring it feels akin to being out in the countryside of Surrey or Hertfordshire. Owned and run by the City of London, it features huge expanses of gorse and grass, plus steep inclines.

Just like the High Line, they have left some of the track bed (if only there was a train) and beautifully restored the station buildings, platform, and level crossing. Meanwhile, the Harbour Bridge features more flowers and planters and a bike path.

Then there\u2019s also Steve Sansweet\u2019s incredible memorabilia museum near San Francisco, Madame Tussauds\u2019 accurate recreations of the movie characters in London and, of course, Galaxy\u2019s Edge at Disney\u2019s US theme parks.What none of these attractions offer, though, is the sense of total immersion that I found on the Galactic Starcruiser at Disney\u2019s Hollywood Studios in Orlando, Florida. This is the first Star Wars experience that allows you to actually be a participant in the story \u2013 and that\u2019s why, despite the many people who seem to be crowing over the pricey attraction\u2019s premature demise, in my opinion it\u2019s a real shame that it will be closing its doors for good this September.Participants sleeps in \u2018cabins\u2019 aboard the starcruiser (Graham E. Hancock)Arriving at the building filled me with anticipation, but the bunker-looking exterior is very much going for the functional starport vibe. Once we stepped onto a \u2018transport\u2019 though, and felt the ground rumbling as we were taken up to the Starcruiser (known as the Halcyon), I knew we were in for something unique. Stepping out of the transport and into the Halcyon\u2019s atrium gave me a literal jaw-drop moment as it really did feel like being aboard a starship in a galaxy far, far away.The building was dreamed up by the same creative artists who work on the movies, and it showed. While the broad-brushstrokes are great, the smallest details are there too, right down to the Hyperspace Compass on display that houses the objective of the heist. While the first impressions were great, what continued to impress me during our two days of adventuring were the interactive elements. The wristbands we received on arrival interacted with the computer terminals, so we were able to scramble an astromech droid\u2019s memory and delete the cruiser\u2019s flight log when the mission called for it. Down in the engine room, everything you touch can impact the functioning of the cruiser, so we decoded the puzzles and got things operational.\n\nStepping out of the transport and into the Halcyon\u2019s atrium gave me a literal jaw-drop moment One of the most innovative interactive elements is the droid that\u2019s on call in each bedroom (or cabin) \u2013 through a monitor we had fully-fledged conversations with an animated droid, who even had me negotiate with a pirate who controlled the hyperspace lane the ship was flying through.Although these technical innovations are impressive and add to the sense of immersion, it wouldn\u2019t have worked without the talented and well-trained cast who play the characters that lead the story, from the ship\u2019s blue-skinned Captain Keevan to the Basil Fawlty-esque antagonist Lieutenant Croy. Beyond the cast, the crew staffing the hotel were also fully in character, each with their own backstory \u2013 when our server ended her shift at the Sublight Lounge, she explained that she had to get back to feed her Puffer Pig.While it wasn\u2019t on my mind in the moment, it was very clear why the Galactic Starcruiser was so expensive to book. When Disney World announced that prices would start at $4,800 for the two-night experience, the online reaction was decidedly negative. There\u2019s a strong argument that Disney World shouldn\u2019t even be offering experiences that are so exclusive and elitist.Interiors were designed by the same people who work on the films, and it shows (Graham E. Hancock)But if this sort of thing is going to be done \u2013 and done to this standard \u2013 then there\u2019s no way to get around the fact that it will be expensive to run. At a Secret Cinema event, you have to suspend some disbelief because the edges are visible; you can see where the set has been constructed in a warehouse. On board the Galactic Starcruiser, though, that was entirely unnecessary; you can see the vastness of space through the windows, you can have an interaction with a Rodian musician and you can touch the walls without them wobbling.Ever since the original Disney studio was founded, the company has pushed to tell stories in new and innovative ways. When the theme parks were first built, they seemed like an incredibly risky proposition \u2013 but pushing in an innovative direction led to holiday destinations that families travel around the world for, to experience a truly bucket-list trip.Is any trip that lasts just two days and never sees you interact with the real world \u201cworth the money\u201d? It\u2019s hard to know how to even start measuring that. But, for a fan, getting to experience the seemingly impossible and live through a Star Wars adventure felt very special indeed. Now that the attraction-crossed-with-a-hotel is closing down permanently, to become a strange quirk of Disney World and Star Wars history, those memories will be even more treasured.Read more of our best USA hotel reviews"}, {"_id": "6488a04751ac33a3962e184a", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/marlon-wayans-luggage-united-airlines-flight-b2356485.html", "primaryCategory": "News &amp; Advice", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Actor Marlon Wayans removed from flight for \u2018disturbing the peace\u2019 in luggage dispute", "lead": "<p>Flare-up occured at Denver airport when the <em>Scary Movie</em> star was told he\u2019d have to check in his bags</p>", "author": "Travel Desk", "datePublished": "Tue, 13 Jun 2023 10:43:05 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:58:47.275987", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-13T10:43:05+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/12/21/Marlon_Wayans_Airport_Citation_26522.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Simon Calder\u2019s free travel email for expert advice and money-saving discountsGet Simon Calder\u2019s Travel email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Yet for anyone who cares to explore, Bodrum offers a wealth of experiences that enrich a visit. Natural good looks, a deep and rich heritage and a vibrant 21st-century way of life combine to magical effect.Reaching this thumb of Turkish territory is easy, with direct flights from across the UK to Bodrum airport. And many arrivals head straight into town \u2013 where the first of my highlights awaits.Bodrum HarbourWhen you see the sugar-white houses of Bodrum sprinkled around a natural amphitheatre, it could be love at first sight. All eyes \u2013 and visitors \u2013 are drawn to the harbour at the heart of the town. Bodrum\u2019s port has been an Aegean hub for millennia. The first known settlement was founded as Halicarnassus around 1200 BC. For centuries warring powers fought for control of the strategic location.Today, Bodrum Harbour is a bay of tranquillity, offering safe haven to hundreds of boats: private yachts, fishing vessels and a network of ferries. One sails across to the pretty Datca peninsula, making a fine day trip.Cafes line the quayside; my favourite is run by the Mariners Association. As you\u2019d imagine, it\u2019s popular with sailors. Visitors are welcome, too. The excellent coffee will power you along for a day of sightseeing \u2013 starting right next door \u2026Bodrum CastleThe first fortifications at this location, guarding the entrance to the harbour, were built soon after the settlement was founded. The location was originally an island just offshore, but it is now joined to the mainland.Bodrum Castle was created by the Knights of St John \u2013 crusaders from across Europe \u2013 during the 15th century. The builders used stones from a much earlier building and a former wonder of the world: the vast ceremonial structure housing the tomb of the Carian King Mausolus (of which more in a moment).The crusaders named the fortress the Castle of St Peter. Today, it is a warren of walls, ruined chapels and gates, with insignia showing the national provenance of the various groups of knights (Italian, Spanish, English ...).The highlight, though, is the underwater archaeology museum: not a collection beneath the waves, but a display that reveals the past as discovered in shipwrecks. For thousands of years, seafaring was the main form of trade and communication in the Aegean region. Each shipwreck was a human tragedy. Yet the painstaking recovery of these vessels \u2013 and their contents \u2013 by nautical archaeologists provide insights into the craftsmanship and commerce of the ancient world. Think of these vessels \u2013 and their contents \u2013 as time machines.Over 3,200 years ago, towards the end of the Bronze Age, a ship sank while it was sailing off the southern Turkish coast. In 1982, a sponge diver discovered a vessel and divers retrieved the cargo: amphora (pottery jars) filled with salted fish, olive oil and wine, as well as the tin and copper required to make bronze.At the castle, you learn how important Bodrum and the rest of the Aegean were for the development of humanity.The original MausoleumThe tomb of Mausolus, a Carian king who lived and died almost 2,500 years old, was one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. The structure was completed in 351BC, decorated by magnificent sculptures and soaring to a height of nearly 50 metres. My guide, Sela Erkanli told me: \u201cThe term \u2018mausoleum\u2019 derives from here. This is the first time it has been used in history. For Mausolus.\"Around 800 years ago, an earthquake brought the original mausoleum down, and its carefully dressed stones were taken away to be reused and begin Bodrum\u2019s next chapter. Yet even today, enough of the mausoleum survives to allow you to touch the past, sense the history and understand a little more about the world.Bodrum theatreJust 200 metres inland from the mausoleum, another ancient triumph is hewn from a hillside. The theatre here in Bodrum is an entertainment highlight from the 4th century BC. It was created at the time of Alexander the Great and later embellished by the Romans. The theatre includes an altar, where sacrifices were offered to the god Dionysus before the performance.Today, you can wander freely around what even by modern standards is a vast venue \u2013 holding 13,000 citizens \u2013 and get a performer\u2019s view of the audience. Appropriately enough for a popular theatre, it\u2019s in the West End of Bodrum. Twenty-four centuries on, the theatre is still used for concerts and dance performances. And there are no bad seats in this house: all yours to enjoy and imagine.Marina lifeOn the Bodrum Peninsula you\u2019re never far from the next great shoreline view \u2013 and you\u2019re never far from one of the marinas that dot the coast. Each is an inviting location for shopping, dining and relaxing.Start in Bodrum itself, where the marina occupies part of the west side of the harbour. It doubles as a retail and entertainment centre \u2013 with excellent coffee and a rooftop view.On the northwest shore of the peninsula, Yal\u0131kavak Marina was named in 2022 as \u201cSuperyacht Marina of the Year\u201d against hundreds of competitors around the world. Yet you are welcome to share the high life, enjoying the same blue skies and sea as people who perhaps have a touch more cash than you do.G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fl\u00fck villageVenture to the western end of the Bodrum Peninsula and you reach the fishing village of G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fl\u00fck. It is an excellent location for dining on fresh seafood taken straight from the Mediterranean while enjoying a superb view as far as Greece beyond.Ipek M\u00fcld\u00fcrbati, a film producer, escaped from the clamour of the largest Turkish city, Istanbul. Relocating to G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fl\u00fck was \u201cthe best decision we have ever made,\u201d she told me. \u201cBeing by the sea definitely adds to your life because being able to see the horizon is a luxury. If you are going to get mad at something, you turn your head, you see the sea, breathe it in. It all goes away.I would advise each and every single tourist here to come and visit G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fl\u00fck.\u201dDining out in BodrumIn central Bodrum you need not walk more than a few metres in any direction to find somewhere to eat. From friendly, inexpensive locations serving up delicious kebabs to gourmet restaurants, there\u2019s something for everyone\u2019s taste \u2013 and wallet.While it\u2019s hard to go wrong with your choice, one particular favourite of mine is M\u00fcdavim. Walk up the steps to the waterside restaurant and you discover much of the menu on display: instead of reading, you just look.For the ultimate in seafood sophistication, try Orfoz: a restaurant founded in 1986 by two divers who explored beneath the waves to get the freshest harvest. Each dish, from oysters to clams, is matched with local wines. Finish off with creme caramel, or a beautifully sculpted fruit salad, plus a \u201cMother\u2019s Cookie\u201d \u2013 with a local mandarin liqueur as a digestif.Leleg WayThis well-marked walking path takes you across the Bodrum Peninsula and through the areas where the original inhabitants of this region once lived. The long-distance footpath is marked by a special symbol: a red bar above a white bar, painted on trees and rocks to guide you through pine forests, over the hills and far away into the past.According to Herodotus \u2013 known as the \u201cfather of history\u201d \u2013 the Leleg people lived on the Bodrum Peninsula between the 15th and 4th centuries BC.You could walk the whole Leleg Way in around five days, or just pick out the highlights. Pedasa is the most magnificent of the Leleg citadels. You\u2019re at just about the highest point on the Bodrum Peninsula and the views are as good as the setting.Blue voyageA highlight for many visitors to Bodrum is a trip on a gulet. These traditional wooden sailing vessels, many built in the town, sleep around 16 in comfortable cabins. Guests laze on board while scanning the horizon and deciding which idyllic location is their favourite. An essential component of a gulet cruise is the privilege of mooring in a bay of your own.Nuri Apak, who runs one operation, explained the philosophy of indulgence: \u201cWhatever you want we try to offer. What we are offering in here is a kind of lifestyle. You don\u2019t have to cook. All you have to do is to live it and to experience it.\u201dUndersea worldA gulet is the ideal vessel for snorkelling. Because the hull is low in the water, you can easily step into a new dimension of the Bodrum peninsula and discover many shades of Turkish blue.Snorkelling allows you to move with a sense of sheer freedom \u2013 and adventure. Guided safely by a very experienced diver, I propelled myself through a seascape I had never seen before: with perfect clarity I swam through shoals of fish.Back on board, my guide Ya\u015far Y\u0131ld\u0131z told me of his amazing nautical archeological exploits.\u201cWe found the oldest shipwreck in the world \u2013 1400 BC,\u201d he says. \u201cWe worked on that ship 11 summers because it was very deep \u2013 45m deep.\u201cThis is the perfect place, as far as I know.\u201dWhere to stayFor my latest visit, I checked in to the Marmara Bodrum, which has a superb location overlooking the town. The design respects local traditions and integrates artfully with the contours of the hillside. The location is steeped in historical significance \u2013 you are sharing the same view as notable figures from history. Manager Volkan Oksuz told me: \u201cBodrum is not only the sea and the sand \u2013 Bodrum has a great history. You can grab your cocktail where the Carian emperor was standing and watching the bay exactly on the same point. This is something unique.\u201dThere are many upmarket options strung out along the peninsula, such as the Swiss\u00f4tel Resort Bodrum Beach. It has an opulent location on the Aegean Sea, decorated by gardens and brilliantly conceived around the dominant colour of white \u2013 designed to resonate with the look of Bodrum itself.Some visitors to Bodrum\u2019s representative of the Kempinski collection arrive by helicopter. The property has a secluded location on the eastern side of the Bodrum peninsula. The no-expense-spared appeal starts in the large lobby with extra helpings of light and space, and continues with a thoughtful and delicious \u201cfarm-to-table policy\u201d. To complete the picture of indulgence, balconies look out over a breathtaking bay."}, {"_id": "6488a04751ac33a3962e184c", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/flight-attendant-bomb-threat-ex-boyfriend-miami-b2356479.html", "primaryCategory": "News &amp; Advice", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Flight attendant makes bomb threat to prevent her ex-boyfriend from flying to Miami", "lead": "<p>The man was reportedly travelling to Miami with his new partner </p>", "author": "Chris Wilson", "datePublished": "Tue, 13 Jun 2023 10:28:34 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:58:47.725821", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-13T10:28:34+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/13/10/iStock-1440555639.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Simon Calder\u2019s free travel email for expert advice and money-saving discountsGet Simon Calder\u2019s Travel email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Daniela Carbone, a flight attendant working for Aerolineas Argentinas, made the threat just before the flight took off from Buenos Aires on 21 May, reports Insider. The 47-year-old said in a message to the pilot and two other employees: \u201cTell the captain that we planted three bombs on him in Miami. Stop messing with politics and check the plane because they are going to fly into a thousand pieces,\u201d according to a report from Argentinian paper La Nacion. She also reportedly directly threatened the pilot, saying that she \u201cknows where [his] kids go to school\u201d. Judge Federico Villena said that Ms Carbone used her daughter\u2019s mobile phone and a pre-paid sim to make the threat, and also used voice distortion software to hide her identity.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeFresh off the recent announcement of his next career move, Lionel Messi ran into a problem at Chinese passport control when he attempted to enter the country via Beijing on 11 June.The Argentine footballer was arriving ahead of a friendly match against Australia, in a repeat of the 2022 World Cup Round of 16 match. However, as Messi and several of his teammates arrived at the airport, the icon was stopped at border control. Videos circulating online show him surrounded by police officers. The Daily Mirror reports that local Chinese press claimed that he was stopped over the decision to use his Spanish passport rather than his Argentinian one.The Barcelona legend was also reportedly quoted as saying \u201cIs Taiwan not China?\u201d, referencing the fact that those travelling on a Spanish passport can enter Taiwan without a visa; Messi reportedly thought the same rules applied to mainland China.RecommendedAirline\u2019s new policy to suspend \u2018overweight\u2019 flight attendants faces backlash One-eyed cat goes viral after being let loose in cabin on a flightPrivate Caribbean island on sale for less than a London flatMessi was required to wait at the airport for an expedited visa, which reportedly took around two hours to be issued before he was let into the country. Hundreds of fans waiting around the airport then finally got a glimpse of the sporting legend, with dozens of people seen wearing shirts with his name on the back. Many will be heading to the match against Australia, which takes place on 15 June at the Workers\u2019 Stadium. This trip marks Messi\u2019s seventh visit to China, and is a return to Beijing, where he won a gold medal at the 2008 Olympics. Looking to the future, the World Cup winner will join Inter Miami \u2013 a franchise co-owned by David Beckham \u2013 next month when his contract with PSG expires.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeA Chinese airline is facing backlash over a new policy that will see flight attendants suspended if they exceed weight limits.News of Hainan Airlines\u2019s \u201cweight reference standard\u201d went viral on Chinese social media after it was announced earlier this month, while the carrier has doubled-down and defended its plans.The weight requirement will be calculated by an individual\u2019s height, reports CNN. For example, a flight attendant who is 1.58 metres (5ft 2in) tall \u2013 the average height of a Chinese adult woman \u2013 would be required to weigh around 48kg (7st 6lbs).According to the state-run Global Times, those who are up to five per cent over their required figure will have their weight monitored and be reviewed, while those weight 10 per cent or more above the \u201cstandard\u201d will be suspended and put on a company-supervised \u201cweight reduction plan\u201d.The policy applies to all cabin crew, regardless of gender.RecommendedOne-eyed cat goes viral after being let loose in cabin on a flightPrivate Caribbean island on sale for less than a London flatWoman warns tourists about strict Rome dress codeThe carrier told CNN: \u201cThis is intended to advocate healthy living habits and maintain a good professional image and healthy physique by anchoring the reference target, rather than passively waiting for individual crew members\u2019 physique to change significantly and then affect safety service work.\u201dThe Independent has contacted Hainan Airlines for comment.A number of users on China\u2019s Weibo social media platform claimed that such a physically demanding job should prioritise stamina and strength over weight loss, especially in the event of an emergency.\u201cI just need the flight attendant to be fully qualified in professional knowledge, well-practiced in safety procedures, and wear the most suitable shoes and clothes for emergencies. Her weight is none of my business,\u201d said one Weibo comment.In recent years, many airlines have taken steps to relax their appearance and uniform guidelines. In September 2022, Virgin Atlantic scrapped gendered workwear to allow staff to wear \u201cthe uniform that best suits them and how they identify\u201d \u2013 although less than a month later the airline confirmed that gender-free unforms would not be worn on the flight carrying England\u2019s football team to the World Cup in Qatar.British Airways also overhauled its rules in 2022, giving crew the choice of what make-up or accessories they want to wear, regardless of their gender.RecommendedOne-eyed cat goes viral after being let loose in cabin on a flightPrivate Caribbean island on sale for less than a London flatWoman warns tourists about strict Rome dress codeJust this week, Australian flag carrier Qantas announced that employees will now be able to grow their hair long, ditch heels for flats and wear make-up regardless of gender for the first time.However, last year Air India has outlawed grey hair, bald patches and receding hairlines for cabin crew in its updated staff guidelines. The same airline grounded more than 100 flight attendants in 2015 for being overweight.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeA woman has filmed herself crying in the toilet of a plane after battling sickness for a 15-hour flight due to a \u201cpastry mix-up\u201d that saw Emirates allegedly serve her the \u201cwrong\u201d croissant.Chlo\u00eb Chapdelaine, 25, who suffers from coeliac disease, ordered a gluten-free in-flight meal ahead of a recent 15-hour flight from Dubai to Los Angeles, California, on Monday 5 June.When she received her meal, the 25-year-old influencer was excited to receive what appeared to be a gluten-free continental breakfast, which was served on a tray labelled \u201cgluten-free\u201d an hour into the flight.However, after eating half of the plain croissant provided with her meal, which didn\u2019t carry a gluten-free sticker, Chapdelaine decided to confirm with a flight attendant that it was indeed gluten-free. An air hostess ultimately confirmed it wasn\u2019t gluten-free, according to Chapdelaine, with footage dubbed \u201cthe worst flight of my life\u201d showing the content creator inside the airplane bathroom explaining what had happened as she tried to make herself throw up.RecommendedBride sparks outrage after documenting everything she ate at her weddingPlane passengers \u2018left without food and water\u2019 after emergency landing, woman claims\u2018It\u2019s an endurance test\u2019: Jayde Adams on what it\u2019s really like to be a plus-size travellerAfter spending an hour throwing up, Chapdelaine said she spent the remainder of the flight feeling nauseous and suffering from bad stomach cramps and diarrhoea.She also claimed she suffered with itchy skin, and said she\u2019ll have to cope with the \u201cmental repercussions\u201d of what happened for weeks to come, which she said include brain fog and feeling depressed.\u201cAs I was eating one of the croissants that was on the tray, I had a really bad feeling,\u201d the 25-year-old from Alberta, Canada, said, according to Kennedy News and Media. \u201cIt tasted so good and I have never tasted such a good gluten-free croissant before. \u201cI then questioned why they would have such a good gluten-free brand on a flight and this is when I questioned whether it was actually gluten-free to a flight attendant.\u201dAccording to Chapdelaine, the flight attendant \u201cwent pale\u201d before going to check whether the pastry was gluten-free. \u201cShe came back and told me it wasn\u2019t meant to be on my plate and it wasn\u2019t gluten-free,\u201d Chapdelaine said, adding: \u201cImmediately I went into shock and started to panic. I am very highly sensitive and my coeliac disease will react to a trace amount or cross contamination.\u201cTo be told I had eaten half a non gluten-free croissant, which is quite a large amount and bigger than what I have reacted to in the past, was really scary for me. I didn\u2019t know how I was going to react.\u201dThe traveller also noted that she wasn\u2019t \u201cupset\u201d because she\u2019d broken her gluten-free diet, but rather because she \u201cknew there were going to be a lot of symptoms I would now have to deal with probably for the next couple of weeks or so\u201d.\u201cIt was a moment of panic. I went to the bathroom and made myself physically sick and was in there for about an hour throwing up, which was horrible,\u201d she said of the actions she took after she\u2019d consumed the croissant. \u201cI knew if I didn\u2019t do this it would cause my body a lot more damage. I could feel the other symptoms starting straight away as well and it just got worse from there.\u201dAccording to the 25 year old, she still began to experience symptoms. \u201cI started getting really bad stomach cramping, I got diarrhoea, I felt nauseous and my skin started itching - when I eat gluten I break out in hives or a rash,\u201d she explained. \u201cThe initial symptoms for me are the stomach issues but after that the rash and hives follow.\u201cThen I have to deal with the mental effects like brain fog or I get depressed for the next couple of weeks.\u201dFollowing her body\u2019s reaction to the croissant, Chapdelaine shared a clip on TikTok to show how serious the effects of eating gluten can be for someone with coeliac disease.Chapdelaine said she had not eaten gluten for almost nine years since she was diagnosed with coeliac disease, but that this was not the first time she has had problems on a flight.\u201cFor me this isn\u2019t the first time I have been exposed to gluten on a plane,\u201d she said. \u201cFortunately, last time I realised before I ate it but had I not, I would have eaten it and the same thing would have happened. It\u2019s not a one-time thing and also on half of the flights I have taken - I travel all the time - gluten-free meals are forgotten.\u201dChapdelaine said, from her experiences, many people are also \u201cquick to question why people with coeliac disease don\u2019t bring their own food on a flight\u201d.In response, she explained: \u201cFirstly, this isn\u2019t always possible as when you\u2019re travelling and in a hotel room you don\u2019t have access to a kitchen to do so. Also, a lot of border security doesn\u2019t allow you to bring food items over the border. A lot of the time you can\u2019t bring meat, dairy or seeds or nuts, which eliminates a lot of products and makes it very difficult for me to bring on my own food onto the plane.\u201dThe Canadian also said airlines need to take allergies and intolerances on flights more seriously, and believes if she had a nut allergy the situation would have been different.\u201cI do feel like coeliac disease is not taken as seriously [as nut allergies] at times,\u201d she said, adding that she believes \u201cpeople with food allergies or sensitivities deserve to exist safely and be taken seriously in their medical condition and that\u2019s not always the case\u201d.\u201cI just hope the airlines specifically take allergies or medical conditions seriously when it comes to serving people food on planes because it can have lasting effects for lots of people,\u201d she continued.As for the response from the airline, Chapdelaine said the Emirates flight attendants were sympathetic towards her, but after filing a formal complaint she has yet to hear from the airline.RecommendedEasyJet cancels over 100 Gatwick flights, stranding at least 15,000 passengers Woman stopped before getting on flight because her passport photo is too \u2018hot\u2019Emergency inflatable slide \u2018explodes\u2019 inside Delta Air Lines planeAn Emirates spokesperson said: \u201cWe are disappointed to hear Ms Chapdelaine\u2019s complaint.

The longest delay is believed to have been on Tui: more than eight hours on a Larnaca flight. It was due to take off just after 9am but eventually left at 5.30pm.In the early hours of Monday morning, passengers on dozens more flights due to depart started receiving notifications that their flights were grounded.

I brought my folding camping chair and my headphones to listen to my show,\u201d they explained in the viral post.\u201cAbout 40 minutes before the school would let us inside, a pregnant woman got next to me since somebody let her in line (I assume her partner),\u201d they said. \u201cShe asked me within five minutes (politely admittedly) if she could have my chair as she was going to have trouble standing the whole time.\u201dThe stranger explained to the pregnant woman that they actually need the chair \u201cmore\u201d because they have problems standing due to their \u201cbad feet and knees\u201d. Two minutes later, the pregnant woman then asked for a second time if she could use the chair, and their answer was the same.\u201cShe, however, got a little mad at me and said that she was going to be struggling the whole time and asked her partner to tell me,\u201d the Reddit user said. The pregnant woman\u2019s partner then came over to the stranger and asked \u201cpolitely\u201d if the woman could sit down.RecommendedWoman applauded for kicking bridesmaid out of wedding after she refused to wear chosen colourGamer finds indent in head from prolonged headset use after shaving his hairWoman praised for telling guests not to eat the food at her sister\u2019s wedding\u201cI again responded that, sorry, but I need it more and suggested she could wait in their car or just sit on the ground,\u201d they wrote. \u201cAt this point the husband directly called me an a**hole but left me alone.\u201dThe Redditor\u2019s post instantly went viral with more than 21,000 votes and 3,500 comments since it was shared earlier this week. Surprisingly, many people in the comments sided with the stranger who had brought their own chair, calling the pregnant woman \u201centitled\u201d to ask for their seat.Others sympathised with the pregnant woman, though they stressed that she should\u2019ve planned ahead.\u201cYou refused to give up the chair you brought because you needed it due to your own health conditions,\u201d read the top comment. \u201cI do feel for the woman, but she and her partner should have brought their own chairs and not assumed they were entitled to yours.\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re pregnant and going to wait for over half an hour, come prepared and don\u2019t expect strangers with possible problems of their own to give up their seat,\u201d another person said.A third user simply wrote: \u201cNeed a chair? Bring a chair.\u201dMeanwhile, some people took the opportunity to share how they would\u2019ve reacted during their own pregnancies.\u201cI have back problems, plus being pregnant, it just made it worse,\u201d one person said. \u201cI kept a chair in my car in case I needed a seat or a more comfortable seat. I would never expect someone to give up their seat for me.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no way that I could have stood that long when I was heavily pregnant (twins, etc.) But, I knew my limitations and would have planned ahead and not expected a stranger to give up [their] seat,\u201d another user wrote. \u201cThat\u2019s the real issue here, not how difficult it is to wait in line during pregnancy. Because indeed it can be.\u201dFor most pregnant women, standing for extended periods of time is generally safe.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeHeineken is celebrating its 150th anniversary by becoming the first beer brand to track its success, alongside its annual performance, by the measurement of \u201cgood times\u201d.In 1864, Gerard Adriaan Heineken, the son of a merchant family in Amsterdam, purchased the brewery De Hooiberg (The Haystack), marking the first step in what would eventually lead to the creation of the Heineken brand. By 1873, Gerard had purchased another brewery in the heart of Amsterdam, which he\u2019d given his family name.As the Heineken brand continued to grow and achieve success, the business was taken over by Gerard\u2019s grandson, Alfred Henry \u201cFreddy\u201d Heineken, a Dutch businessman who served as chairman of the board of directors and CEO from 1971 until 1989.During this time, Freddy defined what the beer brand meant when he famously said: \u201cI don\u2019t sell beer, I sell gezelligheid,\u201d the Dutch word for \u201cfun\u201d or the feeling of good times.In honour of the brand\u2019s 150th birthday, Heineken is reprioritising good times by partnering with experts and academics to understand what exactly is needed to create these important moments for its millions of customers in more than 190 countries. As part of the brand\u2019s research, it has worked with behavioural scientist Dr Chris Brauer, Goldsmiths, University of London, to create the \u201cGood Times Index,\u201d a model of measurement capable of scoring Heineken\u2019s contribution to creating the perfect conditions for a \u201cgood time\u201d.RecommendedHeineken to create 600 jobs through \u00a340m pub investment planPride becomes a minefield for big companies, but many continue their supportBelgium destroys 2,350 cans of American beer after French outrage over \u2018Champagne\u2019 sloganThe research is timely, as the results found that 87 per cent of people believe it is more important now than ever to have a good time.As for what is needed to have a good time, the Good Times Index identified five core conditions that lead to these memorable moments. (Heineken)According to the study, a sense of purpose, or feeling as if we are working towards a shared goal, is one of the most important components in the creation of a good time. These moments wouldn\u2019t exist without other people, however, as the brand found that creating these elevated moments is only possible when opportunities to connect with others are available.Safe and inclusive environments, in which we can form meaningful connections, are also an integral part, with the consumer research conducted by Heineken finding that 82 per cent of respondents care more about being with friends than if their night goes to plan, and that 75 per cent of respondents believing that the people you watch a sports game with is more important than whether your team wins.Additionally, feelings of open-mindedness are also key to good times, with the research finding that respondents are eager to connect with people from different backgrounds or with different experiences from their own. According to the Good Times Index, 78 per cent of respondents agree it is important to socialise with people that don\u2019t always share the same views as them, a sentiment most strongly held in Brazil (84 per cent) and the UK (81 per cent).Finally, good times are about balance and moderation, with respondents revealing how important it is to prioritise time that allows them to enjoy themselves and feel mentally refreshed. However, that doesn\u2019t mean that each detail needs to be planned, as 88 per cent of respondents said the best memories come from unexpected moments.To celebrate all the ways Heineken customers enjoy good times in honour of its 150th birthday, the brand has launched a tongue-in-cheek campaign that highlights some of the unique twists consumers have put on its iconic beer - from misspellings of Heineken, including on a bar sign, to the various and oftentimes unconventional ways the Dutch pale lager beer is enjoyed, such as through a straw or alongside a slice of lime. (Heineken ) (Heineken ) (Heineken) (Heineken)On Twitter, the official green-backed logo for Heineken has been replaced with one that reads: \u201cAinechen,\u201d while the brand\u2019s bio reads: \u201cHekkenen, Ainekan, Heineken, Whateverken. Whatever you choose to pronounce us. Here\u2019s to 150 years of good times!\u201d (Heineken ) (Heineken)The brand has also poked fun at the various misspellings on Instagram, where it\u2019s logo has been changed to read: \u201cHekkenen.\u201d The alternative spellings will also appear on electric lorries as proof that the Heineken doesn\u2019t mind how its customers spell its name, as long as they enjoy themselves.As for the future of the brand, Heineken has committed to tracking \u201cdelivering good times\u201d as part of the way it measures its annual performance, alongside sales and other brand tracking metrics.\u201cBrewing good times has been in our DNA for 150 years. That is why we are evolving our brand metrics to show that creating good times is equally as important as the beer we produce,\u201d Bram Westenbrink, global head of Heineken, said. \u201cBy better understanding the conditions behind good times in today\u2019s world, we can continue to create experiences for all our global customers that promote that feeling of gezelligheid - whether that is through the messages in our advertising, our sponsorships and events or of course our range of products. It is our goal that we will continue to deliver good times, one way or another, for the next 150 years and beyond.\u201dDr Chris Brauer, director of innovation at Goldsmiths, University of London, added that the creation of the Good Times Index has been about reflecting on the idea of good times through a \u201cnew and fresher perspective,\u201d which has also meant better understanding the \u201cmultiple dimensions that make up that feeling\u201d.\u201cGood times are not just one thing or another, they are a multitude of different and subjective feelings, experiences, wants and needs that help generate a sensation and fulfil higher order needs,\u201d he explained. \u201cThere has never been a more important time or opportunity to measure the role and prevalence of good times in our lives.\u201dRecommendedBBQ salad recipes without a soggy lettuce leaf in sightHow to shop for and cook Japanese food at home like a proGrace Dent\u2019s quick and easy recipes that only require the microwaveUltimately, Heineken wants its customers to know that it doesn\u2019t matter how or where they are enjoying the beer, or whether or not they\u2019ve managed to spell the brand correctly, as long as they are having a good time.\u201cSpelling it correctly won\u2019t create good times, but the world\u2019s most international beer brand knows what can,\u201d Heineken said."}, {"_id": "6488a04c51ac33a3962e1860", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/zendaya-rome-restaurant-dress-code-b2356753.html", "primaryCategory": "Lifestyle", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Zendaya appears to respond to claim she was denied entry to Rome restaurant because of outfit: \u2018Source?\u2019", "lead": "<p>\u2018This whole story is a lie,\u2019 Zendaya\u2019s assistant says </p>", "author": "Chelsea Ritschel", "datePublished": "Tue, 13 Jun 2023 15:14:44 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:58:52.283247", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-13T15:14:44+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/13/16/newFile-2.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Stay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletterStay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Although she didn\u2019t mention Gomez by name, the post came after trolls took to the comments of the singer\u2019s recent post and made claims about her speculated drama with Bieber. Despite the ongoing speculation of a feud, Gomez and Bieber issued a statement in March shutting down the rumours.In her Instagram Story, the Rhode Beauty founder criticised those who were leaving unkind comments, seemingly referring to comments on Gomez\u2019s latest photo.\u201cIf you\u2019re leaving mean or rude comments on anyone\u2019s post just know that I don\u2019t want that, nor do I ever or will I ever support or condone hateful, mean, or nasty comments,\u201d she wrote. \u201cDoing that is not supporting me\u2026\u201dShe then emphasised that she will not be a part of this online hate and urged fans to stop writing negative comments on Instagram.RecommendedHailey Bieber posts cheeky response to Kendall Jenner \u2018feuding\u2019 rumoursSelena Gomez and Nicola Peltz Beckham speak out about their anxiety when reading online criticismHailey Bieber says she\u2019s \u2018transitioning from one part of life to another\u2019\u201cIf you are participating in that you are part of a culture that I want no part of,\u201d she concluded. \u201cPlease be nice or don\u2019t say anything.\u201dGomez and Bieber have been pitted against each other since the model married the actor\u2019s ex, Justin Bieber, in 2018. The marriage also came only months after the \u201cStay\u201d singer and Gomez ended their off-and-on relationship of eight years.In January, fans once again speculated that the two women were feuding, with claims that Bieber and friend Kylie Jenner were making fun of the Disney Channel alum, after Gomez confessed in a TikTok that she accidentally laminated her eyebrows too much.However, Jenner quickly denied the claim in a comment on a TikTok video, writing: \u201cNo shade towards Selena ever and I didn\u2019t see her eyebrow posts! You guys are making something out of nothing.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeIt\u2019s safe to say summer has officially started. Temperatures are now firmly above 25C across much of the UK, the sunshine is hotter, noses are stuffy and the air is muggy, sometimes making it difficult to sleep.Keeping cool in a heatwave is a priority \u2013 but it also gives rise to various theories and myths on how to achieve this\u2026Sleeping naked cools you downSleeping naked seems like the easiest and quickest way to cool your body temperature down after being out all day. But this isn\u2019t necessarily the case, according to Abbas Kanani, a superintendent pharmacist at Chemist Click Online Pharmacy.\u201cSweat collects on the body and remains there when we have no clothes on,\u201d Kanani explained. \u201cAlthough having less layers on the body can help you to feel more comfortable in the heat, wearing lightweight nightwear made from breathable fabrics helps draw sweat away from your body and makes you feel a lot cooler and more comfortable.\u201dRecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveSo what should you wear at night to keep cool? \u201cClothing made from natural fabrics like cotton or linen are breathable and absorbent,\u201d Kanani recommended. \u201cThey will soak the sweat up off your skin and they let air through, which cools you down.\u201dPeople don\u2019t die from heat in this countryThe UK sun can feel different compared to when you are sunbathing and drinking cocktails on a beach in Barcelona \u2013 but that can catch people out.\u201cThe biggest myth is that the weather in the UK isn\u2019t hot enough to be dangerous,\u201d said Dr Adam Staten, a clinical director at One Day Tests and NHS GP. \u201cWhilst we don\u2019t have that many really hot days, when it is hot, it can be fatal. For example, during the heatwave last summer, hundreds more people died than normal for that time in the year.\u201dStaten suggests we overcomplicate things when trying to keep cool. \u201cMost measures are really simple and include common sense measures like keeping curtains drawn, keeping windows open or taking cool showers or baths.\u201dSticking to hot drinks will keep you coolWho else thinks drinking tea or coffee in hot weather will cool you down?For Staten, \u201cOne myth that seems to come up a lot is that hot drinks are better for cooling you down than cold drinks. I think the evidence actually shows that it doesn\u2019t really matter \u2013 as long as you are keeping hydrated, your drinks can be hot or cold.\u201dPharmacist Kanani agrees with that final point. \u201cHydration is vital for keeping cool in hot temperatures. Drink plenty of fluids, especially water, to stay hydrated. Avoid excessive consumption of caffeinated or alcoholic beverages as they can contribute to dehydration.\u201dYou only need to wear sunscreen when the sun\u2019s outAnother common misconception is thinking that you can\u2019t get sunburnt when it is cloudy outside. \u201cThis isn\u2019t true,\u201d Kanani said. \u201cAlthough it\u2019s less likely than when you\u2019re out in full sunshine, clouds don\u2019t block all of the sun\u2019s UV rays.\u201dRecommended7 hay fever hacks to ease your symptoms this summerThe pests you really don\u2019t want invading your garden and how to deter themHow to take care of your mental health at festivalsIt\u2019s also why people either only apply sunscreen in the morning or none at all. \u201cMany people think that when sunscreen is waterproof, it means they do not need to reapply it after swimming or sweating. It should be reapplied straight after you have been in water, towel drying, sweating or when it may have rubbed off.\u201dSunburn is something to be careful of. Staten said: \u201cIt\u2019s really common and can actually be very severe both in the short term and for the longer term risk of skin cancer.\u201d"}, {"_id": "6488a04d51ac33a3962e1865", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/hay-fever-map-where-pollen-side-effects-b2356695.html", "primaryCategory": "Health &amp; Families", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Mapped: Pollen in your area as hay fever sufferers warned of deadly surge", "lead": "<p>A charity has warned high pollen levels could be dangerous to asthma and COPD sufferers </p>", "author": "Lucy Skoulding", "datePublished": "Tue, 13 Jun 2023 14:12:32 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:58:53.342323", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-13T14:12:32+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2022/05/10/11/newFile-3.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Stay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletterStay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Enninful, 51, has been responsible for shifting British Vogue\u2019s creative and editorial output towards representing people across the spectrum of LGBT+, disability and race. In turn, the media mogul has been credited for influencing representation in the fashion industry as a whole.He has announced he is stepping down to take up a new position as editorial advisor to British Vogue and global creator and cultural adviser to Vogue.Enninful recalls the first time he ever encountered someone who was \u201copenly\u201d gay, when he was aged 16, in 1980s London but laments that he feared the prospect of ever coming out himself.RecommendedBritish Vogue\u2019s Edward Enninful: How I learnt to overcome fear when I came outThe Independent Pride List 2023: The LGBT+ people making change happenBritish Vogue editor-in-chief Edward Enninful steps down to take on new role\u201cI was 16 when I encountered the first person I\u2019d ever met who actually called themselves gay,\u201d he writes. \u201cI was a sheltered Ghanaian immigrant \u2013 a good, Christian schoolboy who kept his head down, worked hard and always had his father\u2019s words thundering in his ears: \u2018If any of those gays come into this house it will be over my dead body.\u2019\u201dHe observes that fashion changed not only his career prospects but allowed him to express himself in a way he never thought would be possible.\u201cSuddenly, I was a teenager in London and meeting gay and trans people everywhere; photoshoots, parties, gigs, clubs,\u201d he says. \u201cBut did I feel pride? It was probably more complicated than that.\u201dEnninful writes that he was \u201cpetrified\u201d of coming out as gay, especially given his religious upbringing, and feared \u201cenernal damnation\u201d if he revealed his sexuality.\u201cThe fire and brimstone that would rage in church seemed so real that I genuinely thought I was going to hell and that a life \u2013 and afterlife \u2013 of eternal damnation awaited me. This is the way for a lot of young LGBT+ people still today, especially in religious communities. The feelings are terrifying and real seeming.\u201dAt the age of 21, Enninful told his mother he was gay, and was thankful for her reaction. Eventually, he writes, his father \u201ccame around\u201d to the idea of him being gay.\u201cI was extremely fortunate to have the mother I had,\u201d he writes. \u201cShe loved me - I knew that always - and when I eventually told her I was gay at the grand old age of 21, having returned to London after a romantic epiphany on a New York dance floor, there was no question of me being exiled by the family,\u201d he writes.But in London in the Eighties and Nineties, he says, others were not as \u201clucky\u201d as he was.\u201cI saw friends and relations in my community thrown out of their family homes. Meanwhile, the infamous AIDS adverts, with their looming tombstones and terrifying iceberg visuals, were everywhere.

Another major perk is that the king or queen get two separate birthdays each year.While King Charles will officially celebrate his 75th birthday on 14 November later this year, he will receive an early celebration this weekend (Saturday 17 June) at Trooping the Colour, also known as the King\u2019s Birthday Parade.What happens at the Trooping the Colour?The annual spectacle, which also took place under the reign of Charles\u2019s mother, the late Queen Elizabeth II, sees the military parade of the Horse Guards in London.Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s official birthday was celebrated in June, but her actual birthday was on 21 April.RecommendedVegan family writes letter to neighbours requesting they close their windows when cooking meatOnlyFans model Elle Brooke praised for \u2018perfect\u2019 response to Piers Morgan\u2019s concerns about her careerKelis says people \u2018will believe everything\u2019 in new response to Bill Murray dating rumoursWhy does King Charles III have two birthdays?The reason monarchs have two birthdays is simply down to the British weather. The event is typically celebrated with outdoor events, so it makes more sense to throw the celebration in the summer months when the weather is expected to be better. If a monarch doesn\u2019t have a summer birthday, then they will have a second one in June.What time is Trooping the Colour?Trooping the Colour is a ceremony that has marked the official birthday of the British sovereign for the last 260 years. While it is a celebration, it is also a military event that sees 1,400 parading soldiers, 200 horses and 400 musicians to join a procession from Buckingham Palace along The Mall to Horse Guards Parade, and then back again.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeAccording to health officials, people sought advice for hay fever symptoms once every three seconds on Sunday. And today, the Met Office predicted the pollen count would be \u201cvery high\u201d in most of England and Wales.Hay fever is usually at its worst between March and September \u2013 and right now, thousands of people affected are desperate for a solution to their pollen-induced runny noses, itchy eyes and tickly coughs, and other irritating symptoms.The hay fever pages on the NHS.uk website reportedly received 122,650 visits last week alone.So, what can you do to help with hay fever symptoms?1. Don\u2019t rub your eyesRecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow live\u201cRed, itchy, swollen eyes are often a real problem for hay fever sufferers,\u201d explained pharmacist Sid Dajani, from Golden Eye Eye Care.\u201cAs tempting as it is, don\u2019t rub your eyes. Clean them free of pollen frequently, with cotton lint and cold water, and treat the symptoms immediately with eye drops or eye ointment containing propamidine isetionate.\u201d2. Don sunnies and keep your clothes cleanReducing your exposure to pollen, however possible, can really help. Dajani added: \u201cWear wrap-around sunglasses to protect your eyes when outside, and have a shower when you get in from work and put your clothes straight in the wash to help remove all pollen. It\u2019s also best to avoid drying clothes outside.\u201d3. Think about your dietWhat you eat may have an impact too. GP Dr Nisa Aslam suggested: \u201cStick to an anti-inflammatory diet, with plenty of fruit and vegetables, beans, grains and oily fish, whilst limiting processed food high in fat, sugar and salt. Look for anti-inflammatory, antioxidant herbs, like chamomile, ginger, nettle and turmeric. These can be consumed in the form of supplements or beverages.\u201d4. Protect your nostrilsDr Adam Fox, allergist and advisor to Clarityn, said: \u201cPollen balms such as petroleum jelly rubbed around the rim of the nostrils can help trap pollen before it enters the nose, and salt water nasal sprays help rinse pollen particles out of the nose, preventing them from sitting in there and causing more symptoms.\u201d5. Keep the windows shutAs tempting as it may be to fling windows open at this time of year, Dijani said: \u201cKeep windows, including car windows, and doors shut. Venture out as little as possible. Towns and cities are no more friendly to hay fever sufferers than the countryside, due in part to more extensive \u2018greening\u2019 of urban areas.\u201d6. Prepare for the pollen countChecking to see when the pollen is particularly high can help you prepare. \u201cIf you know you have symptoms every year, then it makes sense to be prepared in advance,\u201d said Fox. \u201cIf you require a nasal spray, then starting to use it before the season starts will make it much more effective. For adults, these can be brought over the counter, whilst children will need a prescription.\u201dRecommendedThe pests you really don\u2019t want invading your garden and how to deter themHow to take care of your mental health at festivals5 of the best lawnmowers7.

Preheat the oven to 180C.2. Begin by cooking the steak. Make sure your meat is out of the fridge 30 minutes before you want to cook it, so it has time to come up to room temperature. Get a frying pan or griddle pan on the heat get it to a nice high heat. Drizzle some olive oil onto your steak and season generously with Maldon salt and cracked black pepper. Once the pan is nice a hot, place the meat in and allow it to sear and sizzle on one side first. Depending on the size of your steak this can take a good 5 minutes on each side.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeA woman has been jailed for more than two years in prison for taking abortion pills after the legal cut-off in a case that has sparked fury among campaigners.Carla Foster, a 44-year-old with three children, got hold of the pills under the government\u2019s \u201cpills by post\u201d scheme that allows the termination of unwanted pregnancies up to 10 weeks. Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court on Monday heard Foster, who fell pregnant in 2019, had lied to leading UK abortion provider British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) during a telephone consultation about how far along her pregnancy was so she could get hold of the pills.The court heard Foster was between 32 to 34 weeks pregnant when she took them \u2013 with Justice Pepperall saying she felt \u201cvery deep and genuine remorse\u201d, was \u201cracked with guilt\u201d and still had nightmares over her actions. Politicians, abortion providers, and campaigners have condemned the decision to imprison the mother as they warned the case demonstrates why abortion care must be urgently decriminalised in the UK.RecommendedWoman jailed for taking abortion pills after legal cut-off in \u2018tragic\u2019 case\u2018Extortionate\u2019 childcare costs pushing women to have abortions as terminations rise to record levelsTennessee mother forced to undergo emergency hysterectomy after being denied life-saving abortionWhat are the UK laws on abortion?Abortions can legally be carried out within the first 24 weeks of pregnancy in England, Scotland and Wales. While medical abortions can only be conducted up to 10 weeks into pregnancy, surgical abortions can be performed up to 23 weeks and six days into a pregnancy.Terminations can only be performed after the 24-week-cut off point in a highly limited number of contexts \u2013 such as when the mother\u2019s life is at risk or the child will have a severe disability.Abortions must be approved by two doctors, with the health professionals agreeing continuing with the pregnancy would be riskier for the physical or mental health of the woman than having an abortion. While this is what the law stipulates, in reality, abortions can be given whatever the person\u2019s reasoning for the termination is in the UK.The 1967 Abortion Act, which meant pregnancy terminations were legal in the UK, was never widened to include Northern Ireland. Abortion was banned in almost all circumstances, even rape and incest, with women seeking terminations facing life imprisonment, until the procedure was legalised in Northern Ireland in October 2019.RecommendedMan and woman charged with illegally aborting baby and disposing of bodyWomen seeking abortions face \u2018cruel\u2019 delays due to NHS funding rowWhat criticisms are directed at the way current abortion law works in the UK?Abortions are still deemed a criminal act in England, Scotland and Wales under the 1967 Abortion Act. If a medical professional delivers an abortion outside of the terms of the 1967 act, they are at risk of being prosecuted.Legislation passed in 1861 means any woman who ends a pregnancy without getting legal permission from two doctors can face up to life imprisonment.For years, abortion providers, charities, medical bodies, and MPs have been calling for abortion to be decriminalised in the UK. They want to see abortion law extricated from criminal law and monitored in the same way that other medical practices are \u2013 with the British Medical Association in favour of the decriminalisation of abortion in the UK.RecommendedPM and top ministers voted against widening abortion access, records showPrevious research from the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS), the UK\u2019s largest abortion provider, discovered doctors think Britain\u2019s \u201coutdated\u201d abortion law hampers their ability to provide the best care for women. The report also found doctors think rules such as making two doctors sign off abortion forms give rise to delays, with researchers also discovering the threat of prosecution makes doctors less likely to pursue a career in this area of medicine.Although abortion is criminalised in the UK, in Northern Ireland it has now been decriminalised.How can you get an abortion in the UK?There are two types of abortion: a medical abortion and a surgical abortion. Having a medical abortion involves taking two tablets. A surgical abortion is a minor operation to remove the pregnancy.Prior to the pandemic, getting the first tablet, mifepristone, for a medical abortion required a visit to an abortion clinic. But after Covid hit, the government allowed the medication to be sent by post to be taken at home after a phone consultation, a system referred to as \u201ctelemedicine\u201d.MPs voted at the end of March last year to make at-home early medical abortions permanent in England after a lengthy campaign by pregnancy termination services to keep the measures in place. Some 215 politicians voted for the initiative, while 188 voted against it.The NHS website states there are three main ways to get an abortion \u2013 noting you can get in touch directly with an abortion provider, such as the aforementioned BPAS, MSI Reproductive Choices UK, or the National Unplanned Pregnancy Advisory Service (NUPAS).Another option is to go to a GP and asked to be referred to an abortion service, or thirdly to contact a sexual health clinic to ask them to refer you for an abortion.RecommendedI had an abortion \u2013 and my experience shows how broken the UK system truly isWhat NHS support is available for having an abortion?The NHS states any woman seeking an abortion \u201ccan discuss their options with, and receive support from, a trained pregnancy counsellor if they wish\u201d. It notes \u201cimpartial information and support\u201d can be sought via a GP or another doctor working at your GP practice, or through \u201ca counselling service at the abortion clinic\u201d or \u201corganisations such as Brook (for under-25s), BPAS, MSI Reproductive Choices UK and NUPAS\u201d.The NHS continues: \u201cYou may also want to speak to your partner, friends or family, but you do not have to. They do not have a say in your decision. If you do not want to tell anyone, your details will be kept confidential.\u201cIf you\u2019re under 16, your parents do not usually need to be told. The doctor or nurse may encourage you to tell a parent, carer or other adult you trust, but they will not make you.\u201dHow is the law in the UK different to abortion laws in the US?Millions of women and people with wombs lost their legal right to have a termination in the US in June 2022 after Roe v Wade \u2013 the landmark decision that legalised abortion nationwide in 1973 \u2013 was overturned by the US Supreme Court.Since Roe was overturned, most pregnancy terminations are now banned in 13 US states. Abortion services across the US have radically changed in the space of year, with most of the states who have rapidly curtailed pregnancy terminations in the wake of Roe\u2019s dismantling choosing not to allow pregnancy terminations even in cases of rape or incest."}, {"_id": "6488a05051ac33a3962e1872", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/lifestyle-lowdown/ninja-speedi-a-rapid-cooker-and-air-fryer-that-makes-meals-in-minutes-b2349804.html", "primaryCategory": "lifestyle lowdown", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Ninja Speedi: a rapid cooker and air fryer that makes meals in minutes", "lead": "<p> Discover ten ways to cook with the Ninja Speedi   </p>", "author": "", "datePublished": "Tue, 13 Jun 2023 09:46:56 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:58:56.261085", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-13T09:46:56+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/02/09/Ninja%20speedi%20copy%20image.png?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Air Fryers and multi-cookers have seen a huge surge in popularity over the past few years and, as with most technology, new innovations are allowing the latest models to be even more versatile in the kitchen.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeA mother has sparked a debate after criticising a parent who wouldn\u2019t give her child a piece of birthday cake.Kat Stickler shared a recent video on TikTok about her experience with a fellow mother. She confessed that she was going to \u201cmom shame\u201d someone, before noting that the only other people she\u2019s \u201cmom shamed\u201d before were herself and her own mother. Before adding another parent to her list, she asked viewers if she was \u201centitled\u201d or if what happened was \u201cmessed up\u201d. In the video, she explained how she and her daughter noticed a group of children at a birthday party in a park.\u201cTwo hours ago, literally right now, MK and I were at the park in our neighbourhood,\u201d she said, referring to her daughter. \u201cAnd it was us and this birthday group\u2026These kids are having their birthday party. MK\u2019s playing with them for half an hour. They\u2019re making friends, it was nice. It was actually very cute.\u201dStickler then explained that when it was time to sing happy birthday, her three-year-old joined the rest of the children at the party.RecommendedMother reveals the sweet meaning behind viral graduation gift for her daughterDaughter reveals stark contrast between her parents\u2019 homes: \u2018Complete opposites\u2019Mother hit with deluge of abuse for taking toddler\u2019s packed lunch to a restaurant\u201cShe\u2019s one of the group right now.

This is not your birthday party. These are not your friends.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeColin McFarlane\u2019s announcement that he has been diagnosed with prostate cancer is the latest reminder to millions of the importance of being on the lookout for this pernicious disease and its first symptoms.The Dark Knight star, 61, said that he has been regularly testing for cancer after a fellow actor who was treated for it 17 years ago told him about its prevalence among Black men.McFarlane, also known for his roles in Doctor Who and Outlander, explained that both he and his brother found out about the cancer after taking a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test, which can be given to men without symptoms after a consultation with a doctor.He is far from the only celebrity to have been diagnosed with the cancer. Last year, Duran Duran guitarist Andy Taylor announced that he had discovered the disease in late August, whilst musician and TV presenter Jools Holland also received a diagnosis after a routine blood test in 2014.Also in August, former BBC Breakfast host Bill Turnbull died of the same condition at the age of 66. He was diagnosed in 2017 and took a leave of absence from his Classic FM radio show in October 2021 to focus on his health.RecommendedColin McFarlane diagnosed with prostate cancerMen\u2019s Health Week: How to talk about sensitive or \u2019embarrassing\u2019 health issuesCall to ditch \u2018test by request\u2019 approach to prostate cancer careIn a 2018 interview with The Radio Times, Turnbull said he asked his doctor to stop treating him with chemotherapy after eight rounds, saying he \u201ccouldn\u2019t bear it any longer\u201d. For McFarlane, doctors were able to catch the disease in its very early stages because he tests for it regularly. He will not require treatment but will be \u201cregularly monitored with PSA blood tests every three months and an MRI (or magnetic resonance imaging scan) once a year\u201d.\u201cAs it\u2019s a very slow-moving cancer I am in the best possible position to ascertain what treatment I would need in the future if that were ever deemed necessary, and currently that scenario is a long way off,\u201d he said.

Last year, Duran Duran guitarist Andy Taylor announced that he had discovered the disease in late August, whilst musician and TV presenter Jools Holland also received a diagnosis after a routine blood test in 2014.Also in August, former BBC Breakfast host Bill Turnbull died of the same condition at the age of 66.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeAs responsible gardeners with positive attitudes to insects and biodiversity, it\u2019s a bitter pill to swallow when vine weevil, carrot fly and aphids take hold \u2013 let alone the processionary moth caterpillar which can cause rashes and breathing difficulties.Dr Andrew Salisbury, RHS principal entomologist, says: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to automatically label things as pests, because as soon as you do that people think they have to control it.\u201cBut sometimes some of the creatures in our garden do damage our plants beyond the level of damage we can accept.\u201dOak processionary mothRecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveThe Forestry Commission has warned of a toxic caterpillar which can cause rashes and strip native oak trees of their leaves.Salisbury explains: \u201cThe oak processionary [moth] caterpillars can cause rashes and breathing difficulties and it\u2019s now widespread in London and some of the surrounding areas.\u201dThey are most active in June, July and August, when the caterpillars form processions up the tree trunk and create a nest of white silk. Don\u2019t touch the hairy caterpillars as they can cause reactions.Solution: \u201cIf you have it on an oak in your garden, you need to seek professional advice,\u201d Salisbury warns.An information leaflet is available through forestresearch.gov.uk.Vine weevilIf your patio pot plant suddenly wilts and collapses, and you examine it to find there\u2019s little root left, it\u2019s likely to be vine weevil larvae, which are laid by the adult beetle and feed off the underground roots in autumn through to spring \u2013 often until there\u2019s nothing left. Their favourites include heucheras, cyclamen, sedum and young yew \u2013 and it is generally plants in pots which suffer most damage.\u201cVine weevil is there in people\u2019s gardens in the open ground, but usually there are enough natural enemies to keep it in check,\u201d he says. The adults feed on thick-leaved evergreen shrubs like rhododendron, eating the outside of leaves.Solution: By June the damage has been done and there\u2019s little you can do. However, nematodes (tiny microscopic worms that attack, invade and kill target species) offer biological control to eliminate the grubs. Apply a nematode solution to your pots in late summer/early autumn, which should solve the problem, he suggests.AphidsThere are more than 500 species of aphid in the UK, including greenfly and blackfly, and their population expands rapidly. You\u2019ll see them on the stems of many plants up to the flowers, sometimes resulting in the plant\u2019s loss of vigour.\u201cThey breed faster than their natural enemies can catch up with them,\u201d Salisbury explains. \u201cThere\u2019s an endless list of enemies \u2013 many different species of wasps, beetles and ladybirds, lacewing and hoverfly larvae all eat them, as well as bluetits.\u201cThey tend to breed and get into high numbers in early spring. If you get through spring, by the time you get to mid-June and July, then those natural enemies really do their job and can wipe out aphids.\u201dSolution: As soon as you see them, put on a pair of gardening gloves and remove them with your fingers, running them up the stem.Carrot root flyIt looks like a housefly but it\u2019s the larvae \u2013 yellow-white maggots \u2013 which do the damage, burrowing into the carrot and leaving it inedible. It also feeds on related vegetables including parsnips, celery and celeriac.There are two generations a year (spring and autumn) and the carrot fly is attracted to the smell of the leaves of the plant.Solution: \u201cGrow your carrots under insect-proof mesh,\u201d Salisbury advises. Choose varieties which are less susceptible to carrot fly, like \u2018Fly Away\u2019, \u2018Maestro\u2019, \u2018Resistafly\u2019 and \u2018Sytan\u2019. You could also companion plant pungent crops such as onion and garlic between rows, to put them off the scent. And grow them in raised beds, as it is said that the fly can\u2019t fly very high.Slugs and snailsAs any gardener will know, slugs and snails can chomp through leaves and flowers at an alarming rate, often after rain or at night when it\u2019s cooler.\u201cThey are our number one inquiry in the entomology section of the RHS, but not all slugs and snails like to eat fresh plant material. There are more than 30 species in the UK and many of those feed on dead material,\u201d he explains.\u201cBut if you\u2019ve got hostas in a nice damp patch in the garden, they will damage them. They also damage potatoes.\u201dSolution: \u201cAccept there may be some damage and have some tolerance of a few leaf holes. If they are being very badly damaged in parts of the garden, consider planting plants which are less likely to be eaten by slugs and snails.\u201cThere are barriers out there to deter them, but we have found they are generally not as good as they could be,\u201d he says.You could also create a haven for wildlife, such as a pond, to attract their natural enemies such as frogs and birds.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeKelis has spoken out again about speculation that she and Bill Murray are dating, after telling a fan she \u201cwouldn\u2019t bother\u201d commenting on the rumours.Last week, it was reported that the pair had been out in public together a number of times in recent weeks. Murray was also spotted at the two festivals in London that Kelis performed at. He attended the Mighty Hoopla last weekend (3 June), as well as Cross The Tracks the weekend before. The reported couple were photographed with musician Konny Kon from the soul and hip hop duo Children of Zeus at the latter festival.However, the \u201cSugar Honey Iced Tea\u201d singer, 43, appeared to deny the rumours in a reply to one of her followers on Instagram.Under a photograph of Kelis posing on a beach, a fan wrote: \u201cYou ain\u2019t no beach bum\u2026 U a BB each bummy lol Bill got u out by here riding his wave lol media is destroying y\u2019all [sic].\u201dRecommended\u2018Gentlemen\u2019 like Boris Johnson are over.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeFestival season is upon us, with Glastonbury taking place near the end of June.While we\u2019re well versed in how to take care of our physical health at a festival (yes, you really should take a hat in case the sun comes out), what about the mental health side of things?Mike McAdam, 38, co-founded Blink Mental Health, which provides mental health support at festivals.After his mental health deteriorated in 2017, McAdam found his condition was too serious for primary care, but not extreme enough for secondary care.He accepts there are lots of brilliant charities and campaigns encouraging people \u2013 particularly men \u2013 to talk about their mental health and reach out if they need it, but \u201cit\u2019s incredibly difficult to get help\u201d, he suggests.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveThis is where the idea for Blink came from \u2013 the ultimate aim is to set up a \u2018Blink Bank\u2019 providing money for private therapy for those who are stuck on waiting lists. McAdam accepts that is \u201creally ambitious and would cost millions\u201d, so as a starting point, Blink provides wellbeing at festivals.Blink is going to six festivals this summer \u2013 including Boomtown and Wilderness \u2013 where it will set up dedicated tents which McAdam calls \u201ca place to relax, get away from things [and] take your mind off the festival\u201d, with bean bags and mindful activities such as colouring and jigsaw puzzles. Blink also offers between 12 and 18 hours a day of free talking therapy with fully qualified and accredited psychologists or psychotherapists.\u201cIt\u2019s not just about diagnosed mental health conditions, everyone should look after [their] mental health,\u201d McAdam says.He suggests festivals are a great place to open up conversations around mental health.\u201cAt festivals, people tend to explore new experiences \u2013 whether that\u2019s food, music, dance or activities \u2013 so one reason we go to festivals is because people want to explore new experiences, [and] we find them more open-minded to talk and access therapy,\u201d he says.Plus, he accepts festivals can be \u201cfull-on\u201d, and don\u2019t always have \u201cthat space where you can chill out\u201d.While McAdam suggests early intervention is key when dealing with mental health, there are some things you can do to do yourself if you\u2019re going to a festival this summer\u2026Be preparedBefore heading off to the festival, McAdam recommends being as prepared as possible.This could include \u201ctaking earplugs, a decent sleeping bag, making sure we have clothes for all weathers if we can\u201d, he says.\u201cBecause if you can\u2019t get a decent night\u2019s sleep, if you\u2019re absolutely freezing, that will affect your physical and mental health.\u201dLowri Dowthwaite-Walsh, senior lecturer in psychological interventions at UCLan, agrees with the importance of planning ahead.\u201cIf you have any vulnerabilities, such as pre-existing mental health difficulties or known triggers, plan ahead for how you can manage these,\u201d she says. \u201cBy having a plan of what to do in the event of feeling low or anxious, you\u2019ll be able to enjoy your time more and be more relaxed.\u201dStay well-fed and wateredMcAdam recommends taking a water bottle you can refill throughout the festival, and adds: \u201cTry and eat regularly.\u201dHe suggests it can be \u201cvery, very easy to forget about eating or drinking [water]\u201d at a festival, or you might not want to buy much food as it can be expensive on-site. However, taking your own snacks and bottle could go a long way to helping you be as comfortable as possible.Dowthwaite-Walsh adds: \u201cLong days, warm weather and alcohol consumption can dehydrate you and this can lead to headaches, feeling fatigued and struggling to concentrate and make good decisions\u201d \u2013 which means drinking plenty of water is crucial.Camp wisely\u201cTry and camp with people you feel safe with,\u201d is McAdam\u2019s advice. And if you\u2019re going to a festival with different options for camping \u2013 for example, Wilderness has a quiet camping area \u2013 choose the place that suits you best.If you\u2019re going solo, McAdam says: \u201cTry and find the area that may suit your needs.\u201dBe drink and drug-aware\u201cAlcohol and drugs have a direct impact on your mental health, so it\u2019s important to discuss your choices with friends and people you trust. You can also get support from first responders at the festival if you have issues with any substances,\u201d says Dowthwaite-Walsh.Take the pressure off\u201cThere\u2019s a huge, huge thing about fear of missing out\u201d, McAdam says. \u201cThey\u2019re extremely exciting places, [with] so much going on.\u201cThere won\u2019t be an opportunity to explore and see everything that you may want to, so as hard as it is, please do not try and put too much pressure on yourself trying to get around everything you want to see.\u201dThis could \u201cburn you out and add additional stress\u201d, he says, so McAdam recommends being \u201crealistic about what you can see\u201d.Stay connectedIf you are with friends, Dowthwaite-Walsh recommends staying connected.Recommended5 of the best lawnmowersHow should we be talking to our daughters about money?STI cases at record highs: 6 things everyone needs to know about sexually transmitted infections\u201cBeing able to enjoy yourself with friends helps to deepen the experience of a festival but also keeps you safe physically and psychologically,\u201d she suggests.She also recommends living in the moment as much as you can. \u201cHave fun, enjoy the moment and savour it.

Lawnmowers with larger blades mean you can mow more grass in less time \u2013 and therefore more suitable for larger and more complex spaces, suggests Feasey.As well as electric solutions, he says battery lawnmowers are also suitable for larger lawns, as long as users make sure the battery has the sufficient runtime to cut their lawn on one charge.Indeed, Dobbies\u2019 head of gardening, Liz Brennan, says battery-operated cordless mowers are becoming more popular, thanks to the fact they\u2019re environmentally friendly, simple to use and easy to manoeuvre.\u201cThese handy options also have none of the maintenance and servicing needs of traditional petrol lawnmowers, making them an appealing choice for both beginner and seasoned gardeners alike,\u201d says Brennan.\u201cWe\u2019re also seeing more value models coming on the market to meet demands of gardeners looking for low-cost ways to maintain their outdoor space.\u201dShe says the interchangeable battery in cordless lawnmowers is a fantastic innovation that not only helps gardeners save money, but frees up storage space thanks to its compact nature.\u201cNot only can interchangeable batteries be used to power lawnmowers, but gardeners can also use their battery in cordless hedge trimmers, leaf blowers and other power tools that use the same set up, making them great value for money.\u201dReady to cut the grass?

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeSpring has always been a transformative season for me. As the the weather improves, so, too, does my mood. But there has always been one thing that makes the move from winter much, much worse: my hay fever.Like one in 10 children and one in four adults, according to the Met Office, I have always suffered with hay fever. With that number rising year on year too, it\u2019s likely that if you don\u2019t get symptoms yourself, you\u2019ll know someone who does.For me, the worst symptom has always been unbearably itchy, watery eyes, although the constant sneezing isn\u2019t that much fun either. Other symptoms include itchy mouth, ears and throat, coughing, a blocked nose and many more.For a few years I took prescription strength Loratadine (Clarityn), which worked for a while, up to a point. The symptoms reduced but I was always able to tell when it was a day with high pollen in the air because my eyes would still itch and the sneezes would come and go. If it was the best the doctor could do, then I\u2019d just have to put up with the remaining symptoms, which were reduced.Eventually, Loratadine stopped being as effective. I mentioned it in passing to my GP when I was there for an appointment about something else. \u201cWe\u2019ll try something different,\u201d she said.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeA representative for Jamie Foxx has shut down conspiracy theories that the actor\u2019s recent hospitalisation was due to the Covid-19 vaccine leaving him \u201cpartially paralyzed and blind\u201d.In a statement to NBC News, Foxx\u2019s representatives called the claims \u201ccompletely inaccurate.\u201dThe conspiracy theory began on 30 May, when Hollywood gossip columnist AJ Benza made the unsubstantiated claim on Ask Dr Drew, hosted by reality TV host Dr Drew Pinsky. During the podcast episode, Benza alleged that Foxx was forced to get the Covid-19 vaccine while he was working on a film, citing a source \u201cin the room\u201d with Foxx when he was hospitalised.Benza claimed Foxx developed a \u201cblood clot in the brain\u201d after receiving the vaccine, which \u201ccaused him at that point to be partially paralyzed and blind.\u201dDespite Foxx\u2019s representatives refuting Benza\u2019s claims, it hasn\u2019t stopped far-right commentators from spreading the anti-vaccination conspiracy theory on the internet.

In the video, titled \u201cWhat\u2019s Going On With Jamie Foxx?\u201d, Owens suggested there may be \u201csome veracity\u201d to Benza\u2019s claim because nobody in Foxx\u2019s family had denied it at the time.Turning Point USA co-founder Charlie Kirk also weighed in on the claim, tweeting on 1 June that he was \u201cinfuriated a decent person like Jamie Foxx fell victim to Big Pharma because a movie set is still dumb enough to mandate their cash cow clot shot.\u201dThere\u2019s been much speculation surrounding Jamie Foxx\u2019s health after the 55-year-old actor was hospitalised in April following a \u201cmedical complication\u201d.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeIt\u2019s sad that when most people write about the East End of London today, it\u2019s done in relation to lattes, frappes, fancy flats and pricey olives. The reality is a bit different. For example, there\u2019s still a really potent cockney presence in the area that scarcely gets talked about. It\u2019s a living, breathing force of actual pride, which manifests in fabulously unsubtle ways: pearly queens getting gently mobbed, for example, or the occasional old-school cockney funeral passing by \u2013 featuring all the trimmings such as plumed horses and wooden carriages.It was seeing one of those grand spectacles pass by a few years ago that set me off on a wild train of thought, inspired by a flower arrangement in a hearse that just read \u201cA True Gent\u201d. What is \u201ca true gent\u201d, I wondered. How is it different to just calling someone a gentleman? Why did that phrase feel so profound in the context of a lavish cockney funeral, in a way it wouldn\u2019t in some tepid marketing spiel or tabloid headline? Bear with me, I think I\u2019ve cracked it.I\u2019m sure we all have a firm idea of what a gentleman is, or perhaps was. I was born in the Eighties, an era when everything was shot through the class prism \u2013 either explicitly in books by Rishi Sunak\u2019s favourite author, Jilly Cooper, or under the surface, in comedies such as Blackadder. Notions of what was and wasn\u2019t \u201cgentlemanly\u201d were still very much in fashion.Nowadays, however, it\u2019s clear that younger people are mostly grossed out by an old-fashioned sense of chivalry based on gender, one that heaps praise on men for being kind and respectful to women (shouldn\u2019t that just be, y\u2019know, standard behaviour?). Yet there are still people keeping the flame for the old-fashioned ways. Take Country Life magazine, which until 2017 ran an annual award for Gentleman of the Year. Its editor, Mark Hedges, once declared a gentleman is \u201coccasionally drunk but never disorderly, he doesn\u2019t sunbathe and he \u2018makes love\u2019 on his elbows.\u201d Quite what that means I genuinely have no idea \u2013 perhaps it\u2019s some kind of plank pose for posh people. The list in 2014 included one Boris Johnson in its top 10, who was praised \u2013 with some hilarity today \u2013 for being \u201ca gentleman [who] knows how to apologise\u201d, and that \u201cfew people in the public eye have mastered the mea culpa quite like Boris has\u201d.Yet while the notion of the classic gentleman crashes and burns in tandem with the reputation of our former PM, I\u2019ve keenly watched the growing scenarios where people will invoke that phrase: \u201ca true gent\u201d. I really think we know one when we see one, even though there\u2019s barely any common etymological basis to draw on (or minutes from a secret meeting of cockney elders where one stood up and said: \u201cEnough with all the fake gents\u201d).Recommended\u2018One big, happy family\u2019: How we all got sick of workplace platitudesIt\u2019s time for booze bottles to have health warning labelsI tried anti-bloating pills for two weeks, and now I know the gassy truthOften in a written and reported sense, the phrase comes up in memoriam. Scan local newspapers, for example, and you\u2019ll see it used a lot to celebrate a character who occupied a place in people\u2019s hearts and in the community, no matter how small. It also gets used a lot in sporting circles, too, in tributes to footballers and rugby players especially. I used to worry it was just a synonym for straight white English males of a certain manliness, but that changed after seeing Paul O\u2019Grady heaped with \u201ctrue gent\u201d platitudes after his sad death in March.But in a colloquial, everyday sense, there\u2019s an irresistible truth to the idea of a true gent, which goes beyond how it\u2019s used in words. The purity of it gets me every time I hear it. In my eyes, a true gent trumps a gentleman hands down. A mere gentleman might be blessed with wealth, good looks or manners \u2013 which in turn make him widely respected. A true gent has none of these by birth. They struggled and strived for it, they earned that acclaim off their own back. We have all surely met that one person who is so economically generous beyond their actual means that it humbles you to the core. They get the drinks in, they offer to pay as a reflex, or offer you dinner at theirs when you\u2019re feeling low. There\u2019s a whole strain of capitalism that revolves around what I call \u201cgentlemanism\u201d \u2013 stressing the importance of having the right watch, the right hair, the right clothes, the right accessories. A true gent needs precisely none of these things. They impress us instead by being endlessly caring, even if they\u2019re uncouth at the same time. Who cares? They\u2019re dependable, even if \u2013 compared to a classic gentleman \u2013 they have comparatively little to offer. They\u2019re that person who pursues their passions, even if they struggle to be quote unquote \u201csuccessful\u201d, out of a genuine love for what they do. That\u2019s a 24-carat true gent, right there.Using \u201ctrue gent\u201d as an honorific is also a way of hitting back at centuries of upper class people owning and defining concepts of what made a man worthy. And what arbitrary concepts they were \u2013 a gentleman never buckles his shoe on a Thursday, an MCC tie should be worn upside down during Lent, and so forth \u2013 as though they were deliberately engineered to piss people off. A true gent isn\u2019t tainted by any of that guff. Their worth is real, it\u2019s tangible, it\u2019s\u2026 true. Things may be in a state of flux in the East End, and to deny it would be silly. But I\u2019m pleased that where I live at least, gentrification hasn\u2019t killed off the \u201ctrue gent\u201d just yet."}, {"_id": "6488a05451ac33a3962e1884", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/love-sex/bill-murray-dating-kelis-confirmed-b2356260.html", "primaryCategory": "Love &amp; Sex", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Kelis addresses Bill Murray dating rumours for the first time", "lead": "<p>The \u2018Ghostbusters\u2019 star was recently spotted at two London festivals where Kelis was performing </p>", "author": "Kate Ng", "datePublished": "Tue, 13 Jun 2023 05:16:20 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:59:00.049541", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-13T05:16:20+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/09/07/billkshake.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Stay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletterStay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Yes.\u201dThe 58-year-old TV personality then asked Brooke how she thinks her future children would feel about her career as a sex worker. \u201cAre you going to be proud that you have your little ones and they look at you and go:\u2018Didn\u2019t you want to be a lawyer?\u2019 and you go: \u2018Yeah, but look at all my stuff!\u2019\u201dRecommendedPiers Morgan defends \u2018good friend\u2019 Holly Willoughby after \u2018patronising\u2019 Phillip Schofield speechNHS workers who quit jobs for OnlyFans reveal staggering amount they make an hourOnlyFans model with 7,000 online boyfriends reveals why she doesn\u2019t date in real lifeBrooke responded: \u201cThey can cry in a Ferrari,\u201d leaving Morgan seemingly speechless.A clip of Brooke\u2019s interview with Morgan was reposted to Twitter by viral news account Daily Loud, where it instantly received 35 million views.

The online platform and app is largely used by YouTubers, fitness trainers, musicians, and sex workers as a way of making money directly from subscription-based content, rather than using a third party.It now reportedly has more than 120 million registered users with more than two million content creators. The top earners on OnlyFans can make an estimated $100,000 or more monthly, with the platform having paid out more than $5bn to creators since its inception.Many celebrities have joined the subscription-based platform. Recently, model Amber Rose revealed that she\u2019s been open with her 10-year-old son Sebastian Taylor, who she shares with ex-husband Wiz Khalifa, about her OnlyFans career.During an appearance on the High Low with Emrata podcast last February, she shared that one of Sebastian\u2019s peers mentioned her OnlyFans account to him.\u201cHe said that somebody told him: \u2018Your mom is on OnlyFans,\u2019\u201d the model told podcast host Emily Ratajkowski. \u201cAnd it was during the pandemic.

During the interview, Morgan quizzed Brooke about her previous aspirations to be a lawyer before she joined the sex work industry.\u201cI\u2019m just curious about you being someone who embarks on a law career, who\u2019s obviously very bright, went to university, packed it in just for money, to be effectively an online stripper. I mean, that\u2019s what you do, right?\u201d Morgan asked Brooke.The OnlyFans model cheekily replied: \u201cI could be a good lawyer, yes, but also am I good at doing other things on video and camera? Yes.\u201dThe 58-year-old TV personality then asked Brooke how she thinks her future children would feel about her career as a sex worker. \u201cAre you going to be proud that you have your little ones and they look at you and go:\u2018Didn\u2019t you want to be a lawyer?\u2019 and you go: \u2018Yeah, but look at all my stuff!\u2019\u201dRecommendedPiers Morgan defends \u2018good friend\u2019 Holly Willoughby after \u2018patronising\u2019 Phillip Schofield speechNHS workers who quit jobs for OnlyFans reveal staggering amount they make an hourOnlyFans model with 7,000 online boyfriends reveals why she doesn\u2019t date in real lifeBrooke responded: \u201cThey can cry in a Ferrari,\u201d leaving Morgan seemingly speechless.A clip of Brooke\u2019s interview with Morgan was reposted to Twitter by viral news account Daily Loud, where it instantly received 35 million views.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeChris Pratt has shared why he believes people shouldn\u2019t wait to start a family.The Guardians of the Galaxy star, 43, recently spoke to Men\u2019s Journal about how becoming a father has made him a better actor. Pratt shares son Jack, 10, with ex-wife Anna Faris and daughters Lyla Maria, two, and Eloise Christina, one, with wife Katherine Schwarzenegger.Pratt explained that fatherhood has made him a more versatile actor because he sees being a parent as a \u201ctool\u201d to tap into his \u201cemotional potential\u201d during a scene. \u201cThat instinct you have to protect them \u2013 those are all things you can try to fake, but it doesn\u2019t really come close to what you have access to when you\u2019ve lived it,\u201d he told the outlet on 8 June. \u201cFor me, having kids is what it\u2019s all about, and how it\u2019s benefitted me as an actor is a pleasant byproduct.\u201dThe Parks and Recreation alum went on to encourage others to have children as soon as possible because of the joy that it brought to his own life. \u201cPeople say all the time, \u2018Don\u2019t rush to have kids,\u2019\u201d Pratt said. \u201cI personally disagree. Rush. Have them. Of course, make sure you find a great partner, but don\u2019t wait.\u201dRecommendedChris Pratt posts Mother\u2019s Day tribute with no mention of co-parent Anna FarisKatherine Schwarzenegger addresses public backlash to Chris Pratt relationshipAnna Faris says she\u2019s \u2018getting closer\u2019 to ex-husband Chris Pratt and his new wife Katherine SchwarzeneggerHe then recalled a conversation he had with actor Adam Sandler, who told him: \u201cEvery day you wait is a day they don\u2019t get to have you in their life.\u201d\u201cThe younger you have kids, the more time they get to have with you,\u201d Pratt continued. \u201cIt\u2019s wild. Having kids is incredible. The things you normally take for granted in life are new.\u201dChris Pratt has often shared glimpses into his life as a father of three on social media. The Jurassic World star was married to Anna Faris in 2009. They welcomed their son Jack in 2012, but announced their split in August 2017. Pratt and Faris finalised their divorce in October 2018, four months after he began dating his current wife, Katherine Schwarzenegger.He proposed to the 33-year-old author in January 2019 and they were married in June that year. They went on to welcome daughter Lyla Maria in August 2020 and daughter Eloise Christina in May 2022.Chris Pratt previously sparked backlash on social media when he praised his wife for giving him a \u201cgorgeous healthy daughter,\u201d as many people noted that his son Jack was born prematurely. He shared an Instagram post of himself and Schwarzenegger in 2021, encouraging his followers to \u201cfind someone\u201d who looks at them the way his wife does.\u201cWe met in church. She\u2019s given me an amazing life, a gorgeous healthy daughter, she chews so loudly that sometimes I put in my earbuds to drown it out, but that\u2019s love!\u201d the actor wrote in the Instagram caption. \u201cShe helps me with everything. In return, periodically, I open a jar of pickles. That\u2019s the trade. Her heart is pure and it belongs to me.\u201dHowever, many fans accused the actor of being \u201cpassive aggressive\u201d towards Faris, who has been open about their son\u2019s health issues in the past. In June 2022, he addressed the backlash towards his social media post by calling out critics.\u201cI said something like, \u2018Find someone who looks at you the way my wife looks at me.\u2019 And then I gave her some sh*t in the thing and said, \u2018But I love you. I\u2019m so thankful for my wife \u2013 she gave me a beautiful, healthy daughter,\u2019\u201d he told Men\u2019s Health at the time. \u201cAnd then a bunch of articles came out and said, \u2018That\u2019s so cringeworthy. I can\u2019t believe Chris Pratt would thank her for a healthy daughter when his first child was born premature. That\u2019s such a dig at his ex-wife,\u2019\u201d he recalled.\u201cAnd I\u2019m like, That is f**ked up. My son\u2019s gonna read that one day. He\u2019s nine.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeKanye West has sparked controversy after he served sushi on nude women at his birthday party.On 10 June, the rapper had a private party to celebrate his 46th birthday, which included his and ex Kim Kardashian\u2019s eldest daughter, North West, and his new partner \u00a0Bianca Censori.As shown in videos and photos of the event shared on Twitter, West opted to serve sushi to his guests in a non-traditional way: on a woman\u2019s body. While surrounded by multiple trays of food, the woman, who was only wearing a bikini top and bottom, was laying at the centre of the table. Along with a tray of sushi in between her legs, the food was resting above her chest, torso, and waist. She had her arms flat on the table and head up, while appearing to have a calm look on her face.In response to the photos on Twitter, multiple people went on to claim that West\u2019s decision to serve food on the nude woman was \u201cmisogynistic\u201d.RecommendedKanye West\u2019s daughter North and \u2018wife\u2019 Bianca Censori hold hands at rapper\u2019s birthday partyYeezy shoes are back on sale \u2014 months after Adidas cut ties with Kanye WestKim Kardashian \u2018assumes everything she texts Kanye West will go on the internet\u2019\u201cTreating a human woman like a plate is kinda misogynistic big dog,\u201d one wrote, while another added: \u201cMisogyny at its finest.\u201dA third claimed: \u201c\u2019I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s more disturbing, the fact that Kanye had a naked woman as a sushi platter or the fact that he thought it was an appropriate party idea. Either way, I think I\u2019ll pass on any future invitations to his shindigs.\u201dHowever, other people expressed that West could have been taking part in a Japanese practice called Nyotaimori, which is when sashimi or sushi is served from the naked body of a woman.\u201cI did this in catering for NFL players,\u201d one wrote. \u201cThe \u2018models\u2019 are not naked for sanitation reasons. They wear nude bikinis and the food is placed on banana leaves\u00a0 not their skin directly. Their body is like a table top. It\u2019s artistic and beautiful when executed properly.\u201d\u201cLol people here are not even aware that this isn\u2019t uncommon, there are restaurants all over the world doing this?\u201d a second wrote.One Twitter user also made a reference to the infamous Sex and the City scene, where Samantha, who\u2019s played by Kim Cattrall, covered her body in sushi as part of a gift for her boyfriend, Smith.Other videos from West\u2019s party also show his daughter at the table, as she appeared to have a shocked look on her face.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeKanye West has sparked controversy after he served sushi on nude women at his birthday party.On 10 June, the rapper had a private party to celebrate his 46th birthday, which included his and ex Kim Kardashian\u2019s eldest daughter, North West, and his new partner \u00a0Bianca Censori.As shown in videos and photos of the event shared on Twitter, West opted to serve sushi to his guests in a non-traditional way: on a woman\u2019s body. While surrounded by multiple trays of food, the woman, who was only wearing a bikini top and bottom, was laying at the centre of the table. Along with a tray of sushi in between her legs, the food was resting above her chest, torso, and waist. She had her arms flat on the table and head up, while appearing to have a calm look on her face.In response to the photos on Twitter, multiple people went on to claim that West\u2019s decision to serve food on the nude woman was \u201cmisogynistic\u201d.RecommendedKanye West\u2019s daughter North and \u2018wife\u2019 Bianca Censori hold hands at rapper\u2019s birthday partyYeezy shoes are back on sale \u2014 months after Adidas cut ties with Kanye WestKim Kardashian \u2018assumes everything she texts Kanye West will go on the internet\u2019\u201cTreating a human woman like a plate is kinda misogynistic big dog,\u201d one wrote, while another added: \u201cMisogyny at its finest.\u201dA third claimed: \u201c\u2019I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s more disturbing, the fact that Kanye had a naked woman as a sushi platter or the fact that he thought it was an appropriate party idea. Either way, I think I\u2019ll pass on any future invitations to his shindigs.\u201dHowever, other people expressed that West could have been taking part in a Japanese practice called Nyotaimori, which is when sashimi or sushi is served from the naked body of a woman.\u201cI did this in catering for NFL players,\u201d one wrote. \u201cThe \u2018models\u2019 are not naked for sanitation reasons. They wear nude bikinis and the food is placed on banana leaves\u00a0 not their skin directly. Their body is like a table top. It\u2019s artistic and beautiful when executed properly.\u201d\u201cLol people here are not even aware that this isn\u2019t uncommon, there are restaurants all over the world doing this?\u201d a second wrote.One Twitter user also made a reference to the infamous Sex and the City scene, where Samantha, who\u2019s played by Kim Cattrall, covered her body in sushi as part of a gift for her boyfriend, Smith.Other videos from West\u2019s party also show his daughter at the table, as she appeared to have a shocked look on her face. North then grabbed a piece of sushi from the tray and gave it to Censori.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeElon Musk has weighed in on the parenting controversy surrounding Megan Fox, after the actor was accused by Republican politician Robby Starbuck of forcing her sons to \u201cwear girls clothes\u201d.On 8 June, former GOP congressional candidate Robby Starbuck tweeted a paparazzi photo of Fox and her three children: Noah, 10, Bodhi, nine and Journey, six. The image showed her eldest son Noah wearing a pink long-sleeved T-shirt and tie-dye shorts, while Bodhi and Journey were dressed in dark T-shirts and trousers.\u201cThese are Megan Fox\u2019s sons. We used to live in the same gated community and our kids played at the park,\u201d Starbuck captioned the tweet. \u201cI saw two of them have a full on breakdown saying they were forced by their mom to wear girls clothes as their nanny tried to console them. It\u2019s pure child abuse. Pray for them.The Transformers star then clapped back at Starbuck\u2019s claims of \u201cchild abuse\u201d when she posted a screenshot of his tweet to Instagram. \u201cHey @robbystarbuck I really don\u2019t want to give you this attention because clearly you\u2019re a clout chaser. But let me teach you something,\u201d the 37-year-old actor began her post. \u201cIrregardless [sic] of how desperate you may have become at any given time to acquire wealth, power, success or fame \u2013 never use children as leverage or social currency. Especially under malevolent and erroneous pretense.\u201d\u201cExploiting my child\u2019s gender identity to gain attention in your political campaign has put you on the wrong side of the universe,\u201d the mother-of-three said. \u201cI have been burned at the stake by insecure, narcissistic, impotent little men like you many times and yet I\u2019m still here.

This person trying to claim this is true is a perfect example of someone with selfish motives that does not care about negatively affecting a parent child relationship.\u201dThe Beverly Hills, 90210 alum added: \u201cAs a society I hope we continue to push to be better. This Robby Starbuck person is full of s***, and I have no idea who he is.\u201dGreen and Fox were married for nearly 10 years before separating in 2020.

He\u2019s the one, like sometimes, he\u2019ll dress himself and he likes to wear dresses, sometimes,\u201d Fox said. \u201cAnd I send him to a really liberal, like hippy school. But even there, here in California, he still has little boys going like, \u2018Boys don\u2019t wear dresses,\u2019 or \u2018Boys don\u2019t wear pink\u2019.\u201dRecommendedMegan Fox hits back at US politician\u2019s claim about her children\u2019s clothesKylie Jenner sparks debate after pulling Rolex from bottom of her purseKristin Davis says she was \u2018ridiculed relentlessly\u2019 over facial fillersSpeaking to Glamour in April 2022, Fox also detailed the conversations she had with her eldest son about gender identity. \u201cNoah started wearing dresses when he was about two, and I bought a bunch of books that sort of addressed these things and addressed a full spectrum of what this is,\u201d Fox told the magazine.\u201cSome of the books are written by transgender children. Some of the books are just about how you can be a boy and wear a dress; you can express yourself through your clothing however you want,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that doesn\u2019t even have to have anything to do with your sexuality. So from the time they were very young, I\u2019ve incorporated those things into their daily lives so that nobody feels like they are weird or strange or different.\u201d"}]
