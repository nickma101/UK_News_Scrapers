Read our\u00a0privacy noticeA mother and stepfather have been found guilty over the killing of her nine-year-old son at his home in Worcestershire.Carla Scott has been convicted at Coventry Crown Court of the manslaughter of Alfie Steele and her partner Dirk Howell has been convicted of murdering the youngster, who was repeatedly assaulted.Alfie was repeatedly beaten and assaulted by Scott and Howell, and was put in a cold bath as a punishment prior to his death in February 2021, their trial heard. Both Scott and Howell had denied Alfie was \u201cdunked\u201d in the water as part of a \u201csinister\u201d regime of correction at his mum\u2019s address in Droitwich.Jurors at Coventry Crown Court heard that Alfie had 50 injuries all over his body, with only a handful likely to be attributed to normal childhood bumps and scrapes.RecommendedWho is Christian Brueckner? Madeleine McCann suspect and the accusations against himTwo men charged over murder and disappearance of Chloe Mitchell, 21, in Ballymena\u2018Funny and loving\u2019 couple who were found dead at home pictured for first time as man charged with murderMedical experts previously told the jury that seven of the injuries to his head and face were likely to have come from four different blows.On the day of his death, Scott rang 999 at 2.24pm and told the call handler that \u201cAlfie had fallen asleep in the bath\u201d. Howell was not at the house when officers arrived, with Scott later claiming to have found the boy \u201csubmerged\u201d and that he had previously \u201chit his head\u201d.Alfie was \u2018dunked\u2019 in a cold bath as punishment, a court heard  (Supplied/West Mercia Police)Scott, 35, denied murdering her son and told her trial that she had not \u201cbelted\u201d Alfie, while her partner claimed to have attempted CPR to revive the schoolboy. He also told jurors that he had not beaten the schoolboy nor attempted to stage a cover-up.Jurors at Coventry Crown Court took 10 hours and 13 minutes of deliberation to find 35-year-old Scott guilty of Alfie\u2019s manslaughter, returning a majority verdict of 11 to one on Tuesday.She was cleared of his murder. Howell, 41, was found guilty of Alfie\u2019s murder by unanimous verdict.The judge, Mr Justice Wall, remanded both defendants into custody to be sentenced at 11am on Thursday.Following the verdict, Alfie\u2019s grandad, Paul Scott, paid tribute to his grandson.\u201cOur precious grandson Alfie was a charming, funny and inquisitive young boy whose kindness and cheeky smile was enough to melt your heart.\u201cHe had a unique personality that made him a treasure to be around, whether it was his comical phrases or his quirky dance moves, he knew how to make you laugh and cry joyous tears.\u201cIt fills us with immense sadness that we will never be able to see that same cheeky smile again. Losing Alfie has left a massive void in our lives; to think that we will never be able to hug him and watch him grow into an accomplished young man causes much anguish. We miss him so much.\u201dMother Carla Scott and stepfather Dirk Howell have both been convicted  (West Mercia Police)After the verdict, the senior investigating officer who led the case, Detective Chief Inspector Leighton Harding, said: \u201cAlfie suffered the most horrifying physical and emotional abuse at the hands of Scott and Howell. It is unimaginable to consider the fear and distress Alfie must have felt during the events that led to his collapse and death in his home on the morning of 18 February 2021. \u201cThe physical violence he suffered at the hands of Scott and Howell, which involved being forced into a cold bath and his head held under water, caused his death.\u201cThe court heard evidence of a culture of excessive punishment of Alfie by Scott and Howell. Punishment amounted to beating Alfie with a belt and a slider until he was black and blue with bruising. He was often woken in the early hours of the morning and made to stand outside where Scott and Howell threw jugs of cold water over him.\u201cHe was often grounded for excessive periods, made to stand for hours inside and outside his home, food removed from him, banished to his room, repeatedly forced into a bath of cold water and his head held under.\u201cThe conduct of Scott and Howell was nothing less than serious physical and emotional abuse, inflicting the most cruel and inhumane treatment of Alfie.\u201cAlfie should have expected unconditional love and protection of Scott, yet she deliberately neglected his needs, choosing to prioritise her own needs and relationship with Howell, knowing the cruel treatment he was inflicting upon Alfie.\u201cScott and Howell did nothing to protect Alfie and inflicted or permitted the torrent of physical and emotional abuse to continue time and time again.\u201cBoth continued to lie to social services and police to protect themselves from their abuse being discovered, and even confronted and threatened neighbours and members of the public who reported concerns over their treatment of Alfie. At no stage has either of them shown any remorse or acceptance of responsibility for their actions.\u201cToday\u2019s verdict will never undo the dreadful abuse Alfie suffered but it will mean those responsible for inflicting such terror and pain will face the consequences of their sickening actions.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64889c3451ac339fc372a9b4", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/robin-walker-amanda-spielman-mps-schools-naht-b2356555.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "MPs launch inquiry into school inspections by Ofsted following criticism", "lead": "The watchdog has faced pressure to reform after headteacher Ruth Perry took her own life when her school was downgraded to the lowest rating.", "author": "Eleanor Busby", "datePublished": "Tue, 13 Jun 2023 16:14:05 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:41:24.754764", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-13T16:14:05+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/13/12/34269501f45744aeb06ca49b2f1647d4Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg2NzM4Mjg3-2.71869255.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeMPs are launching an inquiry into Ofsted\u2019s school inspections and whether they can be improved.The watchdog has faced pressure to reform after headteacher Ruth Perry took her own life after her school was downgraded to the lowest Ofsted rating.The inquiry \u2013 by cross-party MPs on the Commons Education Select Committee \u2013 will look into concerns that the one-word ratings that Ofsted gives to schools may not be conducive to helping schools improve.MPs will consider the impact of Ofsted inspections on the workload and wellbeing of teachers, school leaders and pupils as part of the inquiry.Robin Walker, chair of the committee, acknowledged that there has been a \u201cnotable groundswell of criticism\u201d towards Ofsted about the impact of inspections and single-word judgments on school staff.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveHe said: \u201cOfsted plays a particularly vital role when it comes to safeguarding but ensuring that inspections are proportionate, timely and reasonable is essential to build trust, especially after the tragic passing of headteacher Ruth Perry.\u201dThe inquiry will not examine the events that preceded the death of Ms Perry, the former headteacher of Caversham Primary School in Reading, Berkshire, as an inquest is due to commence later this year.An Ofsted report found Caversham School to be \u201cgood\u201d in every category apart from leadership and management, where it was rated as \u201cinadequate\u201d.Since Ms Perry\u2019s death in January there have been calls for one-word ratings to be abolished.On Monday, Ofsted announced a series of changes, including launching a consultation on reforms to the complaints system and giving schools more information around the timing of their inspections.Schools graded inadequate overall due only to ineffective safeguarding \u2013 but where all other judgments were good or better \u2013 will be revisited by inspectors within three months of a report being published as part of the reforms.\n\nI think it is fair to say that a great deal of that pressure does relate to the perceived consequences of inspection - it's not just about the process itselfAmanda Spielman, Ofsted's chief inspectorBut Amanda Spielman, Ofsted\u2019s chief inspector, said on Monday that scrapping one-word judgments would not solve the \u201cunderlying discomfort\u201d among headteachers if the consequences of the inspection remain the same.As part of the inquiry, MPs will explore the impact of Ofsted judgments on schools and pupils \u2013 and the adequacy of the support schools can access to enable them to improve following an Ofsted judgment.The effectiveness of Ofsted\u2019s complaints process will also be explored.Mr Walker added: \u201cSome have argued that Ofsted\u2019s role should be expanded to provide more support to schools that need to improve, amid concerns around the impact that receiving a negative rating can have on a school\u2019s morale and reputation.\u201dAddressing the Commons Education Select Committee on Tuesday, Ms Spielman welcomed the launch of the inquiry.She said Ofsted was focused on how it \u201ccan contribute to reducing the pressure that is undoubtedly felt by school leaders around inspection\u201d.\u201cI think it is fair to say that a great deal of that pressure does relate to the perceived consequences of inspection \u2013 it\u2019s not just about the process itself,\u201d Ms Spielman added.But she told MPs that the consequences of school inspection \u2013 such as intervention or support \u2013 \u201csit with Government\u201d rather than Ofsted.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders\u2019 union the NAHT, said: \u201cThe changes already announced by Ofsted do not go far enough to address the concerns the profession have or to mitigate the harm inspections can cause.\u201cIt is becoming increasingly clear that there is an overwhelming desire for meaningful change.\u201cWe hope the Education Select Committee will listen carefully to the experiences and concerns of the profession and help bring about much-needed change.\u201dProfessor Julia Waters, sister of Ms Perry, said: \u201cI am pleased to see that MPs will be looking into ways that Ofsted inspections can be improved.RecommendedNorthern European allies agree to step up efforts to protect underwater cablesData shows a majority of councils missed accounts deadline as reserves fallBrides get \u2018hitched\u2019 thanks to police escort to wedding venue\u201cSince Ruth\u2019s death, our family has been overwhelmed with the outpouring of anger and distrust of Ofsted from teachers and headteachers.\u201cIt is clear that a rigorous and independent review of the system is necessary, and I am glad that this inquiry will look into a wide range of important issues.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64889c3451ac339fc372a9b5", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/cost-of-living-payment-dwp-universal-credit-b2356653.html", "primaryCategory": "Home News", "subCategories": "test", "title": "July dates for DWP cost of living payments, benefits and pensions", "lead": "<p>Food prices increasing at their fastest rate in almost 45 years, ONS has warned </p>", "author": "Joe Sommerlad", "datePublished": "Tue, 13 Jun 2023 16:09:35 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:41:24.980413", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-13T16:09:35+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/05/23/07/cc940d8bba255e9a0fc72c4dae9574abY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg0OTA3ODA3-2.34653035.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Get the free Morning Headlines email for news from our reporters across the worldSign up to our free Morning Headlines email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticePeople across Britain are still struggling to meet their financial obligations as the cost of living crisis continues to eat into household budgets, with a recent Financial Conduct Authority study putting the total number of those up against it as high as 10 million.While inflation did finally drop down from 10.1 per cent to 8.7 per cent in May, the cost of goods in supermarket aisles and on high street shelves remains high as domestic finances continue to be stretched following a long winter of sky-high energy bills.The most recent Office for National Statistics (ONS) data shows food prices increasing at their fastest rate in almost 45 years for the year to April, with around 44 per cent of adults saying they have responded by spending less on the groceries and essentials, typically by opting for cheaper alternative brands, according to the ONS.Further to that, 50 per cent pf shoppers say they are buying fewer items altogether, 67 per cent say they have noticed an increase in their cost of living within the past month and 97 per cent say they have been impacted by rising grocery costs.Below, we look at what support is available to households this July.RecommendedDespite accelerating wage rises, Britons are getting poorerBanks should increase returns on savings amid interest rate rises, says top ToryAsda freezes prices on more than 500 products until end of AugustHomeowners warned to expect more mortgage pain after wage growth shoots upExtra \u00a31,350 of support being paid outDespite the expiration of Rishi Sunak\u2019s Energy Bill Support Scheme at the end of March (an initiative that handed out \u00a3400 in monthly instalments of \u00a366 and \u00a367), millions of households on low incomes will receive further cost of living support from the government this year worth up to \u00a31,350 in total.Eight million eligible means-tested benefits claimants, including people on universal credit, pension credit and tax credits, will receive \u00a3900 in instalments from this spring, with the money going directly to bank accounts in three tranches, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has said.There will also be a separate \u00a3150 payment for more than six million people with disabilities and an extra \u00a3300 for over eight million pensioners.Here are the payment windows that have been announced so far, with more precise dates expected later in the year:\u00a3301 \u2013 First cost of living payment \u2013 already issued between 25 April and 17 May (or 2 to 9 May for people on tax credits but no other

can expect in July \u2013 if last year\u2019s record-breaking heatwave is anything to go by \u2013 might not be comfortable for everyone but it will at least greatly reduce the need for having the central heating switched on, which proved such an expense over the course of the winter just gone.The government\u2019s Energy Price Guarantee (EPG) \u2013 introduced by Liz Truss last September to ensure households paid no more than \u00a32,500 for their electricity and gas, with the government subsidising the remainder owed to providers under Ofgem\u2019s Energy Price Cap (EPC) \u2013 was extended by chancellor Jeremy Hunt in his Budget of 15 March for a further three months.Mr Hunt had reportedly been tempted to increase the EPG to \u00a33,000, a considerably less generous offer that would have eased the burden on the state, but ultimately thought better of it, extending the guarantee into April, May and June.Now that the EPG has finally expired, consumers will once more be paying the EPC rate, although Ofgem has announced that will be \u00a32,074 from 1 July, a huge fall from the \u00a33,280 it was set at during the second quarter, from which households were shielded by the intervention of the government\u2019s overriding guarantee.That 17 per cent decrease reflects recent drops in wholesale energy prices \u2013 the amount energy firms pay for electricity and gas before supplying it to households \u2013and, although it is a significant drop from the eye-watering rates of the last two years, the figure remains more than \u00a31,000 a year above pre-pandemic levels.As for what might happen next, consultancy firm Cornwall Insight predicts that July\u2019s fall will be followed by another drop in October, when it expects the typical annual bill to be \u00a31,976.RecommendedBudget 2022: Hunt says UK in recession as he announces huge tax risesJeremy Hunt increases energy windfall tax in budgetJeremy Hunt freezes tax allowances and hits 45p rate payersUnfortunately, it believes the typical bill will then rise again in January 2024 to \u00a32,045 and Cornwall does not expect energy prices to return to pre-Covid levels before the end of the decade at the earliest.It has also warned customers that prices remain subject to wholesale market volatility, with the UK\u2019s reliance on energy imports meaning that geopolitical incidents like the war in Ukraine could continue to have a detrimental impact."}, {"_id": "64889c3551ac339fc372a9b6", "url":

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeSinger Lee Ryan has successfully applied to withdraw his guilty plea for drunkenly assaulting a police officer during his arrest for abusing a black flight attendant.A hearing in January was told the singer, 39, was \u201cslurring his words and staggering around\u201d after drinking a bottle of port before a British Airways flight from Glasgow to London City Airport on July 31 last year.After being refused more alcohol on the plane and told to return to his seat, Ryan made comments about attendant Leah Gordon\u2019s looks, calling her a \u201cchocolate cookie\u201d, before grabbing her wrists.Police footage showed Ryan \u201csnarling\u201d and swearing after allegedly trying to bite a Pc Bryett as officers attempted to arrest him on his arrival at the airport.He was found guilty at Ealing Magistrates\u2019 Court in January of racially aggravated common assault by beating and behaving in an abusive way towards the cabin crew member, while pleading guilty to assaulting a police officer by biting him.But appearing at Westminster Magistrates\u2019 Court on Tuesday, Ryan was told it would be \u201cunjust\u201d for him not to be allowed to withdraw the guilty plea after he claimed he received bad advice from his solicitor Mike Rainford.Keima Payton, representing Ryan, earlier said her client has autistic spectrum disorder and \u201cslow processing skills\u201d, leading to \u201cimpairments in understanding what is said to him\u201d, according to a psychological report.She said text messages sent by Ryan on the day of the hearing showed he was made to feel like he \u201chad to\u201d plead guilty by Mr Rainford, \u201ceven though he (Pc Bryett) had me by the neck\u201d.\n\nIn these circumstances I am in real doubt as to whether it was an informed admission of guilt or a following of instructionsDeputy chief magistrate Tan IkramGiving evidence on Tuesday, Ryan said he initially chose not to plead guilty to assaulting a police officer at a hearing in November, when he admitted to being drunk on an aircraft, saying: \u201cI didn\u2019t do it. I didn\u2019t bite him. That\u2019s the reason why I pleaded not guilty.\u201dDescribing the moment he pleaded guilty at a second hearing in January, when a trial was due to start, he said: \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe the words coming out of my mouth.\u201cThere was no conviction. It wasn\u2019t true. I was being made to do it.\u201dRuling Ryan could withdraw the plea on Tuesday, deputy chief magistrate Tan Ikram said: \u201cThere is a feature of this case that makes it slightly different.\u201cMr Ryan was diagnosed with ADHD. He has subsequently been diagnosed with Asperger\u2019s.\u201cOne of the challenges that people with high-functioning autism can have is slow processing of information and responding inappropriately to what is said.\n\nIt would be unjust not to allow him to withdraw his guilty pleaDeputy chief magistrate Tan Ikram\u201cMr Ryan was advised. He received that advice as an instruction.\u201cIn these circumstances I am in real doubt as to whether it was an informed admission of guilt or a following of instructions.\u201cIt would be unjust not to allow him to withdraw his guilty plea.\u201dRyan entered a second not guilty plea at the hearing and elected to be put on trial.A decision on whether or not Ryan will face a trial will be made at a fresh hearing in July."}, {"_id": "64889c3651ac339fc372a9ba", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/government-data-research-iain-wright-england-b2356776.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Data shows a majority of councils missed accounts deadline as reserves fall", "lead": "Two-thirds of councils had not published details of spending by the date set by the Government as concerns are raised over audits and transparency.", "author": "Jonathan Bunn", "datePublished": "Tue, 13 Jun 2023 15:43:05 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:41:26.054818", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-13T15:43:05+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/13/16/88087251a9878b5813038580d790c4fcY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg2NzU1NzY3-2.70401727.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeLess than a third of councils published draft accounts by this year\u2019s deadline amid concerns over town hall finances and audit delays undermining local democracy.Research shared with PA news agency shows 94 of 314 local authorities in England released accounts for 2022/23 by the required date of May 31, with a further 5% publishing by June 2.Of the 205 councils that had not published, 112 issued delayed publication notices, according to data provided by LG Improve.The most common reason cited was a problem with the auditing accounts for the previous financial year. The process of valuing of assets such as infrastructure and inadequate resources in finance departments were also referenced.While 19% of councils had their accounts for 2020-21 signed-off by auditors, 13% have not, leaving limited opportunity for public scrutiny of councils\u2019 spending and financial health.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveWoking recently become the latest council to issue a section 114 notice declaring effective bankruptcy after accruing a \u00a32 billion debt driven by risky borrowing.This has highlighted the potential consequences of widespread problems in audit processes and a lack of transparency.Woking and other councils that have recently said they are cannot meet their legal requirement to balance the books, such as Slough, Croydon and Thurrock, have not published audited accounts for at least the last two years.LG Improve warned that the perilous state of local government finances further emphasised the need for open accountability.\u201cAt a time when there are well reported issues of poor local government financial health, it is not a good situation that the majority of accounts are unavailable,\u201d it said.A recent report by the National Audit Office said cumulative delays to external audits meant that 632 opinions remained outstanding for all years as of November 30 last year.Councils have been required to appoint private firms to undertake their audits since 2018 following the abolition of the Audit Commission.But the changes have coincided with a significant decline in the number of councils able to publish accounts by the deadlines set by government.This has raised questions over both the viability of the audit market due to the level of fees offered and the complexity of work required to provide independent sign-off on accounts.LG Improve found most councils that had failed to publish on time this year said they would do so when \u201creasonably practicable\u201d, raising the prospect that detailed scrutiny will be delayed for some time.There was variation in the proportion of different types of councils that had published their accounts by June 2.Just a quarter of 32 local authorities in London had done so, compared to nearly half of county councils.Appearing before a committee of MPs earlier this month, experts warned that audit delays threatened to undermine public trust in local democracy and processes of accountability.Gareth Davies, controller and auditor general at the National Audit Office, said: \u201cIt is absolutely essential for timely, high quality accounts to explain how the money has been raised, how it is being used, and whether the authority is in a robust financial position.\u201dAlso appearing before the Levelling Up, Housing and Communities Committee, Iain Wright, a director at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, warned that problems with audits undermine vital transparency.\u201cCouncil tax payers want to know how their money is being spent and, ultimately, local authorities accounts are the best way of being able to distil that,\u201d he said.The LG Improve research also highlighted evidence that raises questions over the ability of many councils to weather an unexpected crisis at a time of rising demand and costs.Based on the 109 accounts available on June 2, cash reserves available to councils as a percentage of net revenue expenditure \u2013 a key indicator of resilience \u2013 fell by an average of 11% in 2022/23 compared to the previous year.This fall is reduced when temporary funding for business rates relief allocated to reserves is taken into account, but this money cannot be used on day-to-day spending.Across the board, 80% of councils saw some reduction in reserves but the size of the fall varied across different types of councils.County councils saw an average annual reduction of 1% in 2022/23 while districts experienced a 10% drop.Reserves available to district councils collectively still amounted to 173% of their net revenue expenditure, compared to an average of 59% for all councils.London councils, unitaries and metropolitan boroughs saw annual revenue reductions of between 13% and 18%.LG Improve said the data shows reserves falling \u201cmore rapidly and consistently\u201d in areas with higher levels of deprivation and demand for services.RecommendedBrides get \u2018hitched\u2019 thanks to police escort to wedding venueHeatwave threshold exceeded

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeBoris Johnson was given updates about his resignation honours list before he met with the Prime Minister in June, it is understood.The former prime minister is involved in a public spat with Rishi Sunak over his House of Lords nominations, after Nadine Dorries and other allies missed out on getting peerages.Ms Dorries has claimed information about what was needed for her to pass the vetting process for nominees was not relayed to her in time and accused the Prime Minister of \u201cduplicitously and cruelly\u201d blocking her appointment.She used an interview with TalkTV to launch a fresh attack on Mr Sunak, claiming he used \u201cweasel words\u201d and \u201csophistry\u201d in a meeting with Mr Johnson last week which left the outgoing MP believing she would be included.It is understood Mr Johnson was provided with information via the Cabinet Office about his list some time after the House of Lords Appointments Commission (Holac) sent a list to Mr Sunak in February of the seven approved names which were announced on Friday.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveThe former leader\u2019s team has been contacted for comment.\n\nObviously it is not for No 10 or the Cabinet Office to be in contact with individuals going through the Holac process \u2013 again, that would not be appropriateDowning StreetDowning Street said it would have been inappropriate for either No 10 or the Cabinet Office to contact individuals going through the vetting process directly.\u201cIn line with the longstanding custom, the Prime Minister forwards the list unaltered following vetting by Holac (the House of Lords Appointments Commission),\u201d the Prime Minister\u2019s official spokesman said.\u201cObviously it is not for No 10 or the Cabinet Office to be in contact with individuals going through the Holac process \u2013 again, that would not be appropriate.\u201dMs Dorries, who claims she stood down as an MP after being \u201cbullied\u201d by Downing Street, said she only learned that her name was not on the list around half an hour before it was published.Mr Johnson announced a shock resignation from Parliament on Friday in advance of a report which was expected to find he deliberately lied to MPs over the partygate scandal, before launching into a war of words with the man who was once his chancellor.The rancour between the former Tory leader and his successor descended into a public slanging match as Mr Sunak said his one-time ally had asked him to \u201cdo something I wasn\u2019t prepared to do\u201d.The Prime Minister suggested Mr Johnson wanted him to ignore the recommendations of the House of Lords Appointments Commission.But Mr Johnson\u2019s camp accused him of having \u201csecretly blocked\u201d the peerages of former culture secretary Ms Dorries and other allies in his resignation list.The former prime minister released a statement saying: \u201cRishi Sunak is talking rubbish.\u201cTo honour these peerages it was not necessary to overrule Holac \u2013 but simply to ask them to renew their vetting, which was a mere formality.\u201dThe Cabinet Office dismissed the attack, saying: \u201cHolac did not support the nominations of the MPs put forward by the former prime minister.\u201cIt is unprecedented for a sitting prime minister to invite Holac to reconsider the vetting of individual nominees on a former prime minister\u2019s resignation list.\u201cIt is, therefore, not a formality.\u201dDespite the expected findings of the Privileges Committee this week, Mr Johnson has insisted \u201cI\u2019ll be back\u201d \u2013 a reference to Arnold Schwarzenegger\u2019s Terminator.The committee\u2019s report has been pushed back towards the end of the week, reportedly due to printing problems in Parliament.In the Daily Express, the former prime minister said \u201cWe must fully deliver on Brexit and on the 2019 manifesto. We must smash Labour at the next election.\u201cNothing less than absolute victory and total Brexit will do \u2013 and as the great Arnold Schwarzenegger said, I\u2019ll be back.\u201dThe message echoed Mr Johnson\u2019s sign-off during his final appearance at Prime Minister\u2019s Questions last year, when he told MPs: \u201cHasta la vista, baby\u201d \u2013 the catchphrase of Schwarzenegger\u2019s cyborg character in the 1991 movie Terminator 2: Judgment Day.That reference similarly left the door open for a possible comeback, but the former Uxbridge and South Ruislip MP remained on the back benches until quitting the Commons on Friday.Meanwhile, Sir Keir Starmer warned that Tory infighting between the two erstwhile allies is damaging the UK\u2019s reputation internationally and putting off investors.The Labour leader said the three by-elections triggered by Ms Dorries, Mr Johnson and Nigel Adams were effectively \u201cpolitical tantrums\u201d.RecommendedBrides get \u2018hitched\u2019 thanks to police escort to wedding venueHeatwave threshold exceeded across the UKPortrait of John Lennon by ex-Beatle Stuart Sutcliffe up for auctionBeyond the potential neglect of UK-wide issues like the cost of living, focus on the turmoil could also have more far-ranging implications, he suggested.Speaking to business chiefs at London Tech Week, he said: \u201cThere\u2019s a deeper price because there\u2019s a reputation hit to the UK.

Mr Keith said that \u201cvery little thought\u201d was given to the impact lockdowns could have on the country.The inquiry heard from bereaved families in a series of moving video interviews, which included harrowing stories of people dying alone from Covid. Lady Hallett vowed that those who suffered in the pandemic will \u201calways be at the heart of the inquiry\u201d.Evidence is likely to show a lack of responsibility in government, and a state of \u201cchaos\u201d which resulted in a slow reaction to a pandemic where \u201clost time is measured in lost lives\u201d, the inquiry has been told by representatives of the bereaved.Pete Weatherby KC, of Covid Bereaved Families for Justice UK, said there had been \u201clittle or no ministerial leadership, and the chaos of committees, which led to poor planning and ultimately a reactive rather than proactive response to the virus\u201d.The first module \u2013 investigating the country\u2019s preparedness for the crisis \u2013 will include evidence on \u201cany impact arising from the UK\u2019s departure from the European Union\u201d.The inquiry team will also scrutinise the vaccine programme under module four, examining whether Britain\u2019s vaccines response was more effective as a result of the UK being outside the\u00a0EU.Mr Johnson and Tory ministers have argued that Brexit allowed the UK to chart its own course with the vaccines, both when it came to licensing and also when buying up doses.While the UK\u2019s vaccine rollout was faster than that of the EU, Kate Bingham, the former head of the government\u2019s taskforce, said that the speedy approval had \u201cnothing to do with Brexit\u201d.RecommendedWatch live: Covid inquiry hears evidence on first day of investigationFormer PM\u00a0David Cameron\u00a0and former chancellor George Osborne are expected to appear at an inquiry hearing next week.

He stood up calmly, placing his notes on the historic despatch box, telling her firmly, \u201cNo,\u201d before adding, \u201cthe guidance was followed and the rules were followed at all times\u201d.But just a few hours earlier, two of Mr Johnson\u2019s top aides had urged him against making this very claim.

And in an admission which, according to The Times, was crucial in the committee\u2019s decision Mr Johnson deliberately misled the Commons, Mr Reynolds said: \u201cI accepted this but questioned whether it was realistic to argue that all guidance had been followed at all times, given the nature of the working environment in No 10. He agreed to delete the reference to the guidance.\u201dIn a statement to the Commons opening PMQs, Mr Johnson said: \u201cI have been repeatedly assured since these allegations emerged that there was no party and that no Covid rules were broken. And that is what i have been repeatedly assured.\u201dJust thirty minutes later, Mr Johnson told MPs \u201cthe guidance was followed and the rules were followed at all times\u201d.

You can replicate it anywhere.\u201dCentrepoint aims to build 300 properties in total in London and Manchester in the coming years to help young people escape from homelessness and allow their circumstances and careers to develop so they can move on to the next stage of their lives.When William stood by a young sapling in a pot, which symbolised the launch, he told the guests the project was \u201cinspirational\u201d.He added: \u201cIt starts to show everyone how we really can prevent homelessness and it\u2019s a really amazing solution, practical solution, tangible solution, to how to help young people get back on their feet, to help themselves get back towards their new life.\u201dEarlier, in one of the flats, William chatted to a group of young people living in the block and spoke to Ruffine, a 21-year-old working in digital marketing and originally from Coventry, who was living temporarily with friends before securing a property.She said afterwards: \u201cIt\u2019s a good space, your own little space for a single person, and a nice place to start your life and build a foundation.\u201dSeyi Obakin, Centrepoint\u2019s chief executive officer, hosted the royal visit and said afterwards he believed what was unique about the project was, no other organisation had built a similar development run on the same rental structure.He described the project as a \u201c\u2026stepping stone accommodation \u2013 a bridge between supportive housing and the private rental sector \u2013 this is a bridge that currently doesn\u2019t exist\u201d.Mr Obakin added: \u201cI think this is a big piece of the jigsaw to help solve homelessness \u2013 the flats are self-contained, the young people absolutely love being here, and it gives them a big platform to help build their own careers.\u201cYet nationally we actually don\u2019t have the policy framework that enables this kind of thing to be built.\u201dRecommendedHeatwave threshold exceeded across the UKPortrait of John Lennon by ex-Beatle Stuart Sutcliffe up for auctionPolice keeping an \u2018open mind\u2019 over motive for deadly knife and van attackThe chief executive explained annual utilities were only about \u00a3200 for the young residents, who must be working or in an apprenticeship, and the small size of the homes were easier for them to look after.He said: \u201cA 19-year-old apprentice, who only gets paid the apprenticeship wage, would earn about \u00a38,500 a year.

a cruel \u2018punishment\u2019 regime inflicted by Dirk Howell and Alfie\u2019s mother Carla Scott which culminated in his tragic deathNSPCCScott was found guilty of manslaughter by a majority of 11-1, and cleared of his murder, with jurors returning their verdicts on Tuesday.Howell was found guilty of\u00a0murder by unanimous verdict.Scott was also found guilty of four counts of child cruelty, while Howell had previously admitted child cruelty.Opening the case last month, prosecutor Michelle Heeley KC said that the pair thought it was acceptable to hit\u00a0Alfie\u00a0with \u201cbelts, or a slider, like a heavy-duty flip flop, and use other more sinister forms of punishment\u201d.The six-week trial was told Scott and career criminal Howell tried to cover up the killing by delaying calling 999 after\u00a0Alfie\u00a0was either drowned, asphyxiated or went into cardiac arrest.The court heard\u00a0Alfie, who was found lifeless with a body temperature of 23C, may have been put back in a warm bath as the couple tried to pass off the murder as an accidental drowning.Scott, of Vashon Drive, Droitwich, and Howell, of Princip Street, Birmingham, had denied the charges against them.The judge, Mr Justice Wall, remanded both defendants into custody to be sentenced at 11am on Thursday.An NSPCC spokesperson said: \u201cThe suffering that Alfie Steele endured in the months before he died is heart-breaking; a cruel \u2018punishment\u2019 regime inflicted by Dirk Howell and Alfie\u2019s mother Carla Scott which culminated in his tragic death.\u201cIt\u2019s vital that a thorough review into the circumstances around Alfie\u2019s death establishes whether more could have been done by professionals to protect this little boy.\u201cThis is so important because such findings can help prevent future tragedies.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64889c3951ac339fc372a9c8", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/nottingham-incident-today-roads-closed-b2356440.html", "primaryCategory": "Home News", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Nottingham major incident \u2013 latest: Counter-terror police called in as force \u2018keeping open mind\u2019 on killings", "lead": "<p>Three people were found dead on streets around the city centre in the early hours of the morning </p>", "author": "Tara Cobham,Holly Evans and Maryam Zakir-Hussain", "datePublished": "Tue, 13 Jun 2023 14:38:01 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:41:29.128119", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-13T14:38:01+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/13/09/SEI160062200.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "\u2715ClosePolice prepare to raid Nottingham property following 'major incident'Get the free Morning Headlines email for news from our reporters across the worldSign up to our free Morning Headlines email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

She said she suffered guilt over the way they had died.Another woman said she had \"lost everything\", while others described suffering anxiety.People also told how they had not hugged each other at family funerals because they were sticking to Covid social distancing rules laid down by the government.UK may not have been prepared for pandemicThe UK may not have been \"very well prepared at all\" to deal with the coronavirus pandemic, the official inquiry\u2019s lead lawyer has said as public hearings began.Lead counsel Hugo Keith KC questioned on Tuesday whether the nation was equipped to offer substantial protection to the public as leaders had promised.In his opening statement, Mr Keith said that near the start of the pandemic in March 2020 the Department of Health and Social Care, along with the three devolved governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, published a Covid-19 action plan \"setting out how they planned to tackle the coronavirus outbreak\". Hugo Keith KC says UK may not have been prepared for pandemic  (Covid 19 Inquiry)\"The plan stated that the United Kingdom was well prepared to respond in a way that offered substantial protection to the public. Whether that was actually the case will be examined in module one.\"Even at this stage before hearing the evidence it is apparent that we might not have been very well prepared at all.\"Mr Keith said the inquiry would look at whether health inequalities contributed to the UK death toll and levels of hospitalisation.\"Did the high levels of heart disease, diabetes, respiratory illness and obesity render us more vulnerable?\u201d he said. \u201cHad there been a slowdown in health improvement in the decade before? Had health inequalities widened?\u201dVery little thought given to impact of lockdownsMr Keith said there was \u201cvery little thought\u201d given to the impact lockdowns could have on the country.\"Extraordinary though it may seem, given that it\u2019s a word that\u2019s forever seared in the nation\u2019s consciousness, there was very little debate pre-pandemic of whether a lockdown might prove to be necessary in the event of a runaway virus, let alone how a lockdown could be avoided.\"Very little thought was given to how, if it proved to be necessary, how something as complex, difficult and damaging as a national lockdown could be put in place at all.\"Equally, there appears to have been a failure to think through the potentially massive impact on education and on the economy in trying to control a runaway virus in this way.\"Mr Keith also questioned whether past experiences could have led to complacency in planning.He added: \"Was there an element of complacency based on our recent experiences, including the ranking in the Global Health Security Index? Or our response to swine flu in 2009 and the UK\u2019s undoubted successes in ensuring Sars and Mers did not spread?\"Did our experience of the 2009 swine flu lead to concerns about overreacting?\"Brexit could have \u2018crowded out\u2019 planning for pandemicHugo Keith KC suggested to the Covid inquiry that preparing for Brexit \"crowded out and prevented\" the work that was needed to improve pandemic preparedness.He said: \"The pandemic struck the United Kingdom just as it was leaving the European Union.\"That departure required an enormous amount of planning and preparation, particularly to address what were likely to be the severe consequences of a no-deal exit on food and medicine supplies, travel and transport, business borders and so on.\"It is clear that such planning, from 2018 onwards, crowded out and prevented some or perhaps a majority of the improvements that central government itself understood were required to be made to resilience planning and preparedness.\"Did the attention therefore paid to the risks of a no-deal exit - Operation Yellowhammer as it was known - drain the resources and capacity that should have been continuing the fight against the next pandemic, that should have been utilised in preparing the United Kingdom for civil emergency?Evidence likely to show \u2018chaos\u2019 in governmentEvidence is likely to show a lack of responsibility in Government and \"chaos\" which led to a slow reaction to a pandemic where \"lost time is measured in lost lives\", the Covid inquiry has been told.Pete Weatherby KC, of Covid Bereaved Families for Justice UK, said: \"The families expect the evidence will show a lack of responsibility in Government for civil emergency preparedness, with little or no ministerial leadership and the chaos of committees which led to poor planning and ultimately a reactive rather than proactive response to the virus.RecommendedGovernment WhatsApps about \u2018frothy\u2019 coffee, not big decisions, former health ministerBoris Johnson hands over his WhatsApps and asks for them to be given to Covid inquiryBoris WhatsApp row descends into farce as senior Tories call for Sunak to end dispute\"We anticipate the evidence will show that the most fundamental consequence of this was a slow reaction.

RecommendedListen: Geordie Greig discusses The Independent\u2019s Afghan pilot campaign on LBCAnother Afghan hero who served with British forces is threatened with Rwanda deportationStonewalled and forgotten: The government\u2019s treatment of the Afghan war hero is a scandalSir Iain told The Independent: \u201cWithout heroes like this pilot who is now seeking our help to stay here we would not be able to fight\u00a0causes which matter to democratic governments who fight for freedom.\u201dHe added: \u201cWe were\u00a0allies\u00a0and comrades in arms to those\u00a0who helped the coalition and now they have themselves and their family at risk from the Taliban we have failed our pledge we gave to stand by them. To see America stand in for us and do the decent thing is galling and shameful.\u201dLabour said the Rishi Sunak\u2019s government appeared to be operating \u201cOperation Cold Shoulder\u201d to Afghan heroes, describing the intervention by the US as \u201cdeeply embarrassing\u201d.Sign The Independent\u2019s petition calling for UK to support Afghan war heroes who served alongside BritainSign our petition hereThe airman, who flew more than 30 sorties against terrorist threats which were planned by British and US commanders, was described as a \u201ctrue patriot to his nation\u201d by his US supervisor.But the Ministry of Defence has rejected his application to stay in the UK under the Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy (Arap) \u2013 aimed at getting those who helped British forces out of the country.The government said it did not accept his role had \u201cresulted in a high and imminent risk of a threat to your life\u201d. The MoD also said it does not accept that Britain\u2019s operations in would have been \u201cmaterially less efficient or materially less successful\u201d without him.Although category 4 of the Arap scheme is aimed at those \u201cclosely supporting and assisting\u201d British forces \u2013 thought to be his best chance of staying in the UK \u2013 officials deemed the pilot ineligible.Senior military figures are disappointed that Mr Wallace \u2013 rumoured to be angling for the job of Nato secretary general \u2013 has not rushed to the aid of the Afghan pilot who helped coalition forces against the Taliban.The Afghan pilot has called on Rishi Sunak to stop his deportation and help him bring his family to the UK  (Holy Bancroft)\u201cThis is a very disappointing decision \u2013 justified on very narrow grounds,\u201d Lord Dannatt told The Independent. \u201cAre we denying he fought against the Taliban? This is a most ungenerous decision which sits uncomfortably with common decency.\u201cHe came to this country, trusting in the decency of the British, by the only means available to him and now seems doomed to be deported to Rwanda. To cast him off as America\u2019s problem is a complete abrogation of our responsibilities and our decency.\u201dAir Marshal Stringer said: \u201cWhether we had a de jure contract with these Afghan servicemen or not seems a weaselling distinction on which to fall back.\u201cThe de facto contract was that we encouraged Afghans to join the security services and fight alongside us to achieve our ends - putting themselves at risk from regressive and dangerous forces such as the Taliban.\u201dHe added: \u201cWhen we removed the cover we had promised them we left them dreadfully exposed. What weight does our moral authority carry when we weasel out of our obligations; and why should we expect people to trust us in future?\u201dDozens of military chiefs, politicians and celebrities have backed The Independent\u2019s call to allow him and other Afghan veterans who helped coalition forces to be given safe refuge.Lord Dannatt has backed Afghan pilot\u2019s case  (David Parker/AFP/Getty Images)After serving alongside coalition forces, the pilot received two personal recommendations as to his strength of character and the role he played in fighting the Taliban in the years leading up to the fall of Kabul in August 2021.He has now been accepted onto the US\u2019s P1 resettlement scheme, for which you have to be personally approved by a US official. There is no guarantee that he will be offered asylum and the process can take years, but he has entered the assessment stage.Now living in Home Office accommodation in the UK, the pilot is despairing at his situation and said that the decision he made to risk his life for the coalition was his biggest regret.\u201cWe made the biggest mistake in my life when we cooperated with the American forces and British forces, and now we have to suffer the pain of being stateless, far from family, humiliation and misery,\u201d he said. He is also growing increasingly worried for the safety of his family, as he waits to hear the outcome of a seperate asylum application to the Home Office.Officials at home secretary Suella Braverman\u2019s department warned him he could be sent to Rwanda because his Channel journey is deemed illegal. He has been given 90 days to appeal the decision to turn him down for the Arap scheme.The pilot flew combat mission alongside organised by coalition forces in Afghanistan  (The Independent )A number of Afghans who helped American forces before the US withdrew from Afghanistan \u2014 including the pilot \u2014 were referred to the scheme by their US supervisors directly after the fall of Kabul.But aside from being asked to fill out a form with more details, the pilot heard nothing more from the State Department\u2019s Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration.However, last month White House said it would investigate his case when approached by The Independent and his case has been confirmed in the system.Listen: Geordie Greig discusses The Independent's Afghan pilot campaign on LBCDuring his trip to Washington last week, Mr Sunak ignored questions about the pilot from The Independent as he arrived at the White House to meet president Joe Biden.

He used to be a drug dealer.\u201dThe defendant drew a stickman wearing a cast on one leg before confirming that his father hit and broke his leg.The incident caused him to feel a \u201cbrewing\u201d inside of him which he could not further explain, the court heard.De Zoysa went on to say he hit his father on the head using a metal rod in an apparent separate incident and did it out of \u201cpanic\u201d \u2013 a feeling which he said was \u201cpossibly\u201d caused by his autism.He was arrested for \u201cfighting\u201d his father in June 2019.Jurors watched police body-worn video of De Zoysa\u2019s 2019 arrest in which an officer could be heard saying: \u201cHe\u2019s kicked his father off his bike.\u201dAsked about the incident, De Zoysa said his dad was upsetting him and talking \u201ctoo loud\u201d.The jury heard more about the defendant\u2019s home life including an inference that he liked eating dinner alone because there was \u201cviolence\u201d at the dinner table with his \u201cfamily\u201d which was \u201ccrazy\u201d.He confirmed that he broke the stairs in his family home and set a carpet on fire because he was \u201cupset\u201d.The court also heard he smoked cannabis because of \u201cstress\u201d which helped him feel \u201cmellow\u201d.Jurors were told De Zoysa was bullied at school, the defendant explaining that his peers threw chains at him because he was \u201cvulnerable\u201d and an \u201ceasy target\u201d.But he received three As at A-Level for Chemistry, Physics and Maths and attended University College London \u2013 although he did not finish his degree.He worked in coding at HMRC and told the jury he got on well with his colleagues.De Zoysa was asked to point to the drawing of either a circle or a semi-circle to indicate 100% or 50% sureness respectively in his answers when it came to discussing the day Sgt Ratana died.But the trial was adjourned early after the defendant grew tired.De Zoysa, of Banstead, Surrey, had been arrested on London Road, Norbury, south London, during the early hours of September 25 2020, after a stop and search by officers found he had cannabis and seven rounds of ammunition.Officers did not know he had a gun until it was used to shoot Sgt Ratana.Jurors have been told they will have to consider whether De Zoysa deliberately fired the revolver and the question of diminished responsibility.Mr Khan previously told the jury that the defendant was suffering an autistic meltdown at the time of the shooting.The trial continues on Wednesday at 9.30am."}, {"_id": "64889c3a51ac339fc372a9cf", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/first-minister-michelle-thomson-snp-europe-police-scotland-b2356671.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Sturgeon is Europe\u2019s \u2018most impressive\u2019 politician despite her arrest \u2013 Yousaf", "lead": "The First Minister spoke about his predecessor less than 48 hours after she was arrested by police.", "author": "Pa Scotland Political Reporters", "datePublished": "Tue, 13 Jun 2023 14:20:46 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:41:30.715876", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-13T14:20:46+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/13/14/aa9291305fa9ac581842b9dbf6aa591bY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg2NzQ5NTYy-2.71544566.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

She was released, of course, without charge.\u201dThe First Minister also said he would call for a \u201cunified voice\u201d among the party over the decision not to suspend the whip from his predecessor.Speaking about his predecessor, who spent more than eight years in the top job in Scottish politics,\u00a0he said: \u201cNicola Sturgeon is the most impressive politician I think we have seen in Europe, she is an asset to our movement,\u00a0and to our party.\u201cIt\u2019s obviously a difficult time, it\u2019s a very very difficult time for her and a difficult time for our party and personally painful to many of us.\u201dMr Yousaf, who held a meeting with SNP MSPs in Holyrood on Tuesday told journalists he \u201cdid not read the riot act\u201d to those who disagreed, adding: \u201cI was listening, I was engaged as any good leader would do. I had a really constructive conversation with the SNP group.\u201dSNP depute leader Keith Brown backed Mr Yousaf\u2019s decision to allow Ms Sturgeon to remain in the party and said the SNP group had shown \u201cvery strong support\u201d following her arrest.The group also decided they will send flowers to the former first minister as a show of support.Mr\u00a0Brown added that other cases, where the party\u2019s elected representatives had been suspended while allegations around them were being investigated, involved \u201cdifferent circumstances\u201d.Mr Brown told BBC Radio Scotland: \u201cI think it\u2019s in the interest of natural justice, which is the principle which Humza, the First Minister, is following.\u201dSNP MSP Michelle Thomson was among those calling for Ms Sturgeon to resign from the whip while the investigation was ongoing.Ms Thomson argued that she herself had needed to resign the whip while an MP in 2015, despite not being \u201cpersonally under investigation\u201d and \u201ccertainly not arrested\u201d.However, Mr Brown claimed that Ms Thomson had taken\u00a0the decision to remove herself from the SNP group at Westminster.\u201cThere are different circumstances in each of these situations,\u201d\u00a0 he said.\u201cI accept that, and that\u2019s bound to be the case, but in relation to the current case, Nicola\u00a0Sturgeon has not been charged \u2013 she has not been accused, in fact, of anything.\u201cThe arrest I appreciate is a dramatic thing to have happened.\u201cIt\u2019s perhaps not as well understood that arrest is just a way of making sure that the interview and information gathering by the police is put into formal footing.The SNP depute leader said Ms Sturgeon had given a \u201cstrong defence\u201d of her own innocence and added he was not aware of any complaints being made to the party\u2019s member conduct committee.However, the\u00a0Scottish Conservatives said some of Mr Brown\u2019s claims were \u201cabsurd\u201d.Deputy leader Meghan Gallacher said: \u201cKeith Brown\u2019s desperate spinning in defence of Humza Yousaf will only pour petrol on the bitter civil war between SNP MSPs and MPs over Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s preferential treatment.\u201cHis claim that Michelle Thomson had voluntarily given up the SNP whip when she was under investigation amounts to gaslighting, as she has said very clearly she had the whip removed from her by Nicola Sturgeon.\u201dRecommendedPolice keeping an \u2018open mind\u2019 over motive for deadly knife and van attackBBC boss: Eight equal pay cases currently open is an \u2018achievement\u2019Johnson \u2018was updated on resignation honours list by Cabinet Office before June\u2019She added: \u201cNo amount of spin can disguise the fact that Humza Yousaf is so compromised by his closeness to Nicola Sturgeon that he is having to move the goalposts on internal discipline.\u201dFormer SNP\u00a0leadership contender Ash Regan, and MP Angus MacNeil, both of whom were critics of Ms Sturgeon,\u00a0are also amongst those who have suggested that she should be suspended."}, {"_id": "64889c3a51ac339fc372a9d0", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/cardiff-crash-riot-ely-police-b2356665.html", "primaryCategory": "Home News", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Gross misconduct probe for police who followed boys killed in Cardiff crash that sparked riot", "lead": "<p>Kyrees Sullivan, 16, and Harvey Evans, 15,\u00a0died last month, shortly after they were captured on CCTV being followed by a police van in Ely  </p>", "author": "Martha McHardy", "datePublished": "Tue, 13 Jun 2023 14:14:31 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:41:30.925483", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-13T14:14:31+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/05/24/17/Kyrees%20Sullivan%20Harvey%20Evans.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Get the free Morning Headlines email for news from our reporters across the worldSign up to our free Morning Headlines email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

We negotiated in good faith, addressing concerns from junior doctors but this was only the start of the journey, not the end,\u201d Mr Matheson said.\u201cThis was the biggest investment in junior doctor pay for the last 20 years and a step forward to modernising pay bargaining, restoring confidence amongst junior doctors and ensuring that their contribution to our healthcare system is appropriately recognised.\u201cMy door remains open, and I will meet with BMA Scotland later this week to discuss how we move forward.\u201dScottish Tory health spokesman, Dr Sandesh Gulhane, said junior doctors were \u201cat their wits\u2019 end\u201d, adding: \u201cMichael Matheson has a duty to urgently address the poor conditions junior doctors are facing, such as guaranteeing they will get hot, nutritious meals at night and that rotas will be done six weeks in advance.\u201cThe onus is on the SNP Government to get back round the table and find a solution to this dispute and deliver the modern, efficient and local health service that patients and staff need in Scotland.\u201dScottish Labour deputy leader Jackie Baillie urged the Health Secretary to restart negotiations.RecommendedBBC boss: Eight equal pay cases currently open is an \u2018achievement\u2019Johnson \u2018was updated on resignation honours list by Cabinet Office before June\u2019Sturgeon is Europe\u2019s \u2018most impressive\u2019 politician despite her arrest \u2013 Yousaf\u201cThe responsibility for this strike lies solely with Michael Matheson,\u201d she said.\u201cToday, I am urging Michael Matheson to get around the table with the BMA and act to avert this strike by providing fair pay and conditions for junior doctors.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64889c3c51ac339fc372a9d5", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/nadine-dorries-boris-johnson-rishi-sunak-prime-minister-chief-whip-b2356243.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Dorries says she was \u2018bullied\u2019 by No 10 and accuses Sunak of blocking peerage - old", "lead": "The former culture secretary and Boris Johnson loyalist denied \u2018knifing the party\u2019 by triggering a by-election in her Mid Bedfordshire seat.", "author": "Nina Lloyd", "datePublished": "Tue, 13 Jun 2023 13:44:42 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:41:32.111812", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-13T13:44:42+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/12/22/230b0548d3a68fad81f0c36783ffcc26Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg2NjkxODE3-2.62440664.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up for the View from Westminster email for expert analysis straight to your inboxGet our free View from Westminster email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeBBC director-general Tim Davie has said there are eight equal pay cases open internally within the BBC which he feels is an \u201cachievement\u201d in comparison with where the corporation was.MP John Nicolson questioned Mr Davie during a Culture, Media and Sport Committee meeting on Tuesday on the corporation\u2019s handling of such cases including that of former Northern Ireland newsreader Donna Traynor, who settled a tribunal case earlier this year after alleging she was discriminated against on the basis of age, sex and disability.Addressing the issue of equal pay, Mr Davie said: \u201cThe situation on equal pay is actually a good story for the BBC.\u201cWe had an enormous amount of work (to) sort through the issue and we\u2019re now at a point at the moment (where) we have eight equal pay cases open internally within the BBC.\u201cThat\u2019s an achievement versus where we were and we\u2019ve also got the pay frameworks in place.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow live\u201cWhen we get to a situation which we go to tribunal, no one wants that. All we\u2019re trying to do is make a right call in terms of what\u2019s the right thing to do with licence fee-payer money,\u201d he added.Mr Nicolson recalled that in September 2021, the BBC told the committee it had spent \u00a31.1 million on lawyers\u2019 fees to deal with equal pay cases from employees.The select committee member also claimed he had it on \u201cgood authority\u201d that between five and 10 journalists are currently at home on full salaries on \u201cgardening leave\u201d and that they were allegedly disproportionately women, and people who have challenged the BBC on equal pay for women.He also claimed that freelancers have been hired to present the news in their place.Mr Davie replied: \u201cYou\u2019re into a very small number of people where specifically we\u2019re having discussions about their future. I\u2019m not going to do that with the committee \u2026\u201cI understand the point. I think we need a fair, good conservation with those individuals to make sure they\u2019re settled \u2026\u201cAnd while we do that I\u2019m not going to get into the specifics because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair.\u201cBut in terms of why we\u2019re doing these things, you\u2019re always going to have to schedule bits where you\u2019re going to use freelancers.\u201dLater in the committee meeting, the corporation\u2019s chief content officer Charlotte Moore also denied the allegation that BBC radio is ageist after a number of long-serving presenters left the broadcaster\u2019s stations recently.Ms Moore said: \u201cRadio is absolutely not ageist. It\u2019s important that we constantly evolve, and some people will leave and we give opportunities to new people, and the BBC has always done that.\u201dShe added: \u201cThe competition is such at the moment that there\u2019s huge competition out there and a lot of people choose to leave for very good commercial reasons, and I wish them well, but we therefore have to move the schedules and evolve the schedules and that\u2019s something editorially we do all the time and have always done.\u201dMr Davie admitted he did not want Ken Bruce to leave BBC Radio 2, where he had presented his mid-morning show for 31 years, but feels Vernon Kay is an \u201coutstanding broadcaster\u201d to replace him.Asked if the BBC was not catering to a diverse audience, he added: \u201cYou have to look after your loyal audience, the BBC has to do that and it\u2019s critical.\u201cIf you look at our employee record but also our playlists, there will always be people who have issues with our playlists, different artists, different ages. I\u2019ve got plenty of up-and-coming young talent who would love to be on the radio on playlist, and there\u2019ll be 80s artists that will be annoyed that they\u2019re not getting the playlist.

It was repeated stabbing \u2013 four or five times. The lad collapsed in the middle of the road.\u201cThe girl stumbled towards a house and didn\u2019t move. The next minute she had disappeared down the side of a house, and that\u2019s where they found her.\u201cI\u2019d say it all happened within five or six minutes. The attacker then just walked off up Ilkeston Road towards town, as calm as anything.\u201dThe man said he called the police, who arrived within five minutes, before paramedics tried for 40 minutes to revive the pair.Police activity continued in various locations along Ilkeston Road on Tuesday, with parts of the street cordoned off and armed officers deployed, some of whom came from Derbyshire Police and South Yorkshire Police.Two women were taken away from one commercial property in a police van shortly before 1pm.A terraced property was also under police guard, with staff at a neighbouring hairdresser saying it had been raided last year.Witnesses in Bentinck Road described the suspect struggling as officers dragged him out of a white van.Student Demi Ojolow, who lives in the road, said: \u201cI just saw the police shouting at him to get out of the car and get on the floor.\u201cAnd they dragged him out of the car and he just fell on the floor. He was still pretty wrestling at the point.\u201cThey dragged him away and that was about it.\u201dMs Ojolow said police were pointing some kind of weapons at the man but she was not sure whether it was a Taser or firearm.Damage could be seen to the bonnet and windscreen of the van which was left at the scene.Another Bentinck Road resident, Dimitrious Lawani, arrived at the scene just as the man was being pulled out of the van.He said: \u201cThere\u2019s two of them pulling him and two behind pointing at him \u2013 I think those were Tasers.\u201dThe witness said they shouted: \u201cGet down, get out, stop fighting.\u201dMr Lawani said: \u201cHe was being quite resistive \u2013 very resistive from what I could tell \u2013 and he was also making a lot of noise, but I couldn\u2019t really distinguish what he was saying.\u201dRoad closures have been put in place covering a wide area of Nottingham city centre, including Ilkeston Road, Milton Street, Maples Street and Woodborough Road, from the junction with Magdala Road into the city, Magdala Road and Maid Marian Way at the junction of Parliament Street.The tram network was also disrupted with all services suspended on the Nottingham Express Transit (NET) as the police investigation continued.Nottinghamshire Chief Constable Kate Meynell said: \u201cThis is a horrific and tragic incident which has claimed the lives of three people.\u201cWe believe these three incidents are all linked and we have a man in custody.\u201cThis investigation is at its early stages and a team of detectives is working to establish exactly what has happened.\u201cWe ask the public to be patient while inquiries continue.

In turn, the media mogul has been credited for influencing representation in the fashion industry as a whole.He has announced he is stepping down to take up a new position as editorial advisor to British Vogue and global creator and cultural adviser to Vogue.Enninful recalls the first time he ever encountered someone who was \u201copenly\u201d gay, when he was aged 16, in 1980s London but laments that he feared the prospect of ever coming out himself.RecommendedBritish Vogue\u2019s Edward Enninful: How I learnt to overcome fear when I came outThe Independent Pride List 2023: The LGBT+ people making change happenBritish Vogue editor-in-chief Edward Enninful steps down to take on new role\u201cI was 16 when I encountered the first person I\u2019d ever met who actually called themselves gay,\u201d he writes. \u201cI was a sheltered Ghanaian immigrant \u2013 a good, Christian schoolboy who kept his head down, worked hard and always had his father\u2019s words thundering in his ears: \u2018If any of those gays come into this house it will be over my dead body.\u2019\u201dHe observes that fashion changed not only his career prospects but allowed him to express himself in a way he never thought would be possible.\u201cSuddenly, I was a teenager in London and meeting gay and trans people everywhere; photoshoots, parties, gigs, clubs,\u201d he says. \u201cBut did I feel pride? It was probably more complicated than that.\u201dEnninful writes that he was \u201cpetrified\u201d of coming out as gay, especially given his religious upbringing, and feared \u201cenernal damnation\u201d if he revealed his sexuality.\u201cThe fire and brimstone that would rage in church seemed so real that I genuinely thought I was going to hell and that a life \u2013 and afterlife \u2013 of eternal damnation awaited me. This is the way for a lot of young LGBT+ people still today, especially in religious communities. The feelings are terrifying and real seeming.\u201dAt the age of 21, Enninful told his mother he was gay, and was thankful for her reaction. Eventually, he writes, his father \u201ccame around\u201d to the idea of him being gay.\u201cI was extremely fortunate to have the mother I had,\u201d he writes. \u201cShe loved me - I knew that always - and when I eventually told her I was gay at the grand old age of 21, having returned to London after a romantic epiphany on a New York dance floor, there was no question of me being exiled by the family,\u201d he writes.But in London in the Eighties and Nineties, he says, others were not as \u201clucky\u201d as he was.\u201cI saw friends and relations in my community thrown out of their family homes. Meanwhile, the infamous AIDS adverts, with their looming tombstones and terrifying iceberg visuals, were everywhere. Gay London \u2013 gay life \u2013 felt like it teetered on a knife\u2019s edge.\u201d\u200bThroughout and beyond Pride month, British Vogue, under Enninful\u2019s leadership, will represent different LGBT+ stories, including pop star Janelle Monae, British-Australian actor Miriam Margoyles and The Last Of Us actor Bella Ramsey, exclusively revealed here by The Independent.Throughout Pride month, British Vogue will represent different LGBT+ stories, including Janelle Monae, British-Australian actor Miriam Margoyles, and Rina Sawayama.

That gender fluidity is not new,\u201d he says. \u201cThat the only difference now is that we are finally able to talk about it a bit more.\u201dRecommendedTyler James Williams warns fans against speculating over people\u2019s sexualityPregnant transgender man Logan Brown stars on cover of Glamour UK\u2019s Pride issue\u2018Unsupportive backgrounds\u2019 make LGBT+ youth twice as likely to have suicidal thoughts \u2013 report findsIn recent months, Enninful has released a memoir, A Visible Man, sharing how as a Black, gay, working-class refugee, he found solace in fashion.The Independent is the official news partner of Pride in London.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticePolice in Northern Ireland have issued an apology to a group known as the Hooded Men who were subjected to controversial interrogation techniques in the 1970s.It came after the Supreme Court ruled in December that the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) was wrong not to investigate allegations of torture.The 14\u00a0Hooded\u00a0Men\u00a0were subjected to a series of controversial interrogation techniques by the Army and police when they were interned without trial in Northern Ireland in 1971.The techniques included hooding and being put in stress positions, forced to listen to white noise, and deprived of sleep, food and water.They were also thrown from helicopters that were hovering close to the ground, having been told the aircraft were hundreds of feet in the air.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveThe European Court of Human Rights previously ruled that, while the\u00a0men\u00a0suffered inhumane and degrading treatment, it fell short of torture.The PSNI took the case to the UK\u2019s highest court after failing in\u00a0Belfast\u2019s\u00a0Court of Appeal to overturn a High Court ruling that found the police should revisit the decision to end the investigation into the treatment of the\u00a0men.Representatives of the men had a private meeting with senior police officers in Belfast on Tuesday.They received the apology during this meeting at Garnerville.In the apology the PSNI said: \u201cWe would like to convey an apology to you for the actions and omissions of police officers at that time\u201d.The PSNI also acknowledge the findings of the United Kingdom Supreme Court that, by today\u2019s standards, the treatment of these men at that time would likely be characterised as tortureIt has also emerged that an apology was hand-delivered to one of the Hooded Men, Joe Clarke, on his death bed last Thursday by his solicitor. He died four days later on Monday.Darragh Mackin, of Phoenix Law, who acts for the majority of the Hooded Men including Mr Clarke, said the apology comes after a 10-year campaign for justice.\u201cSince their landmark victory before the Supreme Court in December 2021, we have engaged at the very highest level to try and find a resolution for our clients,\u201d he said.\n\nThis is a seismic development in a seismic caseDarren Mackin, Phoenix Law\u201cThe publication of this apology comes after weeks of intense negotiation which drew to a close in the days before Mr Joe Clarke tragically passed away. In the last days of his life, Mr Clarke was finally delivered closure in the form of an apology, for which he had long since campaigned,\u201d he said.\u201cThis is a seismic development in a seismic case.\u201dMr Mackin said that as the issue of how to tackle Northern Ireland\u2019s troubled past is debated, the case of the Hooded Men can be pointed to as \u201cthe pin-up of due process, humanity and resolution coming together under one umbrella\u201d.\u201cThis case is an example of why the efforts by the British Government to brush the legacy of the past under the carpet will never, and can never, work,\u201d he said.\u201cTribute ought to be paid to those at the upper echelons of the Police Service of Northern Ireland and in particular Assistant Chief Constable Alan Todd and head of Legacy Branch Ian Saunders who, despite the sensitivities, engaged in an extensive negotiation and, against all odds, ensured the delivery of an apology before the passing of Mr Clarke. Today, those efforts must be acknowledged and appreciated in what is truly a landmark development.\u201dMr Mackin paid tribute to Mr Clarke as a \u201clarger-than-life character who had unrivalled generosity and charisma\u201d.\u201cThis apology is a testament to that character and tenacity, in demonstrating that where there is a will, there is always a way,\u201d he added.\n\nToday proves nobody is above the lawDarragh Mackin, Phoenix LawHowever, he urged that the Government and Ministry of Defence also issue an apology.\u201cToday proves nobody is above the law,\u201d he said.Meanwhile, former Hooded Men Liam Shannon and Jim Auld described the apology from the police as \u201ctoo little, too late\u201d.In a statement they also called for an apology from Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and the UK Government.\u201cThis apology in some ways is too little, too late. It ought to have been delivered long before now and is only coming on the back of latest legal challenges against the police over their failure to investigate the criminality of the State,\u201d they said.\u201cWe see this as another step on the road to vindication.\u201cWe now call upon the PSNI to remove their objection to our judicial review challenge listed in a few weeks\u2019 time.\n\nWe also now call upon the State to withdraw its insensitive attempt to stop our rightful claims for proper compensation for the horrendous treatment suffered by usFormer Hooded Men Liam Shannon and Jim Auld\u201cWe also now call upon the State to withdraw its insensitive attempt to stop our rightful claims for proper compensation for the horrendous treatment suffered by us.\u201cThis apology must be seen in its proper context. It will only have any real effect if it will be replicated in all outstanding legal cases and leads to the Government apologising as well. Otherwise it looks like the Government passing the buck and seen as hollow.\u201dIn a statement the PSNI expressed sympathy to the family of Mr Clarke.Detective Chief Superintendent Ian Saunders, head of\u00a0the Legacy Investigation & Disclosure Branch, said the police have written to a number of individuals and next of kin of deceased Hooded Men.\u201cIn this letter, we have acknowledged the findings of the United Kingdom Supreme Court that, by today\u2019s standards, the treatment of these men at that time would likely be characterised as torture,\u201d he said.RecommendedUK firms operating in Russia \u2018complicit in war crimes\u2019 against Ukraine, says MPState agencies accused of \u2018deliberately delaying\u2019 information release over deathWitnesses describe screams as two victims stabbed in deadly Nottingham attacks\u201cThe Police Service of Northern Ireland has formally apologised for the actions and omissions of police officers involved in their treatment whilst in police custody in 1971.\u201cThe Police Service recognise the significant step taken today in issuing this apology.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe UK Covid-19 Inquiry opened its first public hearing on 13 June in London, beginning a three-year investigation into the British government\u2019s response to the coronavirus pandemic.The inquiry will seek to understand the decision-making that led to the imposition of strict lockdown measures on the public, how our evolving understanding of the virus guided policy, what the government got right and what mistakes were made, with a view to being better prepared for future pandemics and public health emergencies.When then-prime minister Boris Johnson announced the first \u201cstay at home\u201d order on 23 March 2020, British citizens came together in a rare moment of national unity, for the most part, diligently adhering to social restrictions introduced to help stop the spread of the contagious respiratory disease.That meant living in isolation from friends, family and colleagues, working from home, wearing face masks and standing apart in public and, in many cases, battling Covid symptoms in hospital or in quarantine amid an atmosphere of intense loneliness and anxiety.But the legacy of that brave response has been tarnished in the intervening years by the \u201cPartygate\u201d scandal that subsequently engulfed Mr Johnson\u2019s government, which has left many, particularly those grieving lost loved ones, feeling betrayed, embittered and in search of answers.RecommendedWatch live: Covid inquiry hears evidence on first day of investigationUK may \u2018not have been well prepared at all\u2019 for pandemic, Covid inquiry hearsCovid inquiry will be the thorough investigation the UK deserves, chair vowsBereaved families hold pictures of loved ones in vigil outside Covid inquiryCovid inquiry to look at Brexit impact on pandemicBy pouring over hundreds of documents, scrutinising the details and hearing testimony on all aspects of the UK\u2019s response to a global disaster that claimed more than 227,000 British lives, the inquiry hopes to draw clear conclusions and perhaps provide a degree of closure for those traumatised or in mourning.Here is everything you need to know about its upcoming hearings.Who is chairing the inquiry?Mr Johnson first announced the inquiry in May 2021. It was established and is being paid for by the government but is being run by an independent chair.That is Baroness Heather Hallett, a retired Court of Appeal judge and crossbench peer, who led the inquests into the Islamist terror attacks on London on 7 July 2005.She will oversee the process, from the hearings to the publication of final reports and has the power to order the production of documents and call witnesses to give evidence under oath.But Baroness Hallett has already run into trouble by demanding Mr Johnson and members of his former Cabinet hand over their private WhatsApp messages from 2020 to the inquiry, which has been resisted by the PM\u2019s successor, Rishi Sunak, and sparked an awkward legal battle.UK Covid-19 Inquiry chair Baroness Heather Hallett (UK Covid-19 Inquiry/PA)The Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group, which has almost 7,000 members, has also complained of feeling marginalised by Baroness Hallett after putting forward a list of 20 people it wanted to appear as witnesses, none of whom have been called so far.However, a spokeswoman for the inquiry said the chair \u201chas been clear she hasn\u2019t ruled out calling testimony from bereaved people in later investigations, for example with the use of do not resuscitate orders\u201d.The group\u2019s members congregated outside the inquiry\u2019s first public hearing on Tuesday to hold aloft pictures of lost loved ones and make their feelings abundantly clear.What format will the inquiry take?The hearings are taking place at the UK Covid-19 Inquiry Hearing Centre at Dorland House in west London and they are open to the public. You can find out more about reserving seats via the inquiry\u2019s official website.Tuesday\u2019s session began with an opening statement from Baroness Hallett vowing that those who suffered will \u201calways be at the heart of the inquiry\u201d. It was followed by a 17-minute film presenting bereaved families telling their stories of the pandemic, which was billed beforehand as \u201cdifficult to watch\u201d.The process is being divided into \u201cmodules\u201d, each of which will last approximately six weeks and be devoted to a different aspect of the UK\u2019s Covid experience in loosely chronological order.The National Covid Memorial Wall in London (Yui Mok/PA)The first is on Britain\u2019s preparedness for the pandemic while the second concerns government decision-making as the outbreak took hold and is subdivided into additional chapters looking at how the response in England compared to the decisions taken by the devolved governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.The third module will look at the impact the crisis had on the NHS and how prepared the UK\u2019s health sector was to tackle its onset and the fourth at the handling of the vaccine rollout from December 2020 onwards.Further modules, about which more details are expected closer to the time, are set to address other important aspects of the pandemic. This includes the impact on the care sector, the government\u2019s approach to awarding contracts for the production of personal protective equipment, how the state approached its responsibilities to the economy and how Covid\u2019s impact on communities was dictated by pre-existing social inequalities.What questions will it attempt to answer?Among the key lines of inquiry the hearings are expected to pursue are: how might Britain better protect its citizens when the next pandemic rolls around, did the UK\u2019s social restrictions become too complex and confusing and what more should have been done to support children who missed out on months of schooling and other crucial opportunities because of quarantine rules?It might also tackle questions such as how lockdowns can be avoided in the future and how staffing shortages within the NHS can be addressed.Who will give evidence?No full list of witnesses has been published so far, although senior government ministers and officials are widely expected to give evidence under oath.The likes of Sir Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK government\u2019s chief medical adviser and chief scientific adviser respectively during the pandemic, are likely to appear.Meanwhile, members of the public are being encouraged to share their own experiences of Covid as part of the inquiry\u2019s Every Story Matters project.How can I follow the inquiry\u2019s progress?RecommendedRishi Sunak to meet King Charles as Truss defends her record - liveJohnson was \u2018begging people for votes\u2019 in a \u2018demeaning\u2019 way, says IDSWelcome, PM Sunak \u2013 the last best option to take over from TrussThe Independent will be bringing you all the latest breaking news lines and analysis\u00a0from the\u00a0UK Covid-19 Inquiry.

It is understood that he has a mental health history.Unverified footage showed a man being detained outside a convenience store in Bentinck Road at around 5.30am on Tuesday.Student Demi Ojolow, who lives in the road, said: \u201cI just saw the police shouting at him to get out of the car and get on the floor.\u201cAnd they dragged him out of the car and he just fell on the floor. He was still pretty wrestling at the point.\u201cThey dragged him away and that was about it.\u201dMs Ojolow said police were pointing some kind of weapons at the man but she was not sure whether it was a Taser or firearm.Damage could be seen to the bonnet and windscreen of the van which was left at the scene.Road closures have been put in place covering a wide area of Nottingham city centre, including Ilkeston Road, Milton Street, Maples Street and Woodborough Road, from the junction with Magdala Road into the city, Magdala Road and Maid Marian Way at the junction of Parliament Street.The tram network was also disrupted with all services suspended on the Nottingham Express Transit (NET) as the police investigation continued.Nottinghamshire Chief Constable Kate Meynell said: \u201cThis is a horrific and tragic incident which has claimed the lives of three people.\u201cWe believe these three incidents are all linked and we have a man in custody.\u201cThis investigation is at its early stages and a team of detectives is working to establish exactly what has happened.\u201cWe ask the public to be patient while inquiries continue.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeA man who admitted being in charge of two American bulldogs which mauled an elderly woman to death in her own garden has been jailed for nearly five years.Darren Pritchard, 44, was sentenced on Tuesday after earlier pleading guilty to owning two dangerously out of control dogs, possessing cannabis with intent to supply, and producing the drug at an address in the street in Rowley Regis, West Midlands, where Lucille Downer was pronounced dead.Wolverhampton Crown Court heard that Pritchard\u2019s 85-year-old next-door neighbour, who had dementia, suffered fatal injuries to her neck when she was attacked by the dogs, which are legal to own in the UK, on the afternoon of April 2 2021.Howard Searle, prosecuting, told the court that Pritchard was at work when the animals got into Mrs Downer\u2019s garden through a hole in the fence and started \u201cmauling\u201d her, leaving her with deep wounds to her left leg and the left side of her neck.Neighbours reported hearing screaming and thought Mrs Downer may have fallen so, along with the pensioner\u2019s daughter who lived nearby and cared for her mother, went to her house, where they found one of the dogs attacking her.Mr Searle said: \u201cOne of the dogs held her by the neck and dragged her from side to side. The dog was mauling and pulling Mrs Downer. The other dog had blood around its mouth, suggesting a joint attack.\u201dThe neighbours and Mrs Downer\u2019s daughter had to retreat inside the house and block the door with a wheelie bin, while a neighbour tried to distract the animals with dog biscuits.The court also heard that paramedics could not help Mrs Downer until Pritchard himself returned home and got the dogs away from her.When Pritchard was arrested and his house searched, police discovered bags of cannabis with an estimated street value of just under \u00a320,000, as well as 10 to 12 cannabis plants in the loft and around \u00a335,000 in bundles of cash.Neighbours had previously witnessed Pritchard hitting one of the dogs \u201crepeatedly\u201d on one occasion, and \u201cgoading\u201d one of the animals while it was on a rope leash on another, Mr Searle told the court.Another neighbour reportedly informed the RSPCA after seeing the dogs left outside in the cold.During a police interview, Pritchard said he kept the dogs in the house and did not muzzle them because he did not think they were aggressive. He accepted that the dogs had escaped into neighbouring gardens before.Defending Pritchard, Morgan Pirone said the defendant was \u201cunder no illusions\u201d that he would be going to prison and was remorseful for what had happened.He said: \u201cOn April 2 2021, his actions destroyed the Downer family. Nothing can repair the damage he has done. He knew Mrs Downer for seven years. He cannot forget or forgive himself for what happened.\u201dSentencing Pritchard, who wore black jeans, a black T-shirt and black trainers and carried a holdall into the dock with him, Judge Michael Chambers KC said Mrs Downer was the victim of a \u201cdreadful and sustained attack\u201d.\n\nWhat occurred was entirely foreseeableJudge Michael Chambers KC, Wolverhampton Crown CourtHe said: \u201cOnly a matter of weeks previously, the dogs had escaped into another neighbour\u2019s garden. What occurred was entirely foreseeable. Lucille Downer was an 85-year-old lady who lived a much-respected and long life.\u201cFor anyone to die in such circumstances is truly tragic, but, suffering from dementia, she must have found this most shocking and upsetting.\u201cShe was entitled to feel protected in her own garden, but the dogs forced their way through the fence and mauled her. You left them free to roam.\u201cNo-one was able to get near them until you returned home and intervened. It is a measure of their ferocity and the injuries were dreadful.\u201dPritchard was jailed for 45 months for the offence under the Dangerous Dogs Act and for 12 months for drug offences, to run consecutively.He was ordered to serve half of the sentence in prison and the second half on licence.West Midlands Police have previously said the dogs were humanely destroyed after the incident."}, {"_id": "64889c4051ac339fc372a9eb", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/conservative-caroline-nokes-diana-johnson-rishi-sunak-government-b2356612.html", "primaryCategory": "Crime", "subCategories": "test", "title": "No plans for abortion law reforms following backlash over jailed mother", "lead": "Carla Foster was given a 28-month sentence after using abortion pills when she was between 32 and 34 weeks pregnant.", "author": "David Hughes", "datePublished": "Tue, 13 Jun 2023 12:30:39 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:41:36.847101", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-13T12:30:39+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/13/13/13132415-72ab144b-7642-408b-a198-489bf7aeb6de.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

I think that makes a case for Parliament to start looking at this issue in detailCaroline NokesAbortions are generally only legal before 24 weeks and are carried out in clinics after 10 weeks of pregnancy.Dame Diana Johnson, the chair of the Commons Home Affairs Committee, urged the Government to \u201cstep up\u201d and decriminalise abortions so women cannot be jailed in such cases.Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court heard Foster was sent the drugs by the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) after she lied about how far along in her pregnancy she was during 2020\u2019s pandemic lockdown.The prosecution said Foster made a number of internet searches between February and May 2020, including \u201chow to hide a pregnancy bump\u201d, \u201chow to have an abortion without going to the doctor\u201d and \u201chow to lose a baby at six months\u201d.Foster was initially charged with child destruction and pleaded not guilty.She later pleaded guilty to an alternative charge of section 58 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861, administering drugs or using instruments to procure abortion, which was accepted by the prosecution.The sentencing on Monday has prompted a backlash.Ms Nokes told BBC Radio 4\u2019s The World Tonight programme: \u201cThis is not something that has been debated in any great detail for many years now.\u201cAnd cases like this, although tragic and fortunately very rare, do throw into stark relief that we are reliant on legislation that is very, very out of date.\u201cI think that makes a case for Parliament to start looking at this issue in detail.\u201dDame Diana said both society and healthcare have \u201cmoved on\u201d since the existing abortion laws were put in place.The Labour MP told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cI think Parliament has a role now to look at reforming our abortion laws. There\u2019s no other country in the world, as I understand it, that would criminalise a woman in this way.\u201cThe Government should step up and say we should decriminalise, we should reform abortion law, take the criminal law out of this, but that doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t have regulation.\u201dBut Downing Street said there were no plans to change abortion laws or sentencing guidelines.The Prime Minister\u2019s official spokesman said: \u201cThrough the Abortion Act, all women have access to safe abortions on the NHS up to 24 weeks and we have made changes so that now includes taking abortion pills at home.\u201cWe think this approach provides the right balance and \u2026 there are no plans to change this.\u201dThe spokesman added: \u201cWe recognise that this is a highly emotive issue and obviously we recognise that the strength of feeling on all sides.\u201dFormer chief crown prosecutor for the North West Nazir Afzal argued it was not in the public interest to prosecute the mother of three.Citing public feeling towards laws restricting abortions and her mitigating factors, he told Today: \u201cHad I been involved, had I been doing this particular case, I would not have prosecuted it.\u201cThis whole terrible event took place during the pandemic and people were making some terrible choices during that period that perhaps they regret now.

It is unimaginable to consider the fear and distress Alfie must have felt during the events that led to his collapse and death in his home on the morning of 18 February 2021. \u201cThe physical violence he suffered at the hands of Scott and Howell, which involved being forced into a cold bath and his head held under water, caused his death.\u201cThe court heard evidence of a culture of excessive punishment of Alfie by Scott and Howell. Punishment amounted to beating Alfie with a belt and a slider until he was black and blue with bruising.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThere was a \u201cwholesale loss and destruction\u201d of evidence in the 1994 murder of Rikki Neave, the Court of Appeal has heard as the man jailed for the killing challenged his conviction.The murder of the six-year-old, who was strangled to death in woods near Peterborough, was among the most high-profile cold cases on police files until DNA was identified on the victim\u2019s clothes following a re-examination of the case two decades later.James Watson, 42, who was 13 at the time of the killing, denied murder but was found guilty by a jury and sentenced to life with a minimum term of 15 years at the Old Bailey in June last year.He appeared at the Court of Appeal in London on Tuesday via video link from Wakefield prison to challenge his conviction.Jennifer Dempster KC, for Watson, told the court there had been a \u201ctotal disregard\u201d towards preserving exhibits in the case.She said: \u201cThe reality we submit was that this was a wholesale loss and destruction of evidence, so much so that a fair trial of this applicant is no longer possible.\u201cIt closed down completely any opportunity for the defence to explore the potential of other suspects.\u201dThe barrister described how the wheelie bin where Rikki\u2019s clothes were found was \u201clast seen\u201d in an underground car park before it went missing, preventing the ability to search it for DNA or fingerprint evidence.Ms Dempster continued: \u201cIt is the developments in DNA technology that have taken place that enabled the Crown to bring this applicant to trial, but it is those very same advances in technology that the applicant has been completely deprived of.\u201dHowever, John Price KC, for the Crown, told the hearing that there was no evidence that Watson\u2019s case had been affected.He said: \u201cThe applicant failed to demonstrate that there was any prejudice caused to him by the loss of the material that has been identified.\u201cIf there was\u2026 we do not accept that it was not capable of being ameliorated in the usual way.\u201dMr Price added: \u201cThe loss of a speculative position is not prejudice.\u201dAt the end of the hearing, Lord Justice Holroyde, sitting with Mr Justice Morris and Judge Angela Morris, said they would give their decision in writing at a later date.\u201cWe will do it as soon as we can,\u201d the judge said."}, {"_id": "64889c4151ac339fc372a9ee", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/jon-moss-boy-george-culture-club-burton-london-b2356607.html", "primaryCategory": "Crime", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Culture Club members given more time to sort \u00a31.75m debt amid bankruptcy bid", "lead": "Boy George and bassist Michael Craig are in debt to former drummer Jon Moss after a previous court ruling.", "author": "Tom Pilgrim", "datePublished": "Tue, 13 Jun 2023 12:14:37 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:41:37.520232", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-13T12:14:37+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/13/13/abe0991cc1b9f29b99af4729139bb2e9Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg2NzQwODQz-2.21255449.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeCulture club singer Boy George and the group\u2019s bassist Michael Craig have been given more time to try and avoid a bankruptcy bid brought against them by former bandmate Jon Moss over a \u00a31.75 million debt from a legal dispute.Boy George \u2013 whose real name is George O\u2019Dowd \u2013 and Mr Craig are both in debt to Culture Club\u2019s ex-drummer after a judge previously ordered Mr Moss should be paid \u00a31.75 million by the band as part of a resolved battle over the group\u2019s profits.A hearing at a specialist court in London on Tuesday was told that Mr Moss is bringing bankruptcy petitions against Boy George and Mr Craig in relation to the judge\u2019s ruling in March.Insolvency and Companies Court judge Catherine Burton was asked by Hugh Miall, lawyer for Boy George and Mr Craig, to adjourn the hearing so that creditors could consider proposals for an Individual Voluntary Agreement (IVA) \u2013 a formal agreement which lets people repay debts in a bid to avoid bankruptcy.Amanda Hadkiss, for Mr Moss, and Edoardo Lupi, representing the IVA nominees, did not oppose the adjournment.Judge Burton ordered that the next hearing in the case should be on June 27.Tuesday\u2019s short proceedings, at which no band members were present, comes after a High Court battle between Mr Moss and his ex-bandmates over the group\u2019s profits was resolved a week before trial.The drummer, a founding member of the group, had previously brought legal action against Boy George, guitarist Roy Hay and Mr Craig, after allegedly being \u201cexpelled\u201d by their manager in September 2018 after 37 years playing together.A six-day trial was due to start in late March to determine the value of the Culture Club name, the profits made by the band since Mr Moss\u2019s alleged expulsion, and the amount he might be entitled to receive.But a court order issued on March 21 said that the group had agreed that a judgment should be made in favour of Mr Moss, with his ex-bandmates required to pay him \u00a31.75 million immediately.The order approved by Mrs Justice Joanna Smith said that Mr Moss had agreed to \u201crelinquish\u201d any right to the Culture Club name and its use, including in connection with concerts and merchandise.The High Court previously heard that the band had settled a dispute over whether there was a \u201ccontinuing partnership\u201d since the formation of Culture Club \u2013 a group best known for hits such as Do You Really Want To Hurt Me and Karma Chameleon \u2013 with Boy George, Mr Hay and Mr Craig conceding there was until Mr Moss\u2019s departure.The abandoned trial over the outstanding issues of the group\u2019s value and profits was also due to cover Mr Moss\u2019s additional claim to an \u201coutstanding balance\u201d of 246,000.17 dollars (\u00a3201,000) under the terms of a band agreement reached over the operation of its 2018 Life Tour.Boy George, Mr Craig and Mr Hay were all previously defending the claims.Last year, the court was told that Mr Moss was amending his legal challenge to include allegations that Boy George \u201cconspired to defraud\u201d him over the Life Tour money, after he learnt that funds were released to a US company, You Give Me Life, Inc (YGML), following the settlement of legal proceedings in America in January 2021.YGML and another English company, Other Places Drama LLP (OPD) \u2013 both said to be Boy George\u2019s personal service companies \u2013 had brought proceedings against Agency for the Performing Arts (APA) in California claiming to be entitled to the money it held.Mr Moss had originally launched litigation seeking a court declaration that the outstanding balance money was being held for him by APA, acting as his agent.The drummer claimed that Boy George, YGML and/or OPD, were allegedly in breach of the \u201cdeal memo\u201d that he said meant each band member would receive a fee of 600,000 dollars (\u00a3491,000) for up to 80 concerts on the Life Tour.Boy George previously accused Mr Moss of making a \u201cpersonal attack on me\u201d and \u201cthe most unfounded and hurtful allegations\u201d, which were \u201centirely untrue\u201d."}, {"_id": "64889c4251ac339fc372a9ef", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/hull-crown-court-east-yorkshire-b2356598.html", "primaryCategory":

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeA woman stabbed her husband in the heart with a kitchen knife during an argument while she was preparing their tea, prosecutors have told a jury.Teresa Hanson is on trial at Hull Crown Court, accused of murdering Paul Hanson three days after Christmas last year.Jurors were told the 54-year-old stabbed her husband in the kitchen of their home in the East Yorkshire village of West Cowick.She told 999 call operators she had stabbed him after a row, but later told police Mr Hanson had effectively walked onto the knife when he unexpectedly turned towards her while she was cooking.Hanson called emergency services at 7.05pm on December 28 and told the ambulance operator she and her husband had had an argument and that she had \u201caccidentally\u201d stabbed him, prosecutor Alistair MacDonald KC told the court.After being arrested on suspicion of murder, Hanson said her husband had been \u201cverbally and mentally abusive\u201d towards her during the marriage, and that this had got worse since he suffered a brain injury about 10 years ago.In a pre-prepared statement, she said Mr Hanson had approached her \u201cin a bad mood\u201d and was shouting at her while she was preparing their evening meal.Hanson said that as Mr Hanson came straight at her, she turned towards him with the knife still in her hand, jurors heard.She claimed she did not realise it had penetrated his body until she heard the dog barking and saw a trail of blood on the floor leading towards her husband, who had collapsed.Jurors heard that during her first call to emergency services, Hanson was asked who had stabbed her husband, and she replied: \u201cJust out of anger.\u201dShe went on to say: \u201cWe was having a row. I didn\u2019t mean to.\u201dMr MacDonald said that in a second 999 call, Hanson said: \u201cWe had an argument and I had \u2026 I was cutting, cooking tea and he told me to f*** off and I\u2019m a bitch so I just like, I don\u2019t know what I did.\u201dThe court heard ambulance staff were unable to save Mr Hanson\u2019s life and he was \u201ceffectively dead on arrival\u201d at Hull Royal Infirmary that evening.Jurors were told the knife had gone into Mr Hanson\u2019s chest at \u201cabout the level of the nipples\u201d and cut through the chest cavity into his heart.When police arrived at her house, Hanson told them \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to do it, it was just an argument. I was making f****** tea\u201d, Mr Macdonald said.In her pre-prepared statement to officers the next day, Hanson said her husband was \u201cverbally and mentally abusive\u201d and that this was \u201cworse when he drinks\u201d.She said she had been in the kitchen preparing a meal when Mr Hanson came into the kitchen in \u201ca bad mood\u201d.\u201cThis normally happens when I mention his drinking,\u201d she said.\u201cHe came alongside me shouting. I turned towards him with the knife in my hand, not in a threatening way.\u201cI had no idea when he walked towards me he came straight at me and the knife went straight into him.\u201d\n\nIt is, of course, theoretically possible for someone to fall or run onto a knife blade and thereby cause a serious injury but such injuries are extremely rareProsecutor Alistair MacDonald KCMr MacDonald said Hanson refused to answer any further questions from police, but that pathologist Dr Michael Parsons was asked to look at her account of what had happened.The prosecutor said: \u201cIt is, of course, theoretically possible for someone to fall or run onto a knife blade and thereby cause a serious injury but such injuries are extremely rare.\u201cSecond, the height at which this happened is difficult to understand on the defendant\u2019s case.\u201cShe is 155cm tall whereas the stab wound entered Mr Hanson\u2019s body 129cm above (\u2026) the ground.\u201cThe knife would have had to have been held very firmly by Mrs Hanson in order for it to have penetrated his chest as it did and without just slipping off his chest and or falling out of her hand before it went into his chest tissues.\u201cDr Parsons has considered scientific research on this issue and has concluded that it is, in his opinion, highly unlikely that Mr Hanson simply walked on to a weakly grasped knife blade so as to cause a fatal stab wound of the type found in this case.\u201dMr MacDonald added: \u201cAlthough Mrs Hanson told the police that her husband could be bad-tempered when he had had a drink, and that he had been drinking that night, she was quite clear that she did not stab her husband because he had been abusive to her.\u201cHer case was quite clearly put on the basis that this was a terrible accident.\u201dHanson denies murder and the trial continues."}, {"_id": "64889c4251ac339fc372a9f0", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/drop-culture-war-battles-penny-mordaunt-tells-tories-b2356118.html", "primaryCategory": "UK Politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Drop culture war battles, Penny Mordaunt tells Tories", "lead": "<p>Party must focus on \u2018building more and taxing less\u2019, says cabinet minister</p>", "author": "Adam Forrest", "datePublished": "Tue, 13 Jun 2023 12:03:20 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:41:38.442784", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-13T12:03:20+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/08/13/1da59af4b996c0322f0bbdf2a49b4011Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg2MzEwOTIy-2.70603318.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up for the View from Westminster email for expert analysis straight to your inboxGet our free View from Westminster email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

The inquest began in March.The proceedings are taking place against the backdrop of a proposed controversial Government Bill on the legacy of the Northern Ireland Troubles.An amendment to the draft legislation, introduced by the Government last week, stated that all ongoing legacy inquests, other than those at the point of verdict, will cease on May 1 2024.A number of nationalist politicians, including Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O\u2019Neill and SDLP MLA Matthew O\u2019Toole were at the Royal Courts of Justice in Belfast to support the Brown family during the review hearing.Counsel for the coroner Joseph Aiken KC told the hearing that it had been planned to hold two days of evidence in the inquest this week.However, he said this had not been possible due to the size of the witness schedule, pointing out that there were 420 potential witnesses in the case.He then updated the court on disclosure issues around outstanding sensitive and non-sensitive material about Mr Brown\u2019s death from the PSNI and Ministry of Defence.Mr Aiken then set out a timetable, agreed by the coroner, for when the process of handing over the outstanding material should be completed over the coming months.Mr Aiken said the full inquest would resume on January 8 2024 for four consecutive weeks of hearing and would conclude by February 2.\n\nI can't allow the internal processes, however difficult they are, to dictate the path of this inquestMr Justice KinneyPSNI barrister Mark Robinson said that a public immunity interest (PII) process was to be carried out and said it should be \u201cconducted properly\u201d.He told the court that he believed that dates imposed within the agenda \u201ccannot be met\u201d.Coroner Mr Justice Kinney said: \u201cThe fact is this is a matter where we are not at a standing start today looking at this process.\u201cThis has been a process that has apparently been under way in some form for almost a year and what I am being told today still seems to remain that process that will dictate the timetable even though that process is opaque.\u201cI can\u2019t allow the internal processes, however difficult they are, to dictate the path of this inquest.\u201dHe added: \u201cIn short, a best endeavour submission today is not sufficient and it will not cut the mustard.

Hugo Keith KC says UK may not have been prepared for pandemic  (Covid 19 Inquiry)\"The plan stated that the United Kingdom was well prepared to respond in a way that offered substantial protection to the public. Whether that was actually the case will be examined in module one.\"Even at this stage before hearing the evidence it is apparent that we might not have been very well prepared at all.\"Mr Keith said the inquiry would look at whether health inequalities contributed to the UK death toll and levels of hospitalisation.\"Did the high levels of heart disease, diabetes, respiratory illness and obesity render us more vulnerable?\u201d he said. \u201cHad there been a slowdown in health improvement in the decade before? Had health inequalities widened?\u201dVery little thought given to impact of lockdownsMr Keith said there was \u201cvery little thought\u201d given to the impact lockdowns could have on the country.\"Extraordinary though it may seem, given that it\u2019s a word that\u2019s forever seared in the nation\u2019s consciousness, there was very little debate pre-pandemic of whether a lockdown might prove to be necessary in the event of a runaway virus, let alone how a lockdown could be avoided.\"Very little thought was given to how, if it proved to be necessary, how something as complex, difficult and damaging as a national lockdown could be put in place at all.\"Equally, there appears to have been a failure to think through the potentially massive impact on education and on the economy in trying to control a runaway virus in this way.\"Mr Keith also questioned whether past experiences could have led to complacency in planning.He added: \"Was there an element of complacency based on our recent experiences, including the ranking in the Global Health Security Index? Or our response to swine flu in 2009 and the UK\u2019s undoubted successes in ensuring Sars and Mers did not spread?\"Did our experience of the 2009 swine flu lead to concerns about overreacting?\"Brexit could have \u2018crowded out\u2019 planning for pandemicHugo Keith KC suggested to the Covid inquiry that preparing for Brexit \"crowded out and prevented\" the work that was needed to improve pandemic preparedness.He said: \"The pandemic struck the United Kingdom just as it was leaving the European Union.\"That departure required an enormous amount of planning and preparation, particularly to address what were likely to be the severe consequences of a no-deal exit on food and medicine supplies, travel and transport, business borders and so on.\"It is clear that such planning, from 2018 onwards, crowded out and prevented some or perhaps a majority of the improvements that central government itself understood were required to be made to resilience planning and preparedness.\"Did the attention therefore paid to the risks of a no-deal exit - Operation Yellowhammer as it was known - drain the resources and capacity that should have been continuing the fight against the next pandemic, that should have been utilised in preparing the United Kingdom for civil emergency?Evidence likely to show \u2018chaos\u2019 in governmentEvidence is likely to show a lack of responsibility in government and \"chaos\" which led to a slow reaction to a pandemic where \"lost time is measured in lost lives\", the Covid inquiry has been told.Pete Weatherby KC, of Covid Bereaved Families for Justice UK, said: \"The families expect the evidence will show a lack of responsibility in Government for civil emergency preparedness, with little or no ministerial leadership and the chaos of committees which led to poor planning and ultimately a reactive rather than proactive response to the virus.\"We anticipate the evidence will show that the most fundamental consequence of this was a slow reaction. And with a pandemic, time is of the essence and lost time is measured in lost lives.\"Welsh government response criticised The Welsh government\u2019s response to the pandemic has come under fire from the barrister representing bereaved families at the UK Covid-19 Inquiry.Kirsten Heaven, addressing the inquiry on behalf of The Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice Cymru, said the people of Wales are still feeling \"trauma due to the devastation caused by Covid-19\" and feel \"let down\" by government.She added: \"They have experienced first-hand what they consider to be the catastrophic failure of the Welsh government to adequately prepare for and respond to a pandemic in Wales.\"Unlike Scotland, Wales has not been granted its own inquiry and Ms Heaven said the families of the bereaved are \"very disappointed\" in \"what they consider to be an inadequate response\" to the probe by the Welsh government.She said the families were \"frankly shocked by the brevity and lack of detail\" of witness statements submitted by the Welsh government and its advisers to module one of the UK inquiry.Ms Heaven added: \"It also appears very disappointing that in some quarters there appears to be a reluctance by certain ministers to take political responsibility for failures to prepare for a pandemic in Wales.\"This inquiry is the only opportunity the people of Wales will have to ensure there is proper scrutiny on the decisions of the Welsh government and their advisers.\"The people of Wales want answers. They are also looking for accountability and for failures to be acknowledged so that lessons can be learned.\"NHS England failed to prepare PPE stocks, BMA lawyer saysFailures of planning and preparation for personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare staff \"led to the ludicrous spectacle of doctors making aprons from bin liners\" during the pandemic, the official Covid-19 Inquiry has heard.Brian Stanton, lawyer for the British Medical Association, listed the ways in which medical workers had to improvise due to the lack of adequate protective clothing.He said: \"The fact that in March 2020 NHS England assured the health and social care committee that there was sufficient supply of PPE nationally, despite stocks containing less than two weeks\u2019 worth of most equipment, suggests serious failures of planning and preparation.\"Frontline staff often had to go without PPE, buy their own, use homemade, donated or expired items, and reuse single-use items.

What\u2019s been a concern is getting the social media review to a point where it can be delivered flawlessly, and that is not easy.\u201dHe added that he is expecting the report back \u201cpretty soon\u201d.Earlier in the session, Mr Davie said the BBC doesn\u2019t always get its obligation to impartiality right, but it has had a \u201cgood year\u201d amid \u201cenormous pressure\u201d around the world for free press.He told MPs: \u201cAs editor in chief, my orders are very clear: we report without fear or favour with due impartiality.\u201cI\u2019ve never claimed we get it perfect all the time, and sometimes we don\u2019t get it right, but overall and the vast majority of occasions, I think we\u2019ve had a good year in maintaining impartiality in a world where there are fierce storms around us.\u201dDuring the session, Mr Davie confirmed he expected the investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct against DJ Tim Westwood to be completed in the \u201cnext couple of months\u201d, while being questioned on alleged bullying and harassment within the corporation.The director-general added that there is also an ongoing review into Top Gear as presenter Andrew \u201cFreddie\u201d Flintoff continues to recover from an accident which occurred during filming at the programme\u2019s test track at Dunsfold Aerodrome in December.Similarly, he addressed the row over cuts to local radio services, describing changes as \u201cvery difficult and unpopular\u201d but adding: \u201cLocal radio is precious.\u201dLast year, the BBC proposed plans for local radio stations to share more content and broadcast less programming.Mr Davie said: \u201cI believe we\u2019re doing the right thing in a situation in which we understand and are listening and have already made some adjustments to our plans to make sure we\u2019re making the right choices with very limited money.\u201dHe said he is \u201cempathetic\u201d to BBC journalists who are currently on strike because change it \u201cstressful\u201d and it has been a \u201cvery difficult time for people working in local radio\u201d.\u201cI\u2019ve been through restructures myself and it\u2019s not nice, so I understand it. I am utterly committed to BBC local growing for the long term,\u201d he said.BBC director of editorial policy and standards David Jordan and chief content officer Charlotte Moore were also at the scrutiny session.Asked about the future of chamber choir The BBC Singers, chief content officer Ms Moore told the select committee: \u201cWe are absolutely committed to our classical musical and performing group provision at the BBC,\u201d adding that they \u201cspend \u00a360 million annually on classical music\u201d.RecommendedWitnesses describe screams as two victims stabbed in deadly Nottingham attacksRobison appears to drop public sector staff shrinking policyLight aircraft crashes off South Wales coastThe broadcaster had previously announced plans to scrap its in-house chamber choir and reduce salaried orchestral posts across the BBC English Orchestras by around 20%.In April, it U-turned, and said it is committed to exploring \u201calternatives\u201d to cutting classical performer jobs at the corporation."}, {"_id": "64889c4351ac339fc372a9f6", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/government-experts-prime-rishi-sunak-joe-biden-b2356554.html", "primaryCategory": "UK Politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Starmer says UK needs to be prepared for \u2018rapid change\u2019 with AI", "lead": "The Labour leader said the UK could make a success of the AI revolution, but measures are needed to reskill workers.", "author": "David Hughes", "datePublished": "Tue, 13 Jun 2023 11:21:57 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:41:39.765271", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-13T11:21:57+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/13/12/629420d073ee41bb1db9281d2914b394Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg2NzM4MTkz-2.72360442.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up for the View from Westminster email for expert analysis straight to your inboxGet our free View from Westminster email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

I could be in a wheelchair by then.\u201dHe is taking on the challenge to raise funds and awareness for Muscular Dystrophy UK, the national charity that supports those with muscle wasting conditions.Earlier this year, Mr Stennett took part in the Marbella 70.3 half Ironman and the TCS London Marathon, with Ironman Austria to be his third major challenge in three months.Ahead of the ironman challenge, he said: \u201cLiving with a condition can be challenging.\u201cFSHD continues to sap my strength, but I remain strong-minded.\u201cCompleting the open water swim with front crawl is a small concern because the muscles in my core are weak and I struggle with snaking in the water when I\u2019m tired.\u201cI am a proficient breaststroke swimmer, so I have no doubt I will complete the swim, but by doing breaststroke I fatigue my legs before the cycle element even starts!\u201dKiera Santry, senior challenge events officer at Muscular Dystrophy UK, said: \u201cChris has an inspiring story \u2013 and he has not let his diagnosis stop him from taking on multiple challenge events, including running the London Marathon in April 2023 for the charity.\u201cWe\u2019re so grateful to Chris for his ongoing support.RecommendedStars pay tribute to actor Treat Williams after death in motorcycle accidentBereaved families hold pictures of loved ones in vigil outside Covid inquiryMost early-stage breast cancer patients will become long-term survivors \u2013 study\u201cThe funds raised will continue to help Muscular Dystrophy UK support people living with muscle-wasting conditions and fund further research and treatment.\u201dMr Stennett can be sponsored at https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/fshd-ironman2"}, {"_id": "64889c4651ac339fc372aa02", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/courts-mps-government-lord-chancellor-alex-chalk-b2356264.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Courts to gain powers to throw out lawsuits designed to silence critics", "lead": "Legal threats known as Slapps are often used by the rich and powerful to intimidate and financially exhaust opponents.", "author": "Sophie Wingate", "datePublished": "Tue, 13 Jun 2023 09:25:37 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:41:42.366119", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-13T09:25:37+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/13/00/7dc5dc9167a08edc36d4eb36a48106c8Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg2NjY2OTU5-2.72310993.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Thank you to everyone for your support \u2013 it really helps.\u201dFollow all the latest updates on The Independent\u2019s liveblogHere is a reminder of the events of the case.RecommendedMadeleine McCann news \u2013 latest: Soil from reservoir compared to samples from prime suspect\u2019s vanHow Madeleine McCann search at reservoir unfolded \u2013 and what police foundRead Madeleine McCann suspect Christian Brueckner\u2019s bombshell prison letters for the first timeThe story began when the McCanns \u2013 affluent doctors Kate and Gerry, their three-year-old daughter Madeleine and her two-year-old twin siblings Amelia and Sean \u2013 joined a group of seven family friends and their five children on holiday at the Ocean Club in the village of Praia da Luz on the southwestern tip of Portugal on 28 April 2007.After a pleasant spring break by the sea, the adults in the party went out for dinner at the resort\u2019s open-air tapas bar on 3 May, gathering at 8.30pm. The children were left behind sleeping in their respective apartments with the doors unlocked and a rota system in place among the parents to ensure that someone returned every half-hour to check on them.When Kate McCann took her turn and returned to her apartment at 10pm, she raced back to the restaurant screaming \u201cMadeleine\u2019s gone! Someone\u2019s taken her!\u201d The police were quickly called and 60 staff and fellow guests searched the complex, calling out the girl\u2019s name in vain until daybreak the following morning.Border police and airport staff were put on alert and hundreds of volunteers joined the efforts to find the missing girl over the coming days, the case fast becoming a sensation.The Portuguese authorities would later attract criticism over their conduct in the crucial earliest hours of the investigation when the trail might still have been warm, accused of making rudimentary mistakes like failing to conduct a house-by-house search of every local residence or interview all of the other guests at the resort, acting slowly to erect roadblocks and potentially compromising forensic evidence at the crime scene.Madeleine McCann (PA)The police initially stated that they believed Madeleine was still alive and had been abducted from the room by a stranger as the parents described their \u201canguish and despair\u201d over her vanishing, a worst fear realised for any parent.On 26 May, police issued a description of a suspicious man seen on the night of the girl\u2019s disappearance. The individual in question was spotted by Jane Tanner, one of the McCanns\u2019 dining companions, who said she had seen a Mediterranean man with dark hair and beige trousers carrying a child close to the apartment when she went to check in on her own children. Scotland Yard would later come to dismiss the sighting as a red herring.The search continued as the summer progressed amid a wild media circus and with huge fundraising activities underway, the McCanns setting up Madeleine\u2019s Fund on 15 May to raise cash to support further investigation and keep the profile of the case high, attracting generous donations from celebrities like Richard Branson, Simon Cowell, JK Rowling and Coleen Rooney. By 30 May, the case was such a cause celebre that they were being flown out to meet the Pope at the Vatican in Sir Phillip Green\u2019s Learjet.A local man, Robert Murat, subsequently became its first suspect and had his house and car searched, his swimming pool drained and his electronic devices confiscated but no evidence was found to link him to Madeleine and the matter was soon dropped.By June, the Portuguese police admitted that they had failed to protect potentially useful evidence at the scene as frustration with the lack of developments grew and the media began to question whether the McCanns themselves had been involved in the matter. Lurid tabloid allegations suggested the couple and their friends might have been swingers and that the McCanns, as physicians, might have been in the habit of sedating their children, while others claimed inconsistencies in their version of events.The intensity of the hostility towards the parents would later be described by Roy Greenslade of The Guardian as \u201cno journalistic accident, but a sustained campaign of vitriol against a grief-stricken family\u201d, singling out The Daily Express and Daily Star for particular condemnation.In July, assistance offered by former South African police officer Danie Krugel \u2013 who claimed his handheld \u201cmatter orientation system\u201d could help to find Madeleine \u2013 was rubbished, while British police sent over two springer spaniel sniffer dogs to search for DNA. Gerry and Kate McCann (PA)Relations with the local authorities would ultimately sour as the latter came to resent British intrusion into a Portuguese inquiry, according to Anthony Summers and Robbyn Swan\u2019s book Looking for Madeleine (2014).By August, Madeleine has been missing for 100 days and police admitted for the first time that she may never be found. They also told the McCanns that they were no longer considering the matter an abduction case but, rather, a murder inquiry.The McCanns themselves were interviewed as \u201carguidos\u201d (suspects) by Portuguese police in September, with the parents told that the dogs had discovered DNA evidence from the missing girl in the boot of their holiday rental car, lines of inquiry that had already been leaked to the British press. They vehemently denied having any part in her disappearance.Despite being listed as suspects (a designation that would linger until the following July), the McCanns were allowed to return to Britain on 9 September. A day later, chief inspector Tavares de Almeida of the Policia Judiciaria in Portimao signed a nine-page report concluding that Madeleine McCann had died in their apartment as a result of an accident, that the tapas dinner and rota checks on the McCann children had been part of a planned cover-up, that the family\u2019s friends had helped to mislead the police and that the McCanns had concealed the body and then faked an abduction. A public prosecutor subsequently applied for the confiscation of Kate McCann\u2019s diary and Gerry McCann\u2019s laptop plus the group\u2019s phone records.On 2 October, chief inspector Goncalo Amaral was removed from the case and transferred after alleging that the British police were only interested in pursuing leads favourable to the McCanns. He would later publish a book, Maddie: The Truth of the Lie, the following summer, resulting in a lengthy libel battle with the McCanns that would run back and forth through the courts until March 2017.Back in Britain, Gerry McCann issued a video that November in which he speculated that his family had been watched by a \u201cpredator\u201d during their stay at Praia da Luz. His wife had come to believe that a potential perpetrator could have seen a note in the resort\u2019s guest book visible to all in reception noting their dining arrangements on the evening of Madeleine\u2019s disappearance. The couple followed up on 20 January 2008 by releasing a sketch of a \u201ccreepy man\u201d they said other holidaymakers had said they had seen loitering at the Ocean Club.In April, a month before the one-year anniversary of the fateful night, Portuguese police travelled to Leicestershire to conduct further interviews with the McCanns\u2019 friends.RecommendedWhat happened to Madeleine McCann? Five possible scenarios as Netflix documentary releasedThen, on 21 July, Portugal\u2019s attorney general, Fernando Jose Pinto Monteiro, announced that there was no evidence to link either the McCanns or Robert Murat to the disappearance and closed the case, unsolved.With the trail cold and no closure in sight, the McCanns continued to publicise their cause, issuing computer-generated images of how Madeleine might look now that she had aged on 3 November 2009 and condemning the release of previously unseen Portuguese police files \u2013 detailing possible sightings of their daughter \u2013 to British newspapers in March 2010.The McCanns published a book of their own about their ordeal in May 2011, entitled simply Madeleine, which was serialised in The Sun as the newspaper led a campaign calling on British prime minister David Cameron to launch a new inquiry. He did so. Commenced by then-home secretary Theresa May, the Metropolitan Police\u2019s Operation Grange would be led by commander Simon Foy and comprise a team of three detective inspectors, five detective sergeants, 19 detective constables and six civilian staff.It began to yield results in 2013, with Scotland Yard formally announcing a new investigation in July and saying in October it had identified 41 potential suspects. That same month, BBC Crimewatch released an e-fit image of a man of particular interest who had been seen in Praia da Luz with a child matching Madeleine\u2019s description in May 2007.Detectives arrived in Portugal in January 2014 promising new arrests and finally searched the village in June, interviewing four people the following month but without unearthing new information. The quartet would be definitively ruled out in April 2017, before the UK government said it would continue to fund the investigation until 2020, having already admitted it had cost \u00a310m in its first four years of operation.That investment had enabled detectives to have tens of thousands of documents translated, investigate over 8,000 potential sightings, take 1,338 statements, collect 1,027 exhibits and investigate 650 sex offenders and 60 persons of interest, all without definitively establishing the truth.The Madeline McCann case lay dormant before suddenly exploding into life in June 2020 when German media revealed that Christian Brueckner, a 43-year-old prisoner with a track record of child abuse and drug trafficking, had been identified as a new suspect by the public prosecutor of the German city of Braunschweig. Christian Brueckner (AFP/Getty)He had reportedly been living in a Volkswagen camper van in the Algarve at the time of Madeleine\u2019s disappearance and one woman has since come forward to suggest she saw a girl that might have been Madeleine speaking German in a supermarket in Portugal in 2017.German investigators classified their probe into his movements as a murder inquiry, saying they were working on the assumption that Madeleine is dead and reporting in July 2021 that they had found an abandoned cellar beneath his former allotment near Hanover where she could, theoretically, have been held captive.Hans Christian Wolters, the prosecutor leading the investigation into Brueckner, has said he was \u201cvery confident\u201d the inmate is responsible for kidnapping her. \u201cIf you knew the evidence we had you would come to the same conclusion as I do but I can\u2019t give you details because we don\u2019t want the accused to know what we have on him \u2013 these are tactical considerations,\u201d he told the BBC. It was subsequently revealed that Madeleine\u2019s Fund still had \u00a3773,629 to spend as of 31 March 2020, meaning the McCanns can continue to bankroll a private investigation to find their daughter long after the police hunt is finally drawn to a close, should they choose to.Brueckner was formally made a \u201carguido\u201d in relation to the case on 21 April 2022.On 19 September, the McCanns lost their libel case against Mr Amaral, the former chief inspector who had investigated the disappearance, before the European Court of Human Rights. The couple had attempted to argue that Mr Amaral was responsible for damaging their reputation and breaching their rights to respect for their private life and to be presumed innocent after taking exception to his book and associated media appearances in which he had repeatedly suggested they were responsible for the vanishing.Their complaint also argued that Portugal\u2019s Supreme Court had failed to allow them proper redress over the alleged libel by Mr Amaral after judges threw out their earlier claim in 2017.The verdict left the McCanns with three months to appeal against the decision.In February 2023, a Polish woman called Julia Faustyna made headlines by claiming she was Madeleine, using the Instagram name @iammadeleinemccann.Ms Faustyna, 21, did not provide any supporting evidence but sought DNA tests to prove her origins. The results ultimately revealed that she was entirely of Polish origin, with no British heritage, disproving her claims for good. In April 2023, a court in Braunschweig dropped a rape charge against Brueckner, unrelated to the Madeleine McCann case, concluding it did not have jurisdiction.Police in Germany continue to claim they have \u201cconcrete evidence\u201d that Madeleine is dead but this has still not been confirmed and their investigation is ongoing, with Brueckner still not charged in the McCann case. Investigators explore the Barragem do Arade beauty spot (EPA)Like her parents, Madeleine\u2019s sister Amelie, now 18, observed the 16th anniversary of her disappearance in May 2023.Speaking publicly for the first time at a prayer meeting in Rothley, she said: \u201cIt\u2019s nice that everyone is here together but it\u2019s a sad occasion.\u201dAmelie McCann reportedly joined in with chants including \u201cNever never give up\u201d, \u201cleave no stone unturned\u201d, \u201cdon\u2019t forget about me\u201d and \u201cstill missing, still missed\u201d.Later that month, the case unexpectedly lurched back into life in when investigators launched a major search operation at a reservoir in the Algarve, with Mr Wolters saying they were acting on \u201ccertain tips\u201d from Brueckner, whom the prosecutor said he remains \u201cvery confident\u201d holds the key to Madeleine\u2019s disappearance.With help from Portuguese police and with Scotland Yard detectives watching on, German investigators carried out a thorough examination of the Barragem do Arade beauty spot in Silves.They combed the shoreline and surrounding grasslands with sniffer dogs, rakes, spades and pickaxes and inspected the water in a rigid-hull inflatable boat.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeMadeleine McCann, a three-year-old girl from Rothley, Leicestershire, was reported missing from the Portuguese holiday resort of Praia da Luz on the Algarve on 3 May 2007, a case still unsolved and still the subject of intense interest among the public and press.Her parents, Kate McCann and Gerry McCann, posted a statement on the Find Madeleine website on 3 May 2023 marking the latest anniversary of their daughter\u2019s disappearance, reiterating their hopes of being reunited with her one day and posting a poem, \u201cThe Contradiction\u201d by Clare Pollard, to express their feelings.\u201cToday marks the 16th anniversary of Madeleine\u2019s abduction. Still missing... still very much missed,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThe police investigation continues, and we await a breakthrough. Thank you to everyone for your support \u2013 it really helps.\u201dFollow all the latest updates on The Independent\u2019s liveblogHere is a reminder of the events of the case.RecommendedMadeleine McCann news \u2013 latest: Soil from reservoir compared to samples from prime suspect\u2019s vanHow Madeleine McCann search at reservoir unfolded \u2013 and what police foundRead Madeleine McCann suspect Christian Brueckner\u2019s bombshell prison letters for the first timeThe story began when the McCanns \u2013 affluent doctors Kate and Gerry, their three-year-old daughter Madeleine and her two-year-old twin siblings Amelia and Sean \u2013 joined a group of seven family friends and their five children on holiday at the Ocean Club in the village of Praia da Luz on the southwestern tip of Portugal on 28 April 2007.After a pleasant spring break by the sea, the adults in the party went out for dinner at the resort\u2019s open-air tapas bar on 3 May, gathering at 8.30pm. The children were left behind sleeping in their respective apartments with the doors unlocked and a rota system in place among the parents to ensure that someone returned every half-hour to check on them.When Kate McCann took her turn and returned to her apartment at 10pm, she raced back to the restaurant screaming \u201cMadeleine\u2019s gone! Someone\u2019s taken her!\u201d The police were quickly called and 60 staff and fellow guests searched the complex, calling out the girl\u2019s name in vain until daybreak the following morning.Border police and airport staff were put on alert and hundreds of volunteers joined the efforts to find the missing girl over the coming days, the case fast becoming a sensation.The Portuguese authorities would later attract criticism over their conduct in the crucial earliest hours of the investigation when the trail might still have been warm, accused of making rudimentary mistakes like failing to conduct a house-by-house search of every local residence or interview all of the other guests at the resort, acting slowly to erect roadblocks and potentially compromising forensic evidence at the crime scene.Madeleine McCann (PA)The police initially stated that they believed Madeleine was still alive and had been abducted from the room by a stranger as the parents described their \u201canguish and despair\u201d over her vanishing, a worst fear realised for any parent.On 26 May, police issued a description of a suspicious man seen on the night of the girl\u2019s disappearance. The individual in question was spotted by Jane Tanner, one of the McCanns\u2019 dining companions, who said she had seen a Mediterranean man with dark hair and beige trousers carrying a child close to the apartment when she went to check in on her own children. Scotland Yard would later come to dismiss the sighting as a red herring.The search continued as the summer progressed amid a wild media circus and with huge fundraising activities underway, the McCanns setting up Madeleine\u2019s Fund on 15 May to raise cash to support further investigation and keep the profile of the case high, attracting generous donations from celebrities like Richard Branson, Simon Cowell, JK Rowling and Coleen Rooney.

Doctors concluded she was 32 to 34 weeks pregnant at the time. The court heard Foster, who already had three children before she became pregnant again in 2019, had lied to the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) during a telephone consultation about how far along her pregnancy was so she could obtain the pills.Following the sentencing, abortion providers, campaigners and politicians fiercely criticised the decision to jail the mother as they called for abortion care in the UK to be immediately decriminalised.Despite receiving a letter from healthcare professionals asking him not to imprison Foster, justice Edward Pepperall imposed a 28-month sentence.RecommendedWomen are waiting too long for abortions, health watchdog findsNHS chief warns of \u2018enormous\u2019 disruption as junior doctors\u2019 announce strike British government \u2018abused, bullied and intimidated\u2019 peers on small boats crisis law Signatories to the letter included the president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the chief executive of the Royal College of Midwives.Justice Pepperall said Foster felt \u201cvery deep and genuine remorse\u201d, was \u201cracked with guilt\u201d and still had nightmares over her actions.But he said his role as judge \u201cis to apply the law as provided by parliament and clarified by the Court of Appeal\u201d, adding that it is \u201ca matter for parliament and not for the courts\u201d.Discussing the letter, he said: \u201cIf the medical profession considers that judges are wrong to imprison women who procure a late abortion outside the 24-week limit then it should lobby Parliament to change that law and not judges who are charged with the duty of applying the law.\u201dThe judge said it would have been better if the letter, which he described as \u201cinappropriate\u201d, \u201chad not been written at all\u201d.Foster will carry out half her sentence in prison and the remaining time under licence.

Multiple and prolonged internet searches showed a level of planning. The taking of the drugs was a planned and deliberate act in which her intention could only have been to procure an abortion.\u201dThe prosecution said the woman made a number of internet searches during lockdown between February and May 2020, including \u201chow to hide a pregnancy bump\u201d, \u201chow to have an abortion without going to the doctor\u201d and \u201chow to lose a baby at six months\u201d.RecommendedFears for vulnerable women amid rise in Britons investigated over illegal abortions by policeWhy are women being arrested for having abortions in the UK?Foster was initially charged with child destruction and pleaded not guilty but later pleaded guilty to an alternative charge of administering drugs or using instruments to procure abortion, which was accepted by the prosecution. The maximum sentence is life imprisonment.Justice Pepperall said the case was made more \u201ctragic\u201d because the woman did not plead guilty earlier, adding that he may have been able to consider suspending the jail sentence if she had.Abortions are still deemed a criminal act in England, Scotland, and Wales under the 1967 Abortion Act.The 1861 legislation means any woman who ends a pregnancy without obtaining legal permission from two doctors, who must agree that continuing with it would be a risk to the woman\u2019s physical or mental health, can face up to life imprisonment.

But he obviously watched me train out there and thinks I can bowl decently.\u201dStokes convinced Ali to return to the England fold for the Ashes (PA Wire)As for his motivation for one last crack at an Australia side who have provided him with some of the most challenging moments in international cricket, Moeen was more keen to focus on the draw of being back involved in one of his sport\u2019s marquee rivalries.\u201cIt\u2019s such a big series\u2026it\u2019s the Ashes, to be part of it would be amazing. It is a free hit. I\u2019m not playing for my spot. There\u2019s no pressure, really. All the things I ever wanted to do in Test cricket I\u2019m going to try to do in these games.\u201dThe pros and cons of the Moeen call-up are clear. On the positive side, none of England\u2019s other slow bowling options such as Will Jacks, Liam Dawson or Rehan Ahmed, come close to his experience or tally of 195 Test wickets.Yet there are those who see his long absence from red-ball cricket as a potential red flag and who would rather see a promotion for someone currently active in the County Championship.Moeen Ali has not played Test cricket since September 2021 (PA Archive)\u201cIt\u2019s a difficult one for me because I never picked myself. I just got the call,\u201d he said.\u201cObviously there are players out there that are playing and doing alright, but I think they (England) know me quite well and it\u2019s not just having the character and the person in the changing room that you want. The results do matter, the process, the matches. I\u2019ve got to perform and make some important impacts in the game.\u201dMoeen offered a remarkably honest assessment of his own style, openly accepting his limitations as a containing bowler and welcoming the freedom he is likely to be given to focus on attack.RecommendedJos Buttler believes Moeen Ali will thrive on return to England\u2019s Test side\u2018Mercurial\u2019 Moeen Ali tipped to make England stronger after Ashes returnMoeen Ali comes out of retirement to join England Ashes squad\u201cI\u2019ve never been able to hold an end up,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I have it\u2019s because I\u2019ve been taking wickets.

Among those sanctions was a decision by the World Boxing Council (WBC) not to recognise Russian and Belarusian fighters, including champions.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeTakeover broker Raine has continued talks with all bidders for Manchester United this week, as the prospective sale of the club enters its protracted final stages. Buyers have been reluctant to give a timescale on when they expect the process to be completed, as so many superficial deadlines have already passed.While most of the focus has been on Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Qatar\u2019s Sheikh Jassim-fronted bid, those bidding for a minority are still in the race. Most notably, no party currently sees themselves as out of it, even though the general feeling has been we are approaching the time when the Glazers are moving to \u201ccomplete\u201d.This confidence is most conspicuous in Qatar, given their camp didn't have that feeling two weeks ago. There was a widespread belief they were out of the race. The so-called \u201cfinal take-it-or-leave-it\u201d offer changed some thinking, and improved discussion. It is understood that bid is still of a lower overall value than that of Ineos, but the very fact that Qatar upped it at all is viewed as a strategic success for the Glazers.The involvement of Paris Saint-Germain\u2019s Nasser Al Kehlaifi is also instructive, as it displays the Glazers\u2019 intent to get Qatar to up the price.There is a view within industry circles that the United owners have long seen Ratcliffe as a \u201cstalking horse\u201d and that, if they are to actually sell, the intention has been to just gradually move Qatar up to the \u00a36bn valuation. While Ratcliffe has made his valuation clear and can't really go past a certain point, after all, the Glazers are naturally conscious of Qatar's ultimately limitless wealth. It has ensured the process has become \u201ca game\u201d, in the words of many sources.RecommendedSheikh Jassim bid still on table as Manchester United takeover tests patienceThe year that sportswashing won: A season that changed football foreverFA Cup final reveals key summer questions for Manchester UnitedIt is also why Qatar increasing their offer after the supposed last deadline is seen as a minor strategic victory for the Glazers. At the same time, there remains optimism within the Ineos camp, especially given the range of potential options they are giving the family. Avram and Joel Glazer, who are most attached to the club, could yet stay on.Industry insiders and sources connected to the situation put Monday night's flare-up down to Qatari media reports of online speculation.There remains confidence in the Jim Ratcliffe camp about their bid  (PA Wire)Chris Davidson, an academic expert on the Gulf who is a fellow at Durham University, believes the entire Qatar bid is a highly calibrated approach that has been influenced by the purchase of Harrods in 2010. Now owned by the Qatar Investment Authority, the flagship department store was sold to Qatar Holdings for a reported \u00a31.5bn. Sheikh Jassim\u2019s father, the then Qatari prime minister Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani, actually flew to London to finalise the deal with Mohammed Al Fayed.The senior Jassim said at the time that Harrods would add \u201cmuch value\u201d to Qatar\u2019s portfolio of investments, especially as a \u201chistorical place\u201d, although Davidson points out how the state was derided for overpaying at the time. He believes this has influenced the United takeover process in two ways, both related to the image of the state.One is over the symbolism of the price. The second is over the idea of giving the impression of some separation, to put more searching questions at a distance.\u201cThey\u2019re just calibrating their bid,\u201d Davidson told The Independent. \u201cThey could blow anyone out of the water, but they\u2019re calibrated to always be just a little bit around Ratcliffe.\u201cIt\u2019s a very different approach. I think this is an example of Qatar learning a lesson they found out the hard way on Harrods, where they were repeatedly pilloried for having overpaid. They really wanted Harrods. It\u2019s a particularly glamorous brand for people from the Gulf. The status it has given them among their Gulf rivals \u2013 not so much in the UK \u2013 is enormous. They were willing to overpay for that. I\u2019m sure they\u2019d be willing to overpay for Man United, too, but I think this was a case of having learnt their lesson.\u201dThis then plays into another strategic purpose, which is putting a perceived difference between the bid and the state. It is all the more important given the greater focus on state ownership in sport, especially with Manchester City\u2019s landmark treble victory and Saudi Arabia\u2019s recent escalation in its sporting investments. One of the points that has been made about the Ratcliffe offer is that it would be much quicker and cleaner to do, as there would be no resistance from other clubs, nor human rights-related issues. The Premier League in March updated its Owners and Directors Test to include a new provision based on Global Human Rights Sanctions Regulations in 2020. Qatar has faced huge criticism from groups such as Amnesty and FairSquare, with that debate framing the entire 2022 World Cup.Qatar have been careful to separate the Man Utd takeover bid from the state  (AP)\u201cBy calibrating it, it just allows them to hover under the radar of being so obviously a state-backed entity, \u201c Davidson explains. \u201cIf they said, \u2018right, we want it\u2019 just as they did with Harrods, and did a bid that blew everyone out of the water, it would be pilloried for being an uncompetitive offer that reflects badly on Qatar. It\u2019s an ongoing calibration as far as I can see\u2026 enough to win the bid without attracting too much negative attention or too much attention, it is ultimately state wealth.\u201cIf they calibrate their offer, one of the talking points becomes that it essentially can\u2019t be state backing. Otherwise, they\u2019d throw even more of it. It\u2019s clearly a stalking point bidding process.\u201dIneos is optimistic that this is not the case and that it has a real chance. Much will depend on how greatly the Glazers actually want to sell, which has remained a huge question throughout all of this.There remains a belief within the club itself that the Glazers\u2019 preference is to just raise enough investment to redevelop Old Trafford but retain control. It is the poor state of the ground that has actually brought them to this point, after all, as it has started to affect revenue. Many in United\u2019s hierarchy have taken note of just how impressive the new Tottenham Hotspur Stadium is, and what a revenue machine it is for the London club. The current Old Trafford can\u2019t offer that, and it was symbolic that it has been passed over for the Euro 2028 plans.That awareness runs alongside a persistent belief at the top of the game that elite clubs will see their value greatly rise in the years to come, particularly with the evolution of telecommunications and virtual reality technology. One industry source says that the new Chelsea owners were so keen to invest in the club \u2013 even for the much-pilloried \u00a3600m last season \u2013 because they believe they have bought an asset that could soon be worth \u00a39bn for \u00a32.5bn.The Glazers are conscious of this, too. While there had previously been a belief that the market for clubs had bottomed out, and that a sale now could offer a remarkable sum for each of the six siblings, there is also the view that this could just be a bad time to sell. They may miss out on huge future earnings.RecommendedFootball rumours: Arsenal closing in on Declan Rice for club-record feeMichael O\u2019Neill expects Ethan Galbraith to flourish after Manchester United exitManchester City\u2019s treble winners arguably greatest ever English team \u2013 Joe RoyleWhile this has been discussed among the Glazers, nobody really knows what they are thinking.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeWho doesn\u2019t love a little transfer speculation, Kylian Mbappe, arguably the world\u2019s most valuable footballer, finds himself yet again amidst transfer rumours worldwide. PSG miraculously managed to keep the star after it looked all but guaranteed that the speedy Frenchman would be taking his talents to Madrid. Mbappe was granted more than money in Paris as he was awarded a seat at the so-called table; given the power to help decide on manager, sporting director, and squad decisions. The Parisians believed this three-year deal would be more than enough to keep the World Cup winner happy in Paris.A letter Mbappe recently sent to the club stating his intention not to sign a contract extension after the conclusion of the 2023-2024 season shattered any dreams that PSG ownership or fans had of the starboy prolonging his stay in Paris.What was originally believed to be a three-year contract extension signed last summer has turned out to be a two-year deal with the option lying with Mbappe to extend after that 2023-2024 season. With Mbappe\u2019s intentions now clear, PSG must enter scramble mode as they risk losing their prime asset, one which they bought for \u20ac180 million, for free after the conclusion of next season.The situation presents the Parisians with two clear options for dealing with Mbappe: sell him this summer to the plethora of suitors, or convince him just as they did last summer of the advantage of staying in his home city. Here we look at the likely options for Mbappe this summer:RecommendedKylian Mbappe alerts Premier League clubs with surprise announcement about his futureHow Jude Bellingham can become the anti-Haaland for Real MadridLiverpool\u2019s must-add midfielder and Haaland 2.0 to Man Utd: Transfer targets for every Premier League clubReal MadridReal Madrid appears to be the obvious choice for a player who has long been tied to the historic club. After trying endlessly last summer to secure the rights to the star Frenchman, Madrid came out with nothing but false hope. For months it felt as though Mbappe lighting up the Bernabeu week after week would be a guarantee but Mbappe saw the Parc Des Princes as having too much to offer at that time to leave. One summer later the Madridistas believe they have found solace as they become yet again the frontrunner to sign Mbappe. Coming off a slightly disappointing season by Madrid standards that included a Copa Del Rey trophy, a second place La Liga finish, and a semi-final defeat to eventual champions Manchester City, Real Madrid are also set to lose legendary No 9 Karim Benzema. This represents a perfect transition period for Madrid as they look to bring in the hyper-talented Mbappe to replace the lost goals from Benzema\u2019s departure.Saudi ArabiaA mere few years ago the idea that a player of Mbappe\u2019s caliber in the prime of his career would go to a league such as the Saudi\u2019s would seem rooted in fantasy. Yet, as we have all learned money talks and the Saudi League sure has a lot. The PIF, or Public Investment Fund, is Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund that has been largely investing in sport over the past few years. This has seen them creating LIV Golf, purchasing 80 percent of Newcastle United in the premier league, and now, purchasing four of their home nation\u2019s 16 Saudi Pro League teams. With the wealth that these teams now possess and the high-profile names that have gone to Saudi Arabia in the past year, there seems to be at least a chance that Mbappe could venture to the Middle East.Al Hillal, Al-Nassr, Al-Ittihad, and Al-Ahil represent the four clubs that the PIF has taken over. Cristiano Ronaldo plays for Al-Nassr, while Lionel Messi was recently connected to Al-Hillal, which reportedly offered a three-year 1.6 billion euro deal to the Argentinian. Madrid\u2019s Benzema and Mbappe\u2019s Les Bleus teammate N\u2019golo Kante have signed with Al-Ittihad and Al-Ahil has just ventured up through promotion to the Pro League. If Mbappe were to venture to the Persian Gulf, Al-Hillal seems like an obvious choice with the empty spot and money left behind when Messi chose Miami over the Saudis. While the money for both PSG and Mbappe would be abundant it still seems a little far-fetched that a player of Mbappe\u2019s level, who still is in the beginning of his prime, would sojourn to one of these clubs. Recent history has taught us not to underestimate the lure of Saudi money; yet again there always remains a chance that the Saudi\u2019s offer a deal neither PSG nor Mbappe could refuse.PSGWhile Mbappe has made his intentions clear that he does not want to renew his contract into 2025, PSG still have the opportunity to convince their star to stay on yet again. Mbappe has enjoyed much success in Paris domestically, finishing as the league\u2019s top goal scorer in five straight seasons as well as securing five of six Ligue 1 trophies with the club.Yet, with PSG entering each Ligue 1 season as massive favorites, this domestic success does not seem to be enough to keep Mbappe happy. Success in the illustrious Champions League which defines Europe\u2019s best seems to be the next step for Mbappe who has seen his club flame out in back-to-back Round of 16\u2019s. How can PSG convince Mbappe of their future in this tournament with a jettisoned Messi and an aging Neymar must be the No 1 question in Paris. While it seems to be quite clear Mbappe has no intention of staying on, this same sentiment was echoed repeatedly just a year ago. One thing we can trust is that Mbappe will do what he sees as best for his future whether that is financially or on the pitch.Manchester United or the Premier League?

Jokic averaged 30 points, 13.5 rebounds and 9.5 assists in 20 games in the 2023 playoffs.He is now one of 11 players who have secured two regular-season MVPs and at least one Finals MVP, joining legends such as Michael Jordon, Tim Duncan, Stephen Curry, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Moses Malone, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, LeBron James, Wilt Chamberlain and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.Denver went 16-4 during its playoff run, and Jokic led the playoffs in all points, rebounds and assists. No player in NBA history has ever achieved this during the playoffs. Jokic is unique. \u201cIt puts him in the legendary category for what he\u2019s done statistically in the Finals,\u201d Isiah Thomas, the former Detroit Pistons star, told ESPN. \u201cI don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anyone who\u2019s ever had a statistical run in the NBA Finals as a centre as he had in these categories.\u201dNikola Jokic celebrates winning the NBA championship and Finals MVP with the Denver Nuggets  (Getty )RecommendedMiami Heat mascot hospitalised after Conor McGregor punchDenver Nuggets with one hand on NBA trophy after taking 3-1 finals series leadMiami Heat rally late against Denver Nuggets to even NBA finals series\u201cThe job is done and we can go home now,\u201d said an earnest Jokic.Having grown up in a cramped two-bedroom apartment that he shared with his parents, two brothers and grandmother in northern Serbia, his basketball abilities were honed playing with his two older brothers, Strahinja and Nemanja. His father worked as an agricultural engineer to help provide for the family.When he was four years old, Nato troops bombed Serbia for 11 weeks in 1999 at the tail end of a war between Yugoslavia\u2019s six neighbouring states: Serbia, Slovenia, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. \u201cI remember things like sirens, bomb shelters, always turning off the lights,\u201d Jokic recalled in 2017 in a conversation with Bleacher Report. \u201cWe practically lived in the dark. Even at like 9am, everything was turned off.\u201dJokic left home when he was just 16 to play with Mega Leks, a Serb basketball team in the Adriatic League. By his third year, he was named league MVP, a sign of things to come. Nicknamed \u201cthe Joker\u201d, Jokic was selected by the Nuggets with the 41st pick in the second round of the 2014 NBA draft. His moment was slightly overshadowed when his name was called during a Taco Bell commercial, and the 6ft 11in star opted to remain in Eastern Europe for an extra season and finally arrived in Denver in 2015.Jokic competes with Miami Heat centre Bam Adebayo during the NBA Finals (AP)During the draft, Jokic was fast asleep in Serbia when he received a call in the middle of the night from his older brother, Nemanja. Nemanja informed his younger brother that he had been drafted into the NBA while popping a bottle of champagne. Jokic came into the league without draft pedigree. He was never supposed to be where he is today. Now he is arguably the best player in the NBA.The future Hall of Famer redefines modern-day positionless basketball as his unconventional playmaking and slick scoring blur the lines between a point guard quarterbacking the offence and a high-scoring big man. The NBA champion has proven to be unstoppable in the pick-and-roll. He bends defences with his smooth passing and soft touch around the basket. His man-to-man defence is unconventional, slow and ugly but it still gets the job done.Throughout his historic trip to the NBA finals, Jokic has surprassed Wilt Chamberlain for the most triple-doubles in a single playoff run. The two-time MVP also won the championship without a single all-star teammate. The Joker has etched his name in history with his dominating playoff run, but he couldn\u2019t have done it without his co-star Jamal Murray.Jokic celebrates after the team won the NBA Championship (AP)Murray has averaged 26.1 points, 7.1 assists and 5.7 rebounds in 20 games in the 2023 playoffs. The Nuggets also put together a strong supporting cast of roleplayers that were tailor-made to play with the dynamic duo. The supporting cast, headlined by Aaron Gordon, included Michael Porter Jr, Bruce Bowen and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope to help propel the team into a championship calibre squad. The group has a chance to repeat as champs next year if they remain focused and don\u2019t suffer from complacency.RecommendedMiami Heat mascot hospitalised after Conor McGregor punchDenver Nuggets with one hand on NBA trophy after taking 3-1 finals series leadMiami Heat rally late against Denver Nuggets to even NBA finals seriesThe entire team orbits around their all-time great player as Jokic has revolutionised basketball with his offensive prowess, changing the way teams gameplan around one player. He is cut from the same cloth as Michael Jordan, LeBron James and Stephen Curry, as opposing teams create a game plan around stopping him. In the 2020 Orlando bubble, after the Denver Nuggets lost to LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers in the Western Conference Finals, it was clear that the Nuggets had the blueprint to be a championship contender. After empathically sweeping the Lakers in this year\u2019s conference finals, the team realised their full potential and came out on top.The NBA title ought to solidify Jokic\u2019s status as the best player in the NBA. Despite winning two regular-season MVPs, critics doubted if he could anchor a championship-level defence, and now he has silenced all who dismissed him."}, {"_id": "64889c5051ac339fc372aa28", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/transfers-midfield-bellingham-rice-mount-mac-allister-b2356154.html", "primaryCategory": "Football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Bellingham gone but who\u2019s next?

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeIt was not the first time Youri Tielemans had made headlines on the day of a major final. A couple of years after he decided the FA Cup with a superlative strike against Chelsea came something that was rather less of a bolt from the blue. It may be presented as a bolt to the claret and blue, given his move to Aston Villa had seemed increasingly likely, but it became fact a few hours before the Champions League final kicked off.A few days earlier came confirmation of a rather costlier move: Jude Bellingham\u2019s transfer from Borussia Dortmund to Real Madrid. Before the transfer window had officially opened, it was announced that Alexis Mac Allister was bound for Liverpool. European finals occurred amid thoughts of goodbyes and to a backdrop of uncertainty. No sooner had West Ham won the Conference League than chairman David Sullivan admitted what was long known: that Declan Rice will leave, providing an appropriate offer comes in. There is the possibility that either the out-of-contract Ilkay Gundogan or Bernardo Silva will bow out of Manchester City having won the Champions League in his valedictory appearance.They could form part of what looks like being a massive midfield merry-go-round. If transfers are a staple of every summer, and discussions about them seemingly a global fixation, 2023 should appear particularly busy in the centre of the pitch.Others seen in the Premier League this season who are either definitely or at least quite likely to be swapping clubs include Mason Mount, Mateo Kovacic, N\u2019Golo Kante, Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Granit Xhaka, Moises Caicedo, Romeo Lavia, James Ward-Prowse, James Maddison, James Milner, Naby Keita, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Tyler Adams, Scott McTominay, Fred, Jefferson Lerma, Joao Moutinho and Ruben Neves. That is before factoring in others whose departures might not be a genuine shock, a group that could include Conor Gallagher, Amadou Onana, Kalvin Phillips, Wilfred Ndidi and Brenden Aaronson, while Tottenham have their annual problem of what to do with Tanguy Ndombele and Giovani Lo Celso. And, given the Premier League\u2019s status as huge net importers, there is every chance of arrivals from abroad. Borussia Dortmund\u2019s Mo Dahoud seems likely to replace Mac Allister at Brighton. Borussia Monchengladbach\u2019s Manu Kone and Nice\u2019s Khephren Thuram are potential targets for others.RecommendedHow Jude Bellingham can become the anti-Haaland for Real MadridReplacement for Granit Xhaka and a No9 for Mauricio Pochettino: Transfer targets for every Premier League clubLiverpool begin midfield overhaul by completing Alexis Mac Allister signingA host of reasons are colliding, and not merely because high-level players are less likely to look for upheaval in tournament summers, making this probably busier than 2024. If there is the usual wish to upgrade, it is particularly pronounced at several clubs. Liverpool delayed their midfield rebuild, paid a price and only exacerbated their need for reinforcements. Erik ten Hag began overhauling Manchester United\u2019s midfield last year but it was always envisaged he would want at least one signing there this summer. Arsenal\u2019s swift improvement in the rest of the team highlighted the midfield as an area where, despite Xhaka\u2019s best season in London, they could be better and Rice would appear better. Newcastle\u2019s transformation into a Champions League club can bring a necessity to find alternatives, and potential superiors, to Eddie Howe\u2019s worthy workhorses, Sean Longstaff and Joe Willock. Maybe Ange Postecoglou will want to give Tottenham an injection of creativity.Declan Rice could be a key midfield domino to fall  (PA Wire)Then there is also a phenomenon that has been apparent for a while: it may be a sign of the Premier League\u2019s strength in depth or a failing on the part of some of the superpowers that some of the outstanding midfielders have not been at the supposed big six. Rice may be the most expensive example but the Brighton double act of Mac Allister and Caicedo, who attracted January bids from Arsenal and Chelsea, are other cases in point. Neves has been a player with enviable class who has shown admirable loyalty to Wolves but has been open in his desire for Champions League football.Indeed, one of the division\u2019s dynamics this season, which in turn should speed up the revolving door of midfielders, is the relegation of sides with quality performers. The precocious Lavia never seemed likely to stay at Southampton for long but Ward-Prowse, whose consistency and set-piece delivery had drawn bids before, could have been a Saints lifer had they stayed up forever. Likewise, it is hard to envisage Adams in the Championship with Leeds. Their contractual situations may have meant Leicester would have always lost Maddison and Tielemans but demotion reduces their bargaining power for the Englishman.The Belgian belongs in two categories. Some of the midfield business comes because an unusually high number of talents are available on free transfers. Gundogan could be the most prominent of them, unless City persuade their captain to re-sign. Liverpool\u2019s frustration with the injuries of Keita and Oxlade-Chamberlain meant neither was offered deals.Then there is Kante, who is also part of another cause: Chelsea\u2019s great disruptors, committed to inexplicable revolution. Todd Boehly and co may be taking a wrecking ball to a Champions League-winning team without intending to. Kante highlights the sudden emergence of supersized offers from Saudi Arabia as a new element in the market. But if Kovacic goes, it will be in part because Chelsea have contrived to alienate their existing players with their incessant focus on the new. If Mount and Gallagher are sold, they are enforced moves to try and balance the books \u2013 especially for Financial Fair Play regulations \u2013 after ludicrous spending. Meanwhile, of course, Chelsea will carry on bidding: indeed if most of Kante, Kovacic, Loftus-Cheek, Gallagher and Mount depart, they could somehow end up short of midfielders and needing to spend again, a few months after paying \u00a3107m for Enzo Fernandez.RecommendedManchester City quintet set to arrive for England duty on Tuesday eveningJoelinton discloses that he suffered racist abuse after loss to ArsenalArsenal forward misses out on fourth World Cup after being cut from squadOthers have more legitimate reasons to buy: just to replace. City will, if Gundogan goes. West Ham must look for a future beyond Rice and, as the reality is they will not recruit someone of his calibre, that may entail bringing in two midfielders. In turn, that can keep money swirling around, powering the merry-go-round. Some of the available players may find themselves in limbo for a while due to the excellence of others: those stuck on shortlists below Rice or Gundogan or Maddison or Lavia or Mount may have to wait to see where they go and when and what that means. The sheer number of compelling options available could make it a buyer\u2019s market, even if some sizeable fees are inevitable. Some of the more astute recruiters seem to have done fine business early, in Tielemans, Mac Allister and Bellingham. Some European clubs may delay to pick up bargains at the end of the summer.The guarantee is there will be plenty more moves. Because by the time the window closes, virtually every midfield is likely to look different, some completely. After a Champions League final decided by a midfielder, this could be the summer of many midfielders."}, {"_id": "64889c5051ac339fc372aa29", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/cricket/michael-vaughan-edgbaston-marcus-trescothick-freddie-flintoff-kevin-pietersen-b2356635.html", "primaryCategory": "Cricket", "subCategories": "test", "title": "England were playing \u2018Bazball\u2019 during 2005 Ashes series win \u2013 Michael Vaughan", "lead": "The current England team have developed into an attacking and entertaining Test unit under the guidance of coach Brendan McCullum \u2013 nicknamed Baz.", "author": "Andy Hampson", "datePublished": "Tue, 13 Jun 2023 12:56:40 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:41:52.402984", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-13T12:56:40+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/13/14/0a2f784e77ef9fcf7907bc6cfc56d87aY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg2NzQ1NDA1-2.2523265.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free sport newsletter for all the latest news on everything from cycling to boxingSign up to our free sport email for all the latest news\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

I didn\u2019t expect us to get 400 in, I think it was 80 (overs). Very much like the modern England thing, the Ben Stokes (way) \u2013 we were playing \u2018Bazball\u2019 in 2005 for that first day at Edgbaston.\u201dThe day began in extraordinary fashion as Australia\u2019s inspirational seamer Glenn McGrath injured his ankle when he trod on a stray ball during the warm-up and was forced to miss the game.England scored 407 with 90 from Marcus Trescothick, 48 from Andrew Strauss and half-centuries from Kevin Pietersen and Andrew Flintoff.Vaughan said: \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t really celebrate great players being stretchered off at that time, but we were.

That\u2019s kind of true of me on the rugby pitch as well \u2013 a lot of people say my tries are walk-ins, but you\u2019ve got to be there in the right position.\u201cHaaland is always lurking. He\u2019s a great finisher and a great footballer, but for me it\u2019s his ability to know where to be that stands out.\u201dMurley\u2019s 15 touch downs last season \u2013 he was also second-highest try scorer behind Max Malins in 2021-22 \u2013 have put him in contention for World Cup selection and he could win his first cap during the four warm-up Tests.While possessing a nose for the line and surprising power for a 23-year-old who is 5ft 8in and weighs 15st 2lbs, developing familiarity with his team-mates has been just as instrumental to his consistency as a finisher.He added: \u201cA lot of it comes down to who you are playing with and if you know them well enough. Do you know what they\u2019re going to do?\u201cFor example, I know that Andre Esterhuizen and Alex Dombrandt will probably make gainline and will look for off-loads, so fishing in and around those two is very good.\u201cAnd of course Marcus Smith can pull a crossfield kick out of anywhere. He likes me to be in certain positions on the touchline \u2013 if he has a couple of looks and there\u2019s space there then I know he\u2019s going to do that.\u201cThose relationships are really important, but there are also other things that you need to practise day in day out on the training field.\u201cMainly I do one on ones. I\u2019m a bit different to other wingers. I don\u2019t have the best feet out there, but I\u2019m also more powerful than some. So I practise grabbing bigger people and practise finishing drills.\u201cMy power has come from when I played back row when I was younger. I was never the biggest so I\u2019ve always had to punch above my weight.\u201dRevitalised by a mandatory five-week rest period that included 10 days spent in Marbella, Murley has been selected in England\u2019s first training squad of the summer with clear instructions from head coach Steve Borthwick on what is expected.\u201cSteve has given general instructions to all the back three. He wants us to be aerially dominant, so he\u2019s asked us to always work on the high ball,\u201d he said.\u201cThe way the international game is going, there is a lot more kick chase, but they want that to be done at as high a speed as possible so we\u2019ve been doing lots of sprint repeats.RecommendedManchester City quintet set to arrive for England duty on Tuesday eveningIt\u2019s all about legacy \u2013 Richard Riakporhe on using his platform to help othersNottingham Open to commence as normal despite \u2018horrific\u2019 incident in city centre\u201cSteve also wants us to be physical \u2013 the most physical wingers in the world.

Khephren Thuram and Manu Kone are also on the club's radar, with the latter the latest to be linked with a switch. Kone returned the seventh best dribble success rate (60%) in the Bundesliga last season, while he ranked 10th for possession won in the midfield third (109) and 15th for tackles per 90 (2.5) with the Gladbach star emerging as one of Liverpool's top midfield targets.RecommendedHow Jude Bellingham can become the anti-Haaland for Real MadridAlexis Mac Allister believes he can add to trophy collection with LiverpoolReplacement for Granit Xhaka and a No9 for Mauricio Pochettino: Transfer targets for every Premier League clubLutonWhat do they need - strikerWho should they sign - Antonio-Mirko ColakCarlton Morris was the leading light in Luton's successful play-off push having scored 20 league goals for the Hatters last season. However, beyond Morris, Luton have few attacking alternatives to ease the burden on the 27-year-old. For context, centre-back Tom Lockyer was their third-highest scorer, with four goals. Promoted teams often make the mistake of prioritising attack over defence, but Luton can ill-afford to rely on Morris to keep them up. Antonio-Mirko Colak started the Scottish Premiership season brightly, and ultimately ended the campaign with 14 league goals, but injuries hampered his long-term impact, so much so that he hasn't started a league game since March. The Croat could prove a crucial signing in the final third were they to make a move for the Rangers man.Manchester CityWhat do they need - right wingerWho should they sign - Wilfried GnontoWhile a team chasing a historic treble is unlikely to really need to strengthen in the off-season, Manchester City could certainly use the summer to bring in another right winger. Riyad Mahrez is now the wrong side of 30, and while a success under Pep Guardiola, the champions need to plan for life beyond the Algerian. Relegated Leeds will be aware they need to cut costs, with Wilfried Gnonto a sellable asset on the books at Elland Road. The Italy international works hard off the ball, too, as evidenced by a return of 1.8 tackles per 90, and this would certainly appease Guardiola.Manchester UnitedWhat do they need - strikerWho should they sign - Rasmus HojlundHarry Kane may be the priority for Erik ten Hag as the Manchester United boss seeks an overhaul of his attack, but with Real Madrid also interested in the Tottenham hitman, the Carabao Cup winners can't afford to be dragged into a bidding war. Rather, they should focus their efforts on securing the services of star-in-the-making Rasmus Hojlund. The Dane ended the 2022/23 Serie A season with a respectable nine goals and two assists to his name despite starting just 20 of 38 league matches. At 20 years of age, there is more to come from Hojlund, and fans should be desperate to see the Atalanta man develop into a world-class striker at Old Trafford.Rasmus Hojlund has impressed for Atalanta (AP)NewcastleWhat do they need - attacking midfielderWho should they sign - James MaddisonFollowing their Champions League return, Newcastle need to add quality bodies to the squad as they gear up to compete on multiple fronts following a successful season under Eddie Howe. James Maddison is one linked with a move to St. James' Park and having scored 10 and provided nine assists, the 26-year-old certainly proved his worth for a relegated Leicester side. Able to cover a number of roles in the final third, Newcastle won't have a straight shot at Maddison, but he's one who'd boost their chances of another top-four finish and silverware next season.Nottingham ForestWhat do they need - goalkeeperWho should they sign - Dean HendersonNottingham Forest were fortunate enough to convince Keylor Navas to join on loan from PSG in January to ease Dean Henderson's injury, though the Costa Rican is unlikely to make a permanent switch to the City Ground. As such, Forest should explore the possibility of signing Henderson once the transfer window opens. The 26-year-old is unlikely to establish himself as first choice at parent club Manchester United, who themselves are looking to sign a new shot-stopper, so would be open to Henderson's sale.Sheffield UnitedWhat do they need - attacking midfielderWho should they sign - Carney ChukwuemekaWhile it remains to be seen whether Sheffield United can retain the services of on-loan Manchester City pair James McAtee and Tommy Doyle, the Blades could maximise the loan market once more in order to bring fresh blood into the side. Chelsea spent big to sign Carney Chukwuemeka from Aston Villa, and he is very much one for the future. However, he needs game time to continue his development, something that may prove hard to come by at Stamford Bridge next season. New boss Mauricio Pochettino will likely want a first look at Chukwuemeka before making a decision on his future, but if the Blades are unable to keep McAtee and Doyle, the former Aston Villa teenager would help ease their respective returns to City.TottenhamWhat do they need - goalkeeperWho should they sign - David RayaTottenham are set to undergo a major rebuild this summer under Ange Postecoglou, and the best position to start is in goal. Hugo Lloris is set to leave north London, so the Frenchman's successor should be the priority. A ball-playing goalkeeper is key, with David Raya rightly their number one target. Brentford have already signed Raya's replacement in Mark Flekken, and that may soften their stance on the Spaniard. The 27-year-old ranked first for saves (154) and third for accurate long balls (410) in Europe's top five leagues this season, and could prove the perfect new goalkeeper for Spurs.Brentford goalkeeper David Raya is wanted by Tottenham (PA Wire)West HamWhat do they need - central midfielderWho should they sign - James Ward-ProwseGiven Declan Rice's likely exit once West Ham's Europa Conference League campaign is done and dusted, the Hammers will need a new midfielder to ease the England international's exit. West Ham will command a huge fee for Rice, so they need to be wise in the summer market in order not to be priced out of a move for a successor. That being said, Southampton will likely have demanded a big price for James Ward-Prowse anyway, with the Saints captain set to leave on the back of their relegation. The 28-year-old ranked seventh for key passes (74) in the Premier League last season and he could prove the right player to help pick up the pieces if, or when, Rice departs.WolvesWhat do they need - strikerRecommendedTalking points as England look to turn tables on Australia in Women\u2019s AshesKylian Mbappe alerts Premier League clubs with surprise announcement about his futureJack Grealish revels as Manchester City parade trebleWho should they sign - Folarin BalogunLike Chelsea, Wolves' primary issue was the inability to hit the back of net. Indeed, they scored fewer goals (31) than any other Premier League side last season, and with Raul Jimenez and Diego Costa unlikely to be Wolves players once the summer window closes, they need investment in attack. If they can convince Arsenal to sell Folarin Balogun, then the USA international could be what they need to reignite their stagnant frontline.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeFor someone who is such a monolith of a man, there are a surprising number of layers to Joe Joyce. At certain points during our half-hour conversation, Joe Joyce the heavyweight boxer is speaking; at others, it\u2019s Joe Joyce the fine-art student, the swimming instructor, the cheerleader, or the trumpet player.\u201cWhen I was a swimming and diving teacher, it was a really great feeling to have someone who was really afraid of the water and to get their head under the water \u2013 or have them swimming three, four strokes by the end,\u201d the Londoner tells The Independent. \u201cTo have people who have spent their life not being able to swim, and to get them to even put their head under the water in their late sixties and seventies, that\u2019s something I found really rewarding. \u201cI also played trumpet for quite a few years, I was in the choir at school. I could do a little bit of percussion; I used to go on music holidays. My little brother is the more musical one; he\u2019s at uni doing something musical and was in the Brit School; he was also in Thriller Live. My dad\u2019s an art teacher, he restores antique mirror frames, and my mum was into pottery; she does a series of African-esque heads. Growing up, music and sport was encouraged, as was art. I did my first oil painting when I was seven years old.\u201cIt would be nice to make more art and create more things, be more creative than the destructive boxing side.\u201dThese other sides to Joyce are all \u201cauthentic\u201d elements of the 37-year-old, as he puts it.RecommendedJoe Joyce arrives at boxing\u2019s top table with brutal knockout of Joseph ParkerTyson Fury: Joe Joyce \u2018couldn\u2019t lace my boots\u2019 but beats Anthony Joshua and Oleksandr UsykTyson Fury to record \u2018Sweet Caroline\u2019 cover for mental health charity\u201cI wake up Joe Joyce, I go to sleep Joe Joyce. I\u2019d like to inspire the next generation coming up and teach them, lead by example. It\u2019s good to give back. I\u2019d like to lead a movement, like how Muhammad Ali transcended boxing and is one of these pivotal names in history \u2013 like Bruce Lee, Bob Marley, Michael Jordan. That\u2019s the kind of thing I\u2019d like to leave behind, or at least something close to that.\u201dThey are huge aspirations for a man who comes across so humbly, but while there is some way for Joyce to go in achieving such status, his profile swelled significantly in the aftermath of his knockout of Joseph Parker in September 2022. \u201cOvernight I saw the change, where people were kind of putting me in the top five [at heavyweight] and were interested and excited about certain match-ups with these top fighters,\u201d he says.Joyce stopped Parker in the 11th round in Manchester  (PA Wire)Joyce, who claimed silver for Great Britain at the 2016 Olympics in Rio, hammered Parker to the canvas with a left hook in the 11th round in Manchester to become interim WBO champion. \u201cWhen I was in there, I couldn\u2019t remember what shot I stopped him with; it wasn\u2019t until I got back to the changing room and they showed me the clip of it. I was like, \u2018Woah!\u2019\u201d The final shot capped off an indefatigable performance from Joyce, who marched down the New Zealander relentlessly and was unperturbed by Parker\u2019s best strikes. \u201cHe did his best, he put his best effort in, and it wasn\u2019t enough,\u201d Joyce says matter-of-factly, before morphing his voice into a fine impression of a 1970s professional wrestler: \u201cAnd it\u2019s gonna take a wrecking ball to take me down, I\u2019ll tell you that much!\u201d he bellows, making a whipping motion with his index finger, before his voice cracks into a laugh.Unfortunately for the Briton, Zhilei Zhang became that wrecking ball in April. While the Chinese heavyweight did not quite take down Joyce, he battered the \u201cJuggernaut\u201d\u2019s right eye to the point of closure, forcing the referee to wave off the bout in Round 6.With the result, Joyce lost the WBO Interim belt and saw his professional record fall to 15-1 (with 14 of his wins having come via knockout). The clashes with Parker and Zhang, similar to Joyce\u2019s bout with rising heavyweight Daniel Dubois in 2020, were risky affairs on paper. But in a business in which the best rarely do battle with one another, Joyce has shown no trepidation in confronting tough combatants. At 37, he cannot afford to waste time on tune-up fights or meaningless match-ups.Joyce became interim WBO heavyweight champion by beating Parker  (Getty)\u201cI\u2019m not out here just to earn money or be heavyweight champion of the world,\u201d he insists. \u201cIt\u2019s about taking them challenges on and overcoming them. I think some of that can be lost in the sport. It\u2019d be good to bring back those good times of everybody fighting everybody. People don\u2019t wanna lose their \u20180\u2019. I don\u2019t know where that mentality came from... Maybe from Floyd Mayweather? That\u2019s why a lot of the [big] fights don\u2019t happen.\u201dIt is a trend that is at odds with what fans want \u2013 one that goes against basic fighting instinct, Joyce argues.\u201cThere\u2019s that excitement when you\u2019re at school, and someone in the playground shouts, \u2018Fight!\u2019 It kicks off, and the whole school gathers around... It\u2019s that primordial excitement that people get, it\u2019s that kind of raw entertainment. When I was in primary school, I had quite a few fights \u2013 two on one, or they\u2019d start the fight and I\u2019d finish it. I was always a head taller than everyone. Early days of rugby, there\u2019d be five or six guys hanging on to me, trying to slow me down.\u201dIronically, a criticism of Joyce has been his perceived lack of speed, but if that is a valid critique then it has not prevented the Juggernaut from building momentum in fights through his pressure and the volume of his output. Before Joyce\u2019s meeting with Zhang, there was a clamour for the Briton to face the likes of Tyson Fury and fellow Olympian Anthony Joshua. The visual of Joyce being scaled by school students on the rugby pitch, coupled with discussions around Fury and Joshua, leads us naturally onto whether Joyce would rather fight five smaller Furys or one gargantuan Joshua.Joyce celebrates with his team after stopping Parker (Getty)\u201cFive little Furys would be a pain in the ass, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d he laughs. \u201cThat\u2019d be so annoying, being surrounded by them! They\u2019d be coming from all angles, you can\u2019t hit them, the head movement... But imagine the punch on a massive-sized Joshua... \u201dRecommendedJake Paul agrees to new stipulation in Nate Diaz fightJosh Taylor says move up to welterweight is \u2018imminent\u2019 after first career defeatTeofimo Lopez and his father share emotional exchange during Josh Taylor fightBefore long, Joyce might not even have to imagine the punch on a life-sized Joshua, who \u2013\u00a0as the 37-year-old acknowledges \u2013 is an intriguing enough proposition as is. Joyce\u2019s eagerness to embrace such challenges is an endearing element of his personality \u2013 and of his approach to his profession. That dichotomy, between the gentle Juggernaut\u2019s personality and profession, will only make his journey all the more enthralling."}, {"_id": "64889c5151ac339fc372aa2f", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/golf/pga-liv-merger-us-congress-saudi-arabia-b2356530.html", "primaryCategory": "Golf", "subCategories": "test", "title": "PGA Tour \u2018confident\u2019 US Congress investigation won\u2019t find fault with LIV Golf deal", "lead": "<p>The US Congress are concerned about \u2018the Saudi government\u2019s role in influencing this effort\u2019 </p>", "author": "Jamie Gardner", "datePublished": "Tue, 13 Jun 2023 11:46:55 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:41:53.771455", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-13T11:46:55+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/06/23/Saudi_Tours_Golf_84003.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free sport newsletter for all the latest news on everything from cycling to boxingSign up to our free sport email for all the latest news\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeTakeover broker Raine has continued talks with all bidders for Manchester United this week, as the prospective sale of the club enters its protracted final stages. Buyers have been reluctant to give a timescale on when they expect the process to be completed, as so many superficial deadlines have already passed.While most of the focus has been on Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Qatar\u2019s Sheikh Jassim-fronted bid, those bidding for a minority are still in the race. Most notably, no party currently sees themselves as out of it, even though the general feeling has been we are approaching the time when the Glazers are moving to \u201ccomplete\u201d.This confidence is most conspicuous in Qatar, given their camp didn't have that feeling two weeks ago. There was a widespread belief they were out of the race. The so-called \u201cfinal take-it-or-leave-it\u201d offer changed some thinking, and improved discussion. It is understood that bid is still of a lower overall value than that of Ineos, but the very fact that Qatar upped it at all is viewed as a strategic success for the Glazers.The involvement of Paris Saint-Germain\u2019s Nasser Al Kehlaifi is also instructive, as it displays the Glazers\u2019 intent to get Qatar to up the price.There is a view within industry circles that the United owners have long seen Ratcliffe as a \u201cstalking horse\u201d and that, if they are to actually sell, the intention has been to just gradually move Qatar up to the \u00a36bn valuation. While Ratcliffe has made his valuation clear and can't really go past a certain point, after all, the Glazers are naturally conscious of Qatar's ultimately limitless wealth. It has ensured the process has become \u201ca game\u201d, in the words of many sources.RecommendedSheikh Jassim bid still on table as Manchester United takeover tests patienceThe year that sportswashing won: A season that changed football foreverFA Cup final reveals key summer questions for Manchester UnitedIt is also why Qatar increasing their offer after the supposed last deadline is seen as a minor strategic victory for the Glazers. At the same time, there remains optimism within the Ineos camp, especially given the range of potential options they are giving the family. Avram and Joel Glazer, who are most attached to the club, could yet stay on.Industry insiders and sources connected to the situation put Monday night's flare-up down to Qatari media reports of online speculation.There remains confidence in the Jim Ratcliffe camp about their bid  (PA Wire)Chris Davidson, an academic expert on the Gulf who is a fellow at Durham University, believes the entire Qatar bid is a highly calibrated approach that has been influenced by the purchase of Harrods in 2010. Now owned by the Qatar Investment Authority, the flagship department store was sold to Qatar Holdings for a reported \u00a31.5bn. Sheikh Jassim\u2019s father, the then Qatari prime minister Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani, actually flew to London to finalise the deal with Mohammed Al Fayed.The senior Jassim said at the time that Harrods would add \u201cmuch value\u201d to Qatar\u2019s portfolio of investments, especially as a \u201chistorical place\u201d, although Davidson points out how the state was derided for overpaying at the time. He believes this has influenced the United takeover process in two ways, both related to the image of the state.One is over the symbolism of the price. The second is over the idea of giving the impression of some separation, to put more searching questions at a distance.\u201cThey\u2019re just calibrating their bid,\u201d Davidson told The Independent. \u201cThey could blow anyone out of the water, but they\u2019re calibrated to always be just a little bit around Ratcliffe.\u201cIt\u2019s a very different approach. I think this is an example of Qatar learning a lesson they found out the hard way on Harrods, where they were repeatedly pilloried for having overpaid. They really wanted Harrods. It\u2019s a particularly glamorous brand for people from the Gulf. The status it has given them among their Gulf rivals \u2013 not so much in the UK \u2013 is enormous. They were willing to overpay for that. I\u2019m sure they\u2019d be willing to overpay for Man United, too, but I think this was a case of having learnt their lesson.\u201dThis then plays into another strategic purpose, which is putting a perceived difference between the bid and the state. It is all the more important given the greater focus on state ownership in sport, especially with Manchester City\u2019s landmark treble victory and Saudi Arabia\u2019s recent escalation in its sporting investments. One of the points that has been made about the Ratcliffe offer is that it would be much quicker and cleaner to do, as there would be no resistance from other clubs, nor human rights-related issues. The Premier League in March updated its Owners and Directors Test to include a new provision based on Global Human Rights Sanctions Regulations in 2020. Qatar has faced huge criticism from groups such as Amnesty and FairSquare, with that debate framing the entire 2022 World Cup.Qatar have been careful to separate the Man Utd takeover bid from the state  (AP)\u201cBy calibrating it, it just allows them to hover under the radar of being so obviously a state-backed entity, \u201c Davidson explains. \u201cIf they said, \u2018right, we want it\u2019 just as they did with Harrods, and did a bid that blew everyone out of the water, it would be pilloried for being an uncompetitive offer that reflects badly on Qatar. It\u2019s an ongoing calibration as far as I can see\u2026 enough to win the bid without attracting too much negative attention or too much attention, it is ultimately state wealth.\u201cIf they calibrate their offer, one of the talking points becomes that it essentially can\u2019t be state backing. Otherwise, they\u2019d throw even more of it. It\u2019s clearly a stalking point bidding process.\u201dIneos is optimistic that this is not the case and that it has a real chance. Much will depend on how greatly the Glazers actually want to sell, which has remained a huge question throughout all of this.There remains a belief within the club itself that the Glazers\u2019 preference is to just raise enough investment to redevelop Old Trafford but retain control. It is the poor state of the ground that has actually brought them to this point, after all, as it has started to affect revenue. Many in United\u2019s hierarchy have taken note of just how impressive the new Tottenham Hotspur Stadium is, and what a revenue machine it is for the London club. The current Old Trafford can\u2019t offer that, and it was symbolic that it has been passed over for the Euro 2028 plans.That awareness runs alongside a persistent belief at the top of the game that elite clubs will see their value greatly rise in the years to come, particularly with the evolution of telecommunications and virtual reality technology. One industry source says that the new Chelsea owners were so keen to invest in the club \u2013 even for the much-pilloried \u00a3600m last season \u2013 because they believe they have bought an asset that could soon be worth \u00a39bn for \u00a32.5bn.The Glazers are conscious of this, too. While there had previously been a belief that the market for clubs had bottomed out, and that a sale now could offer a remarkable sum for each of the six siblings, there is also the view that this could just be a bad time to sell. They may miss out on huge future earnings.RecommendedFootball rumours: Arsenal closing in on Declan Rice for club-record feeMichael O\u2019Neill expects Ethan Galbraith to flourish after Manchester United exitManchester City\u2019s treble winners arguably greatest ever English team \u2013 Joe RoyleWhile this has been discussed among the Glazers, nobody really knows what they are thinking.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeGabri Veiga, tipped to be the next young star of Spanish football, has a long list of skills and abilities, but if one thing sticks out about this supremely confident 21-year-old then it\u2019s his ability to strike a ball. The secret to his ball-striking abilities, however, may surprise you. \u201cI began playing football because of pumpkins,\u201d he has explained.Playing at his uncle\u2019s house when he was a toddler, he discovered a pumpkin on the kitchen floor and started to kick it \u201cout of curiosity\u201d. From then on, all he wanted to do was kick balls and he joined his first football club aged four.Later, as a 12-year-old, he was enrolled in the famed A Madroa academy of local Galician club RC Celta and now, in 2022/23, the attacking midfielder has emerged as one of the team\u2019s key players, working up a profitable partnership with Iago Aspas, the team\u2019s most senior and exceptional player and another who also came through the club\u2019s academy many years ago.Fast forward to this term and Veiga scored the two crucial goals on the final day of the season to see Celta Vigo beat champions Barcelona and secure their top-flight status.That could yet turn out to be his last action at Balaidos, with the likes of Liverpool, Chelsea and Newcastle United all being heavily linked with a move and the talented attacker sitting high on their list of priorities for this summer\u2019s transfers. Veiga\u2019s release clause is set at \u20ac40million (\u00a334.4m) - though it\u2019s perhaps worth noting that Celta have only sold one player for more than \u20ac15m since Nolito left for Man City in 2016.RecommendedJude Bellingham uses pain of England\u2019s near misses in bid for Euro 2024 glorySheikh Jassim waiting to hear if final offer to buy Man Utd has been successfulJoelinton: I received racist insults after Arsenal gameEleven goals - top ten among Europe\u2019s U21 playersBetween them, Aspas and Viega were responsible for scoring 23 of RC Celta\u2019s 43 LaLiga Santander goals in 2022/23 and the veteran striker has done his part in making the youngster feel comfortable, personally setting up two of the midfielder\u2019s 11 goals.Veiga\u2019s goal count this campaign, his first full season in the first team, is nothing short of stunning. Nobody scored more goals from midfield in LaLiga this season.In his age category, Veiga is truly standing out. Of all the Under-21 players in Europe\u2019s top five leagues, Veiga finished with the seventh-highest goal tally, only trailing the likes of Bayern Munich\u2019s Jamal Musiala and Arsenal\u2019s Bukayo Saka. Also, he is the Under-21 player with the second-most goals produced in LaLiga 22/23 (11 goals and four assists), only one behind Villarreal\u2019s Nicolas Jackson (12 and four). (LaLiga Celta Vigo CSM Gabri Veiga)Veiga is about much more than his goals, however. He has proved his versatility throughout his youth career, playing in every position aside from goalkeeper, centre-back and left-back.It is perhaps that rich variety of experience which has seen him to develop into the player he is today: a midfielder with remarkable vision and ability to make the final pass, with the courage and pace to take players on and the timing to run in behind defences and latch on to through balls.\u201cIn my career I\u2019ve only seen one or two players who have the characteristics of Veiga,\u201d said RC Celta coach Carlos Carvalhal, who has been in management for 25 years. \u201cHe is a very complete player. He has a different profile to all the other midfielders in Spain, who are usually about touch and possession. Gabri breaks games open.\u201dA player who can score different types of goalsAs Carvalhal alluded to, Veiga\u2019s qualities make him the ideal link between midfield and attack and his 11 goals this season showcased his various attributes.The two most eye-catching goals were his long-range rockets against Real Betis and UD Almer\u00eda, with the former being his first goal in front of the home fans at Bala\u00eddos, when he rounded three defenders before pinging the ball into the far bottom corner, while the latter goal was a thumping drive from outside the area with hardly any back-lift, which cannoned in off the crossbar. (LaLiga Celta Vigo CSM Gabri Veiga)His first goal had come against Atl\u00e9tico de Madrid, a first-time finish which crept in at the near post, while he produced an ice-cool shot to score against Sevilla FC after racing on to a through ball from Aspas.His best individual display yet, however, came in the thrilling 4-3 win at Real Betis earlier this month. He scored RC Celta\u2019s second goal with a cheeky lob right in front of goalkeeper Rui Silva after creating the danger himself with two clever headers. He then gave his side the lead by appearing at just the right time to knock in Jorgen Strand Larsen\u2019s cross from the byline.RecommendedJude Bellingham uses pain of England\u2019s near misses in bid for Euro 2024 glorySheikh Jassim waiting to hear if final offer to buy Man Utd has been successfulJoelinton: I received racist insults after Arsenal gameWhat next for Veiga?

He is in the U21 squad for this month\u2019s fixture against Mexico.An international debut is bound to further raise Veiga\u2019s profile and confirm what everyone at RC Celta already knows: that he has what it takes to make it to the very top."}, {"_id": "64889c5351ac339fc372aa38", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/alf-ramsey-jude-bellingham-england-gareth-southgate-bobby-moore-b2356516.html", "primaryCategory": "Football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Jude Bellingham uses pain of England\u2019s near misses in bid for Euro 2024 glory", "lead": "The national team are in the midst of their most successful period since Sir Alf Ramsey led Bobby Moore\u2019s heroes to World Cup glory in 1966.", "author": "Simon Peach", "datePublished": "Tue, 13 Jun 2023 10:00:03 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:41:55.782253", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-13T10:00:03+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/13/11/b2af8576834523b10641b90866f5f1eaY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg2NzI5MDQ1-2.72455162.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Miguel Delaney\u2019s Reading the Game newsletter sent straight to your inbox for freeSign up to Miguel\u2019s Delaney\u2019s free weekly newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

The last one was a bit disappointing, but we probably played a harder opponent than the previous ones.\u201cThe way we went out was disappointing, but you take confidence in the fact that you can go toe-to-toe with one of the better teams in Europe.\u201cIt stands you in good stead when you know there\u2019s not many better teams on paper \u2013 you\u2019d like to think \u2013 that are better than us.\u201cSo, you take that confidence and you take the experience that we\u2019ve gained from the last few.\u201cThe goal is always to try and win it. That should be the goal for all of us going into it and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll try and do.\u201dBellingham does not lack confidence and nor should he given England\u2019s performances in Qatar.A narrow defeat to eventual finalists and Euro 2024 favourites France did for Southgate\u2019s side in the desert, where the midfielder says their progress was no mirage.\u201cI felt so confident going into that France game that we\u2019d get a result,\u201d said Bellingham, speaking in his role as ambassador for McDonald\u2019s Fun Football programme \u2013 which provides free, inclusive football coaching for children aged five to 11 across more than 1,500 locations in the UK.\u201cI think probably we fell short in the big moments for their goals and obviously the penalties and moments like that.\u201cThe majority of the game we didn\u2019t have clear chances, but when we did, we could have been a bit more decisive maybe. But, like I said, it\u2019s an experience to take into the next ones.\u201cI just really enjoyed the experience as a whole \u2013 relishing being away, playing in such a good team, having that pressure on me and on the team. It\u2019s something that I really enjoyed.\u201dBellingham underlined his place as one of the greatest talents in the world in Qatar, flourishing in England\u2019s midfield after a restricted but valuable role at Euro 2020.Aged 17 he became the youngest English player to feature in a major tournament, making three substitute appearances in a crash course summer of learning.\u201cIt was a bit of weird one for me because I didn\u2019t play (much),\u201d Bellingham said. \u201cIt was my first major tournament and I didn\u2019t play too much.\u201cBut I was still like a sponge while I was there, trying to learn from everything that was going on around me, having it in England as well.\u201cYou could see the pressure up close almost and you went to the games and the atmosphere was incredible. We fell short at the final hurdle, so you take a lot of experience from that.\u201cBut there\u2019s also a level of\u2026not regret but motivation that you can take from the tournament.\u201cI think, for me, the pain that I felt after that final and after the World Cup will definitely drive me in the tournaments to come.\u201dYou certainly would not back against ambitious Bellingham and his talented England team-mates as they look to finally land silverware in Germany.\u201cI\u2019d just say stick with us, really,\u201d the 24-cap teenager said when asked what his message to supporters would be.\u201cEngland fans can feel it themselves, They\u2019re ambitious, but they\u2019re not stupid. There\u2019s a reason for the kind of expectation and the hype around the team at the minute.\u201cThe truth is that we are delivering.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeJulianna Pena has labelled Amanda Nunes a \u2018coward\u2019 for retiring at UFC 289.Nunes, 35, retained the bantamweight title with a points win over Irene Aldana on Saturday, before calling time on a career seen by many as the greatest in women\u2019s mixed martial arts history.One of the few blemishes on the Brazilian\u2019s career came in 2021, when Nunes \u2013 who also holds the UFC women\u2019s featherweight title \u2013 was submitted by Pena with the bantamweight belt on the line. Nunes avenged the upset loss by dominating the American in 2022, and the pair were due for a trilogy bout at UFC 289 until Pena withdrew due to injury.Pena, 33, was in attendance in Vancouver to see Nunes retire, and the former champion said on The MMA Hour on Monday: \u201cThere was a part of me that really wanted to storm the cage. I had so many people like, \u2018Yes, we\u2019ll do it, we\u2019ll throw you over the gate!\u2019 Then my coach was like, \u2018Don\u2019t do it. Be classy and don\u2019t do it.\u2019 So, I let her have my moment, but it was really difficult for me, because there were so many times where my urge was to go, \u2018Now is the time, go, go go.\u2019\u201cBut at the end of the day, she\u2019s retired, she\u2019s off in the sunset, she\u2019s dead to me at this point, and we\u2019ve just got to keep the division moving. Now we\u2019re stepping into day one of the \u2018Pena Power\u2019 era.

They said, \u2018She doesn\u2019t want to fight you.\u2019 That\u2019s why it took so long to book the trilogy, and when I fell out because of injury, she said it was \u2018less heavy\u2019 for her. \u201cHopefully she comes back.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeWith the 2022/23 season completed and Premier League clubs now focused on the summer transfer window, WhoScored.com take a look at which players suit each team\u2019s biggest need over the next eight weeks.You can see the first part from Arsenal to Fulham here.LiverpoolWhat do they need - central midfielderWho should they sign - Manu KoneLiverpool have signed Alexis Mac Allister from Brighton, but the Argentine won't be the only new central midfielder to make the move to Anfield this summer. Khephren Thuram and Manu Kone are also on the club's radar, with the latter the latest to be linked with a switch. Kone returned the seventh best dribble success rate (60%) in the Bundesliga last season, while he ranked 10th for possession won in the midfield third (109) and 15th for tackles per 90 (2.5) with the Gladbach star emerging as one of Liverpool's top midfield targets.RecommendedHow Jude Bellingham can become the anti-Haaland for Real MadridAlexis Mac Allister believes he can add to trophy collection with LiverpoolReplacement for Granit Xhaka and a No9 for Mauricio Pochettino: Transfer targets for every Premier League clubLutonWhat do they need - strikerWho should they sign - Antonio-Mirko ColakCarlton Morris was the leading light in Luton's successful play-off push having scored 20 league goals for the Hatters last season. However, beyond Morris, Luton have few attacking alternatives to ease the burden on the 27-year-old. For context, centre-back Tom Lockyer was their third-highest scorer, with four goals. Promoted teams often make the mistake of prioritising attack over defence, but Luton can ill-afford to rely on Morris to keep them up. Antonio-Mirko Colak started the Scottish Premiership season brightly, and ultimately ended the campaign with 14 league goals, but injuries hampered his long-term impact, so much so that he hasn't started a league game since March. The Croat could prove a crucial signing in the final third were they to make a move for the Rangers man.Manchester CityWhat do they need - right wingerWho should they sign - Wilfried GnontoWhile a team chasing a historic treble is unlikely to really need to strengthen in the off-season, Manchester City could certainly use the summer to bring in another right winger. Riyad Mahrez is now the wrong side of 30, and while a success under Pep Guardiola, the champions need to plan for life beyond the Algerian. Relegated Leeds will be aware they need to cut costs, with Wilfried Gnonto a sellable asset on the books at Elland Road. The Italy international works hard off the ball, too, as evidenced by a return of 1.8 tackles per 90, and this would certainly appease Guardiola.Manchester UnitedWhat do they need - strikerWho should they sign - Rasmus HojlundHarry Kane may be the priority for Erik ten Hag as the Manchester United boss seeks an overhaul of his attack, but with Real Madrid also interested in the Tottenham hitman, the Carabao Cup winners can't afford to be dragged into a bidding war. Rather, they should focus their efforts on securing the services of star-in-the-making Rasmus Hojlund. The Dane ended the 2022/23 Serie A season with a respectable nine goals and two assists to his name despite starting just 20 of 38 league matches. At 20 years of age, there is more to come from Hojlund, and fans should be desperate to see the Atalanta man develop into a world-class striker at Old Trafford.Rasmus Hojlund has impressed for Atalanta (AP)NewcastleWhat do they need - attacking midfielderWho should they sign - James MaddisonFollowing their Champions League return, Newcastle need to add quality bodies to the squad as they gear up to compete on multiple fronts following a successful season under Eddie Howe. James Maddison is one linked with a move to St. James' Park and having scored 10 and provided nine assists, the 26-year-old certainly proved his worth for a relegated Leicester side. Able to cover a number of roles in the final third, Newcastle won't have a straight shot at Maddison, but he's one who'd boost their chances of another top-four finish and silverware next season.Nottingham ForestWhat do they need - goalkeeperWho should they sign - Dean HendersonNottingham Forest were fortunate enough to convince Keylor Navas to join on loan from PSG in January to ease Dean Henderson's injury, though the Costa Rican is unlikely to make a permanent switch to the City Ground. As such, Forest should explore the possibility of signing Henderson once the transfer window opens. The 26-year-old is unlikely to establish himself as first choice at parent club Manchester United, who themselves are looking to sign a new shot-stopper, so would be open to Henderson's sale.Sheffield UnitedWhat do they need - attacking midfielderWho should they sign - Carney ChukwuemekaWhile it remains to be seen whether Sheffield United can retain the services of on-loan Manchester City pair James McAtee and Tommy Doyle, the Blades could maximise the loan market once more in order to bring fresh blood into the side. Chelsea spent big to sign Carney Chukwuemeka from Aston Villa, and he is very much one for the future. However, he needs game time to continue his development, something that may prove hard to come by at Stamford Bridge next season. New boss Mauricio Pochettino will likely want a first look at Chukwuemeka before making a decision on his future, but if the Blades are unable to keep McAtee and Doyle, the former Aston Villa teenager would help ease their respective returns to City.TottenhamWhat do they need - goalkeeperWho should they sign - David RayaTottenham are set to undergo a major rebuild this summer under Ange Postecoglou, and the best position to start is in goal. Hugo Lloris is set to leave north London, so the Frenchman's successor should be the priority. A ball-playing goalkeeper is key, with David Raya rightly their number one target. Brentford have already signed Raya's replacement in Mark Flekken, and that may soften their stance on the Spaniard. The 27-year-old ranked first for saves (154) and third for accurate long balls (410) in Europe's top five leagues this season, and could prove the perfect new goalkeeper for Spurs.Brentford goalkeeper David Raya is wanted by Tottenham (PA Wire)West HamWhat do they need - central midfielderWho should they sign - James Ward-ProwseGiven Declan Rice's likely exit once West Ham's Europa Conference League campaign is done and dusted, the Hammers will need a new midfielder to ease the England international's exit. West Ham will command a huge fee for Rice, so they need to be wise in the summer market in order not to be priced out of a move for a successor. That being said, Southampton will likely have demanded a big price for James Ward-Prowse anyway, with the Saints captain set to leave on the back of their relegation. The 28-year-old ranked seventh for key passes (74) in the Premier League last season and he could prove the right player to help pick up the pieces if, or when, Rice departs.WolvesWhat do they need - strikerRecommendedTalking points as England look to turn tables on Australia in Women\u2019s AshesKylian Mbappe alerts Premier League clubs with surprise announcement about his futureJack Grealish revels as Manchester City parade trebleWho should they sign - Folarin BalogunLike Chelsea, Wolves' primary issue was the inability to hit the back of net. Indeed, they scored fewer goals (31) than any other Premier League side last season, and with Raul Jimenez and Diego Costa unlikely to be Wolves players once the summer window closes, they need investment in attack. If they can convince Arsenal to sell Folarin Balogun, then the USA international could be what they need to reignite their stagnant frontline. Balogun scored 21 league goals from Reims last season and after a taste of regular first-team action, is unlikely to settle for a spot on the bench at the Emirates. RB Leipzig had been linked with a move for the 21-year-old, but their decision to firm up their interest in Lens hitman Lois Openda means Wolves may yet have a chance to sign Balogun."}, {"_id": "64889c5551ac339fc372aa3e", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league-transfer-news-arsenal-chelsea-b2355891.html", "primaryCategory": "Football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Replacement for Granit Xhaka and a No9 for Mauricio Pochettino: Transfer targets for every Premier League club", "lead": "<p>From Arsenal through to Fulham, here are the first ten top-flight teams and the players they should sign </p>", "author": "Ben McAleer", "datePublished": "Tue, 13 Jun 2023 09:06:47 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:41:57.069810", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-13T09:06:47+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/12/13/Collage%20Maker-12-Jun-2023-01-08-PM-793.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Miguel Delaney\u2019s Reading the Game newsletter sent straight to your inbox for freeSign up to Miguel\u2019s Delaney\u2019s free weekly newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

First up: from Arsenal to Fulham.ArsenalWhat do they need - central midfielderWho should they sign - Moises CaicedoWith Granit Xhaka set for a Bundesliga return, Arsenal need at least two central midfielders this summer. Declan Rice remains the priority for the Gunners, yet the West Ham star can\u2019t be the only middle man that arrives this summer ahead of their return to the Champions League. Moises Caicedo is another linked with Arsenal and would offer an ball-carrying outlet from deep as well as terrific defensive capabilities to help fill the void that will be left once Xhaka departs.RecommendedTalking points as England look to turn tables on Australia in Women\u2019s AshesKylian Mbappe alerts Premier League clubs with surprise announcement about his futureJack Grealish revels as Manchester City parade trebleAston VillaWhat do they need - wingerWho should they sign - Harvey BarnesHaving secured a return to European football on the final day of the season, Aston Villa are aware they need to add strength in depth in the off-season ahead of Unai Emery\u2019s first full season at the Villa Park helm. A right-back, winger and striker are the priorities for the Villans this summer, with Harvey Barnes one who\u2019ll tick off a problem position. Barnes\u2019 goal exploits were overshadowed by James Maddison\u2019s form, but the 25-year-old still managed an commendable 13 league goals for the relegated Foxes.BournemouthWhat do the need - central midfielderWho should they sign - Tyler Adams (PA Wire)Bournemouth boss Gary O\u2019Neil worked wonders in the Cherries hotseat following his appointment as Scott Parker\u2019s successor, but if they are to avoid a relegation dogfight, they need to strengthen in key areas. One of those will be in the middle of the park, particularly with Jefferson Lerma departing following the culmination of his contract. Bournemouth could do a lot worse than raid relegated Leeds for Tyler Adams, the American having ranked third for tackles per 90 (3.7) in the Premier League last season.BrentfordWhat do they need - strikerWho should they sign - Viktor GyokeresIvan Toney\u2019s suspension leaves Brentford a little light up top. Granted, while the Bees have performed well in his absence, they can\u2019t head into the new season without the services of their 20-goal frontman until January. While a short-term addition would suit all parties, Brentford may instead seek to bring Viktor Gyokeres up to the Premier League. Coventry\u2019s failure to secure promotion means the Swede is seemingly up for grabs and having scored 21 and provided 12 assists last season, Thomas Frank\u2019s side would certainly benefit from the 25-year-old\u2019s addition.BrightonWhat do they need - central midfielderWho should they sign - Enzo Le FeeBrighton are set to lose both Alexis Mac Allister and Moises Caicedo this summer and while Mahmoud Dahoud and James Milner are tipped to arrive, the Seagulls still look a little light in the middle of the park. Enzo Le Fee was a standout performer for Lorient this season, yet will depart the French side in the coming weeks, and Brighton would be foolish not to consider the 23-year-old. Le Fee ranked third for tackles (108) and seventh for dribbles (68) in the 2022/23 Ligue 1 campaign, while an additional five goals and five assists has helped boost his reputation.BurnleyWhat do they need - central midfielderWho should they sign - Albert Sambi-LokongaBurnley will need an overhaul in central midfield this summer. They can\u2019t rely on 33-year-old Jack Cork to help beat the drop next season, and so a player who has worked under Vincent Kompany in the past would be a viable option for the Clarets. Albert Sambi-Lokonga spent the second half of last season on loan at Crystal Palace, though still struggled for minutes at Selhurst Park. Arsenal are unlikely to rely upon Lokonga next season, noted by their pursuit of high-profile midfielders, so another short-term move would certainly benefit the Belgian.ChelseaWhat do they need - strikerWho should they sign - Victor Osimhen (AP)To put it bluntly - Chelsea need a player to put the ball in the back of the net. Christopher Nkunku is set to sign for the Blues, but another striker would certainly aid their quest to launch a sustained title push under Mauricio Pochettino. Victor Osimhen wouldn\u2019t come cheap, the Nigerian having scored more goals (26) than any other player in Serie A this season, yet with Todd Boehly willing to loosen the purse strings, Osimhen could prove the perfect frontman for Chelsea, and one to rid them of the dreaded No.9 curse.Crystal PalaceWhat do they need - right-backWho should they sign - Sacha BoeyCrystal Palace were able to muddle through the season with Joel Ward and Nathaniel Clyne at right-back, but the pair are now 33 and 32 years of age, respectively, and the Eagles could do with some investment in defence ahead of the new season. While he has been linked with Arsenal, Sacha Boey could prove a shrewd capture for the Eagles. The 22-year-old was key in Galatasaray\u2019s title triumph and has made the second most tackles (86) in the Super Lig this season, so a committed body to shore up the defence would certainly be welcomed at Selhurst Park.EvertonWhat do they need - strikerWho should they sign - Alfredo Morelos (Getty Images)Everton have been linked with a move for Wout Weghorst, the Dutchman having worked under Sean Dyche during their short time together at Turf Moor, as the Toffees seek to sign another striker. However, Weghorst has a poor record in England having scored just two goals in 37 league appearances, so they may be better off perusing the free market. Alfredo Morelos will leave Rangers this summer upon the culmination of his contract and having scored 11 goals and provided five assists in the Scottish Premiership last season, the hot-headed Colombian could prove a handy pick up.FulhamWhat do they need - centre-backWho should they sign - Harry MaguireRecommendedManchester City\u2019s trophy parade in picturesRain and threat of lightning fail to dampen Manchester City\u2019s trophy paradeEverton fans get their wish as club \u2018sack the board\u2019Centre-back is hardly a problem position for Fulham, with Tim Ream, Tosin Adarabioyo and Issa Diop all performing admirably for the Cottagers as they beat the drop last season, but with the former now 35, some fresh blood would benefit Marco Silva\u2019s side. Harry Maguire is unlikely to be a Manchester United player once the summer transfer window closes and with their ongoing pursuit of Kim Min-Jae, the England international is expected to leave sooner rather than later. If his England performances are anything to go by, Maguire could prove a solid addition to the Fulham defence, while a fresh start would certainly benefit the 30-year-old.Part two: the ten Premier League teams from Liverpool to Wolves."}, {"_id": "64889c5551ac339fc372aa3f", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/cricket/australia-heather-knight-england-womens-ashes-trent-bridge-b2356483.html", "primaryCategory": "Cricket", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Talking points as England look to turn tables on Australia in Women\u2019s Ashes", "lead": "The series begins next point with a one-off Test at Trent Bridge.", "author": "David Charlesworth", "datePublished": "Tue, 13 Jun 2023 09:00:30 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:41:57.273598", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-13T09:00:30+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/13/10/74ab9976926acd9c8a253cf6a1865a73Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg2NDc3MzUy-2.44210167.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free sport newsletter for all the latest news on everything from cycling to boxingSign up to our free sport email for all the latest news\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeEngland will attempt to end a miserable past few years in the Women\u2019s Ashes and topple Australia for the first time since 2013-14 when the multi-format series starts next week.Here, the PA news agency assesses some of the burning issues ahead of the curtain-raising one-off Test at Trent Bridge which begins next Thursday.The greatest showHeather Knight recently harked back to making her England debut in Mumbai in 2010 \u201cin front of one man and his dog\u201d and, as a student, having to explain to her tutor why she would be absent for a month. Thankfully those days are over. The England captain was given equal billing alongside men\u2019s counterpart Ben Stokes on a Tower Bridge projection last week and ticket sales for the \u2018WAshes\u2019 have already exceeded a combined 70,000 for the seven matches. Even if there is still just a solitary Test, it will span five days in a break from the customary four-day affair \u2013 giving both teams a chance to claim a first Ashes win in whites since 2015. Barriers continue to be breached for Knight\u2019s side as they will also play T20s at Edgbaston, the Kia Oval and Lord\u2019s for the first time.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveLanning absence evens the odds?Issy Wong may have only played on 13 occasions for England but the fast bowler seems to revel in being tormentor-in-(mis)chief, remarking last month about Australia: \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty good time to play them.\u201d On the surface, this seems a peculiar comment given Australia\u2019s all-out dominance for much of the last decade. They are the double world champions and have held the urn for the last eight years, beating England on their own patch twice in that time. But there is a little substance to Wong\u2019s claims with Rachael Haynes retiring last year and now totemic captain Meg Lanning withdrawing from the upcoming series due to medical issues. Are Australia more vulnerable now? Unquestionably. Lanning is an exceptional captain and batter who has been in red-hot form. But her temporary successor Alyssa Healy is also a quality player, as are Ellyse Perry, Tahlia McGrath, Beth Mooney, Ashleigh Gardner and Jess Jonassen. Australia are still overwhelming favourites to continue their stranglehold over England.Who is the leader of England\u2019s attack?While Wong\u2019s slightly provocative observation was rooted in Australia selecting one or two more unproven talents, England also look a little light in certain areas. Katherine Sciver-Brunt may have had a peripheral role given her scaling back of commitments but the seamer\u2019s retirement robs England of crucial experience. Wong has shown in the last 12 months she can step up and be counted when the heat is on \u2013 notably at this year\u2019s Women\u2019s Premier League \u2013 so it may be the 21-year-old steps into the considerable void left by Sciver-Brunt. Fellow quick Kate Cross\u2019 battle against a tropical disease has cut into her playing time so she may not be up to speed for the Test while Lauren Bell is relatively untested.\u2018Jonball\u2019 faces its acid testSince succeeding Lisa Keightley as England head coach late last year, Jon Lewis has attempted to instil a more attacking mindset into his charges. Lewis has taken his cues from working alongside Brendon McCullum and Ben Stokes in the embryonic stages of the pair transforming the men\u2019s Test side, sensing this is the best way to break Australia\u2019s stranglehold on women\u2019s cricket. \u2018Jonball\u2019 \u2013 the term coined by star all-rounder Nat Sciver-Brunt \u2013 has had modest returns so far with a semi-final exit at the 2023 T20 World Cup but it seems England will keep ploughing the same furrow when Australia are in town.RecommendedRob Page says Wrexham\u2019s Paul Mullin must prove himself in EFL to earn Wales callNothing is going to change \u2013 Ben Stokes vows to stay true to beliefs in AshesFootball rumours: Arsenal closing in on Declan Rice for club-record feePressure on Heather?The decision to jettison Charlotte Edwards and promote Knight as England captain a little over seven years ago was controversial at the time. But barely 12 months into the role, Knight justified her ascension by leading England to a seminal World Cup triumph. She has been unable to land a telling blow in the Ashes, with one drawn series and two heavy points defeats. A third this summer might draw scrutiny on her position even if Australia are one of the greatest sides of all time in women\u2019s sport. Knight remains the natural leader of this England team and her authoritative presence was missed at the sharp end of last year\u2019s Commonwealth Games, a tournament she sat out because of injury."}, {"_id": "64889c5551ac339fc372aa40", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/us-sport/tori-bowie-cause-of-death-baby-autopsy-b2356371.html", "primaryCategory": "US Sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Tori Bowie: Pregnant US Olympic sprinter\u2019s cause of death revealed", "lead": "<p>US athlete was found dead in Florida after police carried out welfare check </p>", "author": "Graeme Massie", "datePublished": "Tue, 13 Jun 2023 08:39:50 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:41:57.491434", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-13T08:39:50+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/05/03/15/Three-time%20Olympic%20medallist%20Tori%20Bowie%2C%20dies%20aged%20320A.00_00_00_00.Still001.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free sport newsletter for all the latest news on everything from cycling to boxingSign up to our free sport email for all the latest news\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe final day of the Premier League season saw only the relegation battle still outstanding to be sorted, ultimately with Leeds United and Leicester City joining Southampton in dropping down to the Championship - while Everton, again, survived.Naturally there will be plenty of off-field developments at each of the relegated sides, with Leeds a good example after the agreement of a club sale to the owners of the San Francisco 49ers. Alongside that, the natural implication of failing to survive in the top flight is that bigger clubs will come calling for those players deemed too good to go down.Rumours have already circulated around a number of those names and Youri Tielemans has already agreed to join Aston Villa after deparing Leicester; here are 12 more who could easily attract a move to a top-flight club this summer if their present sides feel the need to sell to balance the books after departing the richest league on the planet.James Ward-ProwseStarting with the side who are already gone, central midfielder and dead-ball expert Ward-Prowse will certainly be in demand. An England international, the 28-year-old hasn\u2019t been at his best this term but failings around him haven\u2019t helped. Still has eight goals and four assists in a dismal team, and it\u2019s hard to see him spending even a season in the Championship.RecommendedPremier League 2022/23 season awards: Best player, manager, transfer flop and breakthrough actAston Villa sign Youri Tielemans from LeicesterMan City secure landmark Champions League victory that stretches beyond historic trebleArmel Bella-KotchapWhile Saints\u2019 defensive unit as a whole has been far too porous, individually there are a couple of players who have impressed. Centre-back Bella-Kotchap is one, with some tenacious displays earning him strong reviews earlier in the campaign. Put him alongside a more experienced player in a more cohesive unit and it\u2019s safe to say his career is on an upward trajectory.Romeo Lavia (Getty Images)Another recent recruit, teenage midfielder Lavia is already interesting plenty of top-half clubs who have been impressed with his tactical intelligence as much as his ferocious defensive work, overstretched as he has been in the middle of the park and even with one or two errors on show, as is usual for young players. Considering this was a rookie season for him in the top flight he has acquitted himself very well and the Belgian is already capped at senior international level.Kyle Walker-PetersNot so much a star for the future this time, but Walker-Peters has long since proven his capabilities in the Premier League. Add in his versatility and the fact he has only two years left on his contract and this summer seems the right one for any clubs keen on him to make their move.Kamaldeen SulemanaOf all the January arrivals who failed to impact at Saints, former Rennes man Sulemana might be the biggest disappointment - and therefore potentially the bargain with the biggest upside. At age 21 there\u2019s a long runway for improvement for the Ghanaian, who can play wide or central in attack and showed what he\u2019s capable of on the final day with a brace against Liverpool - but then again perhaps a season as a guaranteed starter would actually prove more beneficial for him in the long run. If Saints keep hold of him he should be a standout star in the Championship.James MaddisonMoving onto the teams still fighting for survival, James Maddison looks to be one who might move on regardless of the final day. The creative attacker is certainly playing at a higher level than most of his Leicester teammates and has already been linked with the likes of Newcastle. Perhaps the only real factor at play here is the transfer fee; the Foxes might be able to ask for significantly more if they do beat the drop.Kiernan Dewsbury-HallMight be one Leicester hope to hang onto even if they are in the second tier, given he has a very long-term contract, but Dewsbury-Hall is almost certain to have top-flight admirers. Energetic, diligent in both halves of the pitch and with a sprinkling of magic about his play, the 24-year-old is too good for the Championship but might be too pricey to prise away.Harvey BarnesFinishing up at the Foxes, Harvey Barnes is already a known target - the Independentreported Aston Villa\u2019s keen interest in the left-sided attacking outlet this week. Despite Leicester\u2019s struggles he has 12 goals to his name this season and with two years remaining on his deal it\u2019s probably time to make a step up, since even if they survive this weekend, his club don\u2019t look like mounting a real revival any time soon.Timothy CastagneFar more wing-back than full-back, Timothy Castagne is a versatile defender who has had an up-and-down time at Leicester to be kind - but Arsenal have already reportedly eyed him up as a squad booster this summer, maybe on the cheap. The 27-year-old was a big-money recruit three years ago, and still has two years left on his deal. But relegation, along with the financial struggles the club have had over the past year or so, will lower the amount the Foxes can ask for.Tyler Adams (AP)Onto Leeds and the first probable departure is American midfield dynamo Tyler Adams. An excellent ball-winner, ball-carrier and team leader in the centre of the park, it\u2019s unthinkable he\u2019d drop down into the second division. An injury absence at the end of this season hasn\u2019t helped Leeds at all but he has long since shown himself a top performer.Luis SinisterraGiven the ability of some of their players, it\u2019s a bit of a wonder Leeds are down there at all - until you watch some of the defensive work, at least. At the other end of the pitch it can be a very different matter though and Sinisterra is another who, having fought around the top of the Eredivisie for Feyenoord before a \u00a325m last summer, surely won\u2019t be a Championship player. Injuries have hampered him this term but he\u2019s electric when fit.RecommendedKylian Mbappe alerts Premier League clubs with surprise announcement about his futureJack Grealish revels as Manchester City parade trebleManchester City\u2019s trophy parade in picturesWilfried GnontoOne of the bargains of the season, Leeds signed the Italian for about \u00a34m in September and he is a real gem in the making. Given the length of his deal and the fact he\u2019s only 19, perhaps he\u2019s one of those they\u2019ll hope to keep and shoot straight back up with - but other, bigger clubs have been impressed this season by Gnonto, make no mistake. He\u2019s already a senior goalscorer for Italy; he probably isn\u2019t going to be keen on facing Rotherham and Hull next term."}, {"_id": "64889c5551ac339fc372aa42", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/ryan-reynolds-rob-mcelhenney-wrexham-preseason-b2356424.html", "primaryCategory": "Football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney confirm Wrexham USA tour to conclude in star\u2019s hometown", "lead": "<p>The Hollywood stars took over the non-league team and have overseen a promotion back to League Two </p>", "author": "Karl Matchett", "datePublished": "Tue, 13 Jun 2023 08:01:26 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:41:57.953154", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-13T08:01:26+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/13/08/GettyImages-1484215085%20%281%29.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Miguel Delaney\u2019s Reading the Game newsletter sent straight to your inbox for freeSign up to Miguel\u2019s Delaney\u2019s free weekly newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeMatt Fitzpatrick admits to being as confused as anyone about the direction golf is heading but insists it will not affect his thinking when he begins the defence of his US Open title on Thursday.The dust is still settling a week on from the shock announcement of the commercial merger between the PGA Tour, DP World Tour and PIF (Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund), which has been the backer of the breakaway LIV Golf.On the face of it golf\u2019s bitter civil war appears to be over but under the surface there are many so-far unanswered questions and residual feelings of resentment by a large section of the two main tours\u2019 membership at how they have been treated in the whole saga.But although several days have passed since PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan went on live network television in the United States with PIF governor Yasir Al-Rumayyan to announce the surprise deal there are very few details about how things will work, and that has led to dissent among the rank and file.\u201cI guess the whole thing is confusing. It was confusing last year,\u201d said the Sheffield golfer, who swerved a question about whether those players who remained loyal to the established tours should be suitably compensated for missing out on LIV\u2019s millions.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow live\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone knows what\u2019s going on. Are we signing with the PIF? Are we not signing with the PIF? I have no idea.\u201cEven though I guess it is confusing, it\u2019s pretty clear that nobody knows what\u2019s going on apart from about four people in the world.\u201dThat will not cloud his thought process when it comes to mounting a defence of his breakthrough major title from Brookline 12 months ago.\u201cYou\u2019re thinking, \u2018It\u2019s a par four, where do I need to hit it? Where is the wind?\u2019 That\u2019s all you\u2019re thinking about.\u201dFitzpatrick will have plenty of things to think about at the Los Angeles Country Club, which he last saw in February on a reconnaissance mission.\u201cNo, I think it\u2019s over-rated.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe smallest sibling of the Primavera Sound superbrand, Porto\u2019s edition of the music festival sometimes feels as if it receives the headliner hand-me-downs of its Barcelona brother.This year, there\u2019s Blur, Halsey, Kendrick Lamar, Fred Again and Spanish superstar Rosalia \u2013 but Portugal misses out on a sprinkling of the big names who performed in Spain only days earlier, including Calvin Harris, Depeche Mode, and Christine and the Queens. To add insult to injury, all of those artists are on the bill for a third Primavera festival this year \u2013 the newcomer Primavera Madrid, which celebrates its first-ever outing the same weekend.Madrid\u2019s debut turns to disaster on 8 June when \u201csevere\u201d weather forces organisers to cancel the opening day. Thankfully, Porto avoids the same fate \u2013 but notably, not the torrential rain. There are other unfortunate glitches, not least a power failure during headliners New Order, interrupting a weekend that otherwise mostly delivers on its promise. Wednesday\u2019s headliner Kendrick Lamar is a spectacular live performer, although not the kind who spends much time interacting with the crowd. The rapper\u2019s set list spans 2011\u2019s woozy \u201cADHD\u201d and 2012\u2019s propulsive \u201cm.A.A.d city\u201d, plus covers of Pusha T\u2019s \u201cNosetalgia\u201d and The Weeknd\u2019s \u201cSidewalks\u201d. It\u2019s a crowd-pleasing concoction and one that would be even more pleasurable if we got a bit more from Lamar himself, especially given that his performance coincides with the most punishing downpour of the weekend, sucking the energy (and a decent chunk of the crowd) from the festival site.The following day brings better weather and, in fact, when the storm does return, it adds some drama to Fred Again\u2019s set during which the rainfall peaks amid the driving bassline of \u201cRumble\u201d. Perhaps it\u2019s the water or maybe it\u2019s his enthusiastic delivery, but Fred\u2019s pad controller breaks midway through his set, leaving him punching madly at buttons like a tweaking velociraptor, as samples fail to land in time. A replacement is quickly found.Recommended\u2018This is something we can continue to invest in\u2019: The future of live-streaming and festivalsThe 14 best music festivals in Europe, from Primavera Sound to Rock WerchterThe 11 best music festivals in the UK for 2023Thursday\u2019s headliner Rosalia is, by some margin, the highlight of the weekend. She is an innovative artist who manages to produce a pop vision that is at once so singular, confident, kooky, warm and feminine that it is strikingly out of step with her peers. On stage with her is an extremely zealous Steadicam operator who she pulls around like a giant hi-res selfie stick, beaming down the lens hypnotically. Whether she\u2019s swooning on the piano in huge single \u201cHentai\u201d or riding in circles with her scooter gang for \u201cChicken Teriyaki\u201d, nobody is having more fun. By Friday, the rain eases and the tension fades. Pusha T is known on record for possessing one of the coldest deliveries around, but his set is a total crowd-pleaser. The rapper flits from the 21-year-old Neptunes hit \u201cGrindin\u2019\u201d, taken from his Clipse days, to the Future single \u201cMove That Dope\u201d, and even a verse from Kanye West\u2019s \u201cRunaway\u201d.The stage is set for the Pet Shop Boys, who walk the line between cringe and cool better than anyone in pop. Tonight they are sensational, with outfit changes that include an iridescent mirrored anorak and a volley of singalong hits including \u201cCan You Forgive Her?\u201d, \u201cWhere The Streets Have No Name\u201d and \u201cLeft to My Own Devices\u201d.

To the abrasive boinging of the opening riff on \u201cPopscene\u201d, he bounds around the stage pumping his fist with a dynamism belying his 55 years. Alex James smokes his signature cigarette. It\u2019s a nostalgic set of no-nonsense and no filler that includes \u201cThere\u2019s No Other Way\u201d, \u201cGirls and Boys\u201d, \u201cCoffee and TV\u201d, \u201cSong 2\u201d and the soaring \u201cThis is a Low\u201d.

With its late-night headliners and limited shelter, this is an event optimised for sunshine. I am no irrigation expert, but I am far from the only one to notice that the rainfall streaming downhill from the tarmac to the grass of the main stage has mingled unappealingly with piss. By Friday, the main stage has marinated into a muddy bayou that wafts zephyrs of ammonia through the crowd. The toilets are finally closed on Sunday night, but a fishy odour hangs in the air throughout Blur\u2019s set.Primavera\u2019s line-up remains peerless, but this execution was a little out of step for what is considered by many to be the highlight of the entire global festival season. It\u2019s possible the team were spread too thin by their transition to three events and caught out by the surprise weather.

After two roundly well-received seasons in 2021 and 2022, Acapulco was renewed for a third run of episodes earlier this year.Access unlimited streaming of movies and TV shows with Amazon Prime Video Sign up now for a 30-day free trialSign upMy Kind of CountryReality TV has rightly been getting a bad rap lately, with singing competitions such as The X Factor or Britain\u2019s Got Talent coming under fire for their harsh treatment of contestants. This Reese Witherspoon and Kacey Musgraves-produced talent show, however, is a welcome respite. Judges Jimmie Allen, Mickey Guyton and Orville Peck nurture a roster of aspiring country singers through the rounds of this uplifting series, which subverts a lot of problematic time-worn trends about who gets to become a country music star.PlatonicIn Platonic, Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne play Will and Sylvia, two former best friends who reconnect in their early 40s after Will gets a divorce. There\u2019s much to like about this sitcom, which plays out with a Nora Ephron-esque lightness of touch. Rogen and Byrne, who formerly starred together in Bad Neighbours, make for an electric \u2013 and, as the title asserts, platonic \u2013 couple, while the series itself has plenty to say about life, relationships and ageing.Just friends: Rose Byrne and Seth Rogen in \u2018Platonic\u2019 (Apple TV+)RecommendedTom Holland works hard in clich\u00e9d, generic series The Crowded Room\u00a0\u2013 reviewThe best Apple TV+ shows to watch nowEmmy Rossum defends playing 27-year-old Tom Holland\u2019s motherLittle AmericaDeveloped by The Big Sick\u2019s husband-wife team of Kumail Nanjiani and Emily V Gordon alongside Jury Duty\u2019s Lee Eisenberg, this anthology drama series follows true stories rooted in the American immigrant experience.

Read our\u00a0privacy notice\u201cClash\u201d is a word that can cause any Glastonbury ticketowner to break out in cold sweats.When organisers first release the poster, which is fit to bursting musicians booked to perform at the Worthy Farm festival, there is nothing more fun than putting together a list of all the performances you plan on seeing.But then the set times are announced, and you come to the crushing realisation that you may have to skip a few of your favourites.Below, we run through the biggest clashes at the 2023 festival.However, don\u2019t fret \u2013\u00a0we\u2019ve also worked out some possible workarounds, meaning you may be able to see at least some of the sets you\u2019re sad about missing.RecommendedGlastonbury 2023: Full line up and stage timesGlastonbury Festival 2023: How to watch the BBC\u2019s live coverageFoo Fighters drop huge hint for mystery Glastonbury band in touching fan letterFriday 23 JuneArctic Monkeys (10pm-11.45pm) vs Hot Chip (10.20-11.30pm)Warpaint (9pm-10pm) vs Sparks (9.15pm-10.15pm)It\u2019s no stretch to assume that those wanting to witness Sheffield quartet Arctic Monkeys\u2019 third headline set since 2007 would have also liked to have bopped along to synthpop heroes Hot Chip. Sadly, this won\u2019t be able to happen unless you ditch Arctic Monkeys midway through their performance. Elsewhere, two titans battling for your attentions are Warpaint and Sparks, an unfortunate clash that will no doubt cause headaches among fans of both. The workaround here is watching half of Warpaint\u2019s set on Woodsies before trekking 15-20 minutes to Park Stage to catch the end of Sparks. You\u2019ll have to sneak around the back of the crowd, though, as Park notoriously gets busy once the first performance kicks off.Saturday 24 JuneLana Del Rey (10.30-11.45) vs Christine and the Queens (10.30-11.45)Rina Sawayama (9pm-10pm) vs Melanie C (9.35pm-10.35pm)Lewis Capaldi (5.35pm-6.35pm) vs Maggie Rodgers (5.15pm-6.15pm)Christine and the Queens  (Christopher Victorio/Shutterstock)Three huge clashes occur on the Saturday, the chief of which is perhaps Other Stage and Woodsides headliners Lana Del Rey and Christine and the Queens, who play at exactly the same time. This is yet another example of a head-scratching slice of scheduling that may or may not have been decided in an attempt to split the crowds, which last year somewhat marred the Glasto experience. Melanie C returns to Worthy Farm after a heroic welcome in 2021 \u2013 however, scheduling her at the same time as Rina Sawayama is a particularly cruel move as it\u2019s understandable that fanbases of each would have enjoyed watching both sets. ]We suggest leaving Sawayama after 30 minutes to catch the end of Melanie C. Similarly, those wanting to watch two exceptionally good singers croon away on a lazy afternoon will have to pick their fighters out of Lewis Capaldi and Maggie Rodgers. Whoever you select, if the sun is shining, it could be a terrific calm before the storm (hopefully metaphorical) that is the Saturday night of Glastonbury. Our suggestion? Pick one and enjoy them.Sunday 25 JuneElton John (9pm-11.05pm) vs Queens of the Stone Age (9.45pm-11.15pm)Phoenix (9.30pm-10.45pm) vs Alt-J (9.15pm-10.15pm)It\u2019s feasible that fans of all genres of music would opt to see Elton John considering it\u2019s \u2013 let\u2019s call it what it is \u2013 a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. However, the singer, who finally headlines the Pyramid Stage after a five-decade career, will test prospective viewers\u2019 loyalties: Queens of the Stone Age, Phoenix and Alt-J are all playing at the same time.

Though apologists may try to plead \u201cstylistic risk-taking\u201d, Cage\u2019s work in the 2006 Wicker Man remake remains near the bottom of the pile \u2013 an exercise in rural horror that comes across as laughable excess.

Berry at the time was in the pomp of her stardom, having won the Academy Award for Best Actress just a few years previously. In its own ignominious way, Berry\u2019s Catwoman turn was also award-worthy: she picked up her Golden Raspberry award in person, joking in her light-hearted acceptance speech: \u201cIn order to give a really bad performance like I did, you need a lot of bad actors around you.\u201d Berry in the critically panned \u2018Catwoman\u2019  (Warner Bros/Dc Comics/Kobal/Shutterstock)Al Pacino \u2013 Jack and Jill (2011)One of the greatest actors to have ever lived, Al Pacino has nonetheless been known to give his fair share of questionable (over-)performances throughout the years. However, there\u2019s none that quite stick in the craw quite so jarringly as his brief cameo in the bleakly bad Adam Sandler vehicle Jack and Jill. Playing himself, Pacino mugs his way through a musical advertisement for a beverage called a \u201cdunkaccino\u201d. It\u2019s not very funny, and Pacino seems almost demeaned by his very presence in it.George Clooney \u2013 Batman & Robin (1997)There\u2019s no way the blame for this notorious superhero flop can be placed solely at Clooney\u2019s door; from head to bat-toes, this film was daft, indulgent and misconceived. But the Ocean\u2019s Eleven star certainly doesn\u2019t cover himself in glory with his take on the caped crusader, resulting in what might be the worst on-screen Batman in memory.Robert De Niro \u2013 Dirty Grandpa (2016)Once considered by many to be the best actor on the planet, De Niro\u2019s star has waned somewhat in recent years. Though he\u2019s still able to pull greatness out the bag (see: The Irishman), his recent output offers a litany of phoned-in performances, from Little Fockers to The Comedian. In terms of sheer, degrading \u201chow did it come to this\u201d moments, there\u2019s nothing on par with Dirty Grandpa, however, in which De Niro plays a randy septuagenarian who accompanies his grandson (Zac Efron) to Florida for Spring Break.Robert De Niro to star opposite himself in Wise GuysRussell Crowe \u2013 The Mummy (2018)The overall lacklustreness of this Tom Cruise vehicle helped disguise Crowe\u2019s performance as Dr Jekyll (of \u201cand Mr Hyde\u201d fame), which was quietly the worst supporting turn of Crowe\u2019s career. The scene in which Crowe wigs out and transforms from the sanguine doctor to the feral Mr Hyde is one of the most giddily over-acted in recent memory, and the dodgy CGI is just the icing on the cake. Had Warner Bros\u2019 planned (and prematurely announced) \u201cDark Universe\u201d panned out, Crowe would have got his own standalone film as the bifurcated literary character. What a horrible and ancient curse that could have been.Natalie Portman \u2013 Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones (2002)All three Star Wars prequels were blessed with an abundance of skilled actors; all three also featured some truly terrible performances, often by those same actors. Natalie Portman was never serviced well by Attack of the Clones\u2019s script, but this nonetheless endures as one of her worst performances. Sharing most of her scenes with Hayden Christensen\u2019s pouting Anakin, Portman\u2019s Padme Amidala is painfully wooden and devoid of charisma; turgid political plotlines set around the Galactic Senate also gave Portman no room to flex her considerable talents.Natalie Portman as Padme Amidala in \u2018Attack of the Clones' (LucasFilm)Robert Downey Jr \u2013 Dolittle (2020)There have been few men as naturally charismatic as RDJ; the camera loves him, and so do audiences. It\u2019s no small shame, therefore, that his acting career after the success of Iron Man has pretty much been confined to Marvel\u2019s Tony Stark \u2013 since The Avengers in 2012, his only sizable non-MCU roles have been The Judge and Dolittle, both of which could be charitably described as letdowns. His role as the animal-fluent doctor in Dolittle must be the worst, however \u2013 a charmless and insipid spin on a classic children\u2019s premise.Tom Hardy \u2013 Capone (2020)As an actor, Tom Hardy makes big choices. This is what makes him great; it\u2019s a big part of what imbued films like Bronson or Mad Max: Fury Road with such unique, specific energy. But these big choices don\u2019t always pan out, leading to bizarre results in films such as last year\u2019s strange Al Capone biopic. The film was savaged by viewers on social media, with one critic writing that Hardy \u201cgrunts, coughs and s***s his way through scenes that lack any form of direction, sympathy and/or purpose\u201d.Tom Hardy as Al Capone in \u2018Capone' (Vertical Entertainment)Adam Sandler \u2013 The Ridiculous 6 (2015)So many of the Sandman\u2019s performances can be described as broad, lowbrow, or just plain bad, it\u2019s easy to forget just how great an actor Sandler is. When he applies himself, either in his self-produced comedies, or in more dramatic projects (Punch-Drunk Love; The Meyerowicz Stories; Uncut Gems), he can be a force to be reckoned with. In the Ridiculous 6, however, he\u2019s not even a force to be tolerated. Playing a white orphan who was raised by Native Americans in the Old West, Sandler is, frankly, terrible. The film is similarly poor, and was the recipient of a rare zero per cent score on Rotten Tomatoes.Leonardo DiCaprio \u2013 J Edgar (2011)It\u2019s a testament to DiCaprio\u2019s consistency that there\u2019s not much to choose from by way of bad performances; J Edgar, however, is an outright stinker. Filmed back in the heady days before DiCaprio\u2019s Best Actor win, the turgid biopic was a transparent ploy for Oscar gold, and saw the actor don terrible prosthetics to play an elderly version of the controversial FBI director. He\u2019s scarcely much better as a younger J Edgar Hoover, mind \u2013 this is a bad, indulgent film, one which the Titanic star does not manage to elevate.Read more:\u00a025 brilliant films that bombed at the box officeMichael Caine \u2013 Jaws: The Revenge (1987)It should have been a coup to land Michael Caine for the fourth entry in the Jaws franchise. With Roy Scheider having left the franchise after Jaws 2,\u00a0 it was in need of some star presence. Alas, Caine did not exactly cover himself in glory. For his part, the British thespian was droll about the film\u2019s dubious merits, famously saying: \u201cI have never seen it, but by all accounts it is terrible. However, I have seen the house that it built, and it is terrific.\u201dMichael Caine in \u2018Jaws: The Revenge' (Universal Pictures)Naomi Watts \u2013 Diana (2013)This year has seen a superlative portrayal of the late Princess Diana on screen, when Kristen Stewart tackled the role for the bold, revisionist biopic Spencer. Previous attempts to capture the \u201cpeople\u2019s princess\u201d haven\u2019t proved quite so fortunate, however, with the 2013 biopic Diana standing as the nadir of Naomi Watts\u2019s career. The Mulholland Drive star is all sorts of bad in her attempt to inhabit the royal, but the film itself is a shoddy and ill-conceived piece of work.Idris Elba \u2013 Cats (2019)Glance at the screen during any frame of the 2019 musical Cats and you\u2019ll see a bad performance; this spot could equally have gone to Judi Dench, or Ian McKellen, or Ray Winstone. It\u2019s not necessarily Idris Elba\u2019s fault so much as the cursed CGI, but Macavity is a creepy, alien creation \u2013 and not in the ways he\u2019s supposed to be. The lofty heights of The Wire\u2019s Stringer Bell have never felt so far away.Idris Elba in \u2018Cats' (Universal Pictures)Meryl Streep \u2013 Into the Woods (2014)Meryl Streep\u2019s place in the Hollywood hall of fame has long been beyond doubt; she practically has Oscar nominations on a yearly subscription. Nonetheless, some of her performances and acting tics have drawn dubious reactions from critics \u2013 with her role as the witch in Into the Woods standing as one of her lowest ebbs. Stephen Sondheim\u2019s masterful musical was robbed of much of its charm and bite for this Disney-produced film adaptation, and Streep\u2019s performance is hammy and off-putting. The section in the opening song where she has to rap is also nightmarish.

You\u2019ll never be able to say \u201cbees\u201d in quite the same way again after watching this.To find out what others are saying and join the conversation scroll down for the comments section or click here for our most commented on articles\u00a0Access unlimited streaming of movies and TV shows with Amazon Prime Video Sign up now for a 30-day free trialSign upHalle Berry \u2013 Catwoman (2004)Produced before superhero films became as ubiquitous as oxygen, Catwoman was a notorious dud when it first came out. Berry at the time was in the pomp of her stardom, having won the Academy Award for Best Actress just a few years previously. In its own ignominious way, Berry\u2019s Catwoman turn was also award-worthy: she picked up her Golden Raspberry award in person, joking in her light-hearted acceptance speech: \u201cIn order to give a really bad performance like I did, you need a lot of bad actors around you.\u201d Berry in the critically panned \u2018Catwoman\u2019  (Warner Bros/Dc Comics/Kobal/Shutterstock)Al Pacino \u2013 Jack and Jill (2011)One of the greatest actors to have ever lived, Al Pacino has nonetheless been known to give his fair share of questionable (over-)performances throughout the years. However, there\u2019s none that quite stick in the craw quite so jarringly as his brief cameo in the bleakly bad Adam Sandler vehicle Jack and Jill. Playing himself, Pacino mugs his way through a musical advertisement for a beverage called a \u201cdunkaccino\u201d. It\u2019s not very funny, and Pacino seems almost demeaned by his very presence in it.George Clooney \u2013 Batman & Robin (1997)There\u2019s no way the blame for this notorious superhero flop can be placed solely at Clooney\u2019s door; from head to bat-toes, this film was daft, indulgent and misconceived. But the Ocean\u2019s Eleven star certainly doesn\u2019t cover himself in glory with his take on the caped crusader, resulting in what might be the worst on-screen Batman in memory.Robert De Niro \u2013 Dirty Grandpa (2016)Once considered by many to be the best actor on the planet, De Niro\u2019s star has waned somewhat in recent years. Though he\u2019s still able to pull greatness out the bag (see: The Irishman), his recent output offers a litany of phoned-in performances, from Little Fockers to The Comedian. In terms of sheer, degrading \u201chow did it come to this\u201d moments, there\u2019s nothing on par with Dirty Grandpa, however, in which De Niro plays a randy septuagenarian who accompanies his grandson (Zac Efron) to Florida for Spring Break.Robert De Niro to star opposite himself in Wise GuysRussell Crowe \u2013 The Mummy (2018)The overall lacklustreness of this Tom Cruise vehicle helped disguise Crowe\u2019s performance as Dr Jekyll (of \u201cand Mr Hyde\u201d fame), which was quietly the worst supporting turn of Crowe\u2019s career. The scene in which Crowe wigs out and transforms from the sanguine doctor to the feral Mr Hyde is one of the most giddily over-acted in recent memory, and the dodgy CGI is just the icing on the cake. Had Warner Bros\u2019 planned (and prematurely announced) \u201cDark Universe\u201d panned out, Crowe would have got his own standalone film as the bifurcated literary character. What a horrible and ancient curse that could have been.Natalie Portman \u2013 Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones (2002)All three Star Wars prequels were blessed with an abundance of skilled actors; all three also featured some truly terrible performances, often by those same actors. Natalie Portman was never serviced well by Attack of the Clones\u2019s script, but this nonetheless endures as one of her worst performances. Sharing most of her scenes with Hayden Christensen\u2019s pouting Anakin, Portman\u2019s Padme Amidala is painfully wooden and devoid of charisma; turgid political plotlines set around the Galactic Senate also gave Portman no room to flex her considerable talents.Natalie Portman as Padme Amidala in \u2018Attack of the Clones' (LucasFilm)Robert Downey Jr \u2013 Dolittle (2020)There have been few men as naturally charismatic as RDJ; the camera loves him, and so do audiences. It\u2019s no small shame, therefore, that his acting career after the success of Iron Man has pretty much been confined to Marvel\u2019s Tony Stark \u2013 since The Avengers in 2012, his only sizable non-MCU roles have been The Judge and Dolittle, both of which could be charitably described as letdowns. His role as the animal-fluent doctor in Dolittle must be the worst, however \u2013 a charmless and insipid spin on a classic children\u2019s premise.Tom Hardy \u2013 Capone (2020)As an actor, Tom Hardy makes big choices. This is what makes him great; it\u2019s a big part of what imbued films like Bronson or Mad Max: Fury Road with such unique, specific energy. But these big choices don\u2019t always pan out, leading to bizarre results in films such as last year\u2019s strange Al Capone biopic. The film was savaged by viewers on social media, with one critic writing that Hardy \u201cgrunts, coughs and s***s his way through scenes that lack any form of direction, sympathy and/or purpose\u201d.Tom Hardy as Al Capone in \u2018Capone' (Vertical Entertainment)Adam Sandler \u2013 The Ridiculous 6 (2015)So many of the Sandman\u2019s performances can be described as broad, lowbrow, or just plain bad, it\u2019s easy to forget just how great an actor Sandler is. When he applies himself, either in his self-produced comedies, or in more dramatic projects (Punch-Drunk Love; The Meyerowicz Stories; Uncut Gems), he can be a force to be reckoned with. In the Ridiculous 6, however, he\u2019s not even a force to be tolerated. Playing a white orphan who was raised by Native Americans in the Old West, Sandler is, frankly, terrible. The film is similarly poor, and was the recipient of a rare zero per cent score on Rotten Tomatoes.Leonardo DiCaprio \u2013 J Edgar (2011)It\u2019s a testament to DiCaprio\u2019s consistency that there\u2019s not much to choose from by way of bad performances; J Edgar, however, is an outright stinker. Filmed back in the heady days before DiCaprio\u2019s Best Actor win, the turgid biopic was a transparent ploy for Oscar gold, and saw the actor don terrible prosthetics to play an elderly version of the controversial FBI director. He\u2019s scarcely much better as a younger J Edgar Hoover, mind \u2013 this is a bad, indulgent film, one which the Titanic star does not manage to elevate.Read more:\u00a025 brilliant films that bombed at the box officeMichael Caine \u2013 Jaws: The Revenge (1987)It should have been a coup to land Michael Caine for the fourth entry in the Jaws franchise. With Roy Scheider having left the franchise after Jaws 2,\u00a0 it was in need of some star presence. Alas, Caine did not exactly cover himself in glory. For his part, the British thespian was droll about the film\u2019s dubious merits, famously saying: \u201cI have never seen it, but by all accounts it is terrible. However, I have seen the house that it built, and it is terrific.\u201dMichael Caine in \u2018Jaws: The Revenge' (Universal Pictures)Naomi Watts \u2013 Diana (2013)This year has seen a superlative portrayal of the late Princess Diana on screen, when Kristen Stewart tackled the role for the bold, revisionist biopic Spencer. Previous attempts to capture the \u201cpeople\u2019s princess\u201d haven\u2019t proved quite so fortunate, however, with the 2013 biopic Diana standing as the nadir of Naomi Watts\u2019s career. The Mulholland Drive star is all sorts of bad in her attempt to inhabit the royal, but the film itself is a shoddy and ill-conceived piece of work.Idris Elba \u2013 Cats (2019)Glance at the screen during any frame of the 2019 musical Cats and you\u2019ll see a bad performance; this spot could equally have gone to Judi Dench, or Ian McKellen, or Ray Winstone. It\u2019s not necessarily Idris Elba\u2019s fault so much as the cursed CGI, but Macavity is a creepy, alien creation \u2013 and not in the ways he\u2019s supposed to be. The lofty heights of The Wire\u2019s Stringer Bell have never felt so far away.Idris Elba in \u2018Cats' (Universal Pictures)Meryl Streep \u2013 Into the Woods (2014)Meryl Streep\u2019s place in the Hollywood hall of fame has long been beyond doubt; she practically has Oscar nominations on a yearly subscription. Nonetheless, some of her performances and acting tics have drawn dubious reactions from critics \u2013 with her role as the witch in Into the Woods standing as one of her lowest ebbs. Stephen Sondheim\u2019s masterful musical was robbed of much of its charm and bite for this Disney-produced film adaptation, and Streep\u2019s performance is hammy and off-putting. The section in the opening song where she has to rap is also nightmarish. Glenn Close \u2013 Hillbilly Elegy (2020)Glenn Close\u2019s turn in this patronising slice of rural Americana may just be one of the worst performances ever to be nominated for an Academy Award.RecommendedEvery movie and TV show coming to Netflix this monthThe One With....

Everyone seems to agree that Close is long overdue an Oscar win; thank God it didn\u2019t come for this.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe 76th Tony Awards have drawn to a close after a lively ceremony at which Liverpool\u2019s Jodie Comer was among the major winners of the night. The biggest night in Broadway took place on Sunday night (11 June) at the United Palace in Manhattan\u2019s Washington Heights neighbourhood. Hosted by Academy Award-winner Ariana Debose, this year\u2019s ceremony was noticeably different to its past iterations due to the ongoing Hollywood writers\u2019 strike. The strike was referenced both playfully and then in detail by DeBose in her opening segment, in which the actor showed support for her \u201csiblings\u201d at the Writers Guild of America. The West Side Story star explained to viewers that as a result of the strikes, neither herself nor anyone on stage would be reading from a script, since the scripts are typically written by members of the WGA.

But Hirsch, best known for playing the titular Speed Racer in the cult 2008 actioner and the tragic American nomad Chris McCandless in Sean Penn\u2019s Into the Wild (2007), still wanted to have some fun with it. \u201cI thought: \u2018OK, I\u2019ll just do an Elon Musk impression for the whole movie,\u2019\u201d the 38-year-old laughs, as if it was the most obvious idea in the world. \u201cIn fairness, it\u2019s probably not even a good Elon Musk impression. Because I don\u2019t think anybody actually got it.\u201d He grins, sighs and holds his hands up in mock regret.Pursuit, which is available for digital download now, is an incredibly stupid movie that gets by on its relentless insanity. Hirsch\u2019s Rick is erratic, noisy and covered in face tattoos, and if his dialogue seems particularly free-wheeling and nonsensical, that\u2019s pretty much because it was made up on the fly. \u201cOur director, he was like, \u2018yeah, don\u2019t worry about the script \u2013 just improvise your lines the whole time if you want.\u2019 So there are whole scenes where I\u2019m just, like, saying anything on camera.\u201dHirsch is at home in Los Angeles, groggy yet energetic after two weeks of night shoots on a poker movie called Degenerate. While his early career was dominated by auteurs (he\u2019d worked with William Friedkin, Ang Lee, Gus Van Sant and Lilly and Lana Wachowski all before he\u2019d turned 25), or teen sex comedies such as the surprisingly sweet The Girl Next Door (2004), his present-day career can be split into two halves. One is the smart indie pile, like his grisly 2016 two-hander with Brian Cox called The Autopsy of Jane Doe. The other is made up of straight-to-streaming action films, in which one or more of a very specific collection of men (Cusack, but also the likes of Stephen Dorff, Michael Madsen or Bruce Willis before he retired) hold big guns on the poster art. He\u2019s occasionally in a modern masterpiece, too \u2013 that was him, you may remember, as Sharon Tate\u2019s hairdresser Jay Sebring in Quentin Tarantino\u2019s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019).He just loves movies, he tells me. Watching them. Making them. Even if some of them are sort of terrible. \u201cI saw all the best stuff really young. I was one of those weird kids binge-watching movies and burning through all the sections of the video store. If I hang out with guys that know about football and every player\u2019s stats or whatever, I don\u2019t know what the f*** they\u2019re talking about \u2013 movies, though, I\u2019m like Mister Aficionado.\u201dEven when he\u2019s not rambling like a Twitter CEO and firing an Uzi while running around in his underpants \u2013 Pursuit, if I haven\u2019t sold it enough already, is a trip \u2013 Hirsch is a performer of near-feral intensity. He was, especially if you came of age in the late Noughties, synonymous with a particular strain of sun-kissed abandon. Few could watch Into the Wild and not also want to flee to the furthest outreaches of the world (many seduced by it would come to conveniently forget that the real McCandless died hungry and alone in the Alaskan wilderness). When he tore off his clothes to dance naked with hippies in Lee\u2019s Taking Woodstock (2009), you wanted to do it, too. Some of us even tried vainly to emulate his wispy, shoulder-length haircut as Seventies skateboarder Jay Adams in Catherine Hardwicke\u2019s Lords of Dogtown (2005), but let\u2019s not talk about that. And all of this is why it was so horrifying \u2013 and disappointing, and sad and confusing \u2013 when Hirsch seemed to throw it all away in a moment of violence.RecommendedJosh Hartnett on Black Mirror, Oppenheimer and saying no to celebrity: \u2018I was on a different path\u2019Hank Azaria: \u2018I didn\u2019t want to cave to so-called PC pressure\u2019Thomas Turgoose: \u2018He\u2019s one of the biggest stars in the world \u2013 but he wanted to go to Wagamama every night\u2019During the Sundance Film Festival in 2015, Hirsch attacked a female film executive in the middle of a busy party. In a statement, the executive said she was grabbed from behind, pulled to the floor, put in a chokehold by Hirsch so forcefully that she \u201ccouldn\u2019t breathe\u201d, and that it took two bystanders to pull him off her before police arrived. Charged with aggravated assault and intoxication, Hirsch pleaded guilty as part of a plea deal later that year, spent 15 days in jail, paid restitution to his victim and went to rehab. It was an act of violence that has justifiably reverberated through his career ever since, along with people\u2019s responses to him personally.\n\nIt was the worst moment of my whole life by far. The lowest. In the most public place possible\u201cIt was scary because it was so wrapped up in binge drinking,\u201d he says now. \u201cI had no memory of what happened. So I\u2019m reading the stuff the next day, like, \u2018What?\u2019 I was dumbfounded. Horrified. It\u2019s like if you drink too much and then you wake up and you\u2019ve done this horrible thing.\u201d He takes a long pause. \u201cIt\u2019s something that should have just never happened. Sometimes people \u2013 not everybody \u2013 have these moments where you let yourself down or you let other people down. And you can say you\u2019re sorry and mean it and move forward, and try to be the best parent and make a living for yourself and still love your art and still love your family and your friends. And that\u2019s sort of what I\u2019ve chosen to do. I think\u2026 I hope that I can be a better person as well.\u201dHe takes another long pause. \u201cIt was the worst moment of my whole life by far. The lowest. In the most public place possible. At the most famous film festival in America, you know?\u201d Has he ever figured out why he actually did what he did? \u201cI\u2019m hesitant to talk very specific about it, you know? Because I think, yeah\u2026\u201d He trails off. \u201cIt certainly led me to do a lot of the emotional work and the therapy that I think I probably should have been getting when I was younger, you know what I mean? Getting famous really young, having a harder time trusting people, I\u2019ve been able to learn my own mechanics more, and do a lot of the work that I put off doing when I was younger because I was scared.\u201d\u2018OK, I\u2019ll just do an Elon Musk impression for the whole movie\u2019: Emile Hirsch in \u2018Pursuit\u2019  (Grindstone Entertainment)The Emile Hirsch that first set foot in Hollywood was someone specifically determined to stay on the straight and narrow. He\u2019d got an agent at the age of seven, after discovering that he had a vague connection to many of the young actors he was watching on TV \u2013 dozens of them had been taught by his grandfather\u2019s brother and his wife, who were prolific teachers hired by Hollywood studios to educate child actors on sets. \u201cThey\u2019d say, \u2018Oh, yeah, we worked with Elijah Wood on this movie, or on this commercial \u2013 you could do that!\u2019\u201d That background, as well as his early watching of movies, made him keenly aware of the industry he was stepping into.Access unlimited streaming of movies and TV shows with Amazon Prime Video Sign up now for a 30-day free trialSign up\u201cComing into LA, I was ultra paranoid,\u201d he explains. \u201cI was wary of the \u2018dark underbelly\u2019 of Hollywood. I was distrusting of party-ers. My favourite actor was River Phoenix, and growing up knowing what happened to him, I felt like I had to learn from him in any way I could. Just out of respect. I wouldn\u2019t say I was a square or anything, but on the range of like, \u2018the party people\u2019, I was at the very low end.\u201dEarly interviews noted his precociousness. A 2002 New York Times piece, in which Hirsch described himself as looking like \u201ca cross between Leonardo DiCaprio and Jack Black\u201d (it\u2019s\u2026 oddly accurate), remarked that he was \u201c17 years old and gravely going on 40\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m way more chill now,\u201d he says. \u201cI think when you\u2019re young, some people have that chill already \u2013 I just had pretty intense angst.\u201d It was sort of inevitable he\u2019d end up crossing paths back then with Sean Penn, another teen actor turned deeply serious artiste, and someone else with just as complicated an image in the public eye.On the road: Hirsch as the late nomad Chris McCandless in 2007\u2019s \u2018Into the Wild\u2019  (Shutterstock)Hirsch was 21 when he made Into the Wild, and remembers matching Penn\u2019s ferocious commitment on set. \u201cWe both put maximum effort into that film. We left everything on the field.\u201d It resulted in one of those all-time great young-actor performances. Hirsch plays McCandless as both the romantic hero of his own story and a spoilt, destructive madman \u2013 over the course of the film he shrinks down to a near-skeletal body weight. You can practically see the lights go out in his eyes in real time; Hirsch seems barely alive as the film goes on (it took eight months to shoot). \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I was scarred by it,\u201d Hirsch says. \u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s like I grew new muscles. I got new strength from that movie. No trauma. No scars. Just strength and only that.\u201dRubbing his eyes, Hirsch tells me he doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019d like to do next. His sleep schedule is out of whack because of Degenerate, and he\u2019s conscious of losing sight of his health. \u201cI know what can bring me up and bring me down,\u201d he explains. \u201cI was chewing all this nicotine gum on set and now I\u2019m like, I gotta stop. I want to start weightlifting again, just head down to Venice Beach and reset.\u201d He has a nine-year-old son named Valor, who makes a cameo in Pursuit as his on-screen son \u2013 but found acting completely uninteresting. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t exactly chomping at the bit to do more after that, so I might have nipped it in the bud early,\u201d he says. \u201cYou want to be an actor?
