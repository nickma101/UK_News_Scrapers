Their loss will be recognised.\u201dModule one, which is looking into Britain\u2019s preparedness for the pandemic, opened on Tuesday.The inquiry has held preliminary hearings, but this week will see the first evidence heard in the inquiry since it was formally launched in June 2022.With a national election expected next year, the detailed examination of decision-making could create political headaches for current Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who was finance minister during the pandemic.However, evidence hearings on module two, which covers governance and decision-making in the pandemic, are not due to start until later in the year.The government has launched a legal challenge against the inquiry over its requests for internal government WhatsApp messages from Johnson\u2018s time in office which it says are \u201cunambiguously irrelevant\u201d to the inquiry.The inquiry argues that it is for the chair to determine what material is relevant.

And I think there\u2019s an economic hit as well ... many investors said to me, we\u2019re not investing in the UK right now because we don\u2019t see the conditions of certainty and stability we need in order to invest.\u201dTory turmoil over Johnson is having an impact on UK\u2019s reputation, Starmer claimsLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer suggested the political chaos was damaging the UK\u2019s international standing and causing concerns for business.Eleanor Noyce13 June 2023 11:201686651309First day of UK Covid-19 inquiry to begin with \u2018difficult to watch\u2019 video testimoniesThe voices of some of those who suffered most in the pandemic will be heard as the UK Covid-19 Inquiry officially begins its first day of evidence.Two years after then-prime minister Boris Johnson announced a public inquiry would be set up, chairwoman Baroness Heather Hallett will formally open the first substantive hearing on Tuesday.Following her statement, a video featuring people from across the UK sharing their experiences of loss will be played to those gathered at the hearing centre in west London.Aine Fox has the full story:First day of Covid-19 inquiry to begin with \u2018difficult to watch\u2019 video testimoniesFirst module of the inquiry will focus on the UK\u2019s preparedness for a pandemicEleanor Noyce13 June 2023 11:151686650204Who is Charlotte Owen and why is she getting a peerage?A former aide to Boris Johnson is set to become the youngest-ever peer after being included in his controversial resignation honours list.Charlotte Owen, 29, joins former cabinet minister Jacob Rees-Mogg and Tory MP Andrea Jenkyns in being elevated to the House of Lords by the ex-prime minister.Mr Johnson\u2019s full honours list was published shortly before he resigned on Friday and sparked a political row with Rishi Sunak after MPs Nadine Dorries and Nigel Adams were omitted.My colleague Matt Mathers reports:All we know about Charlotte Owen as Boris Johnson makes her UK\u2019s youngest peerThe 29-year-old aide among controversial names on Boris Johnson\u2019s resignation honours list Eleanor Noyce13 June 2023 10:561686648552Sir Keir Starmer: UK\u2019s response to Joe Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act a \u2018critical question'Sir Keir Starmer said how the UK responds to Joe Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act is a \u201ccritical question\u201d.The Labour leader said President Biden\u2019s $369bn package of subsidies for investment in green technology is drawing business away from Britain.\u201cI can feel investors being drawn toward the US, and we need a response in the UK to that.

She said she suffered guilt over the way they had died.Another woman said she had \"lost everything\", while others described suffering anxiety.People also told how they had not hugged each other at family funerals because they were sticking to Covid social distancing rules laid down by the government.UK may not have been prepared for pandemicThe UK may not have been \"very well prepared at all\" to deal with the coronavirus pandemic, the official inquiry\u2019s lead lawyer has said as public hearings began.Lead counsel Hugo Keith KC questioned on Tuesday whether the nation was equipped to offer substantial protection to the public as leaders had promised.In his opening statement, Mr Keith said that near the start of the pandemic in March 2020 the Department of Health and Social Care, along with the three devolved governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, published a Covid-19 action plan \"setting out how they planned to tackle the coronavirus outbreak\". Hugo Keith KC says UK may not have been prepared for pandemic  (Covid 19 Inquiry)\"The plan stated that the United Kingdom was well prepared to respond in a way that offered substantial protection to the public. Whether that was actually the case will be examined in module one.\"Even at this stage before hearing the evidence it is apparent that we might not have been very well prepared at all.\"Mr Keith said the inquiry would look at whether health inequalities contributed to the UK death toll and levels of hospitalisation.\"Did the high levels of heart disease, diabetes, respiratory illness and obesity render us more vulnerable?\u201d he said. \u201cHad there been a slowdown in health improvement in the decade before?

Or our response to swine flu in 2009 and the UK\u2019s undoubted successes in ensuring Sars and Mers did not spread?\"Did our experience of the 2009 swine flu lead to concerns about overreacting?\"Brexit could have \u2018crowded out\u2019 planning for pandemicHugo Keith KC suggested to the Covid inquiry that preparing for Brexit \"crowded out and prevented\" the work that was needed to improve pandemic preparedness.He said: \"The pandemic struck the United Kingdom just as it was leaving the European Union.\"That departure required an enormous amount of planning and preparation, particularly to address what were likely to be the severe consequences of a no-deal exit on food and medicine supplies, travel and transport, business borders and so on.\"It is clear that such planning, from 2018 onwards, crowded out and prevented some or perhaps a majority of the improvements that central government itself understood were required to be made to resilience planning and preparedness.\"Did the attention therefore paid to the risks of a no-deal exit - Operation Yellowhammer as it was known - drain the resources and capacity that should have been continuing the fight against the next pandemic, that should have been utilised in preparing the United Kingdom for civil emergency?Evidence likely to show \u2018chaos\u2019 in governmentEvidence is likely to show a lack of responsibility in Government and \"chaos\" which led to a slow reaction to a pandemic where \"lost time is measured in lost lives\", the Covid inquiry has been told.Pete Weatherby KC, of Covid Bereaved Families for Justice UK, said: \"The families expect the evidence will show a lack of responsibility in Government for civil emergency preparedness, with little or no ministerial leadership and the chaos of committees which led to poor planning and ultimately a reactive rather than proactive response to the virus.RecommendedGovernment WhatsApps about \u2018frothy\u2019 coffee, not big decisions, former health ministerBoris Johnson hands over his WhatsApps and asks for them to be given to Covid inquiryBoris WhatsApp row descends into farce as senior Tories call for Sunak to end dispute\"We anticipate the evidence will show that the most fundamental consequence of this was a slow reaction.

The inquest began in March.The proceedings are taking place against the backdrop of a proposed controversial Government Bill on the legacy of the Northern Ireland Troubles.An amendment to the draft legislation, introduced by the Government last week, stated that all ongoing legacy inquests, other than those at the point of verdict, will cease on May 1 2024.A number of nationalist politicians, including Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O\u2019Neill and SDLP MLA Matthew O\u2019Toole were at the Royal Courts of Justice in Belfast to support the Brown family during the review hearing.Counsel for the coroner Joseph Aiken KC told the hearing that it had been planned to hold two days of evidence in the inquest this week.However, he said this had not been possible due to the size of the witness schedule, pointing out that there were 420 potential witnesses in the case.He then updated the court on disclosure issues around outstanding sensitive and non-sensitive material about Mr Brown\u2019s death from the PSNI and Ministry of Defence.Mr Aiken then set out a timetable, agreed by the coroner, for when the process of handing over the outstanding material should be completed over the coming months.Mr Aiken said the full inquest would resume on January 8 2024 for four consecutive weeks of hearing and would conclude by February 2.\n\nI can't allow the internal processes, however difficult they are, to dictate the path of this inquestMr Justice KinneyPSNI barrister Mark Robinson said that a public immunity interest (PII) process was to be carried out and said it should be \u201cconducted properly\u201d.He told the court that he believed that dates imposed within the agenda \u201ccannot be met\u201d.Coroner Mr Justice Kinney said: \u201cThe fact is this is a matter where we are not at a standing start today looking at this process.\u201cThis has been a process that has apparently been under way in some form for almost a year and what I am being told today still seems to remain that process that will dictate the timetable even though that process is opaque.\u201cI can\u2019t allow the internal processes, however difficult they are, to dictate the path of this inquest.\u201dHe added: \u201cIn short, a best endeavour submission today is not sufficient and it will not cut the mustard.

What\u2019s been a concern is getting the social media review to a point where it can be delivered flawlessly, and that is not easy.\u201dHe added that he is expecting the report back \u201cpretty soon\u201d.Earlier in the session, Mr Davie said the BBC doesn\u2019t always get its obligation to impartiality right, but it has had a \u201cgood year\u201d amid \u201cenormous pressure\u201d around the world for free press.He told MPs: \u201cAs editor in chief, my orders are very clear: we report without fear or favour with due impartiality.\u201cI\u2019ve never claimed we get it perfect all the time, and sometimes we don\u2019t get it right, but overall and the vast majority of occasions, I think we\u2019ve had a good year in maintaining impartiality in a world where there are fierce storms around us.\u201dDuring the session, Mr Davie confirmed he expected the investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct against DJ Tim Westwood to be completed in the \u201cnext couple of months\u201d, while being questioned on alleged bullying and harassment within the corporation.The director-general added that there is also an ongoing review into Top Gear as presenter Andrew \u201cFreddie\u201d Flintoff continues to recover from an accident which occurred during filming at the programme\u2019s test track at Dunsfold Aerodrome in December.Similarly, he addressed the row over cuts to local radio services, describing changes as \u201cvery difficult and unpopular\u201d but adding: \u201cLocal radio is precious.\u201dLast year, the BBC proposed plans for local radio stations to share more content and broadcast less programming.Mr Davie said: \u201cI believe we\u2019re doing the right thing in a situation in which we understand and are listening and have already made some adjustments to our plans to make sure we\u2019re making the right choices with very limited money.\u201dHe said he is \u201cempathetic\u201d to BBC journalists who are currently on strike because change it \u201cstressful\u201d and it has been a \u201cvery difficult time for people working in local radio\u201d.\u201cI\u2019ve been through restructures myself and it\u2019s not nice, so I understand it. I am utterly committed to BBC local growing for the long term,\u201d he said.BBC director of editorial policy and standards David Jordan and chief content officer Charlotte Moore were also at the scrutiny session.Asked about the future of chamber choir The BBC Singers, chief content officer Ms Moore told the select committee: \u201cWe are absolutely committed to our classical musical and performing group provision at the BBC,\u201d adding that they \u201cspend \u00a360 million annually on classical music\u201d.RecommendedWitnesses describe screams as two victims stabbed in deadly Nottingham attacksRobison appears to drop public sector staff shrinking policyLight aircraft crashes off South Wales coastThe broadcaster had previously announced plans to scrap its in-house chamber choir and reduce salaried orchestral posts across the BBC English Orchestras by around 20%.In April, it U-turned, and said it is committed to exploring \u201calternatives\u201d to cutting classical performer jobs at the corporation."}, {"_id": "64885e0151ac33216efdbb7f", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/nottingham-bbc-rishi-sunak-police-nottinghamshire-police-b2356570.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Witnesses describe screams as two victims stabbed in deadly Nottingham attacks", "lead": "Three people have been killed and another three injured in linked attacks in the city.", "author": "Pa Reporters", "datePublished": "Tue, 13 Jun 2023 11:32:21 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:16:01.047064", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/13/12/a77d477b42b70edb7a51298eb2559c41Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg2NzQxMjI5-2.72592530.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeMPs are launching an inquiry into Ofsted\u2019s school inspections and whether they can be improved.The watchdog has faced pressure to reform after headteacher Ruth Perry took her own life after her school was downgraded to the lowest Ofsted rating.The inquiry \u2013 by cross-party MPs on the Commons Education Select Committee \u2013 will look into concerns that the one-word ratings that Ofsted gives to schools may not be conducive to helping schools improve.MPs will consider the impact of Ofsted inspections on the workload and wellbeing of teachers, school leaders and pupils as part of the inquiry.Robin Walker, chair of the committee, acknowledged that there has been a \u201cnotable groundswell of criticism\u201d towards Ofsted about the impact of inspections and single-word judgments on school staff.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveHe said: \u201cOfsted plays a particularly vital role when it comes to safeguarding but ensuring that inspections are proportionate, timely and reasonable is essential to build trust, especially after the tragic passing of headteacher Ruth Perry.\u201dThe inquiry will not examine the events that preceded the death of Ms Perry, the former headteacher of Caversham Primary School in Reading, Berkshire, as an inquest is due to commence later this year.An Ofsted report found Caversham School to be \u201cgood\u201d in every category apart from leadership and management, where it was rated as \u201cinadequate\u201d.Since Ms Perry\u2019s death in January there have been calls for one-word ratings to be abolished.On Monday, Ofsted announced a series of changes, including launching a consultation on reforms to the complaints system and giving schools more information around the timing of their inspections.Schools graded inadequate overall due only to ineffective safeguarding \u2013 but where all other judgments were good or better \u2013 will be revisited by inspectors within three months of a report being published as part of the reforms.\n\nI think it is fair to say that a great deal of that pressure does relate to the perceived consequences of inspection - it's not just about the process itselfAmanda Spielman, Ofsted's chief inspectorBut Amanda Spielman, Ofsted\u2019s chief inspector, said on Monday that scrapping one-word judgments would not solve the \u201cunderlying discomfort\u201d among headteachers if the consequences of the inspection remain the same.As part of the inquiry, MPs will explore the impact of Ofsted judgments on schools and pupils \u2013 and the adequacy of the support schools can access to enable them to improve following an Ofsted judgment.The effectiveness of Ofsted\u2019s complaints process will also be explored.Mr Walker added: \u201cSome have argued that Ofsted\u2019s role should be expanded to provide more support to schools that need to improve, amid concerns around the impact that receiving a negative rating can have on a school\u2019s morale and reputation.\u201dAddressing the Commons Education Select Committee on Tuesday, Ms Spielman welcomed the launch of the inquiry.She said Ofsted was focused on how it \u201ccan contribute to reducing the pressure that is undoubtedly felt by school leaders around inspection\u201d.\u201cI think it is fair to say that a great deal of that pressure does relate to the perceived consequences of inspection \u2013 it\u2019s not just about the process itself,\u201d Ms Spielman added.But she told MPs that the consequences of school inspection \u2013 such as intervention or support \u2013 \u201csit with Government\u201d rather than Ofsted.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders\u2019 union the NAHT, said: \u201cThe changes already announced by Ofsted do not go far enough to address the concerns the profession have or to mitigate the harm inspections can cause.RecommendedStarmer says UK needs to be prepared for \u2018rapid change\u2019 with AIBBC boss tells MPs there are imbalances of power in \u2018strange\u2019 TV industryTory turmoil over Johnson is having an impact on UK\u2019s reputation, Starmer claims\u201cIt is becoming increasingly clear that there is an overwhelming desire for meaningful change.\u201cWe hope the Education Select Committee will listen carefully to the experiences and concerns of the profession and help bring about much-needed change.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64885e0251ac33216efdbb85", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/nottingham-major-incident-city-centre-today-b2356427.html", "primaryCategory": "Home News", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Man arrested on suspicion of murder after three people killed in Nottingham", "lead": "<p>Three more people injured in hospital after they were run over by a van on Milton Street </p>", "author": "Maryam Zakir-Hussain", "datePublished": "Tue, 13 Jun 2023 10:56:11 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:16:02.647281", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/13/09/POLICE%20Nottingham%20%2009121400.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Get the free Morning Headlines email for news from our reporters across the worldSign up to our free Morning Headlines email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

I could be in a wheelchair by then.\u201dHe is taking on the challenge to raise funds and awareness for Muscular Dystrophy UK, the national charity that supports those with muscle wasting conditions.Earlier this year, Mr Stennett took part in the Marbella 70.3 half Ironman and the TCS London Marathon, with Ironman Austria to be his third major challenge in three months.Ahead of the ironman challenge, he said: \u201cLiving with a condition can be challenging.\u201cFSHD continues to sap my strength, but I remain strong-minded.\u201cCompleting the open water swim with front crawl is a small concern because the muscles in my core are weak and I struggle with snaking in the water when I\u2019m tired.\u201cI am a proficient breaststroke swimmer, so I have no doubt I will complete the swim, but by doing breaststroke I fatigue my legs before the cycle element even starts!\u201dKiera Santry, senior challenge events officer at Muscular Dystrophy UK, said: \u201cChris has an inspiring story \u2013 and he has not let his diagnosis stop him from taking on multiple challenge events, including running the London Marathon in April 2023 for the charity.\u201cWe\u2019re so grateful to Chris for his ongoing support.RecommendedStars pay tribute to actor Treat Williams after death in motorcycle accidentBereaved families hold pictures of loved ones in vigil outside Covid inquiryMost early-stage breast cancer patients will become long-term survivors \u2013 study\u201cThe funds raised will continue to help Muscular Dystrophy UK support people living with muscle-wasting conditions and fund further research and treatment.\u201dMr Stennett can be sponsored at https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/fshd-ironman2"}, {"_id": "64885e0551ac33216efdbb90", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/courts-mps-government-lord-chancellor-alex-chalk-b2356264.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Courts to gain powers to throw out lawsuits designed to silence critics", "lead": "Legal threats known as Slapps are often used by the rich and powerful to intimidate and financially exhaust opponents.", "author": "Sophie Wingate", "datePublished": "Tue, 13 Jun 2023 09:25:37 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:16:05.410574", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/13/00/7dc5dc9167a08edc36d4eb36a48106c8Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg2NjY2OTU5-2.72310993.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Thank you to everyone for your support \u2013 it really helps.\u201dFollow all the latest updates on The Independent\u2019s liveblogHere is a reminder of the events of the case.RecommendedMadeleine McCann news \u2013 latest: Soil from reservoir compared to samples from prime suspect\u2019s vanHow Madeleine McCann search at reservoir unfolded \u2013 and what police foundRead Madeleine McCann suspect Christian Brueckner\u2019s bombshell prison letters for the first timeThe story began when the McCanns \u2013 affluent doctors Kate and Gerry, their three-year-old daughter Madeleine and her two-year-old twin siblings Amelia and Sean \u2013 joined a group of seven family friends and their five children on holiday at the Ocean Club in the village of Praia da Luz on the southwestern tip of Portugal on 28 April 2007.After a pleasant spring break by the sea, the adults in the party went out for dinner at the resort\u2019s open-air tapas bar on 3 May, gathering at 8.30pm. The children were left behind sleeping in their respective apartments with the doors unlocked and a rota system in place among the parents to ensure that someone returned every half-hour to check on them.When Kate McCann took her turn and returned to her apartment at 10pm, she raced back to the restaurant screaming \u201cMadeleine\u2019s gone! Someone\u2019s taken her!\u201d The police were quickly called and 60 staff and fellow guests searched the complex, calling out the girl\u2019s name in vain until daybreak the following morning.Border police and airport staff were put on alert and hundreds of volunteers joined the efforts to find the missing girl over the coming days, the case fast becoming a sensation.The Portuguese authorities would later attract criticism over their conduct in the crucial earliest hours of the investigation when the trail might still have been warm, accused of making rudimentary mistakes like failing to conduct a house-by-house search of every local residence or interview all of the other guests at the resort, acting slowly to erect roadblocks and potentially compromising forensic evidence at the crime scene.Madeleine McCann (PA)The police initially stated that they believed Madeleine was still alive and had been abducted from the room by a stranger as the parents described their \u201canguish and despair\u201d over her vanishing, a worst fear realised for any parent.On 26 May, police issued a description of a suspicious man seen on the night of the girl\u2019s disappearance. The individual in question was spotted by Jane Tanner, one of the McCanns\u2019 dining companions, who said she had seen a Mediterranean man with dark hair and beige trousers carrying a child close to the apartment when she went to check in on her own children. Scotland Yard would later come to dismiss the sighting as a red herring.The search continued as the summer progressed amid a wild media circus and with huge fundraising activities underway, the McCanns setting up Madeleine\u2019s Fund on 15 May to raise cash to support further investigation and keep the profile of the case high, attracting generous donations from celebrities like Richard Branson, Simon Cowell, JK Rowling and Coleen Rooney. By 30 May, the case was such a cause celebre that they were being flown out to meet the Pope at the Vatican in Sir Phillip Green\u2019s Learjet.A local man, Robert Murat, subsequently became its first suspect and had his house and car searched, his swimming pool drained and his electronic devices confiscated but no evidence was found to link him to Madeleine and the matter was soon dropped.By June, the Portuguese police admitted that they had failed to protect potentially useful evidence at the scene as frustration with the lack of developments grew and the media began to question whether the McCanns themselves had been involved in the matter. Lurid tabloid allegations suggested the couple and their friends might have been swingers and that the McCanns, as physicians, might have been in the habit of sedating their children, while others claimed inconsistencies in their version of events.The intensity of the hostility towards the parents would later be described by Roy Greenslade of The Guardian as \u201cno journalistic accident, but a sustained campaign of vitriol against a grief-stricken family\u201d, singling out The Daily Express and Daily Star for particular condemnation.In July, assistance offered by former South African police officer Danie Krugel \u2013 who claimed his handheld \u201cmatter orientation system\u201d could help to find Madeleine \u2013 was rubbished, while British police sent over two springer spaniel sniffer dogs to search for DNA. Gerry and Kate McCann (PA)Relations with the local authorities would ultimately sour as the latter came to resent British intrusion into a Portuguese inquiry, according to Anthony Summers and Robbyn Swan\u2019s book Looking for Madeleine (2014).By August, Madeleine has been missing for 100 days and police admitted for the first time that she may never be found. They also told the McCanns that they were no longer considering the matter an abduction case but, rather, a murder inquiry.The McCanns themselves were interviewed as \u201carguidos\u201d (suspects) by Portuguese police in September, with the parents told that the dogs had discovered DNA evidence from the missing girl in the boot of their holiday rental car, lines of inquiry that had already been leaked to the British press. They vehemently denied having any part in her disappearance.Despite being listed as suspects (a designation that would linger until the following July), the McCanns were allowed to return to Britain on 9 September. A day later, chief inspector Tavares de Almeida of the Policia Judiciaria in Portimao signed a nine-page report concluding that Madeleine McCann had died in their apartment as a result of an accident, that the tapas dinner and rota checks on the McCann children had been part of a planned cover-up, that the family\u2019s friends had helped to mislead the police and that the McCanns had concealed the body and then faked an abduction. A public prosecutor subsequently applied for the confiscation of Kate McCann\u2019s diary and Gerry McCann\u2019s laptop plus the group\u2019s phone records.On 2 October, chief inspector Goncalo Amaral was removed from the case and transferred after alleging that the British police were only interested in pursuing leads favourable to the McCanns. He would later publish a book, Maddie: The Truth of the Lie, the following summer, resulting in a lengthy libel battle with the McCanns that would run back and forth through the courts until March 2017.Back in Britain, Gerry McCann issued a video that November in which he speculated that his family had been watched by a \u201cpredator\u201d during their stay at Praia da Luz. His wife had come to believe that a potential perpetrator could have seen a note in the resort\u2019s guest book visible to all in reception noting their dining arrangements on the evening of Madeleine\u2019s disappearance. The couple followed up on 20 January 2008 by releasing a sketch of a \u201ccreepy man\u201d they said other holidaymakers had said they had seen loitering at the Ocean Club.In April, a month before the one-year anniversary of the fateful night, Portuguese police travelled to Leicestershire to conduct further interviews with the McCanns\u2019 friends.RecommendedWhat happened to Madeleine McCann? Five possible scenarios as Netflix documentary releasedThen, on 21 July, Portugal\u2019s attorney general, Fernando Jose Pinto Monteiro, announced that there was no evidence to link either the McCanns or Robert Murat to the disappearance and closed the case, unsolved.With the trail cold and no closure in sight, the McCanns continued to publicise their cause, issuing computer-generated images of how Madeleine might look now that she had aged on 3 November 2009 and condemning the release of previously unseen Portuguese police files \u2013 detailing possible sightings of their daughter \u2013 to British newspapers in March 2010.The McCanns published a book of their own about their ordeal in May 2011, entitled simply Madeleine, which was serialised in The Sun as the newspaper led a campaign calling on British prime minister David Cameron to launch a new inquiry. He did so. Commenced by then-home secretary Theresa May, the Metropolitan Police\u2019s Operation Grange would be led by commander Simon Foy and comprise a team of three detective inspectors, five detective sergeants, 19 detective constables and six civilian staff.It began to yield results in 2013, with Scotland Yard formally announcing a new investigation in July and saying in October it had identified 41 potential suspects. That same month, BBC Crimewatch released an e-fit image of a man of particular interest who had been seen in Praia da Luz with a child matching Madeleine\u2019s description in May 2007.Detectives arrived in Portugal in January 2014 promising new arrests and finally searched the village in June, interviewing four people the following month but without unearthing new information. The quartet would be definitively ruled out in April 2017, before the UK government said it would continue to fund the investigation until 2020, having already admitted it had cost \u00a310m in its first four years of operation.That investment had enabled detectives to have tens of thousands of documents translated, investigate over 8,000 potential sightings, take 1,338 statements, collect 1,027 exhibits and investigate 650 sex offenders and 60 persons of interest, all without definitively establishing the truth.The Madeline McCann case lay dormant before suddenly exploding into life in June 2020 when German media revealed that Christian Brueckner, a 43-year-old prisoner with a track record of child abuse and drug trafficking, had been identified as a new suspect by the public prosecutor of the German city of Braunschweig. Christian Brueckner (AFP/Getty)He had reportedly been living in a Volkswagen camper van in the Algarve at the time of Madeleine\u2019s disappearance and one woman has since come forward to suggest she saw a girl that might have been Madeleine speaking German in a supermarket in Portugal in 2017.German investigators classified their probe into his movements as a murder inquiry, saying they were working on the assumption that Madeleine is dead and reporting in July 2021 that they had found an abandoned cellar beneath his former allotment near Hanover where she could, theoretically, have been held captive.Hans Christian Wolters, the prosecutor leading the investigation into Brueckner, has said he was \u201cvery confident\u201d the inmate is responsible for kidnapping her. \u201cIf you knew the evidence we had you would come to the same conclusion as I do but I can\u2019t give you details because we don\u2019t want the accused to know what we have on him \u2013 these are tactical considerations,\u201d he told the BBC. It was subsequently revealed that Madeleine\u2019s Fund still had \u00a3773,629 to spend as of 31 March 2020, meaning the McCanns can continue to bankroll a private investigation to find their daughter long after the police hunt is finally drawn to a close, should they choose to.Brueckner was formally made a \u201carguido\u201d in relation to the case on 21 April 2022.On 19 September, the McCanns lost their libel case against Mr Amaral, the former chief inspector who had investigated the disappearance, before the European Court of Human Rights. The couple had attempted to argue that Mr Amaral was responsible for damaging their reputation and breaching their rights to respect for their private life and to be presumed innocent after taking exception to his book and associated media appearances in which he had repeatedly suggested they were responsible for the vanishing.Their complaint also argued that Portugal\u2019s Supreme Court had failed to allow them proper redress over the alleged libel by Mr Amaral after judges threw out their earlier claim in 2017.The verdict left the McCanns with three months to appeal against the decision.In February 2023, a Polish woman called Julia Faustyna made headlines by claiming she was Madeleine, using the Instagram name @iammadeleinemccann.Ms Faustyna, 21, did not provide any supporting evidence but sought DNA tests to prove her origins. The results ultimately revealed that she was entirely of Polish origin, with no British heritage, disproving her claims for good. In April 2023, a court in Braunschweig dropped a rape charge against Brueckner, unrelated to the Madeleine McCann case, concluding it did not have jurisdiction.Police in Germany continue to claim they have \u201cconcrete evidence\u201d that Madeleine is dead but this has still not been confirmed and their investigation is ongoing, with Brueckner still not charged in the McCann case. Investigators explore the Barragem do Arade beauty spot (EPA)Like her parents, Madeleine\u2019s sister Amelie, now 18, observed the 16th anniversary of her disappearance in May 2023.Speaking publicly for the first time at a prayer meeting in Rothley, she said: \u201cIt\u2019s nice that everyone is here together but it\u2019s a sad occasion.\u201dAmelie McCann reportedly joined in with chants including \u201cNever never give up\u201d, \u201cleave no stone unturned\u201d, \u201cdon\u2019t forget about me\u201d and \u201cstill missing, still missed\u201d.Later that month, the case unexpectedly lurched back into life in when investigators launched a major search operation at a reservoir in the Algarve, with Mr Wolters saying they were acting on \u201ccertain tips\u201d from Brueckner, whom the prosecutor said he remains \u201cvery confident\u201d holds the key to Madeleine\u2019s disappearance.With help from Portuguese police and with Scotland Yard detectives watching on, German investigators carried out a thorough examination of the Barragem do Arade beauty spot in Silves.They combed the shoreline and surrounding grasslands with sniffer dogs, rakes, spades and pickaxes and inspected the water in a rigid-hull inflatable boat.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeMadeleine McCann, a three-year-old girl from Rothley, Leicestershire, was reported missing from the Portuguese holiday resort of Praia da Luz on the Algarve on 3 May 2007, a case still unsolved and still the subject of intense interest among the public and press.Her parents, Kate McCann and Gerry McCann, posted a statement on the Find Madeleine website on 3 May 2023 marking the latest anniversary of their daughter\u2019s disappearance, reiterating their hopes of being reunited with her one day and posting a poem, \u201cThe Contradiction\u201d by Clare Pollard, to express their feelings.\u201cToday marks the 16th anniversary of Madeleine\u2019s abduction. Still missing... still very much missed,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThe police investigation continues, and we await a breakthrough. Thank you to everyone for your support \u2013 it really helps.\u201dFollow all the latest updates on The Independent\u2019s liveblogHere is a reminder of the events of the case.RecommendedMadeleine McCann news \u2013 latest: Soil from reservoir compared to samples from prime suspect\u2019s vanHow Madeleine McCann search at reservoir unfolded \u2013 and what police foundRead Madeleine McCann suspect Christian Brueckner\u2019s bombshell prison letters for the first timeThe story began when the McCanns \u2013 affluent doctors Kate and Gerry, their three-year-old daughter Madeleine and her two-year-old twin siblings Amelia and Sean \u2013 joined a group of seven family friends and their five children on holiday at the Ocean Club in the village of Praia da Luz on the southwestern tip of Portugal on 28 April 2007.After a pleasant spring break by the sea, the adults in the party went out for dinner at the resort\u2019s open-air tapas bar on 3 May, gathering at 8.30pm. The children were left behind sleeping in their respective apartments with the doors unlocked and a rota system in place among the parents to ensure that someone returned every half-hour to check on them.When Kate McCann took her turn and returned to her apartment at 10pm, she raced back to the restaurant screaming \u201cMadeleine\u2019s gone! Someone\u2019s taken her!\u201d The police were quickly called and 60 staff and fellow guests searched the complex, calling out the girl\u2019s name in vain until daybreak the following morning.Border police and airport staff were put on alert and hundreds of volunteers joined the efforts to find the missing girl over the coming days, the case fast becoming a sensation.The Portuguese authorities would later attract criticism over their conduct in the crucial earliest hours of the investigation when the trail might still have been warm, accused of making rudimentary mistakes like failing to conduct a house-by-house search of every local residence or interview all of the other guests at the resort, acting slowly to erect roadblocks and potentially compromising forensic evidence at the crime scene.Madeleine McCann (PA)The police initially stated that they believed Madeleine was still alive and had been abducted from the room by a stranger as the parents described their \u201canguish and despair\u201d over her vanishing, a worst fear realised for any parent.On 26 May, police issued a description of a suspicious man seen on the night of the girl\u2019s disappearance. The individual in question was spotted by Jane Tanner, one of the McCanns\u2019 dining companions, who said she had seen a Mediterranean man with dark hair and beige trousers carrying a child close to the apartment when she went to check in on her own children. Scotland Yard would later come to dismiss the sighting as a red herring.The search continued as the summer progressed amid a wild media circus and with huge fundraising activities underway, the McCanns setting up Madeleine\u2019s Fund on 15 May to raise cash to support further investigation and keep the profile of the case high, attracting generous donations from celebrities like Richard Branson, Simon Cowell, JK Rowling and Coleen Rooney. By 30 May, the case was such a cause celebre that they were being flown out to meet the Pope at the Vatican in Sir Phillip Green\u2019s Learjet.A local man, Robert Murat, subsequently became its first suspect and had his house and car searched, his swimming pool drained and his electronic devices confiscated but no evidence was found to link him to Madeleine and the matter was soon dropped.By June, the Portuguese police admitted that they had failed to protect potentially useful evidence at the scene as frustration with the lack of developments grew and the media began to question whether the McCanns themselves had been involved in the matter.

Doctors concluded she was 32 to 34 weeks pregnant at the time. The court heard Foster, who already had three children before she became pregnant again in 2019, had lied to the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) during a telephone consultation about how far along her pregnancy was so she could obtain the pills.Following the sentencing, abortion providers, campaigners and politicians fiercely criticised the decision to jail the mother as they called for abortion care in the UK to be immediately decriminalised.Despite receiving a letter from healthcare professionals asking him not to imprison Foster, justice Edward Pepperall imposed a 28-month sentence.RecommendedWomen are waiting too long for abortions, health watchdog findsNHS chief warns of \u2018enormous\u2019 disruption as junior doctors\u2019 announce strike British government \u2018abused, bullied and intimidated\u2019 peers on small boats crisis law Signatories to the letter included the president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the chief executive of the Royal College of Midwives.Justice Pepperall said Foster felt \u201cvery deep and genuine remorse\u201d, was \u201cracked with guilt\u201d and still had nightmares over her actions.But he said his role as judge \u201cis to apply the law as provided by parliament and clarified by the Court of Appeal\u201d, adding that it is \u201ca matter for parliament and not for the courts\u201d.Discussing the letter, he said: \u201cIf the medical profession considers that judges are wrong to imprison women who procure a late abortion outside the 24-week limit then it should lobby Parliament to change that law and not judges who are charged with the duty of applying the law.\u201dThe judge said it would have been better if the letter, which he described as \u201cinappropriate\u201d, \u201chad not been written at all\u201d.Foster will carry out half her sentence in prison and the remaining time under licence.

Multiple and prolonged internet searches showed a level of planning. The taking of the drugs was a planned and deliberate act in which her intention could only have been to procure an abortion.\u201dThe prosecution said the woman made a number of internet searches during lockdown between February and May 2020, including \u201chow to hide a pregnancy bump\u201d, \u201chow to have an abortion without going to the doctor\u201d and \u201chow to lose a baby at six months\u201d.RecommendedFears for vulnerable women amid rise in Britons investigated over illegal abortions by policeWhy are women being arrested for having abortions in the UK?Foster was initially charged with child destruction and pleaded not guilty but later pleaded guilty to an alternative charge of administering drugs or using instruments to procure abortion, which was accepted by the prosecution. The maximum sentence is life imprisonment.Justice Pepperall said the case was made more \u201ctragic\u201d because the woman did not plead guilty earlier, adding that he may have been able to consider suspending the jail sentence if she had.Abortions are still deemed a criminal act in England, Scotland, and Wales under the 1967 Abortion Act.The 1861 legislation means any woman who ends a pregnancy without obtaining legal permission from two doctors, who must agree that continuing with it would be a risk to the woman\u2019s physical or mental health, can face up to life imprisonment.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeMillions of people across the UK are struggling to meet their financial obligations as the cost of living crisis persists. A Financial Conduct Authority study has put the total as high as 10 million, reporting a 3.1 million increase year-on-year and warning that many are having to choose between heating and eating and being forced to cancel insurance policies to make ends meet. With inflation still in double digits at 10.1 per cent, the cost of goods in supermarket aisles and on high street shelves remains high \u2013 doubling in many cases, according to a recent survey from Which? \u2013 household budgets continue to be stretched after a long winter of sky-high energy bills.And, while there is state support available to help those up against it on low incomes, several government initiatives that promised help throughout the winter, such as the Warm Home Discount and Cold Weather Payment schemes, have now ceased to apply, subsiding on 1 April with the changing of the seasons.The government\u2019s Energy Bill Support Scheme, introduced by Rishi Sunak during his time in 11 Downing Street last year, has also now wound up, dishing out the final \u00a367 instalment of its \u00a3400 total in late March.RecommendedTesco issues warning to everyone with a ClubcardRecord \u00a32.4bn in motor claims paid in first quarter of 2023, say insurersRetired colonel cleared

the Energy Bill Support Scheme, millions of households on low incomes will nevertheless receive further cost of living support from the government this year worth up to \u00a31,350 in total.Eight million eligible means-tested benefits claimants, including people on universal credit, pension credit and tax credits, will receive \u00a3900 in instalments from this spring, with the money going directly to bank accounts in three payments, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has said.There will also be a separate \u00a3150 payment for more than six million people with disabilities and an extra \u00a3300 for over eight million pensioners.Here are the payment windows that have been announced so far, with more precise dates expected later in the year:\u00a3301 \u2013 First cost of living payment \u2013 already issued between 25 April and 17 May (or 2 to 9 May for people on tax credits but no other low-income benefits)\u00a3150 \u2013 Disability payment \u2013 during summer

spring 2024Energy Price Guarantee still in playThere was some good news in Jeremy Hunt\u2019s Budget of 15 March when the chancellor announced that the Energy Price Guarantee (EPG) \u2013 introduced by Liz Truss last September to ensure households paid no more than \u00a32,500 for their electricity and gas, with the government subsidising the remainder owed to providers under Ofgem\u2019s Energy Price Cap \u2013 would be extended for a further three months.Mr Hunt had reportedly been tempted to increase the EPG to \u00a33,000, a considerably less generous offer that would have eased the burden on the state, but ultimately thought better of it, extending the guarantee into April, May and June.\u201cHigh energy bills are one of the biggest worries for families, which is why we\u2019re maintaining the energy price guarantee at its current level,\u201d the chancellor told Parliament in his Spring Statement.\u201cWith energy bills set to fall from July onwards, this temporary change will bridge the gap and ease the pressure on families, while also helping to lower inflation too.\u201dWithout that help in place, the average household would have been paying an annualised bill of \u00a34,279 between January and April but, because of the EPG, that was reduced to \u00a32,500 with the government picking up the remaining \u00a31,779.Ofgem has since dropped the price cap by 23 per cent to \u00a33,280 for the second quarter of the year, with Mr Hunt\u2019s decision meaning the public will continue to be shielded rather than pay that full amount while the state will be paying considerably less, more like \u00a3780 per household.Benefits going out as usualThe usual state support in the shape of benefits and pensions payments will also be going out as usual in June, with no bank holidays scheduled to confuse delivery dates.Anyone expecting to receive any of the following from the DWP can expect their money on the usual date this month.Universal creditState pensionPension

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeMillions of people across the UK are struggling to meet their financial obligations as the cost of living crisis persists. A Financial Conduct Authority study has put the total as high as 10 million, reporting a 3.1 million increase year-on-year and warning that many are having to choose between heating and eating and being forced to cancel insurance policies to make ends meet. With inflation still in double digits at 10.1 per cent, the cost of goods in supermarket aisles and on high street shelves remains high \u2013 doubling in many cases, according to a recent survey from Which? \u2013 household budgets continue to be stretched after a long winter of sky-high energy bills.And, while there is state support available to help those up against it on low incomes, several government initiatives that promised help throughout the winter, such as the Warm Home Discount and Cold Weather Payment schemes, have now ceased to apply, subsiding on 1 April with the changing of the seasons.The government\u2019s Energy Bill Support Scheme, introduced by Rishi Sunak during his time in 11 Downing Street last year, has also now wound up, dishing out the final \u00a367 instalment of its \u00a3400 total in late March.RecommendedTesco issues warning to everyone with a ClubcardRecord \u00a32.4bn in motor claims paid in first quarter of 2023, say insurersRetired colonel cleared over \u00a343,000 claim to pay his children\u2019s school feesBelow, we look at what support is available to households this June.Extra \u00a31,350 of support being paid outDespite the expiration of the Energy Bill Support Scheme, millions of households on low incomes will nevertheless receive further cost of living support from the government this year worth up to \u00a31,350 in total.Eight million eligible means-tested benefits claimants, including people on universal credit, pension credit and tax credits, will receive \u00a3900 in instalments from this spring, with the money going directly to bank accounts in three payments, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has said.There will also be a separate \u00a3150 payment for more than six million people with disabilities and an extra \u00a3300 for over eight million pensioners.Here are the payment windows that have been announced so far, with more precise dates expected later in the year:\u00a3301 \u2013 First cost of living payment \u2013 already issued between 25 April and 17 May (or 2 to 9 May for people on tax credits but no other low-income benefits)\u00a3150 \u2013 Disability payment \u2013 during summer 2023\u00a3300 \u2013 Second cost of living payment \u2013 during autumn 2023\u00a3300 \u2013 Pensioner payment \u2013 during winter 2023/4\u00a3299 \u2013 Third cost of living payment \u2013 during spring 2024Energy Price Guarantee still in playThere was some good news in Jeremy Hunt\u2019s Budget of 15 March when the chancellor announced that the Energy Price Guarantee (EPG) \u2013 introduced by Liz Truss last September to ensure households paid no more than \u00a32,500 for their electricity and gas, with the government subsidising the remainder owed to providers under Ofgem\u2019s Energy Price Cap \u2013 would be extended for a further three months.Mr Hunt had reportedly been tempted to increase the EPG to \u00a33,000, a considerably less generous offer that would have eased the burden on the state, but ultimately thought better of it, extending the guarantee into April, May and June.\u201cHigh energy bills are one of the biggest worries for families, which is why we\u2019re maintaining the energy price guarantee at its current level,\u201d the chancellor told Parliament in his Spring Statement.\u201cWith energy bills set to fall from July onwards, this temporary change will bridge the gap and ease the pressure on families, while also helping to lower inflation too.\u201dWithout that help in place, the average household would have been paying an annualised bill of \u00a34,279 between January and April but, because of the EPG, that was reduced to \u00a32,500 with the government picking up the remaining \u00a31,779.Ofgem has since dropped the price cap by 23 per cent to \u00a33,280 for the second quarter of the year, with Mr Hunt\u2019s decision meaning the public will continue to be shielded rather than pay that full amount while the state will be paying considerably less, more like \u00a3780 per household.Benefits going out as usualThe usual state support in the shape of benefits and pensions payments will also be going out as usual in June, with no bank holidays scheduled to confuse delivery dates.Anyone expecting to receive any of the following from the DWP can expect their money on the usual date this month.Universal creditState pensionPension

Doctors concluded she was 32 to 34 weeks pregnant at the time. The court heard Foster, who already had three children before she became pregnant again in 2019, had lied to the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) during a telephone consultation about how far along her pregnancy was so she could obtain the pills.Following the sentencing, abortion providers, campaigners and politicians fiercely criticised the decision to jail the mother as they called for abortion care in the UK to be immediately decriminalised.Despite receiving a letter from healthcare professionals asking him not to imprison Foster, justice Edward Pepperall imposed a 28-month sentence.RecommendedWomen are waiting too long for abortions, health watchdog findsNHS chief warns of \u2018enormous\u2019 disruption as junior doctors\u2019 announce strike British government \u2018abused, bullied and intimidated\u2019 peers on small boats crisis law Signatories to the letter included the president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the chief executive of the Royal College of Midwives.Justice Pepperall said Foster felt \u201cvery deep and genuine remorse\u201d, was \u201cracked with guilt\u201d and still had nightmares over her actions.But he said his role as judge \u201cis to apply the law as provided by parliament and clarified by the Court of Appeal\u201d, adding that it is \u201ca matter for parliament and not for the courts\u201d.Discussing the letter, he said: \u201cIf the medical profession considers that judges are wrong to imprison women who procure a late abortion outside the 24-week limit then it should lobby Parliament to change that law and not judges who are charged with the duty of applying the law.\u201dThe judge said it would have been better if the letter, which he described as \u201cinappropriate\u201d, \u201chad not been written at all\u201d.Foster will carry out half her sentence in prison and the remaining time under licence.

Multiple and prolonged internet searches showed a level of planning. The taking of the drugs was a planned and deliberate act in which her intention could only have been to procure an abortion.\u201dThe prosecution said the woman made a number of internet searches during lockdown between February and May 2020, including \u201chow to hide a pregnancy bump\u201d, \u201chow to have an abortion without going to the doctor\u201d and \u201chow to lose a baby at six months\u201d.RecommendedFears for vulnerable women amid rise in Britons investigated over illegal abortions by policeWhy are women being arrested for having abortions in the UK?Foster was initially charged with child destruction and pleaded not guilty but later pleaded guilty to an alternative charge of administering drugs or using instruments to procure abortion, which was accepted by the prosecution. The maximum sentence is life imprisonment.Justice Pepperall said the case was made more \u201ctragic\u201d because the woman did not plead guilty earlier, adding that he may have been able to consider suspending the jail sentence if she had.Abortions are still deemed a criminal act in England, Scotland, and Wales under the 1967 Abortion Act.The 1861 legislation means any woman who ends a pregnancy without obtaining legal permission from two doctors, who must agree that continuing with it would be a risk to the woman\u2019s physical or mental health, can face up to life imprisonment.

Almost one in five (19%) of Year 9 pupils expressed an interest in learning Italian in addition to the language(s) they already learn at school, followed by Spanish (16.6%) and then Irish (11.3%).When asked about the value of languages, almost all pupils do not see the potential for languages to be a part of their future careers \u2013 with just 14.2% of the 1,158 Year 9 pupils surveyed expressing any likelihood of using languages in the future.However, motivation for language learning in Year 9 is still high with most young people (74%) enjoying languages at Key Stage 3.Meanwhile, in primary schools, languages are also recovering, having almost collapsed following the pandemic.The report shows that 51% of responding primary schools currently teach languages as part of the curriculum, with Spanish the main language taught at Key Stage 2, closely followed by French.When asked if languages should be statutory at Key Stage 3, 84% of responding schools agreed, with Northern Ireland remaining\u00a0 the only part of the UK and Ireland where pupils at primary school do not have an entitlement to learn a language as part of the curriculum.Dr Collen said that following years of decline, language learning in Northern Ireland has stabilised.\u201cWhilst other UK jurisdictions and Ireland are investing in language learning, there is an urgent need to start similar endeavours in Northern Ireland to ensure we have a multilingual workforce ready to grow our economy,\u201d he said.\u201cIt would be timely to overhaul curriculum content and assessment of languages to better reflect the lives of young people today, and offer appropriate vocational qualifications in languages through progression pathways for all learners.\u201dJonathan Stewart, director, British Council Northern Ireland, said the latest report gives cause for optimism.RecommendedMore people eligible to have historical homosexuality convictions wipedNHS chief warns of \u2018enormous\u2019 disruption ahead of junior doctors\u2019 strikePeople seek hay fever advice once every three seconds, says NHS England\u201cOur increasingly multicultural society makes it more important than ever to promote languages in our schools, equipping young people with the skills they need to thrive in future careers,\u201d he said.\u201cStrong language skills enhance communication and interpersonal skills, expand career opportunities, and develop intercultural awareness.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64885e1351ac33216efdbbc2", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/nhs-england-people-hay-fever-england-met-office-b2356268.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "People seek hay fever advice once every three seconds, says NHS England", "lead": "It comes as the pollen count was \u2018very high\u2019 in many parts of the country.", "author": "Ella Pickover", "datePublished": "Mon, 12 Jun 2023 23:01:00 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:16:19.315469", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/13/00/129d91ab8add67b59869d7f93e5ab16eY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg2NjYyNDEw-2.34528775.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

You can\u2019t allow that to happen, you have to stand up for yourself, and that\u2019s what I did.\u201dReferring to Mr Sunak and Mr Forsyth, she added: \u201cThis story is about a girl from Liverpool\u2026 who had something that was offered to her\u2026 removed by two privileged posh boys.\u201dMs Dorries said she was \u201c100%\u201d sure that her former boss had not decided to axe her from the list himself.It comes amid an escalating war of words between Mr Johnson and the Prime Minister.The former prime minister accused Mr Sunak of \u201ctalking rubbish\u201d for claiming his predecessor asked him to overrule the vetting committee to push through his House of Lords nominations.RecommendedUK to return to dry, sunny weather after being battered by thunderstormsChildren dead in suspected double murder named as detectives question womanMPs warned to use careful language to prevent trans people being targeted\u201cTo honour these peerages it was not necessary to overrule Holac \u2013 but simply to ask them to renew their vetting, which was a mere formality,\u201d Mr Johnson said.One Downing Street source said the Cabinet Office had made it clear to Mr Johnson that there is no re-vetting process, while the Prime Minister\u2019s official spokesman said it is \u201centirely untrue to say that anyone from No 10 attempted to remove or change\u201d to Holac-approved list."}, {"_id": "64885e1451ac33216efdbbc5", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/boris-johnson-sunak-partygate-report-b2356054.html", "primaryCategory": "UK Politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Boris Johnson: Sunak\u2019s \u2018talking rubbish\u2019 \u2013 I didn\u2019t ask PM to bend honours rules", "lead": "<p>Tory war of words intensifies, as party braces for verdict on whether Johnson lied about lockdown parties</p>", "author": "Adam Forrest and Archie Mitchell", "datePublished": "Mon, 12 Jun 2023 20:41:41 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:16:20.070085", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/12/19/Boris%20Johnson%20Rishi%20Sunak%20indycomp%20news%2012%20June.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up for the View from Westminster email for expert analysis straight to your inboxGet our free View from Westminster email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

But he is now expected to avoid the embarrassing sanction \u2013 likely to have sparked a by-election \u2013 because he is standing down as the MP for Uxbridge and Ruislip.One senior Tory MP told The Independent they expected the report to be harsh and cement Mr Johnson\u2019s unpopularity with the public, adding: \u201cI think the public are completely fed up with him, as is the party.

Ordinary men fear for the safety of their daughters in public toilets.\u201cOrdinary children are subjected to a psychological experiment which they are told they can choose their gender, and ordinary toddlers are used to satisfy the sexual fetish of adult men dressed as eroticised women.\u201cUnderstanding the difference between male and female underpins society, safety and security. We must clarify the Equality Act to give ordinary people the certainty that our laws can be trusted to protect women and children, and that sex means sex.\u201dSNP MP Hannah Bardell responded: \u201cI feel it incumbent upon me to make a point of order on the fact that trans people are being characterised as predators.\u201cThat is deeply undemocratic and deeply worrying in this debate, and that is not what this debate is about, and for the Member to be using language like that and terms like that is unparliamentary.\u201dBut Ms Cates replied: \u201cI was making the point that the vast majority of sexual predation happens by men of women and children, and those are the rules that society has evolved to protect against.\u201dAhead of the debate, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said biological sex is \u201cfundamentally important\u201d, but Ms Caulfield said the Government had not yet finished considering whether to make changes to the Equality Act.After being asked to investigate changes to the Act, the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) in April said that while it found \u201cno straightforward balance\u201d, the change could bring \u201cgreater legal clarity\u201d in eight areas including hospital wards and sport.Ms Caulfield told MPs said: \u201cI know that Members in this Chamber today will be eager to hear updates and reassurances and the timeline around our next steps, but these issues under discussion today are complex and we need to be proceeding carefully and respectfully, because as we have heard in the Chamber there are a wide number of people who would be affected by any change.\u201cI hope that Members will agree it is only right and proper that we take timely consideration of the advice that we have been given before coming to any conclusions.\u201dConservative former minister Tim Loughton gave his backing to calls for the Act to be amended, claiming it was about \u201cclarification, not change\u201d.He said: \u201cThere is currently confusion about how the Equality Act operates in relation to sex that is jeopardising provision of single sex and separate sex services allowed for by the act.\u201dOn sport, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s not fair on women and girls who\u2019ve spent years training in their sport only to have it snatched away by competing against somebody who is biologically different.\u201dLabour\u2019s Lloyd Russell-Moyle (Brighton, Kemptown) meanwhile backed calls to leave the Act as it is.RecommendedMember of Birmingham Six \u2018sings at his own funeral\u2019Parliament seems to remain in permanent swamp of complaints, says Penny MordauntCleverly asks Bryant to withdraw \u2018Chinese stooge\u2019 claim amid row over BeijingHe said: \u201cPeople are complex and that\u2019s why flexibility in the law, the current law as it stands, is important.\u201cActually, by defining it too much, what you suddenly do is assume that everyone lives in these easy binary boxes.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64885e1551ac33216efdbbca", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/adam-clapham-court-rotherham-b2356194.html", "primaryCategory": "Crime", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Five guilty of \u2018utterly horrific\u2019 torture and murder of man in cellar over \u00a3300 debt", "lead": "<p>Adam Clapham, 31, was tied to a chair and tortured for five hours in a Rotherham basement</p>", "author": "Dave Higgens", "datePublished": "Mon, 12 Jun 2023 19:56:14 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:16:21.400922", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2022/09/24/14/newFile.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

MGN has previously denied that 35 of the 37 articles involved phone hacking or unlawful information-gathering, with one article being not admitted.During the second day of her evidence, Ms Sanderson was taken through several of the articles by MGN\u2019s barrister, along with some examples of similar stories in non-MGN publications.One of these stories, a short piece in the Daily Mirror from May 2005, showed Ms Sanderson and her then-boyfriend Danny Young on a beach together, which MGN say came from a photography agency.RecommendedNikki Sanderson says giving evidence in phone hacking case was \u2018humiliating\u2019I watched in horror as Harry told his truth, his whole truth and nothing but his truth...Nikki Sanderson tells court her hair was set on fire during public backlashMs Sanderson described the photo as \u201cunflattering\u201d, adding: \u201cI just don\u2019t understand how they knew I was talking about going on holiday with my friends.\u201dThe actress, who has played Maxine Minniver in the Channel 4 soap Hollyoaks since 2012, was then taken to a front-page photoshoot she starred in with the men\u2019s magazine Maxim in August 2005.

Mr Green said: \u201cIt says you were fuming \u2026 there is a reference to an onlooker.\u201cThis appears to be reporting something someone had seen rather than being gathered from voicemail messages.\u201d However, Ms Sanderson said she would not have had a row outside of the set, where she could be seen by the public.She added: \u201cI just don\u2019t feel like that would have happened.\u201d The actress later denied a suggestion that another article was \u201cutterly trivial\u201d.\u201cTo you it might seem trivial, to me it\u2019s like I was being watched and followed,\u201d she said.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe sister of a headteacher who took her own life following an Ofsted inspection has criticised the school watchdog, claiming proposed reforms are not enough. Professor Julia Waters said the Ofsted inspection at her sister Ruth Perry\u2019s primary school in Reading had been \u2018the worst day\u2019 of her life.Ofsted is set to introduce major changes to the school inspection system after Ms Perry died by suicide in January this year, after a report from the inspectorate found that Caversham Primary School was \u201cgood\u201d in every category apart from leadership and management, where it was judged to be \u201cinadequate\u201d.School headteacher Ruth Perry took her own life after an Ofsted inspection  (Brighter Futures for Children)Ms Waters said the move was \u201ca start\u201d but more changes were needed as they do not \u201cadequately address the many problems that the system creates\u201d.\u201cI am disappointed that no mention is made about removing harmful and misleading single-word judgments,\u201d she told Radio 4\u2019s Today programme on Monday.RecommendedLabour pledges to revamp Ofsted grading systemOfsted inspectors should \u2018hand in badges\u2019, says sister of late headteacher Ruth PerrySchool leaders\u2019 union to ask headteachers to stop working as Ofsted inspectors\u201cI can understand the need to provide clarity and simplicity for parents about an inspection, but too much is hidden or lost behind a headline judgement of just one or two words,\u201d she added. Professor Waters was responding to comments made on Today by Ofsted\u2019s chief inspector Amanda Spielman. She insisted Ofsted is listening to the concerns raised in the wake of Ms Perry\u2019s death and has been \u201cthinking carefully about how we can revise aspects of our work without losing our clear focus on the needs of children and their parents\u201d.The changes include new funding for wellbeing support for teachers and school leaders, but stop short of banning single-word ratings.Campaigners and MPs are calling for changes to Ofsted including the removal of the one-word grading system  (PA)Ofsted has been under pressure from unions and Labour, who have joined calls for one-word Ofsted assessments to be abolished in the wake of Perry\u2019s death. Education secretary Gillian Keegan has defended the system as clear and easy for parents to understand.However, Professor Waters did call plans to remove a requirement that the inspectorates\u2019 findings stay confidential before results are published a \u201cvery welcome, much-needed change\u201d and also welcomed the additional funding for mental health support.Earlier, schools were not allowed to see how inspectors arrived at their conclusion, thereby making the process of challenging the decision via Ofsted\u2019s complaints more difficult. Ms Perry\u2019s sister Professor Julia Waters called the confidentiality agreement for Ofsted reports \u2018inhumane\u2019  (PA)The watchdog\u2019s officials will still turn up with only a day\u2019s notice, but there will be \u201cmore clarity\u201d about the year schools are likely to be inspected.A change, coming in from September, will see inspection reports refer to the school, rather than individuals, when discussing areas of weakness.Ofsted added that inspectors will be clear that it is up to a headteacher to decide which colleagues, or others, they share their inspection outcome with \u2013 ahead of the report being finalised.Responding to Ms Spielman\u2019s points, Professor Waters said: \u201cNothing she has said would have helped my sister. She didn\u2019t last three months \u2013 she lasted 54 days with that knowledge.\u201dExplaining why the \u2018inhumane\u2019 confidentiality agreement was so harmful, Professor Waters said: \u2018It (the draft report) says categorically that teachers must not share that information and that Ofsted would consider it a serious breach of confidentiality and take appropriate action.\u201cShe told me, her sister, because she told me everything, but it was always couched in this dreadful \u2018Don\u2019t tell anyone - I\u2019ll lose my job if I get found out\u2019.\u201d\u201cEven unburdening herself was a burden because she was so terrified that she would lose her job \u2013 lose her school which she had loved and led for 16 years.\u201dTributes were paid to Ms Perry after her death  (PA Wire)Ms Waters went on to explain one of the reasons why her sister found the inadequate judgement so difficult was that she had invited Ofsted into the school three years previously, determined to get everything in place and believing it would be useful for their school improvement work.Professor Waters said: \u201cThe feedback that she received from the team overseen by Amanda Spielman was glowing - it identified no failings whatsoever. They commented explicitly on the fact that staff are vigilant and safeguarding leads are tenacious.\u201cOne of the reasons that Ruth found that inadequate judgment so devastating was precisely because she had invited Ofsted in three years before and wanted to make sure she had everything in place.\u201cShe was given assurances that the school was functioning well and that their outstanding judgment was valid.\u201dRecommendedEducation Secretary \u2018considering urgent actions\u2019 after Ruth Perry death \u2013 sisterNearly a third of primary schools have no male classroom teachers \u2013 studySchools graded inadequate overall as a result of ineffective safeguarding \u2013 where all other judgements are good or better \u2013 will see inspectors return within three months of an inspection report being published.This is more quickly than has previously been the case and if the school has been able to resolve the safeguarding concerns it is likely to see its overall grade improve, Ofsted said.Also from September schools will be given more clarity about the threshold for effective versus ineffective safeguarding, the watchdog said, adding that ineffective safeguarding will be described more clearly in inspection reports \u201cto help reassure parents and others that these judgements are not made lightly\u201d.If you need to speak to someone, Samaritans are available 24/7 on 116 123.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeBoris Johnson has formally resigned as an MP under the archaic process of being appointed to be Steward and Bailiff of the Three Hundreds of Chiltern.The move follows the former prime minister\u2019s dramatic resignation announcement last week, in protest at his trimmed-down honours list and expected ruling by a parliamentary committee that he lied to MPs over partygate.But he technically remained an MP until his exit from Parliament was formally triggered on Monday, when Chancellor Jeremy Hunt appointed him to the historical position \u2013 which in modern times has been used to facilitate the resignations of MPs.\n\nIn modern times they are unpaid, formal titles that are applied for when an MP needs to disqualify themselves from the CommonsParliament website\u201cThe Chancellor of the Exchequer has this day appointed Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson to be Steward and Bailiff of the Three Hundreds of Chiltern,\u201d the Treasury said.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveElected MPs are in theory unable to resign and must become disqualified if they wish to quit Westminster while Parliament is sitting.Holding the Chiltern Hundreds or the Manor of Northstead titles immediately disqualifies a person by law from being an MP and therefore removes them from the House of Commons.Former culture secretary Nadine Dorries and ex-minister Nigel Adams also said they were standing down as MPs after Downing Street published Mr Johnson\u2019s resignation honours list on Friday without their names.Mr Johnson\u2019s camp accused Rishi Sunak of having \u201csecretly blocked\u201d their peerages, amid a public slanging match between the current and former prime ministers.Mr Adams pipped Mr Johnson to the post with his formal resignation on Monday, with Mr Hunt naming him the Steward and Bailiff of the Manor of Northstead minutes before the ex-prime minister\u2019s appointment.The arcane title held by Mr Adams alternates with the Hundreds.He will likely only stay in the position briefly until Ms Dorries takes it on to formally quit.Parliament\u2019s website says: \u201cThe Steward and Bailiffs of the Chiltern Hundreds and of the Manor of Northstead were positions traditionally paid for by the Crown.\u201cIn modern times they are unpaid, formal titles that are applied for when an MP needs to disqualify themselves from the Commons.RecommendedNurses \u2018struggling to live\u2019, union leader warns amid new strike ballotRenoir painting a first for public collection in Northern IrelandAlister Jack: Foreigners unhappy discussing independence with Scots ministers\u201cAn elected MP has no right to resign: unless they die or are expelled they must become disqualified if they wish to retire before the end of a Parliament.\u201cBy law, taking on one of these titles immediately bars a person from being an MP.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64885e1751ac33216efdbbd4", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/royal-college-of-nursing-nurses-england-nhs-government-b2356125.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Nurses \u2018struggling to live\u2019, union leader warns amid new strike ballot", "lead": "The Royal College of Nursing is currently balloting members in England on further strike action over pay.", "author": "Ella Pickover", "datePublished": "Mon, 12 Jun 2023 17:27:16 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 14:16:23.990937", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/12/18/9072f5307de71bcd45d9503cf6801749Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg2NjM3NDcw-2.71977958.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Their pay over this past decade has dropped by 20%, and they are really struggling to live \u2013 they\u2019re struggling to feed their families, they\u2019re struggling to keep a roof over their head.\u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking to hear those nurses saying that they now have to choose whether they stay on as a nurse or go elsewhere so that they can feed their families and keep a roof over their head.\u201cThat\u2019s not a way to treat the nursing staff. Every patient needs a nurse at some point in their lives so we need to do the decent thing for them.\u201dAsked about the prospect of more strikes, she said: \u201cIt worked the last time because in the past six months we\u2019ve had negotiations with Government \u2013 negotiations that we wouldn\u2019t have had if they hadn\u2019t have taken the action that they took, so they\u2019re willing to take that action again.\u201cThey actually lose out during that action.\u201cThis isn\u2019t about them being selfish or reckless, it\u2019s about standing up again for the health service just as we\u2019re about to embark on the 75th year anniversary, and shouldn\u2019t we be celebrating it?\u201cBut we need to celebrate it by able to by being able to fill the vacant posts that we\u2019ve got.\u201dA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \u201cWe hugely value the work of nurses and it is disappointing the RCN is balloting its members for further industrial action.\u201cThe majority of unions on the NHS Staff Council voted to accept the Government\u2019s fair and reasonable pay offer \u2013 which includes a pay rise of 10.7% over two years for newly qualified nurses \u2013 and we hope RCN members recognise this is a fair deal and decide it is time to bring industrial action to an end.RecommendedRenoir painting a first for public collection in Northern IrelandAlister Jack: Foreigners unhappy discussing independence with Scots ministersEverton being sued by former manager Carlo Ancelotti\u201cWe have helped nearly two million people out of absolute poverty since 2010 and have launched a \u00a394 billion support package worth around \u00a33,300 per household to help those most in need, as well as raising benefits by 10.1%.\u201d\u2013 The RCN ballot for members in England is running until June 23."}]
