Read our\u00a0privacy noticeDan Wootton is a GB News presenter, and MailOnline columnist, facing allegations that he has been using fake online identities to trick men into sending him sexually explicit images in exchange for tens of thousands of pounds. While the claims are investigated, the MailOnline has paused his regular column.Returning to his show last Thursday, Wootton stridently denied the claims:\u201cSo good to be back from my scheduled holiday in New Zealand, with my family,\u201d he said, the Union flag backdrop tessellating behind him. \u201cIt was really special actually, that family time, because, of course, they are the people who really know you.\u201dFor those outside of the Wootton clan, here\u2019s the story of how a 12,000-mile journey across the world turned Wootton into one of Britain\u2019s most well-sourced and salacious journalists \u2013 before leaving him at the eye of the latest storm.Born in 1983 in New Zealand\u2019s capital, Wellington, to British parents, Wootton was raised in Lower Hutt, a city to the east of Wellington Harbour. He was a near contemporary of future Oscar-winner Anna Paquin in this English-speaking enclave of the Pacific Ocean. Cut off from the rest of the world (even Sydney is a 4-hour flight from Wellington) the New Zealand of the 1980s and 1990s was a significant importer of British and American culture.RecommendedDan Wootton MailOnline column suspended amid investigation - latestDan Wootton suspended by MailOnline as \u2018explicit images\u2019 claims investigatedDan Wootton\u2019s MailOnline column paused while allegations investigatedMarvin Gaye, David Bowie and Michael Jackson all had long runs at the top of the charts in the year of Wootton\u2019s birth \u2013 and by 2004 Wootton made the decision to move to the UK, reversing his parents\u2019 migration a few decades earlier. Despite promising gigs as a cub reporter at The Dominion Post, one of New Zealand\u2019s top dailies, and on the TVNZ 1 show Good Morning, the lure of European celebrity culture was too strong.As a British passport holder, he had no difficulties coming to the UK, and found there were plenty of Kiwis he could bunk with. He spent a month or so couch surfing in the west London outpost of Acton, before moving into a flan in Gunnersbury. Like many young Antipodean travellers to the UK, these early days were spent largely in pursuit of a job, a foothold in the industry that he aspired to be part of.Wootton told GB News viewers that he was the victim of a \u2018smear campaign\u2019  (GB News)After a brief flirtation with becoming a financial journalist (\u201cI was dealing with hedge fund managers who would have had fortunes of \u00a3100,000,000 or something,\u201d he later told a website for New Zealand expats, \u201cand here I was earning absolutely no money, and talking to them about something I knew nothing about\u201d) Wootton found himself gravitating towards entertainment journalism. And London of that era was a far cry from a childhood spent watching Grease, his favourite movie, and listening to ABBA, his favourite band, stuck on the other side of the world.The entertainment world he encountered in Britain during those years was one dominated by manufactured and mainstream popular culture. McFly would prove the most successful music act of 2004, while sequels to the Shrek, Harry Potter and Spider-Man film franchises battled for box office supremacy. Wootton was in his element: by 2007 he had bagged a plum job as TV Reporter at the News of the World, and, when the paper was shuttered in scandal a few years later, he crossed the streams and joined ITV\u2019s Lorraine as an on-air entertainment reporter. Mixing an ear for gossip with a contacts list that covered the great and good of the new millennium\u2019s social scene, Wootton was swiftly identified as a rising star of tattling reportage.A decade on Lorraine, a daytime talk show hosted by Scottish journalist Lorraine Kelly (playing, for tax purposes, the role of \u201cLorraine Kelly\u201d), beamed Wootton into the public consciousness. During this period he also took on a column at The Sun, continuing his association with Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News UK and giving him a soapbox for an increasingly gossipy, and conservative, worldview. In the same year that he joined The Sun, Wootton publicly came out as gay. \u201cI am gay and I believe in equality in every way,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cIf the media hides gay relationships then how will they ever be normalised?\u201dAlthough generally private about his personal life, Wootton celebrated his partner Alan Longair at his 40th birthday event in March, describing him as \u201cthe love of my life\u201d.RecommendedDan Wootton: Ex Sun showbiz editor says he is victim of \u2018witch hunt\u2019 over claims he offered cash for sexual imagesWatch: Dan Wootton addresses \u2018smear campaign\u2019 allegationsThis Morning editor on toxic culture claims: There are some scores being settledThough he had long been open about his sexuality privately, this announcement came at a time when The Sun was under the cosh for outing a closeted celebrity. Wootton\u2019s response typified his prickly relationship with the LGBT community. In 2015 he published a column in The Sun titled \u201cHOLLYWOOD HIV PANIC\u201d, as rumours swirled that a major star (later confirmed to be Charlie Sheen), was HIV positive. The article was widely condemned as scaremongering and regressive, with a spokesman from the Terrence Higgins Trust stating that \u201cat its best this is irresponsible journalism, at its worst an insidious headline grab.\u201dWootton began as a TV reporter at the News of the World before moving to ITV and The Sun  (Getty Images)But Wootton was consistently undeterred by controversy. In recent years, he is perhaps best known for his crusade against Meghan Markle, and her house husband, Prince Harry. Across many platforms \u2013 including his current gigs at GB News and the Daily Mail \u2013 and several years, Wootton pursued the Sussexes, tapping into a prevailing public mood. He referred to Markle as a \u201cgutless woman\u201d in a crusade that saw the couple disengage from The Sun and other tabloid newspapers. This didn\u2019t stop Wootton from breaking the news of \u201cMegxit\u201d, the Sussexes\u2019 departure from the UK and resignation from royal duties, his biggest scoop to date. Prince Harry was reported to blame his father, the King, for utilising Wootton as a prop in the court psychodrama. \u201cThis all feeds into this narrative of Harry and Meghan\u201d he later told American talk show host Megyn Kelly, \u201cas these uber paranoid people who love to drag each other down with conspiracy theories.\u201dIn his best-selling autobiography, Spare, Prince Harry referred to Wootton as \u201ca sad little man\u201d. There was little sign, however, that Wootton cared about the opprobrium from the palace-in-exile. Picking up a presenting slot on News UK\u2019s TalkRadio in 2018 \u2013 another arrow in his ever-expanding professional quiver \u2013 he became a leading voice advocating for the controversial \u201cherd immunity\u201d policy at the outbreak of Covid-19 in 2020. This led Labour MP Chris Bryant to label the presenter \u201ca complete and utter nutcase\u201d during a slot on Wootton\u2019s drivetime show in which the politician cut his appearance short. As ever with Wootton\u2019s bear baiting tactics, it made for box office radio.This courting of the fine line between talking point and provocation has typified Wootton\u2019s columns and ensured he\u2019s never been far from the headlines, even when he\u2019s not reporting them. Most important was the 2020 defamation lawsuit launched against Wootton\u2019s employers, News Group Newspapers, by the actor Johnny Depp. Depp alleged that Wootton\u2019s column in The Sun, which referred to the actor as a \u201cwife beater\u201d, was libellous. Following a three-week trial at the High Court in London, judge Andrew Nicol found in favour of the defendant. \u201cI accept,\u201d Nicol wrote, at the conclusion of a 129-page judgment, \u201cthat the Defendants have shown that the words they published were substantially true in the meanings I have held them to bear.\u201d Despite this setback, Depp took his ex-wife Amber Heard to, televised, court in the United States, and successfully sued her for defamation.Johnny Depp sued The Sun after Wootton\u2019s colum referred to him as a \u2018wife beater\u2019 following the breakdown of his marriage to Amber Heard (PA Wire)Then in 2022, a different judge placed a restraining order on Andrew Brady, a former contestant on The Apprentice and boyfriend of the late presenter Caroline Flack, after he launched a campaign of harassment against Wootton. Brady blamed Wootton, who was a friend of Flack but had covered many challenging stories involving her, after she died by suicide in 2020. The presiding judge condemned Brady\u2019s \u201ccraving for celebrity status\u201d, but the case proved another example of the tangled way that Wootton dealt with the world he notionally covered.The Gospel of Matthew\u2019s most famous proverb \u2013 \u201clive by the sword, die by the sword\u201d \u2013 could\u2019ve been written for Wootton. Over the past decade, as celebrity culture has done battle with the gossip trade (whether that\u2019s Peter Thiel destroying Gawker, or the endless procession of phone hacking lawsuits) Wootton has accumulated a reputation \u2013 and a suite of enemies. \u201cAs a journalist, I feel uncomfortable being the story,\u201d he told viewers of his GB News show \u2013 Dan Wootton Tonight \u2013 as he took to the air following this week\u2019s revelations. \u201cI have been the target of a smear campaign by nefarious players with an axe to grind.\u201dAs Wootton fights for his professional life and reframes the story as an assault on the right-wing channel that employs him, the Wootton\u2019s words he said recently about Prince Harry and Meghan Markle float, inexorably, to mind. \u201cThey were lazy, they were entitled, they only cared about themselves,\u201d he told Sky Australia, after the royal couple were dropped from a Spotify deal last month. \u201cWho do they blame for this?\u201dNow at the centre of his own storm, the controversial presenter \u2013 brutally branded a \u201cshock jock\u201d by former GB News colleague Andrew Neil \u2013 has to, finally, be his own man."}, {"_id": "64cceae451ac3352961fa8b7", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/who-is-dan-wootton-gb-news-partner-b2387704.html", "primaryCategory": "Home News", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Who is Dan Wootton?

of people are saying \u2018this was brilliant, you made your point, it was peaceful, it didn\u2019t disrupt normal people\u2019s everyday lives, you took it to the home of the decision maker\u2019.\u201cSo there\u2019s both kinds of opinions, also, it\u2019s important to remember that this is just one tactic that organisation like Greenpeace use, I often describe Greenpeace as a Swiss army knife.\u201dShe added: \u201cI think the point that we want to make is Rishi Sunak needs to be held accountable for this decision and we need to hold politicians accountable when they make terrible decisions like these.\u201dAndy Gregory4 August 2023 13:051691148522Exclusive: Chris Packham accuses Sunak of playing \u2018political football\u2019 with green policiesChris Packham has

arrangements after climate protesters scale his homeQuestions have been raised about the prime minister's security arrangements after Greenpeace activists scaled his home in protest at new fossil fuels drilling, our policy correspondent Jon Stone reports.Health minister Maria Caulfield said on Friday that it would not be \u201cresponsible\u201d for her to comment on Rishi Sunak\u2019s security arrangements, as police said there was \u201cno threat to the wider public\u201d from the demonstration.But former home secretary Priti Patel urged her successor Suella Braverman to launch an immediate review into the PM\u2019s security arrangements.\u201cThis raises some very serious questions around how the home of a sitting prime minister has been accessed in this way, to the extent that political campaigners and activists have been able to trespass on his property and physically gain access,\u201d she told the Daily Mail newspaper.And former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith said he believed security \u201cdoesn\u2019t seem to know how to protect the house of the Prime Minister\u201d, adding: \u201cThere has to be an inquiry into what the hell was going on.\u201dCalls to

11:371691144133Protest was \u2018carefully and meticulously\u2019 planned, says GreenpeaceGreenpeace has said it planned its protest \u201ccarefully and meticulously\u201d and would not have done it if Rishi Sunak was there.Areeba Hamid, co-executive director of Greenpeace, told Sky News the protest was \u201cproportionate response to a disastrous decision\u201d by the PM to grant more than 100 new licences for oil and gas extraction in the North Sea.\u201cIt was an empty home, the fact that he wasn\u2019t there was actually national news, everybody knows that he wasn\u2019t there,\u201d said Ms Hamid.\u201cWe made sure, in fact we wouldn\u2019t have done it if he was there because our intention was to draw attention to the fact that what he\u2019s doing on climate is actually a big disaster, rather than to talk about his family or where he lives, so that was the entire point.\u201cSecurity is a big part of whatever we do, we planned it carefully and meticulously, we knew he wasn\u2019t going to be there.\u201cWe knocked on the door to make sure that there was nobody there, initially there was no response, then we got a response, we told them who we were. So this was quite a peaceful, calm thing to make a very important point.\u201dAndy Gregory4 August 2023 11:151691142153Tory minister appears to concede Labour will win next electionA Conservative government minister has appeared to concede that Labour will win the next election during an appearance on TV news.Maria Caulfield was accused of a \u201cpoor choice of words\u201d after seemingly painting a Labour victory at the next election as an inevitability.Speaking on Sky News the health minister said people would be afraid of what Labour would do \u201cwhen they get into government\u201d.Our policy correspondent Jon Stone has more: Tory minister appears to concede Labour will win next electionMaria Caulfield accused of poor choice of words after comments about \u2018when\u2019 Labour win next election Andy Gregory4 August 2023 10:421691140473Sadiq Khan\u2019s Ulez support has \u2018not touched the sides\u2019, claims ministerSadiq Khan\u2019s announcement of financial support to ease the impact of the ultra-low emission zone (Ulez) has \u201cnot touched the sides\u201d, a health minister has said.Maria Caulfield told Sky News: \u201cI don\u2019t think it touched the sides of people\u2019s concerns.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeAfghan refugees in the UK are presenting as homeless to councils after being turfed out of government hotels in \u201cshameful\u201d evictions.The families, many of whom worked with or for the British government and armed forces in Afghanistan, came to the UK following the Taliban takeover in 2021. All 8,000 Afghans living in bridging hotels were served with eviction notices by the end of May and were given three months by the government to find their own accommodation. Now, the Local Government Association (LGA), which represents councils, has warned it was hearing reports that up to 20 per cent of those evicted have declared themselves homeless to local authorities. The hotels are being emptied in a staggered way, with those in the smaller hotels being moved out first.

He said it was reasonable to move people out of hotels, but not at the pace that the government was doing it. He said: \u201cThese are not economic migrants. These are Afghans who placed themselves in mortal peril to serve alongside British forces in Afghanistan and they did so at our request. \u201cThese are people to whom we\u2019ve given an invitation to come to our country. Nobody should be homeless and these people need to be given the time and space ... to ensure that they are properly relocated.\u201dSpeaking to Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, he added: \u201cThere is a real risk here that we are seeing what is both morally flawed and poor public policy because homeless families are being created. We owe them a debt of gratitude, so I think what we need to do is move at a pace that sees these Afghan families transition in a way that allows local authorities the time to identify suitable accommodation.\u201cThe notion that people are being forced to become homeless is just shameful.\u201dCllr Shaun Davies, chair of the LGA, said: \u201cHotels have already begun to close to Afghan households across the country and - as we feared - councils are already seeing families presenting to them as homeless as a result.\u201cIt is wrong that some families are having to leave Home Office-funded hotels only to then end up having to move into temporary accommodation.\u201dCllr Davies warned that the situation \u201cis likely to worsen significantly as the Home Office stops paying for the remaining bridging hotels for Afghan families in the coming days and weeks.\u201dIn Northampton, a council spokesperson said that around 50 people have nowhere to go when they are evicted. There are 179 Afghans in hotels in the area who have received notice to quit by the end of August. A spokesperson for West Northamptonshire Council told local media: \u201cWe are currently looking at around 50 individuals who do not have a viable option at the end of the rehousing process and who the council will need to assess a homelessness duty for. \u201cMany of these are single men so we are also exploring an additional, bespoke option based on the model of the Homes for Ukraine sponsorship scheme.\u201dThe Independent has been campaigning for the government to honour our debt to Afghans who supported the British military and grant them asylum in the UK.

Investigators say the seven alleged victims were recruited with false declarations of love, but then forced to take part in pornography, and were controlled by \u201cintimidation, constant surveillance\u201d and claims they were in debt.

There are currently 114 operating, which have carried out 4.6 million tests, checks and scans since July 2021.\n\nThese actions will bolster capacity across the country and give patients more choice over where and when they are treatedHealth minister Will QuinceA number of other measures to use capacity in the private sector have been outlined by the Elective Recovery Taskforce, which was set up in December.These include using data from private health providers to identify where they could take on more NHS patients to help clear backlogs. They will also look at using the private sector to train junior NHS staff.Health minister and Elective Recovery Taskforce chairman Will Quince added: \u201cWe have already made significant progress in bringing down waiting lists, with 18-month waits virtually eliminated.\u201cI chaired the Elective Recovery Taskforce to turbocharge these efforts and help patients get the treatment they need.\u201cThese actions will bolster capacity across the country and give patients more choice over where and when they are treated.\u201d\n\nNo-one should be waiting in pain while hospital beds that could be used lie emptyShadow health secretary Wes StreetingLabour said the Government is not making enough use of private capacity, claiming 331,000 patients waiting for NHS care could have been treated since January 2022.Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting,\u00a0said: \u201cThe Conservatives are failing to make use of private sector capacity and patients are paying the price.\u201cNo-one should be waiting in pain while hospital beds that could be used lie empty.

Three men and two women were arrested after they scaled the roof of the PM's country mansion, draping it in oil-black fabric and a banner that says \"no new oil\".Asked whether the stunt raised concerns about the PM's security, health minister Maria Caulfield on Friday said: \"I'm not going to comment on the security arrangements of the Prime Minister, I don't think that would be a responsible thing to do,\" she told Sky News.\"But it does raise concerns for everyone, most people have seen some disruption from protesters.\"RecommendedBudget 2022: Hunt says UK in recession as he announces huge tax risesJeremy Hunt increases energy windfall tax in budgetJeremy Hunt freezes tax allowances and hits 45p rate payersElliot Foskett, assistant chief constable of North Yorkshire Police, said in a statement: \u201cShortly after 8 am this morning we responded swiftly to reports of protest activity at the prime minister's North Yorkshire address.\"There was no threat to the wider public throughout this incident which has now been brought to a safe conclusion. The prime minister and his family were not at the address at the time of the incident.\u201dBut former home secretary Priti Patel urged her successor Suella Braverman to launch an immediate review into the PM\u2019s security arrangements.\u201cThis raises some very serious questions around how the home of a sitting prime minister has been accessed in this way, to the extent that political campaigners and activists have been able to trespass on his property and physically gain access,\u201d she told the Daily Mail newspaper.And former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith said he believed security \u201cdoesn\u2019t seem to know how to protect the house of the Prime Minister\u201d, adding: \u201cThere has to be an inquiry into what the hell was going on.\u201dResponding to the protest, a Downing Street spokesperson said: \"We make no apology for taking the right approach to ensure our energy security, using the resources we have here at home so we are never reliant on aggressors like [Vladimir] Putin for our energy.\"Greenpeace said it had planned its protest \"carefully and meticulously\" and would not have done it if Rishi Sunak was at home.Areeba Hamid, co-executive director of the organisation, said the protest was \"proportionate response to a disastrous decision\" by the Prime Minister to grant more than 100 new licences for oil and gas extraction in the North Sea.\"It was an empty home, the fact that he wasn't there was actually national news, everybody knows that he wasn't there,\" she said. \n\nUK news in picturesShow all 501/50UK news in pictures\n\nUK

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe government must urgently address rising homelessness within Britain\u2019s Roma communities, experts have warned.It follows a new report which found that these groups face a heightened risk of living in overcrowded and severely substandard housing, which often impacts mental and physical health.Exploring the phenomenon of Roma homelessness in the UK, published by the Institute for Social Policy, Housing, Equalities Research (I-SPHERE) at Heriot-Watt University, interviewed people in the community in the past year in Luton and Glasgow, areas that have high populations of Roma people.A number of recommendations for solutions are proposed including the need for better conversations and understanding between the Roma community and public services that could assist them to navigate their housing and other challenges.Recommended\u2018I have nothing\u2019: Roma people left without support and at risk of exploitation due to digital-only statusBefore you make another offhand remark about Roma and Travellers in the UK, we'd like to tell you this5 Big Fat Myths about Gypsies, Travellers and RomaThe truth about Romania's gypsies: Not coming over here, not stealing our jobsMatt Downie, chief executive of the homeless charity Crisis, said: \u201cThis report makes for harrowing reading, but unfortunately its findings are not surprising. Every day we see in our services that minoritised ethnic communities are experiencing higher rates of homelessness.\u201cIt\u2019s horrifying that so many Roma people are having to endure appalling and overcrowded living conditions when trying to access a safe and secure home. National and local government must sit up and take notice of this report.\u201cWe need long-term, culturally sensitive solutions to end homelessness for good and the recommendations set out today should be implemented now to ensure everyone has access to suitable, safe and appropriate accommodation, regardless of their background, nationality or personal circumstances.\u201dThere are at least 200,000 migrant Roma people living in the UK and the lack of support that many experience is well-documented. From grappling with harsh immigration policies and difficulty securing work to overt discrimination and poorer health outcomes.Healthcare inequalities are frequently experienced by Gypsy, Roma and Traveller (GRT) communities. Previously, The Independent revealed that UK GP practices were potentially breaching equalities law by refusing to register patients from these groups during the Covid-19 pandemic.Many living in overcrowding conditions led to significant levels of stress and anxiety, it was found. This was seen as particularly problematic for younger household members who rarely had their own room or private space.This was considered to impair the educational and personal development of children and teenagers;\u00a0 GRT pupils have the lowest attainment in compulsory schooling of all ethnic groups.In order to avoid living in severely overcrowded accommodation, people spoken to by the researchers said they had moved out of accommodation shared with family and rented their own house, the report found, however, these properties were often of an extremely poor standard.There were also cases of households facing health and physical injury due to high levels of overcrowding and poor housing conditions, the report highlighted. Some of these properties lacked basic utilities, such as electricity and water, while mould, rats or bed bugs were found.As well as being dangerous to physical health, such conditions seriously impact mental health, compromising the well-being of the family, social networks and inducing feelings of shame and frustration, it was concluded.Crina Morteanu, Luton Roma Trust, said: \"This report sends a strong message that Roma homelessness exists and interventions at different levels are required in order to eradicate it. It captures a very accurate image of the situation of many Roma in the UK and especially in Luton.\u201cAs a Roma charity in Luton, working for the betterment of the Roma community, this report is very helpful and will help tremendously with raising awareness about homelessness and with advocating on behalf of the Roma.\"The report\u2019s findings challenge the stereotypical image of Roma people living as large extended households by choice, finding instead they are constrained by circumstances.Lead author Dr Ionut Cioarta, from Heriot-Watt University, who is Roma, said the issue of homelessness among Roma people is \u201chighly complex yet woefully under-researched\u201d. This leaves policymakers and service providers with extremely limited information to inform their current and future interventions.A government spokesperson said: \u201cNo-one in our society should have to suffer the injustice of living in overcrowded or substandard housing, and councils have a responsibility to ensure families or vulnerable people are not left without a roof over their head.Recommended\u2018Shameful\u2019: Afghan refugees in UK becoming homeless after government hotel evictionsDan Wootton: GB News host suspended by MailOnline amid investigation - latestHolidaymakers parking at airports warned over \u2018serious financial sting\u2019\u201cWe are investing over \u00a31billion into the Homelessness Prevention Grant over three years to\u00a0help tackle homelessness before it occurs.

All 8,000 Afghans living in bridging hotels were served with eviction notices by the end of May and were given three months by the government to find their own accommodation. Now, the Local Government Association (LGA), which represents councils, has warned it was hearing reports that up to 20 per cent of those evicted have declared themselves homeless to local authorities.

He said it was reasonable to move people out of hotels, but not at the pace that the government was doing it. He said: \u201cThese are not economic migrants. These are Afghans who placed themselves in mortal peril to serve alongside British forces in Afghanistan and they did so at our request. \u201cThese are people to whom we\u2019ve given an invitation to come to our country. Nobody should be homeless and these people need to be given the time and space ... to ensure that they are properly relocated.\u201dSpeaking to Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, he added: \u201cThere is a real risk here that we are seeing what is both morally flawed and poor public policy because homeless families are being created. We owe them a debt of gratitude, so I think what we need to do is move at a pace that sees these Afghan families transition in a way that allows local authorities the time to identify suitable accommodation.\u201cThe notion that people are being forced to become homeless is just shameful.\u201dCllr Shaun Davies, chair of the LGA, said: \u201cHotels have already begun to close to Afghan households across the country and - as we feared - councils are already seeing families presenting to them as homeless as a result.\u201cIt is wrong that some families are having to leave Home Office-funded hotels only to then end up having to move into temporary accommodation.\u201dCllr Davies warned that the situation \u201cis likely to worsen significantly as the Home Office stops paying for the remaining bridging hotels for Afghan families in the coming days and weeks.\u201dIn Northampton, a council spokesperson said that around 50 people have nowhere to go when they are evicted. There are 179 Afghans in hotels in the area who have received notice to quit by the end of August. A spokesperson for West Northamptonshire Council told local media: \u201cWe are currently looking at around 50 individuals who do not have a viable option at the end of the rehousing process and who the council will need to assess a homelessness duty for. \u201cMany of these are single men so we are also exploring an additional, bespoke option based on the model of the Homes for Ukraine sponsorship scheme.\u201dThe Independent has been campaigning for the government to honour our debt to Afghans who supported the British military and grant them asylum in the UK.

There\u2019s a lot of pain to swallow there.\u201dThe Bank of England is seeking to tame stubborn inflation  (PA)Calling Thursday\u2019s increase \u201canother difficult blow for prospective and current homeowners\u201d, Cooper Associates Mortgages warned that some homeowners who tied into low two-year fixed rate deals in 2021 are now facing four-fold interest rate increases.Unions and think-tanks of various political persuasions were among those warning that the Bank had made the \u201cwrong decision\u201d in raising rates once more and was \u201ccausing excessive harm\u201d by \u201ctightening the screws too much\u201d.RecommendedMapped: Areas in UK facing sharpest drop in house pricesUK economy set to \u2018flatline at best\u2019 after sluggish service sector growthDescribing the new hike as \u201cparticularly excruciating\u201d for mortgage-holders, the ICAEW accused the Bank of being \u201ctoo fixated on backward looking data when setting interest rates, which risks wider economic damage given the large time lag between rate rises and their full impact on households and businesses\u201d.And the centre-left IPPR think-tank said interest rates could already be \u201cmore than a percentage point too high\u201d\u201cThe UK economy is weakening,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cThe labour market is slowing down, and productivity is falling.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe Bank of England has once again met to discuss what it needs to do to keep inflation under control.It has been hiking interest rates since December 2021 as inflation ran rampant.But what do higher interest rates mean, will they continue to go up, and what does the Bank expect to happen to the economy? We try to answer some of those questions here.What happened to interest rates today?The Bank of England\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee decided that it would increase the base interest rate from 5% to 5.25%.This is the 14th straight rise in the Bank\u2019s base rate, and brings the rate to the highest since April 2008.RecommendedWhen will interest rates fall? Experts warn of \u2018more pain to swallow\u2019 after latest hikeBank of England hikes interest rates for 14th consecutive time despite inflation slowdownInflation win for Rishi Sunak, but a tough 2024 ahead for the rest of usWhat will higher interest rates mean?For borrowers it is bad. If you have a variable rate mortgage it means that the interest that you pay every month will increase pretty soon.If you have a fixed-rate mortgage, or are planning to take out a new mortgage, it means you will probably pay more in interest when you remortgage or borrow the money to buy your home.But you are not immune if you do not own your house. These higher interest rates also often find their way to renters as well.There is a benefit for savers though. The base rate going up will increase the amount that your bank will pay you in interest on the money you have in your bank account.Will rates continue to go up, will they stay the same, or could they come down?Forecasting the future is impossible, but markets still bet on it to make money if their bets are right.The Bank said that markets expect its base interest rate to keep rising to 5.8% in the last quarter of this year, 5.9% in the last quarter of next year, before falling, although not much, to 5% in the last quarter of 2025.The Bank itself does not say what it will do to interest rates in future, but it did imply on Thursday that they might have to stay higher for longer.What\u2019s the Government\u2019s inflation target, and is it on track?The Government said at the end of last year that it planned to halve inflation from 10.7% at the time to 5.3% by the end of this year.The Bank\u2019s economic projections, which could easily be wrong, are now that the Government will meet this objective quite comfortably. It expects Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation to fall to 4.9% in the final quarter of the year.Most of this will be because of falling international energy prices, which have very little to do with anything the Government has done.What\u2019s the economy doing?RecommendedWhen will interest rates fall? Experts warn of \u2018more pain to swallow\u2019 after hikeShadow chancellor Rachel Reeves says interest rates \u2018hammer blow for working people\u2019What the papers say \u2013 August 4The Bank said that it does not expect the economy to go into recession this year, despite previous forecasts, although margins are slim and the margin for error around its forecasts could allow for a recession.The Bank said that this year UK gross domestic product (GDP) will rise by 0.5%, an upgrade from the 0.25% it had forecast in May. However, it downgraded its 2024 growth forecast from 0.75% to 0.5% and its 2025 forecast from 0.75% to 0.25%."}, {"_id": "64cceaf351ac3352961fa8db", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/prime-minister-akshata-murty-oliver-dowden-disneyland-prime-b2387320.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Sunak strolls along sun-soaked California pier with family in holiday photos", "lead": "The Prime Minister, his wife and daughters were pictured at an amusement park on the Santa Monica Pier.", "author": "Sophie Wingate", "datePublished": "2023-08-04 05:37:59", "dateScraped": "2023-08-04 14:11:31.408156", "dateUpdated": "2023-08-04T05:37:59+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/08/03/20/f3434b877028d148a178840b6954cca2Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjkxMTc3MTU2-2.73225550.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up for the View from Westminster email for expert analysis straight to your inboxGet our free View from Westminster email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Not only had he breached the conditions, but we uncovered that he had also been storing child abuse images.\u201cI hope this case sends the message that we closely monitor people who are under terrorism notification and crime prevention orders, and that we will bring them back to court where we\u2019ve found they\u2019ve broken those conditions.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64cceaf651ac3352961fa8e6", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/chester-zoo-rare-jaguar-inka-b2387389.html", "primaryCategory": "Home News", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Zoo welcomes rare jaguar in effort to protect \u2018remarkable\u2019 species", "lead": "<p>Chester Zoo has welcomed a two-year-old rare jaguar named Inka</p>", "author": "Aisling Grace", "datePublished": "2023-08-04 04:28:03", "dateScraped": "2023-08-04 14:11:34.054720", "dateUpdated": "2023-08-04T04:28:03+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/08/04/00/03194710-20821404-c556-4c4e-af44-0dd48c6f0070.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Get the free Morning Headlines email for news from our reporters across the worldSign up to our free Morning Headlines email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

eased the burden on the state, but ultimately thought better of it, extending the guarantee into April, May and June.Now that the EPG has finally expired, consumers will once more be paying the EPC

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeSadiq Khan has announced he is extending financial support for people hit by the expansion of the Ultra low emission zone (Ulez) \u2013 after Labour's leader urged him to re-think it.The mayor of London said he remained \"committed to seeing through\" his decision to expand the clean air scheme to the whole of the capital but that he had \"listened to concerns\".The scheme raced to the top of the political agenda last month after Keir Starmer and his allies blamed it for Labour's shock loss at the Uxbridge by-election in outer west London.Under the Ulez charge anyone with a vehicle deemed to be more polluting \u2013 around 10 per cent of those on the roads \u2013 has to pay a \u00a312.50 daily charge to drive it.The mayor had already announced a \u00a3110m scrappage scheme to help people replace cars and vans that did not meet the emissions standards, but has said he will now expand it to all Londoners. RecommendedSunak commits to new oil and gas licences alongside carbon capture investmentCaught out (again): MP claims parking fine on expensesSadiq Khan to stand by Ulez amid Starmer pressureAn additional \u00a350 million from City Hall's cash reserves will be pumped into the scrappage scheme, bringing its total funding to \u00a3160m. It means any Londoner with a non-compliant car will be able to get \u00a32,000 towards replacing it. City Hall says it has found 5,000 Ulez compliant cars for sale for under \u00a32,000 within 200 miles of central London on one major vehicle trading site alone.Additional changes to the scrappage scheme will also see the grant per van raised from \u00a35,000 to \u00a37,000, with small businesses able to get up to \u00a321,000 to replace their fleet with greener vehicles.Payments for wheelchair accessible vehicles will also be doubled from \u00a35,000 to \u00a310,000 after feedback from disabled people.In the aftermath of the Uxbridge by-election Sir Keir told Mr Khan to \"reflect\" on the clean air policy, which he said had cost votes. He also criticised the government for not providing funding for a scrappage scheme.The financial support was previously open to Londoners on low and middle incomes, with qualification open to those claiming a range of social security benefits \u2013 including some available to people on higher incomes like child benefit.Mr Khan said: \u201cI have always said that expanding the ULEZ to the whole of London was a difficult decision, and not one I took lightly \u2013 but it\u2019s a decision I remain committed to seeing through. \u201cI\u2019m not prepared to step back, delay or water down vital

I can announce a huge expansion to the scrappage scheme that means that all Londoners with non ULEZ-compliant cars will now be able to get financial support to switch to greener, less polluting vehicles. \u201cAs we continue to build a greener and healthier London for everyone, I\u2019m determined that no Londoner and no London business is left behind. We need to take people with us on the path to a sustainable future. We are ensuring that help is now available for everyone \u2013 and I urge Londoners to come and get it.\u201dAround 4,000 Londoners die prematurely every year from the effects of toxic air, according to research by Imperial College London \u2013 with fine particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) the main culprits. Huge swathes of the capital regularly breach World Health Organisation legal limits on air pollution \u2013 and there is evidence that the Ulez policy in central and inner London is already helping to clean it up.In the first 10 months of Ulez being live in central London, road transport nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions fell by 35 per cent in the zone, and CO2 emissions by 6 percent.RecommendedStarmer criticises Tories after by-election defeats: \u2018They\u2019ve given up on government\u2019Keir Starmer issues tough warning to Labour after bruising defeat in Boris\u2019s old seatTories \u2018doomed to lose power\u2019 without change of course, warns Lord FrostA study by Imperial released in February this year found that the expansion of the scheme to the north and south circular in 2021 had also had an effect, and that progress had continued in the centre. It found that NO2 levels were 46 per cent lower in central London and 21 per cent lower in inner London than they would have been without the scheme.All in all the study found this was achieved by having 74,000 fewer qualifying vehicles driving in the zone, a cut of 60 per cent since expansion in October 2021. The scheme will be extended to the whole of Greater London on 29 August 2023."}, {"_id": "64cceaf851ac3352961fa8ef", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/airport-parking-charge-uk-financial-b2387223.html", "primaryCategory": "Home News", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Holidaymakers parking at airports warned over \u2018serious financial sting\u2019", "lead": "<p>Customers are being charged up to four times more for airport parking when paying on arrival versus booking online in advance</p>", "author": "Eleanor Noyce", "datePublished": "2023-08-04 03:52:53", "dateScraped": "2023-08-04 14:11:36.250300", "dateUpdated": "2023-08-04T03:52:53+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/08/03/17/SEI166415412.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Simon Calder\u2019s free travel email for expert advice and money-saving discountsGet Simon Calder\u2019s Travel email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Here, payment on arrival racked up to \u00a3406, compared with \u00a395 when booked beforehand.Elsewhere, Heathrow charged \u00a3583 compared with \u00a3190 in advance, Birmingham \u00a3392 versus \u00a3150 and Gatwick \u00a3180 versus \u00a3106.Last month, research from RAC further uncovered that drop-off fees for drivers have skyrocketed at over one third of the UK\u2019s major airports over the last year.RecommendedStansted airport passenger numbers soar despite signs of weakness elsewhereHow much time do you need for an international layover?Airport survival guide for August: Be kind to your fellow travellers and staffFlight forced to divert after three men caught vaping and drinking their own alcoholGreggs targets more shops in supermarkets and airportsSouthampton and Belfast International airports represented the most dramatic increase in charges, hiking from \u00a34 to \u00a36 and from \u00a31 to \u00a33 respectively.Rory Boland, editor of magazine Which?

It\u2019s in a protected environment and the children have to answer the question.\u201cAnd a lot of exam boards and Ofqual are doing a lot of research into using computer-based testing, online testing.

teacher assessments instead of exams.England\u2019s exams regulator Ofqual has said this year\u2019s national results will be lower than last year, but they are expected to be similar to those before

February this year.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow live\n\n\u201cEvery year that elapses is a year away from the disruption caused by the pandemic and there are more years that those young people have had in school full timeSchools minister Nick GibbIn an interview with the PA news agency ahead of students receiving their results, Mr Gibb said: \u201cIt is important to get back to normal because we want these qualifications to continue to carry the weight and credibility both with employers and with universities and colleges that they need to have.\u201dHe said: \u201cEvery year that elapses is a year away from the disruption caused by the pandemic and there are more years that those young people have had in school full time.\u201dBut Mr Gibb added that there will be an \u201cadditional protection\u201d this year where grade boundaries will be altered if senior examiners find evidence nationally of a drop in standards compared with 2019.He told PA: \u201cA typical student in 2019 \u2013 given the same level of ability, the same level of diligence \u2013 the likelihood is that same student would get the same grades in 2023 as they would have done in 2019.\u201dThis summer, GCSE students in England who took mathematics, physics and combined science were given formulae and equation sheets in exams to mitigate the potential loss of learning during Covid-19.When asked whether the exam aids will no longer be offered to students in England next year, Mr Gibb told PA \u201cthat will be the expectation\u201d but the final decision will be taken \u201cin due course\u201d.He added that the exam aids were intended as \u201ca temporary expedient\u201d for this year.\u201cThe grading is back to 2019 levels and we expect the system to be back fully in the following year,\u201d the minister said.\n\nThis return to normal is an important milestoneDr Jo Saxton, the chief regulator of OfqualThousands of students who had taken vocational technical qualifications (VTQ) were left in limbo last summer after nearly 21,000 grades from awarding bodies Pearson and OCR were delayed or had errors.Asked whether he could rule out delays to VTQ results this year, Mr Gibb said: \u201cYou can\u2019t predict anything about exam results \u2013 whether it\u2019s the academic side or the vocational side \u2013 but certainly we have done everything, the regulator has done everything they can to make sure that there aren\u2019t those delays because they were unacceptable last year and we don\u2019t want to see it happening again this year.\u201dDr Jo Saxton, the chief regulator of Ofqual, which launched an action plan last year to help make sure students receive their VTQ results on time this August, said: \u201cI expect the number of late results will be significantly lower than last year because of the actions we\u2019ve taken.\u201dShe added: \u201cWith 16 million GCSE, AS and A-level scripts now in the final stages of marking, nationally we are expecting results to be similar to before the pandemic.\u201cGrade protections have been built in to reflect that performance is likely to be a little weaker because of the disruption that students experienced.\u201cThis return to normal is an important milestone, and while overall results will be lower than last year, students can have confidence that their grades will reflect what they know and understand and will help them make the right choice about their next step, whether that\u2019s further study or moving into the world of work.\u201d\n\nThere are many future exam cohorts that have had part of their education disrupted by the pandemic and it\u2019s important this is recognised when making decisions in future yearsGeoff Barton, ASCLSarah Hannafin, head of policy for school leaders\u2019 union the NAHT, said: \u201cEmployers, universities and colleges are more than capable of understanding changes to approaches in grading and making appropriate changes to their own processes \u2013 as we saw when exams were cancelled.\u201cA narrow focus on returning to pre-pandemic levels misses opportunities to reflect, review and improve on what we had before.\u201dThe NAHT union believes the formulae sheets for GCSE mathematics and the equation sheets for GCSE physics and combined science \u201cshould be kept in place for future exam series,\u201d she added.On possible plans to remove exam aids for students, Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said: \u201cWhile we understand the appetite to fully return to normal from next year onwards, there are many future exam cohorts that have had part of their education disrupted by the pandemic and it\u2019s important this is recognised when making decisions in future years.\u201dEngland, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland offered different levels of support to

They will also look at using the private sector to train junior NHS staff.Health minister and Elective Recovery Taskforce chair Will Quince added: \u201cWe have already made significant progress in bringing down waiting lists, with 18 month waits virtually eliminated.\u201cI chaired the Elective Recovery Taskforce to turbocharge these efforts and help patients get the treatment they need.\u201cThese actions will bolster capacity across the country and give patients more choice over where and when they are treated.\u201dHowever, Labour said the Government is currently not making enough use of private capacity.The party claims 331,000 patients waiting for NHS care could have been treated since January 2022.Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting,\u00a0said: \u201cThe Conservatives are failing to make use of private sector capacity and patients are paying the price.\u201cNo-one should be waiting in pain while hospital beds that could be used lie empty.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe Mayor of London has announced a major expansion of financial support designed to ease the impact of the capital\u2019s ultra low emission zone (Ulez) on people\u2019s pockets.Sadiq Khan said every Londoner with a polluting car facing charges under Ulez will now be able to receive a grant of up to \u00a32,000 to support an upgrade.It comes after he was asked by Sir Keir Starmer to reflect on how the extension of Ulez to all London boroughs was being carried out.The Labour leader blamed concerns around the scheme for his party\u2019s narrow by-election defeat in Boris Johnson\u2019s old Uxbridge and South Ruislip seat last month.Mr Khan said while he will not \u201cstep back, delay or water down\u201d the policy to tackle air pollution, he is widening the scrappage scheme after listening to residents\u2019 unease about Ulez amid a cost-of-living crisis.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveWhile previously only child benefit recipients, low-income and disabled people were eligible for scrappage grants, from August 21 all Londoners with non-Ulez compliant cars or motorcycles can apply.The Labour incumbent in City Hall also announced that small businesses and sole traders can get \u00a321,000 to junk up to three vans, with \u00a327,000 available for charities to replace three minibuses.More support kicking in on Friday includes higher payments for switching to an electric vehicle, for charities with old vans, and for retrofitting an existing vehicle. Grants for replacing wheelchair accessible vehicles will double to \u00a310,000.It comes ahead of the Ulez expansion to beyond the capital\u2019s north and south circular roads on August 29.Drivers of vehicles which do not meet minimum emissions standards are charged a \u00a312.50 daily fee for entering the zone.Mr Khan said: \u201cI have always said that expanding the Ulez to the whole of London was a difficult decision, and not one I took lightly \u2013 but it\u2019s a decision I remain committed to seeing through.\u201cI\u2019m not prepared to step back, delay or water down vital green policies like Ulez, which will not only save lives and protect children\u2019s lungs by cleaning up our polluted air but help us to fight the climate crisis.\u201cI have continued to listen to the concerns of Londoners over recent months, and today I can announce a huge expansion to the scrappage scheme that means that all Londoners with non Ulez-compliant cars will now be able to get financial support to switch to greener, less polluting vehicles.\u201cAs we continue to build a greener and healthier London for everyone, I\u2019m determined that no Londoner and no London business is left behind.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeFollowing George Floyd\u2019s murder, conversations around race were thrust into the global mainstream sphere in a completely unprecedented way. At the time, these talks did not fall off the news agenda within hours, as has typically been the case. Instead, the world witnessed a seismic, if largely temporary, shift in consciousness. Two years on though and many have argued that not enough has changed for all the corporate taking-of-the-knee and pledges of solidarity with Black people that we saw in 2020.The more traditional and established areas of journalism such as politics, health and sport boost important developments and narratives around people, policies and personalities; the intersectionality of race and identity folds into that. Yet it\u2019s invariably overlooked, as the perspectives of racialised communities are sidelined within a society that views everything through the lens of whiteness. And yet: we exist. From the recent upsurge in Black Lives Matter demonstrations which sparked the largest racial justice movement in UK history to the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 pandemic on ethnic minority groups, these stories count.From the plight and achievements of Gypsy, Traveller and Roma communities to the launch of South Asian Heritage Month, these goings-on are newsworthy.RecommendedMaking a Windrush documentary showed me how the TV industry fails Black viewersBarrel Children: The families Windrush left behind The Windrush statue is offensive \u2013 no wonder people are boycotting itSo, why not have a dedicated newsletter to highlight such matters?The Race Report seemed like an appropriate title given the Sewell Report, released last year, which reduced the valid, uncomfortable lived experiences of Black, Asian and minority ethnic communities to mere illusions.

says its plans would help provide an income stream for conservation works to Syon House, which is privately-owned but still open to the public.Key worker housing for the neighbouring West Middlesex University Hospital has also been promised and there would still be a place for those who use the allotments, the inquiry heard.Isleworth councillor Salman Shaheen, who stressed the value of the Park Road allotments, stated that \u201cits stakes for our community, for my constituents and for our environment can not be understated\u201d.He described it as \u201can ill-conceived plan designed not to support a treasured historic asset, but to destroy one for private gain.\u201dHe said: \u201cHounslow has comfortably met its housing targets by allowing development on the ample brownfield sites in the area \u2013 that we have been able to do so without paving over our green space makes me ask what the imperative would be to change that now except to line the duke\u2019s already deep pockets?\u201dHe added that \u201ca man richer than the King has shown no evidence to prove that the only way to fund the repairs to one historic asset is by destroying another historic asset\u201d.A round of applause broke out and some people rose to their feet as\u00a0he finished his statement of objections.The inquiry heard that the Isleworth site has been used as allotments since 1917 when the duke\u2019s ancestor leased the land to the council to help in the aftermath of the First World War.Claire Nevin, for the Park Road Allotment Association, said that Northumberland Estates was

times\u201d.Ms Nevin added: \u201cAccess to this green open space was crucial during the Covid-19 pandemic and the importance to allotment holders and their families of cultivating their own fruit and vegetables during a cost-of-living crisis is obvious.\u201cImportantly the benefits provided by this site extends beyond the allotment holders to the wider community which benefits from nature walks, open days, litter picking, apple and blackberry picking and donations to food banks organised by allotment holders.\u201dEd Grant, for the council, told the inquiry that the Northumberland Estates scheme would provide \u201cthe same or nearly the same number\u201d of the 38 allotments which previously existed.Mr Grant said \u201cthat is an assertion made possible by only by providing very small allotments, suitable only for beginners, rather than an appropriate range of sizes\u201d.Ms Cadbury said she felt she needed to speak at the appeal hearing because of \u201cthe sheer weight of local public opposition, but also because I feel the planning case for the application is very weak\u201d.She said: \u201cIn my view, given the future uncertainty over the balance of supply and demand for housing sites in the borough, this application does not warrant the loss of allotment land, the loss of an active community asset and the loss of significant ecological benefits.\u201dShe added: \u201cThis small site would make relatively little contribution to the overall housing supply.\u201cThere are other larger sites with outstanding permissions that have not yet been built out.\u201cFurthermore, there will almost certainly be new sites coming available in due course as result in the change in demand for commercial premises with the change in post-Covid work

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe Welsh Government has hit back at comments made by the UK\u2019s technology minister about the country\u2019s chip manufacturing sector after he claimed he did not want to \u201crecreate Taiwan in south Wales\u201d.Paul Scully, who leads the government\u2019s digital economy strategy, told the Financial Times that the UK\u2019s semiconductor industry will not be joining the global competition to build advanced chip-building facilities.South Wales, in particular the wider Newport region, already has a cluster of companies that specialise in the design and manufacture of chips which are integral parts of mobile phones, cars, hospital devices and power stations.The Welsh economy minister Vaughan Gething said the minister\u2019s comments are potentially damaging to possible future investment in the region.Mr Gething called on the UK Government to \u201cprovide an urgent reassurance that the minister\u2019s comments do not reflect Government policy\u201d.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveIt follows the setting up of a UK Government semiconductor advisory panel to steer the future of the sector.The group, which includes representatives across business and academia, is expected to meet every two months to oversee a strategy of growing the domestic semiconductor sector, mitigating supply chain disruptions and protecting national security.One of those invited to take part is the chief executive of Wales-based IQE, Americo Lemos, whose company has a 55% global market share in compound semiconductor technology.Mr Lemos has previously said that with government support the UK could become a world leader in the production of compound semiconductors, and rival Taiwan.However, chairman of the group Mr Scully said on Thursday that the UK industry should focus on niche manufacturing and designs rather than try to challenge international rivals in chipmaking.\u201cTo leverage our position, it is about advanced packaging and design. We are not going to recreate Taiwan in south Wales, it\u2019s just not going to happen,\u201d Mr Scully told the FT.In response, Mr Gething said: \u201cI am extremely surprised by the tech minister\u2019s comments today, which are a real disservice to the talented workforce in the south Wales compound semiconductor cluster.\u201cThe Welsh Government is ambitious for the industry in south Wales, and is working collaboratively with the UK Government to develop it.\u201cWe are currently in active discussions with a number of companies about bringing vital new investment and jobs into the region.\u201cThe UK Government should now provide an urgent reassurance that the minister\u2019s comments do not reflect Government policy.\u201dA Government spokesperson said: \u201cThese suggestions are nonsense. As minister Scully made clear in his interview, the UK Government\u2019s commitment to the South West Wales cluster is unwavering \u2013 our strategy focusses narrowly on Britain\u2019s world-leading strengths that are driven by businesses such as IQE in Cardiff and the surrounding region.\u201cToday, our semiconductor advisory panel met for the first time. The group, which includes representatives from the South West Wales cluster, will drive forward in delivering our ambitious \u00a31bn strategy that doubles down on the UK\u2019s strengths in design, compound semiconductors and advanced manufacturing.\u201dThe UK Government plans to offer chip companies \u00a31 billion over the next decade in a bid to boost the domestic industry, although critics have said the country is \u201clate to the game\u201d.And the figure pales in comparison to the state investment being seen elsewhere, such as the 52 billion dollars (\u00a341 billion) of subsidies and incentives being offered by the US, and the 43 billion euro (\u00a337 billion) investment plan by the EU.RecommendedRoyal Collection Trust returns to profit thanks to visitors flocking to palacesDuke\u2019s allotment management was \u2018dereliction by design\u2019, inquiry toldEx-Met officer jailed for stag do assault would have been sacked, hearing rulesIn a submission to the Business and Trade Committee inquiry into the UK semiconductor industry, the Welsh Government said it had been working to grow the sector in Wales for the last 10 years and said there was a \u201cneed for long-term, sustained commitment to the industry to maximise return on investment, and send out the message to the global market that the UK is a suitable destination for investment\u201d.They also argued for further state support on the grounds that the UK must protect its sovereign capability in semiconductor manufacturing in the wake of vulnerabilities which have been exposed by geo-politics including the trade war between the US and China."}, {"_id": "64cceafd51ac3352961fa904", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/london-old-bailey-met-police-surbiton-b2387265.html", "primaryCategory": "Crime", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Brutal killer of 25-year-old Ramane Wiggan jailed for 34 years", "lead": "Kaine Gilead shot dead Ramane Wiggan on the balcony of a flat before fleeing on a scooter", "author": "Emily Pennink", "datePublished": "2023-08-03 17:47:11", "dateScraped": "2023-08-04 14:11:41.010560", "dateUpdated": "2023-08-03T17:47:11+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/08/03/18/79d523828ddcf9dcd82a7dd4885f480dY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjkxMTcwNTk3-2.73150884.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

I want to reiterate that apology today.\u201cI know this update will have a significant impact not only on the family but also the wider community, and want to offer my reassurance that we will look to bring these matters to a conclusion as soon as possible.\u201cIt\u2019s important we don\u2019t pre-judge the outcome of proceedings in any way, but our communities rightly expect police officers to be subject to thorough scrutiny for the actions they take.\u201cWe continually review our policies in line with national guidance around restraint as well as how we assist those in mental health crisis and are working with colleagues nationally to consider our training and guidance to officers in dealing with these kinds of fast-paced and challenging incidents.\u201dMr Clarke\u2019s mother, Wendy Strachan, said they were relieved the IOPC had finally come to a decision, but had hoped more officers would face misconduct proceedings.RecommendedRoyal Collection Trust returns to profit thanks to visitors flocking to palacesWelsh Government hits back at minister\u2019s claim over semiconductor sectorDuke\u2019s allotment management was \u2018dereliction by design\u2019, inquiry told\u201cThis process has taken nearly two years and our family is emotionally and physically exhausted with the delays and constant battle with the IOPC,\u201d she said.\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have had to go through this painful wait if the IOPC had carried out a proper investigation the first time round.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64cceafd51ac3352961fa907", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/interest-rates-rise-bank-england-inflation-b2386295.html", "primaryCategory": "Home News", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Bank of England hikes interest rates for 14th consecutive time despite inflation slowdown", "lead": "<p>Central bank raises interest rates to highest level since February 2008 </p>", "author": "Archie Mitchell", "datePublished": "2023-08-03 17:38:32", "dateScraped": "2023-08-04 14:11:41.694561", "dateUpdated": "2023-08-03T17:38:32+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/08/02/12/newFile-4.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Get the free Morning Headlines email for news from our reporters across the worldSign up to our free Morning Headlines email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeRishi Sunak is on course to meet his inflation target but the UK faces years of higher mortgage rates and a flatlining economy until 2026, the Bank of England warned on Thursday.As it pushed interest rates to a fresh 15-year high, the Bank forecast the economy will stagnate for the next three years, when GDP will increase by just 1 per cent.And governor Andrew Bailey warned households and businesses the Bank would keep interest rates sufficiently high for at least two years \u2013 or as long as it takes to keep inflation under control.It means years more misery for homeowners facing spiralling mortgage costs, which have almost tripled since December 2021.RecommendedRishi Sunak believes \u2018light at end of the tunnel\u2019 on inflationHouse prices are falling, but here\u2019s why it would be wrong to give up on bricks and mortarBorrowers have now been punished with 14 consecutive interest rate rises, with the base rate climbing from 0.25 per cent 18 months ago to 5.25 per cent today.The rise means the average tracker mortgage holder will now pay nearly \u00a324 more a month, or around \u00a3285 a year, according to figures from trade association UK Finance.For homeowners on a standard variable rate (SVR) mortgage, the average payment could increase by \u00a315.14 per month or nearly \u00a3182 per year.Despite the fresh blow for homeowners and the bleak economic outlook, Mr Bailey welcomed the \u201cgood news\u201d that inflation is finally falling.Mr Bailey said inflation \u201chits the least well off hardest\u201d and the Bank needs to \u201cmake absolutely sure\u201d it returns to its 2 per cent target.The rate of price increases in June stood at 7.9 per cent, and the Bank expects to hit its 2 per cent goal by the beginning of 2025.Chancellor Jeremy Hunt acknowledged the rise in interest rates would be a \u201cworry\u2019\u2019 for families and businesses but said the government must stick to its plan to bring down inflation.Reacting to the Bank of England\u2019s decision, he said: \u201cIf we stick to the plan, the Bank forecasts inflation will be below 3 per cent in a year\u2019s time without the economy falling into a recession.\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s easy for families facing higher mortgage bills so we will continue to do what we can to help households.\u201dIt comes as high street retailer Wilko announced it would appoint administrators, putting 12,000 jobs at risk.The boss of the homeware and hardware chain said it is expected to enter insolvency after failing to secure a takeover to help the business with \u201cmounting cash pressures\u201d.In a boost to the prime minister, the Bank said inflation would drop to around 5 per cent in October, meaning Mr Sunak will likely meet a key promise to halve inflation this year.But any joy for the PM was tempered by a warning that he faced a bleak economic outlook at the next election.The Resolution Foundation think tank said the election, expected next autumn, would come amid\u00a0\u201cfalling GDP, higher unemployment and big increases in mortgage repayments\u201d.It said the Bank\u2019s gloomy outlook was \u201cparticularly bad news for Rishi Sunak\u201d.Its research director, James Smith, said: \u201cThe Bank\u2019s decision to raise interest rates for a fourteenth meeting in a row \u2013 continuing the largest tightening cycle in more than 30 years \u2013 was expected. But this will provide little comfort for mortgage holders facing an increase of around \u00a33,000 in repayments next year.\u201dMr Smith added that while inflation was coming down quicker than expected, climbing interest rates would see an additional 350,000 people unemployed over the next three years.After the Bank\u2019s latest interest rate hike, it was accused of \u201coverdoing it\u201d and \u201ccausing too much harm\u201d to households.Senior economist Carsten Jung said: \u201cThe UK economy is weakening. The labour market is slowing down, and productivity is falling. Increasingly there is a realisation that the Bank of England is already overdoing it.\u201cBy raising interest rates to 5.25 per cent, the Bank is tightening the screws too much and causing excessive harm for households and businesses.\u201dAnd think tank the New Economics Foundation told The Independent the Bank should have \u201cheld its horses\u201d before pushing up interest rates again.\u201cWhen the Bank raises interest rates, it takes time for those effects to filter through the economy,\u201d said senior economist Lukasz Krebel.He warned that households with mortgages were \u201calready struggling\u201d after 13 interest rate increases and today\u2019s rise \u201ccould damage the economy by discouraging investment\u201d.Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor, said Mr Bailey\u2019s warning on higher interest rates means \u201cthe era of cheap money is well and truly behind us\u201d.The Bank of England\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee has raised rates again (REUTERS)\u201cMortgage holders will have to get used to paying more each month,\u201d she told The Independent.Mr Bailey\u2019s optimistic tone on inflation and the 0.25 percentage point increase, smaller than some had called for, mean the era of devastating mortgage rate hikes might be over, Ms Scholar added.Taking all 14 rate rises into account, average monthly payments will have increased by \u00a3488.50 for tracker deals and, assuming base rate rises have been fully passed on, \u00a3311.90 for SVRs.This adds up to an average annual increase of \u00a35,862 for homeowners on tracker mortgages and \u00a33,742.80 for SVR customers.RecommendedThe Bank hikes interest rates again \u2013 but the end of the pain could finally be in sightThe mortgage crisis will have severe political consequences for the Conservative PartyMortgage rates soar again to surpass Liz Truss mini-Budget peakAnalysts now believe interest rates will peak at just under 5.7 per cent, down from earlier expectations they could top 6 per cent.And, in a sign of further small increases to the base rate, Mr Bailey said it is not \u201ctime to declare it\u2019s all over\u201d.At the Bank\u2019s rate-setting meeting, six of nine monetary policy committee members voted for the 0.25 percentage point increase.Two members voted for a larger 0.5 percentage point hike to take the rate to 5.5 per cent. And one member said the rate should have been kept flat at 5 per cent.Labour said the increase would be \u201cincredibly worrying for households across Britain already struggling to make ends meet\u201d.Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said the Conservatives were responsible for \u201ccrashing the economy\u201d, leaving households with higher mortgages, higher food bills and higher taxes.House prices slumped by 3.8 per cent annually in July, Nationwide said  (Dominic Lipinski/PA)Interest rate pain for mortgage holders has partly fuelled the largest slump in property values for 14 years, with house prices declining by 3.8 per cent on average annually in July, according to Nationwide."}, {"_id": "64cceafd51ac3352961fa908", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/greenpeace-rishi-sunak-home-protests-b2386873.html", "primaryCategory": "UK Politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Greenpeace activists arrested after climbing on Sunak\u2019s home and covering it in black fabric", "lead": "<p>Activists blanketed his home in protest at Rishi Sunak\u2019s new \u2018drilling frenzy\u2019 </p>", "author": "Archie Mitchell", "datePublished": "2023-08-03 17:23:27", "dateScraped": "2023-08-04 14:11:41.916319", "dateUpdated": "2023-08-03T17:23:27+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/08/03/09/F2lvOLJWEAAvbmE.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up for the View from Westminster email for expert analysis straight to your inboxGet our free View from Westminster email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

It has emerged that the senior doctor who targetted her was subsequently arrested for sexually assaulting a girl under the age of 16. He was allowed full access to the hospital and worked with colleagues on research for a month before being suspended. Speaking to The Independent in her first media interview, Elizabeth said the hospital\u2019s investigation into her sexual assault in June 2020 was \u201cheavily misogynistic\u201d and failed to take the incident seriously. She believes her colleague would have raped her if she hadn\u2019t managed to push him off her.RecommendedFamilies launch legal action against scandal-hit hospitals after The Independent exposed \u2018systemic abuse\u2019Sexual assault and domestic violence \u2018going unchecked\u2019 by regulators, NHS staff warnDespite complaining straightaway, it took 10 months for the hospital to find there was a case to answer but as the other doctor had left the trust there was nothing they could do. Elizabeth then took her case to an employment tribunal which found last month that she had been unlawfully discriminated against on the grounds of her sex.Elizabeth said the assault occurred after a senior doctor asked for an urgent conversation about work at the end of her shift. Inside his office, it quickly emerged the conversation was \u201cjust a pretence for getting me into the room\u201d.She described how he pulled her in for a hug as she tried to leave, making her \u201cfeel very uncomfortable\u201d.\u201cHe then pushed me down into the chair and said I seemed really anxious and he started massaging my back,\u201d she added. \u201cI stood up again and I was like, right. I need to go now.\u201dHe then refused to let her go, beginning to kiss her and saying \u2018I want a kiss\u2019 while she tried to move her face away from him, she recounted.RecommendedNHS launches campaign to combat sexual violenceHundreds of nurses and other health workers disciplined over sex assaults or abuse\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t let go of me,\u201d Elizabeth added. \u201cHis hands were around me.

This was an informal chat and HR wasn\u2019t notified.\u201dShe and her representative at the British Medical Association then requested Dr Elsayed be removed from the investigation due to her \u201ccompletely inappropriate\u201d approach but this was refused.\u201cAt the end of July, I then got a phone call from another person in HR to tell me the recording of my interview had been accidentally attached to an email and sent to three other people in the trust,\u201d she added.The data breach demonstrated \u201chow shambolic their approach to the entire thing was\u201d and the \u201clittle care\u201d they took, she said.Discussing the ordeal in her witness statement, Elizabeth said she was \u201chorrified to learn that random people\u201d heard her \u201ccrying\u201d, at her \u201cmost vulnerable\u201d recounting the sexual assault.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe Royal Air Force (RAF) has delivered a powerful message of unity to Russian President Vladimir Putin with the interception of dozens of Russian aircraft during its leadership of a Nato air policing mission in Estonia, Ben Wallace has said.The Defence Secretary praised the RAF\u2019s success, emphasising the unwavering commitment of the United Kingdom and its allies in safeguarding European airspace and standing against any potential threat to their borders.His comments come as RAF personnel have returned to the UK after leading the air policing mission in Eastern Europe for four months, during which pilots intercepted 50 Russian aircraft and flew for a combined total of more than 500 hours.The members of the 140 Expeditionary Air Wing (140 EAW) had been deployed to Amari Air Base since the start of March, along with a squadron of RAF Typhoon fighter jets, to conduct Quick Reaction Alert (QRA) intercepts of Russian aircraft transiting close to Nato airspace.The deployment, named Op Azotize, began with RAF pilots flying missions alongside the German Air Force \u2013 during which the first ever air joint air intercept between Nato allies took place, as British and German Typhoons shadowed a Russian air-to-air refuelling aircraft and transport aircraft.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveMr Wallace said: \u201cHundreds of RAF pilots and personnel have spent months away from their families, working round-the-clock alongside our allies to keep Europe\u2019s skies safe.\u201cThe UK\u2019s successful leadership of Nato\u2019s air policing mission in Estonia, resulting in the interception of dozens of Russian aircraft by the RAF, sends a strong message to Putin that we stand united with our allies against any threat to our borders.\u201dPersonnel from 140 EAW were always ready to quickly intercept Russian aircraft that didn\u2019t follow the usual communication rules with Nato air traffic agencies and didn\u2019t file proper flight plans. This behaviour created a safety risk for all the planes flying in the area and Nato aircraft had to closely monitor these Russian planes to ensure everyone\u2019s safety.Once the RAF took full control of the air policing mission, their Typhoon fighter jets regularly intercepted Russian fighters, long-range bombers, and reconnaissance aircraft.There was a 21-day period when they intercepted Russian planes a total of 21 times.During the course of the deployment, operations were conducted in co-ordination with the Portuguese and Romanian Air Forces, which jointly led the Nato air policing mission in Lithuania.Defence Minister Baroness Goldie said: \u201cFollowing a successful deployment to Estonia from our strategic airbase at Lossiemouth, I pay tribute to the commitment and dedication of personnel from 140 Expeditionary Air Wing for their role in protecting Nato airspace over the last four months.\u201dOn Wednesday, the leader of 140 EAW, Wing Commander Scott MacColl, officially passed on the responsibility of the air policing mission in Estonia to the Spanish Air Force.Air and Space Commander, Air Marshal Harv Smyth, said: \u201cThe RAF is committed to its role within Nato of collective defence, to ensure the strength and unity of the alliance and to deter and defend against threats to Nato security. While in Estonia, 140 Expeditionary Air Wing has excelled, participating in 12 major Nato and Joint Expeditionary Force exercises in addition to the Air Policing role.\u201cI am extremely proud of the whole force\u2019s hard work and dedication.

The central bank raised its base rate by a further 0.25 points to 5.25 per cent on Thursday, the highest level since February 2008, as part of its ongoing bid to tame inflation by cooling Britain\u2019s economy.It comes despite the latest inflation statistics suggesting price rises had finally slowed by a greater margin than anticipated, with CPI inflation falling from 8.7 per cent in May to 7.9 per cent in June \u2013 the lowest rate since March 2022.As economists eyed an end to the cycle of interest rate hikes, high street retailer Wilko filed for administration, putting some 12,000 jobs at risk.

That should not be a voluntary scheme. Banks and lenders should be forced to take part in that, otherwise hundreds of thousands of people getting into financial difficulty with their mortgages risk falling through the gaps.\u201cSecond, obviously we are talking about mortgages and rents today, but the truth is that energy prices are still much higher than they were before Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, and the energy companies continue to make large profits.\u201cWe would tax those properly by closing some of the loopholes in the government\u2019s windfall tax on the energy giants and use that money to help people with their bills.\u201cThose are two practical things that we would do differently from the government right now. But the truth is we are in these problems today because of a decade or more of economic mismanagement, and we need to do more to get our economy back on the right path.\u201dAndy Gregory3 August 2023 16:001691073501Tracker mortgages to increase by nearly \u00a324 a month after latest rate riseMortgage holders on tracker deals face nearly \u00a324 per month being added to their payments, on average, following the latest Bank of England base rate rise, reports Vicky Shaw.Based on the mortgages outstanding, the new 0.25 percentage point rise, which takes the base rate to 5.25 per cent, will add on \u00a323.71 typically to monthly tracker payments, according to figures from trade association UK Finance, adding up to nearly \u00a3285 per year.For homeowners on a standard variable rate (SVR) mortgage, the average payment could increase by \u00a315.14 per month, or nearly \u00a3182 per year. SVRs are set by individual lenders and often follow movements in the base rate.Taking all of the past 14 base rate rises since December 2021 into account, average monthly payments will have increased by \u00a3488.50 for tracker deals and, assuming base rate rises have been fully passed on, \u00a3311.90 for SVRs.This adds up to an average annual increase of \u00a35,862 for homeowners on tracker mortgages and \u00a33,742.80 for SVR customers.PA3 August 2023 15:381691071778Inflation hurts lower-income households most, says Andrew BaileyThe governor of the Bank of England has emphasised that inflation hurts lower-income households the most, which is why the Bank has opted for \u201crestrictive\u201d monetary policy.Andrew Bailey said: \u201cWe do recognise, and I think it\u2019s very important to say, that inflation has a very serious effect particularly on those least well off.\u201dThe main components of inflation, energy and food, make up a bigger portion of spending for lower income families, he said. \u201cBut I will emphasise that the economy is more resilient.

The world needs more like Sven.\u201dThe mother of the 16-year-old said in a witness statement that her son is \u201csuffering mentally with PTSD, night terrors, flashbacks and has withdrawn completely socially\u201d.She added: \u201cThese people robbed me of my son and have left an empty shell behind, a damaged boy I no longer recognise.\u201dShe said that since the jury\u2019s verdict, a video of drill music has been uploaded online and that they have had to relocate and change their names \u201cdue to ongoing threats\u201d.Melanie Simpson KC, defending Gedel, said the defendant \u201cclearly expressed regret\u201d when giving evidence.She added that he was placed in care at the age of 13 and was in 14 different care placements in the years afterwards.Brian St Louis KC, defending Ambersley, said: \u201cWe suggest the defendant\u2019s offending relates to his youth, his lack of maturity and lack of supervision.\u201dHe added: \u201cHe has always expressed to us his deep regret that Mr Badzak died. That was never an intention that he wanted but he accepts the jury\u2019s finding in relation to that death.\u201dHarvey Canavan, 19, from Maida Vale, had pleaded guilty to manslaughter and unlawful wounding and Lior Agbayan, 20, had fled to the Ivory Coast and has not returned, jurors were told.The remaining two suspects have not been identified, the court heard.Michael Bromley-Martin KC, defending Canavan, said: \u201cThe unlawful act which he committed and he admitted to committing is to appear to be involved with others, to walk around the area of Willesden Lane with the intention of selling cannabis, knowing that others in the group would be armed with a knife or knives and being reckless to whether some harm, not serious harm, would be caused by one of the others by means of the use of a knife or knives.\u201dHe added that Canavan was at the time a \u201cvery damaged, very vulnerable, very immature child\u201d.Judge John Dodd KC called the eight-second attack \u201cbrutal and savage and swift\u201d.He said: \u201cSven Badzak was clearly a decent young man. He was 22 when you attacked and killed him.\u201cIt\u2019s clear that he\u2019d done absolutely nothing wrong on that February day.\u201dGedel and Ambersley were both sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 27 years for murder, and 12 years to run concurrently for wounding with intent.Canavan was sentenced to seven and a half years in prison for manslaughter and 15 months to run concurrently for unlawful wounding."}, {"_id": "64cceb0151ac3352961fa917", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/aslef-gtr-brighton-govia-thameslink-railway-pride-b2387148.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Talks between rail operator and council fail ahead of Brighton Pride weekend", "lead": "Govia Thameslink Railway blamed an overtime ban by Aslef for its announcement that no trains will run to or from Brighton on Saturday.", "author": "Alan Jones", "datePublished": "2023-08-03 14:53:51", "dateScraped": "2023-08-04 14:11:45.732791", "dateUpdated": "2023-08-03T14:53:51+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/08/03/16/0525557c2334df8593b1b4b1cf874a04Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjkxMTU5ODA0-2.68202559.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

A government minister on Friday said it would not be \"responsible\" for her to comment on Rishi Sunak's security arrangements, as police said there was \"no threat to the wider public\" from the demonstration. Three men and two women were arrested after they scaled the roof of the PM's country mansion, draping it in oil-black fabric and a banner that says \"no new oil\".Asked whether the stunt raised concerns about the PM's security, health minister Maria Caulfield on Friday said: \"I'm not going to comment on the security arrangements of the Prime Minister, I don't think that would be a responsible thing to do,\" she told Sky News.\"But it does raise concerns for everyone, most people have seen some disruption from protesters.\"RecommendedBudget 2022: Hunt says UK in recession as he announces huge tax risesJeremy Hunt increases energy windfall tax in budgetJeremy Hunt freezes tax allowances and hits 45p rate payersElliot Foskett, assistant chief constable of North Yorkshire Police, said in a statement: \u201cShortly after 8 am this morning we responded swiftly to reports of protest activity at the prime minister's North Yorkshire address.\"There was no threat to the wider public throughout this incident which has now been brought to a safe conclusion.

into the PM\u2019s security arrangements.\u201cThis raises some very serious questions around how the home of a sitting prime minister has been accessed in this way, to the extent that political campaigners and activists have been able to trespass on his property and physically gain access,\u201d she told the Daily Mail newspaper.And former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith said he believed security \u201cdoesn\u2019t seem to know how to protect the house of the Prime Minister\u201d, adding: \u201cThere has to be an inquiry into what the hell was going on.\u201dResponding to the protest, a Downing Street spokesperson said: \"We make no apology for taking the right approach to ensure our energy security, using the resources we have here at home so we are never reliant on aggressors like [Vladimir] Putin for our energy.\"Greenpeace said it had planned its protest \"carefully and meticulously\" and would not have done it if Rishi Sunak was at home.Areeba Hamid, co-executive director of the organisation, said the protest was \"proportionate response to a disastrous decision\" by the Prime Minister to grant more than 100 new licences for oil and gas extraction in the North Sea.\"It was an empty home, the fact that he wasn't there was actually national news, everybody knows that he wasn't there,\" she said. \n\nUK news in picturesShow all 501/50UK news in pictures\n\nUK

Wind turbines, solar panels and other solutions have been popping up all over the country.Yet very few transmission lines have been built over the last 30 years.\u201cDelivering 50 gigawatts (GW) of new wind power and 24 GW of new nuclear will be a major step towards decarbonising our economy and providing customers with clean, secure, affordable electricity, but that magnificent achievement will be wasted if we cannot get the power to homes and businesses,\u201d said Mr Winser, the Electricity Networks Commissioner.\u201cThe implications of being able to build wind generation faster than the associated connections to customers will be serious: very high congestion costs for customers, and clean, cheap domestic energy generation standing idle, potentially for years.\u201cI believe that we must\u2026 reduce the overall timescale to seven years.\u201cI am confident that this is achievable as long as we streamline the process as proposed in the report; and take a transparent, respectful and efficient approach when engaging with people and communities about the impact.\u201dThe report included a series of recommendations of steps for the Government and regulators to take.Dan McGrail, chief executive of trade body RenewableUK, said: \u201cOur electricity network is the single biggest barrier to delivering a zero-carbon power system by 2035.RecommendedPush for more North Sea oil and gas \u2018right thing for planet\u2019, Jeremy Hunt saysHeavy rain and thunderstorms to batter Britons until end of weekClimate change driving migratory butterfly to stay in UK\u201cSo we\u2019re pleased that this timely report puts forward a series of constructive measures to speed up the pace at which the UK builds vital new grid infrastructure.\u201cThese recommendations will benefit billpayers across the country by ensuring that we maximise the vast quantities of cheap, clean power we\u2019re generating from renewables, and that we can get it to British homes and businesses more efficiently.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64cceb0351ac3352961fa91c", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/jeremy-hunt-north-sea-chancellor-channel-4-news-rishi-sunak-b2387280.html", "primaryCategory": "News", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Push for more North Sea oil and gas \u2018right thing for planet\u2019, Jeremy Hunt says", "lead": "The Chancellor was challenged over his support for the move when he opposed a gas drilling project in his constituency.", "author": "Sophie Wingate", "datePublished": "2023-08-03 18:15:41", "dateScraped": "2023-08-04 14:11:47.073070", "dateUpdated": "2023-08-03T18:15:41+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/08/03/19/44262c3cbd1c4f2b83e54d5c422ea409Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjkxMTcwMzQ2-2.73157300.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to the Independent Climate email for the latest advice on saving the planetGet our free Climate email\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeJeremy Hunt has defended the Government\u2019s push to maximise the production of oil and gas, arguing it is \u201cthe right thing to do\u201d for UK energy security and the planet.The Chancellor was challenged over his support for the continued licensing of new North Sea developments when he strongly opposed a gas drilling project in his Surrey constituency on environmental grounds.The South West Surrey MP in 2022 blasted a Government decision to allow an exploratory gas well to be dug near the village of Dunsfold as \u201cbitterly disappointing and wrong both economically and environmentally\u201d.\n\nAnd that's why this is the right thing to do for the planet as well as for our energy securityJeremy HuntAsked why he then backed oil and gas exploration in the North Sea, Mr Hunt told Channel 4 News on Thursday: \u201cBecause these are totally different situations.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow live\u201cAs a constituency MP, I do my job and stand up for constituents who are worried about environmental impact.\u201cBut when it comes to the North Sea, something very profound and important has changed in the last 18 months, which is that we realised that what matters is not just the transition to net zero, but also energy security, and it happens to be a lot more carbon-intensive to import gas than to use our own supply.\u201dIt was put to Mr Hunt that with the private companies that own the North Sea fields selling the oil and gas on the international market, there is no guarantee the supplies will end up in the UK.He replied: \u201cBut we\u2019re far more likely to get them if we\u2019re extracting that gas than if we\u2019re not extracting it.\u201dMr Hunt also told Sky News that the UK will remain \u201ca bigger importer of gas\u201d and that while \u201cwe\u2019re importing it, it uses three times less carbon to use our own gas (than) to import it from the other side of the world.\u201cAnd that\u2019s why this is the right thing to do for the planet as well as for our energy security.\u201dPrime Minister Rishi Sunak this week announced plans to \u201cmax out\u201d the UK\u2019s oil and gas reserves by granting more than 100 new oil and sea gas licences alongside a new carbon capture scheme in north-east Scotland.He also hinted that the UK\u2019s largest untapped oil field, Rosebank, to the west of Shetland, could be approved despite fierce opposition from environmental campaigners.Climate-conscious Conservatives have joined campaigners to warn against the move, amid concerns it will hinder efforts to reach net-zero by 2050.Meanwhile, Mr Hunt echoed Mr Sunak in reaffirming the Government\u2019s commitment to banning the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030.\u201cI think that deadline is important because it encourages a lot of investment,\u201d the Chancellor told GB News.RecommendedHeavy rain and thunderstorms to batter Britons until end of weekClimate change driving migratory butterfly to stay in UKSunak expects grilling from daughters over fossil fuel plans\u201cBut what the Prime Minister has said is that as we transition to electric vehicles, we need to do so in a way that is proportionate and sensible and takes account of the people who will still be driving vehicles that aren\u2019t electric.\u201cWe\u2019re sticking with 2030, but we\u2019re going to do it in a pragmatic way.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64cceb0351ac3352961fa91d", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/greenpeace-prime-minister-oliver-dowden-north-yorkshire-california-b2386879.html", "primaryCategory": "News", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Greenpeace activists scale Sunak\u2019s house in protest at oil drilling \u2018frenzy\u2019", "lead": "The group said four campaigners climbed the roof of the Prime Minister\u2019s North Yorkshire house while he is holidaying with family in California.", "author": "Sam Blewett", "datePublished": "2023-08-03 16:30:55", "dateScraped": "2023-08-04 14:11:47.319975", "dateUpdated": "2023-08-03T16:30:55+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/08/03/10/deeabf12b494539a5b74774435e18861Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjkxMTM4ODQ4-2.73220578.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up for the View from Westminster email for expert analysis straight to your inboxGet our free View from Westminster email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe Women\u2019s World Cup takes a break today after a dramatic end to the group stages saw Germanyeliminated from the tournament. The No. 2 ranked side in the world failed to make it out of the group after a 1-1 draw against South Korea left them on four points in Group H, two behind Colombia and Morocco - the Atlas Lionesses\u2019 defeated Colombia 1-0 on the final matchday. Germany\u2019s exit is good news for England as they would have been on the Lionesses side of the draw and could have been potential semi-final opponents. There\u2019s a long way to go until that stage however and Sarina Wiegman will be focused only on defeating Nigeria in the last-16. Elsewhere, co-hosts Australia made it into the knockout stages with an impressive 4-0 demolition of Canada in their final match of Group B. The Matildas needed to win to ensure their spot in the last-16 and, despite captain Sam Kerr still being injured, they swept the Canadians aside and dumped them out of the tournament. Another giant killing saw Jamaica hold Brazil at bay for a 0-0 draw and ensured they edged into the last-16 where they now face Colombia.Follow along for the latest news and updates from the Women\u2019s World Cup:RecommendedHow the Women\u2019s World Cup delivered its greatest ever group stage \u2014 against all the oddsZambia Women\u2019s coach accused of rubbing player\u2019s chest at World Cup\u2018Resilient\u2019 Jamaica create World Cup history as Brazil and Marta exitWomens\u2019 World Cup 2023 - Latest newsFollow along for the lastest news and updates from the Women\u2019s World CupLionesses prepare for last-16 tie against NigeriaGermany dumped out of World Cup in the group stagesWhen do England play next?

Portugal\u2019s Ana Capeta, brought on in stoppage time, came within the width of a post from sending the two-time defending champions crashing out of the tournament. If that\u2019s how close the USA came to a first World Cup defeat since 2015, it\u2019s a clear indication of how fragile their dominance appears to be. After only scraping through Group E as runners-up and with Sweden, who thrashed the USA at the Olympics two years ago, likely to be next in the last-16, there is little confidence that this is the same side who entered the tournament as favourites.Had Captea\u2019s shot caught the inside of the post then the World Cup would have staged its biggest shock yet, with the dethroning of the four-time winners. Yet, even though Capeta\u2019s strike agonisingly rebounded out, the nerves at the end as the USA survived only confirmed what many thought ahead of the World Cup. After draws against the Netherlands and Portugal, the first time the USA have ever failed to win two games in the World Cup group stage, it is clear that the gap between the defending champions and the rest of the world has closed.USA\u2019s narrow escape spells the end of Women\u2019s World Cup dominancePortugal 0-0 USA: The defending champions were the width of the post away from crashing out of the World Cup Mike Jones4 August 2023 13:001691149851Carli Lloyd slams former teammates as USA almost crash out of Women\u2019s World CupFormer United States women\u2019s national team player Carli Lloyd labelled USA\u2019s performance against Portugal \u201clacklustre\u201d and \u201cuninspiring\u201d as they almost crashed out of the World Cup in the group stages.The defending champions needed to avoid defeat but were inches away from elimination when Portugal substitute Ana Capeta struck the post in stoppage time.The USA held on to scrape a 0-0 draw, enough to secure progress to the last-16 while knocking Portugal out, but the four-time winners missed out on top spot in Group E with Lloyd highly critical of the display from her former side.Carli Lloyd slams former teammates as USA almost crash out of Women\u2019s World CupThe USA held on to scrape a 0-0 draw against Portugal with the four-time winners missing out on top spot in Group EMike Jones4 August 2023 12:501691149431Women\u2019s World Cup 2023: USA\u2019s route to the finalWhat is the USA\u2019s potential path to the final?

The United States survived an almighty scare to advance from the Women\u2019s World Cup group stage - keeping alive hopes of a third successive title.Portugal hit the post late to ensure the United States avoided an early exit at the group stages.The defending champions opened their campaign with a 3-0 victory against Vietnam but were held to a 1-1 draw by the Netherlands, in what was a rematch of their 2019 World Cup final.And the goalless draw against Portugal has prompted widespread criticism back home but the USA progress as runners-up from Group E, behind the Netherlands, who thrashed Vietnam 7-0.Who are the United States playing at the World Cup?The United States take on Sweden in the last 16 and the match will take place in Melbourne at the Rectangular Stadium on 6 August, kick-off is scheduled for 5am ET (10am BST).The winner will play the winner of Japan vs Norway in Auckland on 11 August.Mike Jones4 August 2023 12:361691148591Women\u2019s World Cup 2023: A group stage of shocksNew Zealand\u2019s opening victory against Norway set the tone, with Colombia\u2019s last-second win against Germany standing out as the highlight of a tournament that has so far had it all. To add to that, Jamaica reaching the last-16 with their draw against Brazil, Nigeria\u2019s stunning victory against Australia, and South Africa\u2019s dramatic comeback against Italy were all brilliant moments from a group stage that delivered the unpredictability and drama of knockout football.The number of shocks and upsets throughout illustrated that the progress and development of women\u2019s football since the last World Cup has been felt just as much throughout the world than its traditional powers. The gap to the top has closed: the professionalisation of top European leagues and beyond has improved standards at the biggest clubs, and is providing more opportunities to players from across the globe.Mike Jones4 August 2023 12:291691148171Lauren James delighted to \u2018carve out\u2019 her name with superb displays at World CupLauren James headed into this summer\u2019s Women\u2019s World Cup having emphasised her desire to make a name for herself \u2013 and she has certainly done so with the performances that have followed.There was already a considerable buzz around the 21-year-old forward \u2013 the younger sister of fellow England and Chelsea player Reece James \u2013 in the build-up to her first major tournament as a senior international.And during the Lionesses pre-tournament preparations she spoke about wanting to carve out her own name, saying: \u201cI do feel like that, a lot.\u201dLauren James delighted to \u2018carve out\u2019 her name with superb displays at World CupJames has truly announced herself on the world stage with three goals and three assists.Mike Jones4 August 2023 12:221691147751My premonition about England team-mate Lauren James came true says Rachel DalyRachel Daly revealed her pre-match premonition about England team-mate Lauren James came true on Tuesday night after the Chelsea prodigy scored twice and picked up three assists in the 6-1 victory over China at the World Cup.James, 21, became the first England player of either gender to be directly involved in five or more goals in a World Cup match as the Lionesses clinched top of group D to set up a last-16 meeting with Nigeria in Brisbane on Monday.Daly was one of five Lionesses who got their names on the scoresheet at Adelaide\u2019s Hindmarsh Stadium, where boss Sarina Wiegman switched to an inspired 3-5-2 system in the wake of an undisclosed knee injury to midfield maestro Keira Walsh.My premonition about England team-mate Lauren James came true \u2013 Rachel DalyJames, 21, became the first England player of either gender to be directly involved in five or more goals in a World Cup.Mike Jones4 August 2023 12:151691147271Women\u2019s World Cup 2023: Lionesses train ahead of Nigeria clashWith the group stages now over, the focuse moves to the knockout rounds.

The identity of the 33 who will travel to France has mostly been decided, but a small handful of spots still have a question mark hanging over them. Debutant flanker Tom Pearson, wing Joe Cokanasiga and centre Joe Marchant are among those hoping to give Borthwick a nudge before the final selection meeting on Saturday evening.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveWales need a performanceWales, to put it bluntly, lost their way after the spectacular high of a first away victory over South Africa 14 months ago.

Warren Gatland was then appointed for a second stint as Wales boss, but an underwhelming fifth-placed finish in the Six Nations generated more questions than answers. Saturday\u2019s Principality Stadium encounter might effectively be a \u2018friendly\u2019, yet the importance of a Wales win cannot be overstated in terms of restoring some confidence and optimism for suffering supporters.Captain Morgan in chargeOspreys flanker Jac Morgan will captain Wales for the first time in what is effectively the first of three World Cup leadership auditions. Gatland has said that he anticipates appointing a different skipper for each warm-up Test \u2013 England home and away, followed by South Africa in Cardiff \u2013 before announcing his final 33-player squad and leader later this month. Others in the captaincy frame include Dewi Lake, Dan Biggar, Will Rowlands and Adam Beard, but 23-year-old Morgan has been handed a golden opportunity to stake his claim. If Wales get it right, he could prove difficult to dislodge.Smith calls the shotsMarcus Smith is not among those on trial at the Principality Stadium after Borthwick confirmed he will take three fly-halves to the World Cup. Unburdened by the need to pull a rabbit out of the hat to secure his place at the tournament, the instinctive Harlequins playmaker can focus on providing England with the generalship his position demands. Smith stands apart as an attacking fly-half, but his game management and organisational skills will have benefited from having worked alongside veteran ringmasters Owen Farrell and George Ford throughout the summer.Century for HalfpennyRecommendedStaking a claim for the World Cup \u2013 Ireland versus Italy talking pointsThe key questions answered as the Commonwealth Games suffers latest setbackIpswich boss Kieran McKenna backed to handle step up to the ChampionshipFull-back Leigh Halfpenny will become the ninth player to win 100 Wales caps when he runs out against England. It is a red-letter day for the 34-year-old, who has overcome major injury setbacks during recent seasons and now looks firmly on course to make Wales\u2019 World Cup squad. He is just the fifth Welsh back to reach three figures after Stephen Jones, Gareth Thomas, George North and Biggar, while only Jones and Neil Jenkins have more amassed more points for Wales than Halfpenny\u2019s current figure of 785. Almost 15 years after he made his Test debut, he now joins an exclusive club and can be guaranteed a rapturous reception for such an impressive achievement."}, {"_id": "64cceb0651ac3352961fa927", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/andy-farrell-ireland-italy-england-samoa-b2387674.html", "primaryCategory": "Sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Staking a claim for the World Cup \u2013 Ireland versus Italy talking points", "lead": "Andy Farrell\u2019s men also face England and Samoa this month.", "author": "Ed Elliot", "datePublished": "2023-08-04 11:02:26", "dateScraped": "2023-08-04 14:11:50.905079", "dateUpdated": "2023-08-04T11:02:26+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/08/04/12/beb73b18622e42501821940fef938330Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjkxMjMyNTQ3-2.71431140.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free sport newsletter for all the latest news on everything from cycling to boxingSign up to our free sport email for all the latest news\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Jack Crowley is the first to be handed an opportunity to impress. The 23-year-old\u2019s selection is reward for his fine form for Munster, which included United Rugby Championship glory in May. Uncapped Ciaran Frawley awaits his chance on the bench, with fellow Leinster player Ross Byrne \u2013 Sexton\u2019s main understudy during the Six Nations \u2013 hoping for involvement against England and Samoa in the coming weeks. Forwards coach Paul O\u2019Connell described game time for the rookie trio as a \u201creal good silver lining\u201d to Sexton\u2019s undesirable situation.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveStaking a claimIreland\u2019s World Cup hopefuls have just three games to secure places on the plane to France, with Farrell due to cut his 42-man squad down to 33 on August 28. Only three men \u2013 Robbie Henshaw, Caelan Doris and Ryan Baird \u2013 have retained starting roles from Ireland\u2019s Six Nations success over England in March in a much-changed matchday 23. Many of the others are on the periphery and fighting for a spot. Lock Joe McCarthy and prop Tom O\u2019Toole will make their first and second Test starts respectively, while potential debutants Frawley, Calvin Nash and Tom Stewart are joined on the bench by Connacht rookies Cian Prendergast and Caolin Blade.Rare start for StockdaleJacob Stockdale was player of the championship during Ireland\u2019s 2018 Six Nations Grand Slam win and a guaranteed starter at the last World Cup. But his international career has very much hit the buffers. The 27-year-old is set to make his first Test appearance for more than two years and just his sixth start of the Farrell era. James Lowe has emerged as Ireland\u2019s first choice on the left wing, yet Keith Earls, who wins his 99th cap this weekend, is the only current squad member to have scored more Ireland tries than Stockdale (19). Farrell believes the Ulster player is still capable of being a \u201ctremendous asset\u201d.Maintaining momentumTadhg Beirne, who is among the replacements, this week pointed to poor warm-up performances contributing to Ireland\u2019s underwhelming World Cup campaign in Japan four years ago. Farrell and members of his squad have repeatedly stressed the Italy fixture is far from a friendly as, in addition to individuals competing for places, they attempt to maintain collective momentum going into the tournament in France. Ireland are bidding for an 11th successive win and a 15th on the bounce at home to protect their number one world ranking. They have lost just one of 21 Aviva Stadium fixtures under Farrell \u2013 to France in 2021.RecommendedEngland goalkeeper Mary Earps describes boss Sarina Wiegman as \u2018mastermind\u2019The key questions answered as the Commonwealth Games suffers latest setbackIpswich boss Kieran McKenna backed to handle step up to the ChampionshipEngland-born pair switch allegiancesAzzurri head coach Kieran Crowley has made nine personnel changes from last weekend\u2019s 25-13 Murrayfield loss to Scotland, including naming two debutants of interest to English rugby fans: Paolo Odogwu and Dino Lamb.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeWhen Chloe Kelly scrambled home England\u2019s winner against Germany in the Euro 2022 final last July, Sarina Wiegman achieved a feat only dreamed of since Sir Geoff Hurst\u2019s stunning hat-trick against the same opponents at the same venue in 1966: she brought football home.Since succeeding Phil Neville as the Lionesses\u2019s coach in September 2021, the Dutchwoman, 53, has barely put a foot wrong, winning 28 of her 35 games in charge, drawing just six and losing only once: a chastening 2-0 friendly defeat to Australia in Brentford in April that may actually have served as a timely reality check ahead of this summer\u2019s Women\u2019s World Cup in the Matildas\u2019 backyard.It\u2019s three out of three for her team in Australia and New Zealand so far, with the Lionesses\u2019s putting two nervy 1-0 wins over Haiti and Denmark behind them with the 6-1 trouncing of China, which saw them top Group D in style and head into a round of 16 clash against Nigeria brimming with confidence.But while success might appear to come easily to Sarina Wiegman, matters were not always so straightforward.Born in The Hague on 26 October 1969, she played street football from a young age but, incredibly, had to pretend to be a boy in order to turn out for Wasserman side GSC ESDO at junior level.RecommendedWomen\u2019s World Cup LIVE: Latest news and updates as England prepare for last-16 clash with NigeriaHow the Women\u2019s World Cup delivered its greatest ever group stage \u2014 against all the oddsWiegman hails England\u2019s adaptability after tactics change sparks big win over China\u201cWhen I started playing football as a six-year-old girl we weren\u2019t allowed to play, so I played illegally,\u201d she told BBC Radio 5 Live Breakfast recently.\u201cI had very short hair, looked a little bit maybe like a boy, my parents were really OK and I had a twin brother, so we just started to play and everyone said that\u2019s OK. It wasn\u2019t normal then and now it\u2019s just normal, whether you\u2019re a boy or a girl, you can play football and that\u2019s just great. It was actually crazy before, that you couldn\u2019t, but that\u2019s just the way it is in development I guess.\u201dSubsequently playing as a central midfielder for the women\u2019s teams HSV Celeritas and KFC \u201871 in the 1980s, she made her debut for the Dutch national side in 1987 against Norway, aged 17, when the well-travelled future Rangers manager Dick Advocaat picked her for what would turn out to be his only game in charge.She would ultimately make 104 appearances for the Netherlands, becoming their first female centurion when she appeared against Denmark in 2001, prompting Louis van Gaal to pay his respects to her extraordinary accomplishment in an era in which the women\u2019s game had been so badly neglected.Long before that moment, Wiegman\u2019s performances at the 1988 FIFA Women\u2019s Invitation Tournament in China had caught the eye of then-US women\u2019s coach Anson Dorrance, who subsequently invited her to enrol at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to play for the North Carolina Tar Heels.Hristo Stoichkov presents Sarina Wiegman with the female coach of the year award during The Best FIFA Football Awards 2022 in Paris, France (Aurelien Meunier/Getty)She accepted, making 24 appearances in 1989 and scoring four times for a team that featured such future American greats as Mia Hamm. Three members of her current Lionesses squad \u2013 Lucy Bronze, Alessia Russo and Lotte Wubben-Moy \u2013 would later follow in her footsteps and turn out for the Tar Heels.Returning to the Netherlands, Wiegman worked as a PE teacher at Segbroek College secondary school in her hometown before signing for Ter Leede in Sassenheim in 1994, whom she would play for until 2003, picking up two championships and a domestic cup along the way.After retiring as a player, she returned to Ter Leede as the club\u2019s manager in 2006, leading them to a league and cup double in her debut season before joining ADO Den Haag for the inaugural Women\u2019s Eredivisie. She would spend seven years with Den Haag, again winning the double in 2012 and another cup the following year (Wiegman\u2019s husband Marten Glotzbach, incidentally, is the current manager of the ADO Den Haag\u2019s men\u2019s side).Wiegman would then serve the Dutch women\u2019s team as assistant manager between 2015 and 2017, twice stepping in as interim boss during that period while also becoming the first woman to hold a coaching role with a men\u2019s team when she joined Sparta Rotterdam as an assistant in 2016. That same year, she also became the first woman to complete her Uefa Pro coaching licence.Finally promoted to manager of the Netherlands women\u2019s side in 2017, she quickly led them to Euros glory that summer and the World Cup final in France two years later, where they were unfortunate to come up against an imperious Megan Rapinoe-inspired USASarina Wiegman celebrating England\u2019s Finalissima penlty shoot-out win over Brazil this spring  (Bradley Collyer/PA)Joining England as the Covid-19 pandemic subsided, her impact on these shores was just as immediate, with players like Mary Earps later speaking movingly about Wiegman\u2019s positive influence on her game and personal life, the new manager arriving at a time when the goalkeeper was suffering a crisis of self-belief and seriously considering hanging up her gloves.Bringing clear communication and direct attacking football to the Lionesses, Wiegman enjoyed the ideal approach to last summer\u2019s Euros with an emphatic 5-1 win over the Netherlands, the reigning champions and her own former side.Speaking after that game, Wiegman was characteristically disinclined to get carried away, commenting: \u201cWe stick to our strategy and plans, and whether we would lose or win now, we\u2019re not going to all of a sudden sit, we call it, on a pink cloud. We stay grounded.\u201dDespite losing her sister weeks before the Euros got underway, Wiegman refused to lose focus and England would go from strength to strength as the tournament progressed, thrashing Norway and Northern Ireland in Group A, finding a way past a tricky Spanish side in the quarters before trouncing Sweden 4-0 on the way to that historic showdown with Germany.\u201cThe world around us will be changed,\u201d she reflected in the aftermath of that famous extra-time victory, without hyperbole.Sarina Wiegman jokes with Lauren James during last week\u2019s match with China (PA)\u201cIt\u2019s positive but we have to be aware of it too. But we\u2019ve changed society. That\u2019s what we want. It\u2019s so much more than football. We want to win, but through football you can make little changes in society and that\u2019s what we hoped for. This has done so much for the game and for women and society. In England, but also across the world. It\u2019s so nice to see how enthusiastic everyone was, inside and outside the stadium.\u201dWhile she benefitted from a settled first-team at the Euros and at times appeared reluctant to make changes, Wiegman has had her preparations for the World Cup disrupted by injuries, first to Beth Mead, Leah Williamson and Fran Kirby and now Keira Walsh, having already lost Ellen White and Jill Scott to retirement.But, as usual, she has simply taken adversity in her stride and given opportunities to promising understudies like Lauren James and Katie Zelem, both of whom excelled against China.RecommendedWatch England train ahead of Women\u2019s World Cup last 16 clash with NigeriaWiegman hails England\u2019s adaptability after tactics change sparks big win over ChinaLauren James delighted to \u2018carve out\u2019 her name with superb displays at World CupCan Wiegman\u2019s England go one better this time than her Dutch side of four years ago?With Brazil, Germany and Canada already knocked out and the USA decidedly unconvincing and up against a free-scoring Sweden next, the dream has rarely looked closer to becoming a reality."}, {"_id": "64cceb0751ac3352961fa929", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/wrexham-league-two-ryan-reynolds-rob-mcelhenney-preview-b2382349.html", "primaryCategory": "Football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Why Wrexham can\u2019t bank on another Hollywood ending", "lead": "<p>Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney\u2019s ownership means the Welsh club approach their first season back in League Two since 2008 with plenty of expectation</p>", "author": "Ben Fleming", "datePublished": "2023-08-04 10:29:20", "dateScraped": "2023-08-04 14:11:51.749989", "dateUpdated": "2023-08-04T10:29:20+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/04/24/17/c839e994224e977dcec41414e404ebcdY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjgyNDQwNzY5-2.71863962.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Miguel Delaney\u2019s Reading the Game newsletter sent straight to your inbox for freeSign up to Miguel\u2019s Delaney\u2019s free weekly newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeFor a team whose first three fixtures back in League Two are MK Dons, AFC Wimbledon, and Walsall, it feels somewhat out of kilter that three of their last pre-season games saw them face Chelsea, LA Galaxy and Manchester United. Such is the Wrexham way.Fresh off a nail-biting National League campaign, Las Vegas promotion party and sell-out Stateside pre-season tour, Wrexham fans and players, if only momentarily, might be brought back down to earth by the prospect of a 46-game slog as they look to pick up where they left off back in the Football League for the first time since 2008.Perhaps if this were a Hollywood script, Wrexham\u2019s journey under owners Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney would continue unperturbed; the Welsh side coasting to League Two glory and continuing their march up the English football pyramid.But football isn\u2019t always that straightforward.Ask Salford City. The Manchester club, owned by class of \u201892 teammates Gary Neville, Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs, Nicky Butt, Phil Neville and David Beckham were the original celebrity-owned lower-league club and arrived in this very same league back in 2019 to similar fanfare. Four seasons and four managers later, they still remain. In their quartet of campaigns since promotion from the National League, their best finish has been last season, placing seventh before ultimately bowing out in the play-off semi-finals.RecommendedWrexham fume at Man Utd goalkeeper after striker Paul Mullin hospitalised with punctured lungRyan Reynolds\u2019 Wrexham is on its way to the United States after being given the Hollywood treatmentWhy Wrexham? How Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney came to buy a club they\u2019d never heard ofAsk Mansfield Town. The Stags will now enter their 11th straight year in the division after their promotion from the then-Conference League. After four unsuccessful promotion challenges in the last six seasons as one of the league\u2019s bigger spenders, Nigel Clough\u2019s side have become part of League Two\u2019s furniture, last year missing out on a spot in the play-offs to Salford courtesy of goal difference.Ask Stockport County. Last season\u2019s shiny new toy, having pipped Wrexham to promotion in 2021, Stockport were many people\u2019s favourite to achieve back-to-back promotions with their National League record and stellar squad. However, a play-off final penalty-shootout defeat to underdogs Carlisle means that Dave Challinor\u2019s side will again compete in the fourth tier this season.None of this is to suggest that Wrexham can\u2019t achieve back-to-back promotions for the first time in the club\u2019s history. They are clear favourites with the bookmakers to do just that after their record-breaking points tally (111) last season in the fifth tier.But even with four promotion spots on offer, rather than the two in the National League, history has shown that nothing can be taken for granted in a league full of clubs looking to move up the pyramid.The Welsh club accrued a record 111 points last year in the National League  (Getty Images)In that sense, Parkinson can be grateful that Wrexham\u2019s riches and big-spending in the past gifts him a squad full of League Two know-how with no better example than talisman and last year\u2019s Player of the Season, Paul Mullin. Although a punctured lung, suffered in a pre-season friendly against Manchester United, will see the striker miss the start of the season, the 28-year-old will need no time to acclimatise to the division.It was in League Two, after all, that he first caught the eye of Wrexham having fired 32 goals in 46 games to guide Cambridge United to an unlikely promotion in 2021. His move back down the pyramid to Wrexham was an early sign of Reynolds and McElhenney\u2019s pull and pockets.Then there is Ben Tozer and Jordan Tunnicliffe. Tozer captained Cheltenham out of League Two the very same season that Mullin burst onto the scene while Tunnifcliffe made it into the division\u2019s team of the season that same year for his performances at Crawley.This year, Tozer will be reunited with fellow centre-back, Will Boyle \u2013 Wrexham\u2019s lone signing so far this window \u2013 with whom he formed a sturdy partnership at Cheltenham. Add to that Eoghan O\u2019Connell, signed last January from League One Charlton Athletic, and recent Premier League goalkeeper Ben Foster, who has postponed a second retirement to sign a new contract, and it\u2019s clear to see the enviable quality that the Welsh side have in defence.The creativity of fan-favourite and former Luton Town midfielder Elliot Lee, alongside the goalscoring prowess of Ollie Palmer, who joined for a club-record \u00a3300,000, is further evidence of why Wrexham went on to smash the record points tally last season. It is perhaps also why, other than Boyle, the club have not made any signings in the transfer window.There is money available, especially after new, lucrative shirt and stadium sponsorship deals with United Airlines and US coffee brand, Stok, but it also points to a squad that was ready to compete with League Two\u2019s best long before they reached this point.Paul Mullin will be one of the key men in Wrexham\u2019s bid for back-to-back promotions  (Jon Super)They are by no means out on their own, though. Wrexham\u2019s great title rivals in the National League, Notts County, look likely to challenge them again, especially after the coveted signing of veteran striker David McGoldrick who scored 22 goals for Derby County last year in League One.And there is also Stockport, last year\u2019s Wembley losers, who have recruited Nick Powell from Stoke City, the 29-year-old returning to the league where he first caught the eye of Manchester United aged 18.RecommendedRyan Reynolds reaches out to Manchester United keeper after Paul Mullin injuryExtraordinary \u2013 Wrexham director says reception in US has exceeded expectationsHow the Women\u2019s World Cup produced its greatest ever group stageGillingham, fresh off their own US investment, and those teams relegated from League One last season \u2013 MK Dons, Morecambe, Accrington Stanley and Forest Green \u2013 could all contend as well in what promises to be one of the most intriguing and high-quality seasons the league has ever seen.Wrexham will continue to attract global eyeballs and bring renewed pride to their local community, that much is assured. On the pitch, though, nothing is guaranteed. As League Two has shown before, no amount of money or high-profile ownership is a guarantee of success. Wrexham will be wary of that and Parkinson will have his work cut out against any number of fancied promotion rivals but with a squad built for the level, the Welsh club and its owners will surely be dreaming of another Hollywood ending.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe upsets at the Women\u2019s World Cup group stage started on the opening day and ended with the biggest of all. Germany, the two-time champions and among the tournament favourites, are out before the quarter-finals for the first time in their history, a result that ranks as both the most stunning shock the tournament has ever seen, while also simply continuing the theme of the greatest group stage ever played at the Women\u2019s World Cup. After all, hadn\u2019t we learned to expect the unexpected?A 1-1 draw against South Korea sealed Germany\u2019s fate, following their dramatic 2-1 defeat to Colombia earlier in Group H. It meant Morocco, making their Women\u2019s World Cup debut, progressed ahead of the side who thrashed them 6-0 in the opening round. The first-ever 32-team Women\u2019s World Cup and the decision to expand from 24 teams has been a resounding triumph: rather than creating a more predictable group stage, it has done the opposite and led to wonderfully chaotic, thrilling tournament football.Germany, Canada and Brazil, all sides ranked in the top 10 in the world, are out, while Jamaica (43rd), South Africa (54th) and Morocco (72nd) are through to the last-16. It can no longer be said that the group stages of the Women\u2019s World Cup are a foregone conclusion and that the tournament only starts when the knockouts begin.New Zealand\u2019s opening victory against Norway set the tone, with Colombia\u2019s last-second win against Germany standing out as the highlight of a tournament that has so far had it all. To add to that, Jamaica reaching the last-16 with their draw against Brazil, Nigeria\u2019s stunning victory against Australia, and South Africa\u2019s dramatic comeback against Italy were all brilliant moments from a group stage that delivered the unpredictability and drama of knockout football.The number of shocks and upsets throughout illustrated that the progress and development of women\u2019s football since the last World Cup has been felt just as much throughout the world than its traditional powers. The gap to the top has closed: the professionalisation of top European leagues and beyond has improved standards at the biggest clubs, and is providing more opportunities to players from across the globe.RecommendedWomen\u2019s World Cup TV schedule: How to watch every match todayWomen\u2019s World Cup golden boot: Who\u2019s leading the top-scorer standings?When do England play next? Women\u2019s World Cup fixtures and route to the finalSeveral countries that do not have a strong domestic league, such as Colombia and Jamaica, instead now feature a core of players who are based in Europe. It means that even if playing conditions are lacking within their national organisations, players such as Colombia and Real Madrid\u2019s Linda Caicedo, Nigeria and Barcelona\u2019s Asisat Oshoala, and Jamaica and Manchester City\u2019s Khadija Shaw are able to raise standards and expectations when they return to their national teams.Germany were stunned after only drawing against South Korea  (Getty Images)Morocco knocked Germany out to advance thanks to a 1-0 win against Colombia  (Getty Images)The level of coaching has also improved, with teams who are not among the traditional powers now confident in setting up organised, defensive structures in order to restrict the attacking talents of their more favoured opponents. The goalkeeping at this World Cup has also taken another huge step forward, which has been proved by player-of-the-match displays from Nigeria\u2019s Chiamaka Nnadozie, Philippines\u2019 Olivia McDaniel, Ireland\u2019s Courtney Brosnan and Jamaica\u2019s Rebecca Spencer. Strong defensive bases have made teams more resilient, and upsets possible.The World Cup needed this, too, and the decision to increase the field to 32 teams has paid off more than anyone expected. There were some fears that the expansion had come too soon, and that certainly would have been the assessment had the seeded teams all coasted through unopposed, as they did in 2019. But that was not the case and there were only a handful of one-sided contests, with the majority of groups going down to the final round, setting the stage for classic World Cup drama.Morocco led the eight teams making their debuts at the World Cup, but most of the others had moments to celebrate. Haiti deserved more from Group D but shone in their display against England. Ireland were also unlucky to only come away with a point, but their performances against Australia and Canada made an impact back home\u00a0and there will be a homecoming parade in Dublin. Portugal were one of the most tactically and technically interesting sides at the tournament and were inches away from knocking out the USA. Philippines and Zambia, who were ultimately a disappointment, both had historic wins and sparked moments of national celebration.The question, and obvious hope before the World Cup, is how those moments inspire further progress and, crucially, investment. Many of the debuting countries did far more than that at their first World Cup, offering competitive performances, and they can look at how Jamaica and South Africa have battled against the odds to improve from four years ago. Both Jamaica and South Africa lost every game when they made their debuts in France, but have now advanced to the knockout stages four years later.South Africa reached the last-16 with their first ever Women\u2019s World Cup win  (Getty Images)But what also makes Jamaica and South Africa\u2019s success even more remarkable is what they have had to overcome. Their success is owed to the players and the work of their immediate support staff, and that alone. Along with Nigeria, they have reached the knockout stages despite their federations, not because of them.Before the World Cup, Jamaica\u2019s players said their preparations for the tournament had been disrupted by a lack of financial support, planning and communication from the Jamaica Football Federation. They went public with their grievances in an open letter to the JFF, where they expressed their \u201cutmost disappointment\u201d that training camps and warm-up fixtures had not been organised before the World Cup.At the same time, Jamaica have relied on two separate crowdfunding campaigns to help cover the costs of their travel to Australia and New Zealand. After their historic qualification to the 2019 World Cup, which was also supported by crowdfunding campaigns, led by Cedella Marley, the daughter of Bob Marley, it felt like Jamaica were back to square one as the progress they had fought for off the field had not been matched by meaningful change off it.Yet the response of the players has been to aim higher and further, despite the lack of support or respect they have been shown. After knocking out Brazil, Jamaica\u2019s progress was hailed as \u201cundoubtedly the proudest moment in Jamaica\u2019s football history\u201d by the country\u2019s sports minister Olivia Grange. However, it should also come as a moment of huge embarrassment to the country\u2019s federation, with Jamaica\u2019s success actually creating a spotlight for the lack of support they have received. \u201cWe put the dispute to bed for the tournament but the better we do, the more pressure it creates,\u201d said Jamaica\u2019s goalkeeper Rebecca Spencer after keeping a famous clean sheet against Brazil. \"We hope they\u2019re looking at us and do what they should be doing.\"Jamaica\u2019s fight at the World Cup has come both on and off the field  (Getty Images)The federations of South Africa and Nigeria are under the same spotlight. South Africa\u2019s first-ever World Cup win against Italy to seal their spot in the last-16 capped a stunning turnaround after their players went on strike before the tournament, boycotting their final warm-up game against Botswana over bonus payments and player contracts.The dispute centred around Fifa\u2019s prize money for the World Cup and a guarantee that it would be distributed to the players. Before the World Cup, Fifa announced an increase in its total prize money to $152m (\u00a3126m), which included a payment of \u00a330,000 (\u00a324,000) for each player at the tournament. For the players representing South Africa and Nigeria, that is set to double after reaching the last-16, a life-changing sum, but the prize money will only be distributed to the players by the federations, it does not mean players are guaranteed to receive it.RecommendedWomen\u2019s World Cup LIVE: Latest news and updates as England prepare for last-16Zambia Women\u2019s coach accused of rubbing player\u2019s chest at World CupBrazil and Marta exit World Cup as Jamaica makes historyIt created uncertainty for South Africa, who only reached an agreement with their federation that their money would be released days before the tournament. The picture looks less certain for Nigeria, who were locked in their own pay dispute with the federation before the World Cup. Nigeria\u2019s head coach Randy Waldrum has said he hasn\u2019t been paid in seven months, and that some players had not been paid in two years. After Nigeria stunned Australia in the group stages, former England and Arsenal striker Ian Wright simply tweeted: \u201cPay them\u201d.There may be people within some of the federations who point to the success stories of the Women\u2019s World Cup as evidence that developments in the game are creating an equal playing field, and that further financial support is not merited. The reality and the lesson throughout this brilliant group stage is that if this is what can be achieved despite the lack of support, imagine what could be done if there was. With that in mind, there is no reason why any team inside the top-50 in the world shouldn\u2019t be capable of the same if the right foundations are built.\u00a0 For now, those teams who have stunned the World Cup and remain at the tournament can continue to show why it was wrong not to support them before their unexpected success."}, {"_id": "64cceb0851ac3352961fa92b", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/axel-disasi-chelsea-transfer-monaco-pochettino-b2387598.html", "primaryCategory": "Football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Chelsea confirm Axel Disasi signing to cure defensive woes", "lead": "<p>Disasi has signed a six-year deal after joining from Monaco </p>", "author": "Pa Sport Staff", "datePublished": "2023-08-04 09:32:33", "dateScraped": "2023-08-04 14:11:52.267671", "dateUpdated": "2023-08-04T09:32:33+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/08/04/10/14ae2905984ed89cf95f2825caba5917Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjkxMjI1MTgy-2.73090397.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Miguel Delaney\u2019s Reading the Game newsletter sent straight to your inbox for freeSign up to Miguel\u2019s Delaney\u2019s free weekly newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeWhen it was confirmed in mid-July that Wesley Fofana would face a significant period on the sidelines owing to an ACL injury, Chelsea started to be linked with a host of centre-backs to replace the Frenchman. Harry Maguire was a reported target, so too was Blues academy product Marc Guehi.However, Chelsea have now confirmed the signing from Monaco of towering France international Axel Disasi. The 25-year-old has been on Premier League radars in recent months, with Manchester United and Newcastle both credited with an interest in the Gonesse-born centre-back. Chelsea have since taken the plunge on the defender, bringing him in on a six-year deal for \u20ac45m.That in itself serves to highlight the extent of Fofana's injury, but even so; Chelsea couldn't afford to pass up the chance to secure Disasi's services. Even with his compatriot available, Mauricio Pochettino's top-quality options at the heart of the defence are thin on the ground.Levi Colwill, who is set to pen a new deal at Stamford Bridge, should go on to become a mainstay in the Blues backline, but a partner for the 20-year-old was key. Trevoh Chalobah isn't quite of the standard expected for a club seeking to return to the Champions League, while the west London outfit can't rely on 38-year-old Thiago Silva to manage the backline for another season, particularly in a four-man defence. Benoit Badiashile will return sooner rather than later, but he'll need some time to get up to speed under Pochettino having missed much of pre-season due to a hamstring issue.RecommendedChelsea and Barcelona push for Kylian Mbappe player-plus-cash transfer dealsFootball rumours: Tottenham name Harry Kane price as Bayern Munich prepare bidChelsea have a Conor Gallagher problem and Tottenham could be the perfect solutionFor the right-sided centre-back role, Disasi can be viewed as a superb acquisition. Standing at 6ft 3in, the France international maximises his stature having won the second most aerial duels (97) of defenders in Ligue 1 last season. And he was consistent in beating opponents in headed battles, too. Of the 143 players to contest 50 or more aerial duels, Disasi's aerial success rate of 70.3% ranked ninth in the division.Considering Chelsea returned an aerial success rate of just 52.1% last season, Disasi's dominance in the air will certainly boost that return. There's also a willingness to get the ball forward quickly from deep. Not only did Chelsea struggle for goals last season, hitting the back of the net 38 times in the Premier League, but they were compounded by an inability to put an opponent to the sword at speed.Disasi has played 99 league games for Monaco across three seasons (Getty Images)No team scored fewer counter-attacking goals than Chelsea (1) in England's top tier last term, and even that came in a 4-1 defeat at Manchester United back in May. Disasi, though, is one willing to pick a pass from range, and does so to a decent standard to help quickly turn defence into attack. Indeed, 141 accurate long balls ranked 14th of outfield players in France's top tier last term, and this in itself played a part in Monaco scoring seven counter-attacking goals; only champions PSG (10) netted more.Dominant in the air and sound with the ball at his feet, Disasi seems the perfect fit for a Chelsea side that will seek to control matches where possible. Another key reason behind the drive to sign Disasi, though, will have been his versatility. Primarily a centre-back, he\u2019ll line up at the heart of the defence with everyone fit in Pochettino's 4-2-3-1 setup, but players who can operate in multiple positions are a precious commodity in the modern game.As such, Disasi's ability to play at right-back as well as centre-back will have been another reason behind Chelsea's interest. The departure of Cesar Azpilicueta over the summer means the Blues needed another defender to operate in a couple of roles, and a defensive-minded right-back is a handy squad option. Pochettino has also previously used a three-man backline during his time at Tottenham, a system that does suit the full-backs at his disposal, so the ability to switch between two formations is ideal.The 25-year-old featured for France in the Qatar World Cup (Getty Images)RecommendedChelsea confirm Axel Disasi signing to cure defensive woesChelsea agree fee with Monaco for France international defender Axel DisasiWatch England train ahead of Women\u2019s World Cup last 16 clash with NigeriaDisasi's flexibility will help Pochettino's decision making when it comes to tinkering with his side, particularly in-play, and it cannot be overstated how important this positional interchangeability is for Chelsea. Given how often managers tinker with their setup across the 90 minutes, the potential ability to swap between a four-man and a three-man defence will aid the Blues, not just on a week-by-week basis, but across the season.There are concerns over the defensive side to his game, particularly when up against direct attackers in one-on-one situations, yet from an offensive perspective; Disasi will benefit Chelsea. Given the right protection in front of him, Disasi should be given the crucial time on the ball to help set the Blues on the front foot. Alongside ball-playing star-in-the-making Colwill, Chelsea will have a solid centre-back foundation to help in their quest to return to the Champions\u00a0League."}, {"_id": "64cceb0951ac3352961fa92d", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/alberta-ontario-victoria-calgary-edmonton-b2387612.html", "primaryCategory": "Sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "The key questions answered as the Commonwealth Games suffers latest setback", "lead": "The government of Alberta has announced a halt to its attempt to bring the 2030 event to cities Calgary and Edmonton.", "author": "Pa Sport Staff", "datePublished": "2023-08-04 09:26:55", "dateScraped": "2023-08-04 14:11:53.132970", "dateUpdated": "2023-08-04T09:26:55+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/08/04/10/929ab8d6c736254429b8965bd09fd2d0Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjkxMjI1MTQw-2.35942398.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free sport newsletter for all the latest news on everything from cycling to boxingSign up to our free sport email for all the latest news\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeAlberta has given the Commonwealth Games its latest setback after the Canadian province pulled the plug on a possible bid to stage the 2030 event.Here, the PA news agency takes a closer look at the key issues in this story.What has happened?Just a couple of weeks on from the Australian state of Victoria abruptly withdrawing as hosts for the 2026 Commonwealth Games citing rising costs, the government of Alberta announced a halt to its attempt to bring the 2030 event to cities Calgary and Edmonton.Alberta\u2019s Tourism and Sport Minister Joseph Schow has baulked at an estimated price tag of up to \u00a31.57billion, a bill which he says would have been landed largely at the feet of the taxpayers.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveHow bad is this latest news?Alberta had not been awarded the Games, merely mulling over whether to submit an offer, whereas the Commonwealth Games Federation is scrambling to find a replacement for Victoria in three years\u2019 time.But Alberta stepping away comes a few months after Hamilton, Ontario \u2013 which hosted the inaugural Games in 1930 \u2013 suspended its effort for a centenary event because of a lack of government support.Right now, the Commonwealth Games has no host for 2026, one fewer suitor in a shallow pool of choices for 2030, while its overall viability and relevance in the modern world is coming under increasing scrutiny.What can be done to entice bidders?Organisers have attempted to provide hosts with flexibility to keep costs down, while the CGF is keen to work with international sports federations on providing a global showcase for their new innovations.Birmingham 2022 broke new ground with the introduction of 3\u00d73 basketball, with T20 women\u2019s cricket also making its debut at a multi-sport event and setting world attendance records.Is staging the Commonwealth Games too costly?The costs set out by Victoria of up to \u00a33.6bn, if correct, are eye-watering and way above the cost of staging Birmingham 2022 \u2013 put at \u00a3778million by the British Government, which is just over half of what put Alberta off.However, the CGF argues Victoria\u2019s approach to hosting was a factor in some of those costs. It chose, for example, not to use existing sports facilities in Melbourne in favour of developing temporary sites in the regional state hubs it planned to use for the Games.Victoria was the first Games host that was able to benefit from a new CGF hosting \u2018roadmap\u2019 which, among other things, reduced the number of compulsory sports from 16 to two and removed the requirement to provide a bespoke athletes\u2019 village.The British Government and Birmingham City Council would disagree that staging a Games has to be a money pit.An independent report published in January this year said Birmingham 2022 had contributed \u00a3870.7m to the UK economy, with over half the economic impact generated (\u00a3453.7million) benefiting businesses and communities across the West Midlands.Who could host in 2026?CGF chief executive Katie Sadleir said last month all options will be considered, including the UK.\u201cThe UK are fantastic hosts and we would be very open to having a conversation with them about it, if that\u2019s something they would be interested in doing,\u201d she told the PA news agency.UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak\u2019s official spokesman said he hoped a \u201cviable solution\u201d could be found for Australia to host the Games.

The Matildas needed to win to ensure their spot in the last-16 and, despite captain Sam Kerr still being injured, they swept the Canadians aside and dumped them out of the tournament. Another giant killing saw Jamaica hold Brazil at bay for a 0-0 draw and ensured they edged into the last-16 where they now face Colombia.Follow along for the latest news and updates from the Women\u2019s World Cup:RecommendedHow the Women\u2019s World Cup delivered its greatest ever group stage \u2014 against all the oddsZambia Women\u2019s coach accused of rubbing player\u2019s chest at World Cup\u2018Resilient\u2019 Jamaica create World Cup history as Brazil and Marta exitWomens\u2019 World Cup 2023 - Latest newsFollow along for the lastest news and updates from the Women\u2019s World CupLionesses prepare for last-16 tie against NigeriaGermany dumped out of World Cup in the group stagesWhen do England play next?

Portugal\u2019s Ana Capeta, brought on in stoppage time, came within the width of a post from sending the two-time defending champions crashing out of the tournament. If that\u2019s how close the USA came to a first World Cup defeat since 2015, it\u2019s a clear indication of how fragile their dominance appears to be. After only scraping through Group E as runners-up and with Sweden, who thrashed the USA at the Olympics two years ago, likely to be next in the last-16, there is little confidence that this is the same side who entered the tournament as favourites.Had Captea\u2019s shot caught the inside of the post then the World Cup would have staged its biggest shock yet, with the dethroning of the four-time winners. Yet, even though Capeta\u2019s strike agonisingly rebounded out, the nerves at the end as the USA survived only confirmed what many thought ahead of the World Cup. After draws against the Netherlands and Portugal, the first time the USA have ever failed to win two games in the World Cup group stage, it is clear that the gap between the defending champions and the rest of the world has closed.USA\u2019s narrow escape spells the end of Women\u2019s World Cup dominancePortugal 0-0 USA: The defending champions were the width of the post away from crashing out of the World Cup Mike Jones4 August 2023 13:001691149851Carli Lloyd slams former teammates as USA almost crash out of Women\u2019s World CupFormer United States women\u2019s national team player Carli Lloyd labelled USA\u2019s performance against Portugal \u201clacklustre\u201d and \u201cuninspiring\u201d as they almost crashed out of the World Cup in the group stages.The defending champions needed to avoid defeat but were inches away from elimination when Portugal substitute Ana Capeta struck the post in stoppage time.The USA held on to scrape a 0-0 draw, enough to secure progress to the last-16 while knocking Portugal out, but the four-time winners missed out on top spot in Group E with Lloyd highly critical of the display from her former side.Carli Lloyd slams former teammates as USA almost crash out of Women\u2019s World CupThe USA held on to scrape a 0-0 draw against Portugal with the four-time winners missing out on top spot in Group EMike Jones4 August 2023 12:501691149431Women\u2019s World Cup 2023: USA\u2019s route to the finalWhat is the USA\u2019s potential path to the final?

To add to that, Jamaica reaching the last-16 with their draw against Brazil, Nigeria\u2019s stunning victory against Australia, and South Africa\u2019s dramatic comeback against Italy were all brilliant moments from a group stage that delivered the unpredictability and drama of knockout football.The number of shocks and upsets throughout illustrated that the progress and development of women\u2019s football since the last World Cup has been felt just as much throughout the world than its traditional powers.

Ukad told reporters: \u201cUkad notes that Mr Benn has made further public comments today regarding proceedings before the independent National Anti-Doping Panel.

It is definitely one with a lot of anticipation and we\u2019re all excited. I am definitely excited.\u201cIt is definitely a step up, physically it is a step up. The difficult thing is how you compare because we dominated so many games in League One so physically they are not as demanding as games in the Championship.\u201cEveryone has the typical Champ game references when you watch Championship football and it comes around a lot.\u201cBut I think with Ipswich, after Burnley last year, we will try to be the exception where you are not saying that.\u201cWe want to play out from the back, play good football, be entertaining, so it will be a challenge but the players we have got are all looking forward to it.\u201dAustralia international Luongo is delighted to be established at a club for the start of this season after enduring a difficult time last summer.Luongo had to wait until September to find a new club before he failed to make an appearance during his short stint at Middlesbrough and had largely \u201cwritten off the season\u201d when Ipswich registered their interest before January.The lure of being managed by ex-Tottenham Under-18s boss McKenna, after crossing paths at Spurs, helped the 30-year-old get over a largely disappointing 2022 to become a key figure for Ipswich and he netted in the 6-0 victory over Exeter that clinched promotion in April.\u201cWith Ipswich there was some history there, I enjoyed it last time and probably the manager was the biggest pull. I came across him a little bit at Tottenham and over my career he kept track of me. I had also heard a lot of good things,\u201d Luongo said.\u201cWhat is striking for me is his detail in how he wants to play. On the pitch, the detail is at a really, really high level, like the information we receive and the feedback we receive from the coaches.\n\nWe want to play out from the back, play good football, be entertaining, so it will be a challenge but the players we have got are all looking forward to it.Ipswich midfielder Massimo Luongo\u201cAnd the way he conducts himself. He is in early, watches every second of training and loves football, I feel like he watches every single game because he pulls out games like that.\u201cHis knowledge of modern football is really good and he is obsessed with football to be honest. That bleeds into the team and we can all see it.\u201cYou can tell he loves football, is obsessed with it and wants to improve as a coach and manager so you can imagine what he wants for us and demands from us.\u201cI enjoy coming in every day, for sure. The coaching staff and him have definitely created an atmosphere where we are firstly humble.\u201cWe don\u2019t leave any stone unturned, it doesn\u2019t matter who we play against. Then when we win, stay humble and when we lose, don\u2019t get too low.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeIt is a team from another time, a glimpse of Arsenal\u2019s post-Wenger identity crisis and Mikel Arteta\u2019s decidedly imperfect inheritance. There are David Luiz and Shkodran Mustafi, Dani Ceballos and Ainsley Maitland-Niles, Alexandre Lacazette and Nicolas Pepe. They assume a greater pertinence now, and not merely as signs of the transformation of a side in three years.They remain the only Arteta side to beat Pep Guardiola\u2019s Manchester City, 2-0 in the 2020 FA Cup semi-final, courtesy of a brace from Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. Now, as Arteta\u2019s current and former clubs prepare to meet at Wembley again, this time in the Community Shield, there is the probability that the Arsenal starting 11 will feature no survivors of one of the manager\u2019s first major wins. Perhaps Kieran Tierney but Granit Xhaka, the last regular in Arteta\u2019s strongest side, was sold in the summer.And while Emi Martinez left Arsenal and went on to lift the World Cup, few of the others have experienced better times since Arteta\u2019s FA Cup win.Since that deceptively good start, the apprentice has begun to pose more of a threat to the master: in the bigger picture, anyway. Arsenal topped the Premier League for 248 days last season; their return of 50 points at the halfway stage put them on course, albeit briefly, to equal City\u2019s record of 100. There was the danger that Guardiola had taught Arteta just too well.And yet the season ended with Guardiola having done different kinds of hat-tricks. There was the treble of trophies. There were also three wins over Arteta: 1-0 against a weakened Arsenal side in the FA Cup and, more emphatically and more importantly, 3-1 and 4-1 in the Premier League. It extended an increasingly impressive record in their private battles: the older man now has an 88 per cent win rate and eight victories against his old assistant.RecommendedEddie Nketiah ready to step up again after Gabriel Jesus\u2019 injuryArsenal striker Gabriel Jesus to miss start of season after knee surgeryArsenal transfer news: Raya, Balogun, Kudus, Pepe and moreAmong managers Guardiola has faced at least nine times, he only has a better record against Sean Dyche, Eddie Howe and Graham Potter, and the majority of those games came when they coached bottom-half teams, not supposed peers.Beating Guardiola over 38 games can entail beating him in two. Thus far this year, Arteta has another kind of triumph: he beat Guardiola to Declan Rice; Arsenal\u2019s prime target attracted City\u2019s attention and yet preferred the capital. Rewind three decades and the most coveted young midfielder outside the title contenders was courted by the top two, rejected Kenny Dalglish and Blackburn after a volte-face and signed for Sir Alex Ferguson and Manchester United.Which isn\u2019t to say Rice is necessarily the next Roy Keane. But if Arteta spent last summer signing City\u2019s squad players, in Gabriel Jesus and Oleksandr Zinchenko, pipping them to one of their targets felt they were conducting transfer business at another level.For City, Rice\u2019s decision may have been a sign Arsenal are here to stay, that last season was not a one-off. It shapes the possibility that Arteta against Guardiola is the division\u2019s new defining rivalry. (Getty Images)If so, it would be the third to involve the Catalan, though the first, and most hyped, actually proved less compelling and enduring than the second.Guardiola against Jose Mourinho was a battle of ideas that the Catalan won and, even when the Portuguese won twice in charge of Tottenham, had lost some of its lustre. The knockout blow had already been struck as the ball was caressed around Guardiola\u2019s midfields. Mourinho has the second most wins against Guardiola \u2013 seven \u2013 while coming off second-best in their feud.Guardiola against Jurgen Klopp had epic status for at least four seasons, between 2017-20 and then 2021-22. Twice they were only separated by a solitary point at the top of the table. Once, Liverpool knocked City out of the Champions League. Once, they knocked them off their perch as champions of England.The overall score stands at 8-7 to Klopp in one respect, with more victories in their meetings in this country, and 5-1 to Guardiola in another: they have shared the last six Premier League titles, but not equally. (Getty Images)Liverpool\u2019s second underwhelming campaign in three, albeit for different reasons in 2022-23 to 2020-21, prompts the question if, like Ferguson against Arsene Wenger, a previously even contest will become more one-sided and if this is a rivalry whose best days are in the past.RecommendedOn this day in 2020: Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang leads Arsenal to FA Cup gloryStatue of former Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger unveiled outside Emirates StadiumArsenal\u2019s Folarin Balogun set for Serie A move as Italian giants spark bidding warThen there is the emerging rival in Arteta, lacking Klopp\u2019s record of defeating Guardiola \u2013 something the German still did twice last season, including in the Community Shield \u2013 but with the more recent title challengers and the transfer business that has the stamp of ambition.Not every manager who runs Guardiola closest proves capable of overhauling him. Mourinho did in Spain, after finishing runners-up in LaLiga with Real Madrid. When his Manchester United came second, however, he was sacked by the end of the calendar year. The same fate befell Ole Gunnar Solskjaer three years later. If Arteta seems to have more staying power, as Klopp did before him, the next challenge is to overcome Guardiola over both 90 minutes and nine months."}, {"_id": "64cceb0b51ac3352961fa936", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/boxing/anthony-joshua-tyson-fury-francis-ngannou-mma-b2387362.html", "primaryCategory": "Boxing", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018We will all forget about it\u2019 \u2013 Anthony Joshua reacts to Tyson Fury fighting MMA star", "lead": "<p>Heavyweight champion Fury will face Francis Ngannou in Saudi Arabia this autumn rather than fighting a recognised boxer </p>", "author": "David Charlesworth", "datePublished": "2023-08-04 07:03:42", "dateScraped": "2023-08-04 14:11:55.786787", "dateUpdated": "2023-08-04T07:03:42+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/08/03/22/14162211-7373d664-673e-4a94-ba9a-837daed5dede.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free sport newsletter for all the latest news on everything from cycling to boxingSign up to our free sport email for all the latest news\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeRaise your hand if you thought Jake Paul\u2019s boxing venture had come to an end with his loss to Tommy Fury in February. It\u2019s okay, you don\u2019t look silly; you weren\u2019t the only one. So, go on: Raise that hand, nod your head, or let out a sigh. You don\u2019t have to carry the burden anymore.Many believed that fight marked the endgame of this particular endeavour, even before it had played out. A win would have allowed the YouTube star, 26, to say he had beaten a professional boxer, after several wins against mixed martial artists; a loss would have signalled the dissipation of any momentum and intrigue that the American had built over the last few years.Except even in defeat by Fury \u2013 a points loss to the half-brother of world heavyweight champion Tyson \u2013 a degree of intrigue has remained, though Paul\u2019s momentum did indeed take a hit. In the lead-up to that bout in Saudi Arabia, Paul had already hinted that his next challenge could be a boxing match with Nate Diaz, who left the UFC with the most unique of legacies in September. Paul\u2019s plan, of course, was to defeat Fury, stay unbeaten, then move on to face Diaz, but the master promoter has managed to stay on track in spite of his loss. In Dallas this Saturday, Paul will take on Diaz in another fight that will be deemed a circus act but that will nonetheless attract a significant audience.RecommendedJake Paul vs Nate Diaz live stream: How to watch fight online and on TV this weekendNate Diaz reveals \u2018secret\u2019 that he and Jake Paul shareThe hidden side of Jake PaulThis time, it could be argued, Diaz is doing the heavy lifting, which may sound ironic given the American\u2019s trademark apathy in the run-up to the fight. That\u2019s because the focus of this Jake Paul fight is different than the focus of the last Jake Paul fight. When Paul fought Fury, the narrative centred on whether the divisive social-media star could actually beat a \u2018proper boxer\u2019, even though Fury\u2019s pedigree does not line up with his lineage. That question, which had existed for years, was finally answered in Diriyah, leaving Paul\u2019s detractors delighted. Now, though, it is not about how Paul will fare; the intrigue surrounds Diaz, and it comes from the MMA community.This does actually provide a familiar feeling around a Paul fight, if not his bout with Fury. In previous outings, Paul knocked out ex-UFC champion Tyron Woodley after outpointing him in their first fight; he knocked out Ben Askren, who was an MMA champion before joining the UFC, and he beat the consensus greatest MMA striker of all time \u2013 Anderson Silva \u2013 via decision. Each opponent was willed by MMA fans to stop this \u2018pretender\u2019, Paul, from making a mockery of their preferred sport, even though Paul\u2019s success against these athletes said very little about MMA and how the YouTuber would fare in a cage fight. Paul, left, knocked down Tommy Fury late in their fight but lost on points  (AP)Even so, MMA fans feel similarly about Diaz\u2019s contest with Paul, and perhaps even more strongly, such is the adoration that most have for the 38-year-old. Silva, too, is adored by the community, while Askren and Woodley are divisive in their own ways but command respect nonetheless. Yet they all failed against Paul. There were asterisks, admittedly: Silva was 47, while Askren and Woodley are ageing wrestlers. Askren had even retired from competition and Woodley was on a brutal losing streak.So, how does Diaz compare? The welterweight\u2019s record has always been mixed, with the American becoming a fan favourite for his personality, soundbites and style, rather than for any significant winning streak or title triumph. The Californian\u2019s jiu-jitsu is his greatest asset, though his cardio and volume striking have aided him significantly. In 2016, when he stepped in at late notice and submitted Conor McGregor, Diaz achieved mainstream popularity. When he narrowly lost the pair\u2019s highly-anticipated rematch five months later, his star hardly fell. His octagon outings have been sporadic in the years since: an impressive points win against ex-lightweight champion Anthony Pettis in August 2019, a TKO loss to Jorge Masvidal three months later \u2013 when Diaz\u2019s so-often-leaky blood betrayed him and forced a doctor stoppage \u2013 and a decision defeat by soon-to-be welterweight champion Leon Edwards in 2021. Then, of course, came his fitting UFC exit on the night he submitted Tony Ferguson. A key reason for Diaz\u2019s decision to leave the UFC was a dispute over his pay \u2013 the same issue that many fighters have raised in recent years, but one that Diaz had additional ammo to combat, given his pulling power. Even so, he didn\u2019t make much of a dent in the UFC\u2019s armour, and the option of a clash with Paul made too much sense to ignore.Diaz, right, after beating Tony Ferguson in September 2022  (@UFC via Instagram)That is, in a monetary sense at least. In other regards, this is a dangerous proposition. Diaz is 12 years Paul\u2019s senior, and while his boxing fundamentals are solid, he is not known as an out-and-out striker. Furthermore, he is especially prone to suffering cuts, which cost him against Masvidal \u2013 although he was admittedly losing that fight anyway. It may yet cost him against Paul. Many MMA fans fear an unceremonious end for Diaz in this fight, much as the veteran is known for his perseverance. Maybe such an end will not come via the sort of one-punch KO that ruined Woodley, but maybe it will come courtesy of a doctor deeming Diaz unfit to continue.

MMA fighters don\u2019t know this, but the thing about that is: I\u2019m in on the same secret, and I\u2019ve been in on that since I was 15. I\u2019m not your average wrestler, MMA fighter. When these guys he fought were in the wrestling room at five, six, seven, 10, 15 years old, I was boxing the whole neighbourhood, boxing every pro I could find.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeDouble World Cup-winning coach Jill Ellis confesses even she is blown away by the utter unpredictability of the 2023 tournament, which has already seen six top-20 sides bow out at the group stage.The most shocking of those upsets came on Thursday night, when world number two Germany were dumped from Group H after never failing to reach the quarter-finals in eight previous tournaments.Counter to the disappointed faces of the two-time champions were those of group rivals and debutants Morocco who, in a viral clip, huddled around a phone on the pitch before erupting in elation after learning their world number 72 side had made it to the knockouts.\u201cIt\u2019s been a doozy so far,\u201d said Ellis, who guided the USA to back-to-back titles in 2015 and 2019 and now heads the tournament\u2019s technical study group.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow live\u201cI think we all feel this. Gone are the days of total predictability. Progress sits very clearly at the core, and certainly the competitiveness can be felt [with] giants in the game getting knocked out, we see debutants advance to the next round, which I think lends itself to this being just one of the most unpredictable and arguably exciting World Cups we\u2019ve seen to date.\u201cIf I\u2019m candid, I really am surprised. I think when you suddenly see a Germany or a Brazil get knocked out of a World Cup in group stage.\u201cI don\u2019t think any of us could have predicted that. I\u2019m excited by the development, of course, for sure. But I think I was thinking that one more iteration of the World Cup before we started to see even more parity that we\u2019re starting to see right now.\u201dOlympic champions Canada (seventh) and Brazil (eighth) were the other two top-10 sides to be sent packing after the group stage, joining China (14th), Italy (16th) and South Korea (17th) amongst some of the world\u2019s top-ranked teams eliminated.For the first time, three African nations \u2013 Morocco, Nigeria and South Africa \u2013 all advanced to the knockouts, while Jamaica made history by reaching the last-16 for the first time, despite an ongoing dispute with their federation over pay, resources and conditions that resulted in players airing their grievances in an open letter on social media before the World Cup.Nigeria and South Africa are among other qualifying nations who were involved in pre-tournament disputes with their respective federations \u2013 a group that also includes England, who have vowed to fully focus on winning a first World Cup before resuming discussions with the Football Association over bonus payments and commercial structures.Each nation competing at this World Cup also received US $960,000 (\u00a3753,830) to exclusively cover preparation costs.While some sides seem to be defying the odds, Ellis and her expert panel have pointed overall to a clear correlation between investment and resourcing and performance.The Royal Moroccan Football Federation, for example, has significantly invested in girls\u2019 and women\u2019s football since a system overhaul in 2009, and six years ago created a women\u2019s football academy where players have access to the same facilities as the men\u2019s national team.Ellis said: \u201cI was blown away by the facility. It\u2019s one of the nicest I\u2019ve ever seen, and it just kind of made me realise that yes, there are federations that are taking this very seriously.\u201dFIFA\u2019s data after the group stage also reflect an increasingly competitive pool.

In those key positions you need to have depth, three players who can play in that position,\u201d Borthwick said.RecommendedMarcus Smith given last chance to shine in England shirt ahead of Rugby World CupDylan Hartley backs Owen Farrell as England\u2019s fly-half for World CupEngland handed huge Rugby World Cup boost with Ollie Chessum news\u201cWith the number of cards that are issued and HIAs, you need to have depth for those specialist positions.\u201cIf someone does take a head knock you are looking at 12 days out potentially and could miss two Test matches.\u201cYou need to be protected and have the right amount of depth in those specialist positions, which means positional flexibility is really important in your 33.\u201dNow destined to play in his first World Cup as part of England\u2019s creative brains trust, Smith can approach Saturday\u2019s first of four warm-up Tests unburdened by the need to convince Borthwick that he must be involved this autumn.Farrell and Ford are more experienced and provide expert game management, but the 24-year-old Harlequins ringmaster offers the type of running threat that can turn a match on its head.\u201cI rate Marcus exceptionally highly. He has an incredible skill set and an ability to find space. He recognises when there are defenders that he can pick off,\u201d Borthwick said.\u201cHe can either pull them out of the line and put other people through space or find space himself.\u201cI\u2019ve been hugely impressed with Marcus throughout this camp but also in all my interactions with him.\u201cHe\u2019s a young man who has already achieved a lot in the game, but he\u2019s got even more exciting things to achieve in the future.\u201dSmith\u2019s last start at fly-half came during a heavy defeat by France in the Six Nations, a tournament that saw him swap in and out of the role with Farrell. He was among a number of players to struggle that day \u2013 and he has not forgotten.\u201cFrance was a long time ago now and I\u2019ve played a lot of rugby since then,\u201d Smith said.\u201cIt was a tough afternoon and I have learnt a lot of lessons. It has definitely put me in a much better position as a person and on the field as well as a player.\u201cI would not say I want to rectify it, but I am a very competitive person\u2026\u201dDanny Care joins Smith at half-back for the visit to the Welsh capital and with no players from Premiership finalists Saracens and Sale present in the starting XV, the side is littered with fringe World Cup contenders.Ellis Genge captains the team but apart from Care it is an inexperienced line-up that sees fast-rising Northampton flanker Tom Pearson make his debut at openside, with Theo Dan and Tom Willis poised to win their first caps off the bench.Borthwick and his coaching assistants will hold their final selection meeting on Saturday night before each player is told the following day whether they have made the cut.\u201cOut of the 33, the vast majority of those positions we are pretty firm on where we are. There is always a few that are written in pencil, as it were,\u201d Borthwick said.\u201cThe players are very clear about where they stand, where they are in the rankings of their position and what they need to do to earn their place in the 33.\u201dBorthwick\u2019s squad were given a talk by England football coach Gareth Southgate during their World Cup training camp.RecommendedEngland coach Tom Harrison: Rugby passion helped overcome dyslexia challengesBen Earl commends England coach Steve Borthwick\u2019s tactful approach with squadMarcus Smith teased by England team-mates over Racing 92 speculation\u201cGareth\u2019s got such a vast experience of tournaments as a player and in management.

They have been friends for a while and it will stay the same.\u201dBoth Rangers and Celtic have overseen summers of change, with Allan McGregor, Ryan Kent and Alfredo Morelos among those to move on from Ibrox, while nine players have come in, Los Angeles\u2019 Jose Cifuentes the most recent acquisition.Celtic, meanwhile, saw Ange Postecoglou move down south to take charge of Tottenham in June and ex-boss Rodgers return for his second spell at Parkhead.Rangers begin their league campaign with a trip to Kilmarnock on Saturday night while Celtic kick off with the lunchtime visit of Ross County.\u201cThis is the first year in a long, long time where I genuinely don\u2019t know who wins it,\u201d McCoist admitted.\u201cCeltic have lost one or two, lost Jota but I wouldn\u2019t say Brendan left under a cloud. I think there was a section of the Celtic support who weren\u2019t happy because he left at that time and went Leicester and I get that, but you can\u2019t please everyone all the time.\u201cOne thing that is undeniable is that he is an excellent coach and knows how to set up a team.

Didn\u2019t look good in the first half against Hoffenheim and then looked great in the second half against Hoffenheim.\u201cSo, I don\u2019t really know but of course Rangers and Celtic have got to hit the ground running, particularly Rangers with the (Champions League) qualifier coming up.RecommendedMarcus Smith set for World Cup spot with Steve Borthwick keen on fly-half depthJonny Bairstow ready for next test after ankle \u2018held up really well\u2019 in AshesChelsea agree deal with Brighton to sign goalkeeper Robert Sanchez\u201cIt is a tough one to call.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeAfter keeping wicket in the Ashes, Jonny Bairstow was left confident that his ankle will hold up to the gruelling schedule ahead of the World Cup in October.Ahead of the international summer, Bairstow was awarded the gloves in place of specialist wicketkeeper Ben Foakes, as his abilities with bat in hand during the first Bazball summer in 2022 earned him a place in the XI.In September 2022, Bairstow suffered a freak injury, a horrific leg break on the golf course, but just nine months later he had returned to the Test fold and with the additional stress on the body of keeping wicket.He hit out at critics of his keeping during the third Test match at Old Trafford, calling some of the comments arguing for Foakes\u2019 return \u201cout of order\u201d.But Bairstow was left pleased with how his body held up throughout the series, although when focus shifts to the white ball format, it will be a new challenge when he takes his role in the field and as a specialist batter.RecommendedMoeen Ali reveals reasons behind answering Ben Stokes\u2019 \u2018daunting\u2019 Ashes pleaChris Woakes reveals the gamble that paid off to be named player of the AshesBrendon McCullum details how England refined Bazball during \u2018heavyweight fight\u2019 of Ashes\u201cI feel good.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeWarren Gatland has backed Wales to do \u201csomething pretty special\u201d at the World Cup in France.Wales face England in their opening tournament warm-up game on Saturday after winning just two of the last 10 Tests.A miserable Six Nations campaign produced a fifth-placed finish, while player contracts, financial issues throughout Welsh professional rugby and the threat of a players\u2019 strike significantly compounded matters.Wales have also dropped to ninth in World Rugby\u2019s official rankings and seen talismanic figures like Alun Wyn Jones, Justin Tipuric and Rhys Webb all retire from international rugby since the end of last season.Head coach Gatland, though, has delivered an upbeat message ahead of Wales\u2019 preparation games against England home and away, plus South Africa, before a tough World Cup opener against Fiji in Bordeaux on September 10.RecommendedJac Morgan leads Wales against England as Warren Gatland ponders captain optionsWorld Cup is \u2018more important this time\u2019 for Wales \u2013 Mike PhillipsJac Morgan to captain Wales in World Cup warm-up clash with EnglandAsked if he relished Wales being written off, Gatland said: \u201cYeah. Continue to do it because it\u2019s only going to make us stronger.\u201cI am really excited. I\u2019m telling you this team will do something pretty special.\n\nI promise you now, we will surprise some peopleWarren Gatland\u201cI think if I look back on the Six Nations and all the things that were going on, I probably needed to let things unfold a bit and not be as direct or demanding as I might have normally been.\u201cThe fact that things have settled down and a lot of new players have come in, the way that we\u2019ve been so much more accountable for how we do things and demanding standards, that has been brilliant.\u201cAs a group, we are in a good place. I promise you now, we will surprise some people.\u201dWales\u2019 training squad experienced punishing training camps in Switzerland and Turkey during the past month and Gatland will parade three news caps \u2013 Max Llewellyn, Corey Domachowski and Keiron Assiratti \u2013 among a starting line-up captained for the first time by flanker Jac Morgan.\u201cI have got to say that I am incredibly impressed with this group of players in the last eight weeks,\u201d Gatland added.\u201cThey are in great shape physically. I couldn\u2019t have asked for any more.\u201cThey have been to the well and had to dig deep with everything we\u2019ve put them through. They have been absolutely brilliant.\u201cWe\u2019ve had tough sessions, but come out the other side. The hardest thing is naming the 33 (final World Cup squad). There will be some real tough calls.\u201dGatland, meanwhile, says he can see a likeness between 23-year-old Morgan and Sam Warburton, who was appointed Wales skipper ahead of World Cup in 2011 at the age of 22.Other leadership candidates will also be assessed during the warm-up schedule, but Morgan has first opportunity to put down a marker.\u201cHe is a fantastic individual and he is respected in the group. He has got a big future for Wales,\u201d Gatland said.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t say a lot or talk a lot, a bit like Sam Warburton. He does his talking out there and leads by example.\u201cWe went to Turkey last week and took a referee out there with us to do some live stuff.\u201cOne of the comments from him (referee) was that some of the interaction from Jac was really impressive. He was asking good, positive questions and that was probably an indication that we had made the right call.\u201dGatland, meanwhile, has also hailed full-back Leigh Halfpenny, who will become the ninth player to win 100 Wales caps when he runs out against England.\u201cHe will be leading the side out,\u201d Gatland added. \u201cHe is driven and he is a role model for everyone coming through who looks up to him.RecommendedLouis Rees-Zammit has \u2018lot more to give\u2019 as he looks to realise World Cup dreamJack Crowley has chance to lay down World Cup marker against ItalyMarcus Smith given last chance to shine in England shirt ahead of Rugby World Cup\u201cIf you are talking about role models as a professional, you could not get a harder worker than Leigh Halfpenny in terms of how he prepares.\u201cThe analysis, training and recovery.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeBoxing matches tend to be organised as one of three types: professional, amateur or exhibition. But what is the difference between them?Generally speaking, most \u2018major\u2019 fights \u2013 including title fights \u2013 are professional bouts, while exhibition contests are those staged with more of a focus on the audience and entertainment. Most professional fighters have an amateur career before turning pro, and Olympic fights count as amateur bouts.For example, Anthony Joshua\u2019s Olympic gold-medal win in 2012 was part of his amateur career. Meanwhile, his heavyweight title fights with Oleksandr Usyk in 2021 and 2022 were professional bouts. Elsewhere, Floyd Mayweather\u2019s recent matches against YouTubers Logan Paul and Deji were exhibitions.All fights \u2013 professional, amateur and exhibition \u2013 must be licensed by a commission (e.g. fights in Las Vegas are regulated by the Nevada State Athletic Commission), but exhibition bouts do not need to be sanctioned by a governing body. In contrast, the World Boxing Council (WBC) sanctioned Tyson Fury\u2019s three fights with Deontay Wilder, as the WBC heavyweight title was on the line.Professional fights do not need to be title bouts, but they tend to have an effect on the rankings in the weight class in which they take place, as seeded by the governing body sanctioning the fight. I.e. Andy Ruiz Jr is the World Boxing Organization (WBO)\u2019s No 1-ranked fighter below its champions, while Wilder is ranked sixth. If Wilder were to fight and beat Ruiz Jr, Wilder would likely overtake the Mexican-American in the rankings.RecommendedThe Independent\u2019s pound-for-pound boxing rankingsTerence Crawford\u2019s masterclass puts him in conversation to be an all-time greatThe hidden side of Jake PaulFurthermore, rules are more flexible in exhibition fights. For example, a world title fight in men\u2019s boxing \u2013 a professional bout \u2013 will always be scheduled for 12 three-minute rounds; and a women\u2019s world title fight will always be scheduled for 12 two-minute rounds. In contrast, an exhibition fight could be set as six three-minute rounds, or eight two-minute rounds (these are random examples).Fights can of course end earlier if there is a knockout/TKO (technical knockout, where the referee or a ringside doctor halts the action, or a towel is thrown in), but such results are less frequent in exhibition bouts, where wins and losses do not count towards a fighter\u2019s record \u2013 and there is often no winner declared at all. For example, former multi-weight world champion Mayweather retired unbeaten in 2017 with a professional record of 50-0, and he has since fought in five exhibitions. While the 46-year-old has been somewhat aggressive in beating three of his exhibition opponents via TKO, two of his exhibition fights lasted the full number of rounds and no winner was declared.Sometimes, however, fights that one would expect to be exhibition bouts are in fact professional contests. For example, YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul has boxed six times professionally, taking on former mixed martial arts champions Anderson Silva, Tyron Woodley (twice) and Ben Askren, as well as ex-NBA star Nate Robinson and YouTuber AnEsonGib. Readers might expect such fights to be exhibitions, but they have in fact been organised as professional bouts, meaning Paul has a 6-0 record (4 KOs).

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe boxing landscape is arguably as intriguing as it has ever been.The past several years have seen heavyweight epics for the ages between Tyson Fury and Deontay Wilder, they have seen Saul \u201cCanelo\u201d Alvarez establish himself as the face of the sport in the eyes of many fans, and they have seen frequent displays of technical brilliance from champions in lighter weight classes.There have been upsets, title unifications, and there has been no shortage of drama \u2013 Anthony Joshua\u2019s post-fight rant after a second loss to Oleksandr Usyk stands out as a prime example.All of these fights and results have factored into The Independent\u2019s own top 10, pound-for-pound rankings for men\u2019s boxers, to be updated monthly. While there is no exact science to putting together lists such as this, a number of factors have been considered in making the rankings, including each fighter\u2019s overall record, recent record, level of activity and calibre of opposition.RecommendedMike Tyson to train Francis Ngannou for Tyson Fury clashEddie Hearn claims Tyson Fury \u2018only cares about money\u2019 as Ngannou fight approachesTyson Fury seeks UFC star\u2019s help ahead of Francis Ngannou fightThe Independent\u2019s pound-for-pound rankings10. Shakur Stevenson (20-0, 10 KOs)Shakur Stevenson celebrates his successful lightweight debut in April 2023 (Getty Images)The unbeaten American, 26, was already a two-weight world champion by the time he was 24. Now Stevenson is a rising force at lightweight, as he looks to build upon his significant success at featherweight \u2013\u00a0where he was WBO champion \u2013 and super-featherweight, where he was unified champion. In his most recent fight, in April, Stevenson debuted at lightweight and stopped Shuichiro Yoshino in the sixth round. Clashes with the likes of Gervonta Davis (who narrowly misses out on this list), Ryan Garcia and Devin Haney are alluring prospects. So is a fight with the next man in these rankings...9. Vasiliy Lomachenko (17-3, 11 KOs)Vasiliy Lomachenko (left) during his fight with Devin Haney in May  (AP)The Ukrainian southpaw (one of two on this list...) saw off Jorge Linares in 2018 to become a three-weight title holder, before adding further belts with notable wins against the likes of Luke Campbell and Jose Pedraza. \u201cLoma\u201d was somewhat surprisingly beaten by Teofimo Lopez in 2020, but the 35-year-old bounced back with three straight wins to maintain his status as one of the best boxers in the world. The two-time Olympic champion is in the twilight of his career now, which only made his terrific showing against No 7 on this list even more impressive. Lomachenko came up narrowly short, but many observers felt that he had won.8. Errol Spence Jr (28-1, 22 KOs)Errol Spence Jr is a former unified welterweight champion  (Getty Images)The American has not been the most active fighter in recent years, but he slowly built a fine resume as one of the top welterweights of this generation. Spence Jr holds impressive wins against the likes of Shawn Porter, Mikey Garcia, Danny Garcia and Carlos Ocampo. The southpaw stopped the latter, as well as notably finishing Kell Brook on the Briton\u2019s home turf earlier in his career, and a cancelled clash with Manny Pacquiao would surely have built up Spence even further had it come to fruition.In July, the 33-year-old finally faced Terence Crawford in a clash five years in the making, where he put his unified titles on the line against the WBO champion. Crawford left Las Vegas with all the belts after stopping Spence in Round 9, in a fight that was nowhere near as close as fans expected. As a result, Crawford climbed this list, while Spence dropped from No 5.7. Devin Haney (30-0, 15 knockouts)Devin Haney (right) was a unanimous-decision winner against George Kambosos Jr in two fights in 2022  (Getty Images)The unbeaten American entered our list following his second straight clinic against George Kambosos Jr. Haney eased to a unanimous-decision win against the Australian on Kambosos\u2019 home turf in June 2022 to become undisputed champion at lightweight, before retaining that status in the pair\u2019s rematch in October \u2013 also in Melbourne. Prior to those clashes, Kambosos Jr was undefeated. At just 24 years old, the best is still ahead of Haney, though he must learn from his most recent bout, with Lomachenko in May.\u00a0It was a fight that Haney won, but not without controversy.6. Dmitry Bivol (21-0, 11 KOs)Dmitry Bivol outpointed Saul \u2018Canelo\u2019 Alvarez for a stunning win  (Copyright 2022 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.)Entered our list in May 2022, following his stunning victory over Saul \u201cCanelo\u201d Alvarez. The Russian remained unbeaten and retained the WBA light-heavyweight title with that result, which he achieved by fighting on the front foot, picking his shots wisely, and almost doubling the output of his opponent. Bivol, 32, won by two points on all three judges\u2019 scorecards, though the margins should have been much wider. A clinical showing that raised the Russian\u2019s profile immensely and likely sets up a rematch with Canelo down the line. Before that, though, Bivol was tasked with getting past the unbeaten Gilberto Ramirez in November. Bivol won on points with an aggressive and sharp performance, which saw him a few spots here. 5. Tyson Fury (33-0-1, 24 KOs)Tyson Fury after stopping Deontay Wilder again in a heavyweight epic in 2021  (Getty Images)Has eclipsed Anthony Joshua as the household name in British boxing. Fury, 34, returned to the sport in 2018 after three years off due to a long struggle with his mental health. Since then, he has established himself as one of the great heavyweights, dethroning Deontay Wilder to become WBC champion in the pair\u2019s 2020 rematch, having controversially drawn with the American in their first clash, in 2018. In October 2021, Fury stopped Wilder for the second fight in a row to retain the belt, which he did again in April by knocking out Dillian Whyte with ease and once more in December with a late stoppage of Derek Chisora. A creative fighter who has demonstrated remarkable resilience and heart in the ring, Fury previously held the WBA, WBO, IBF and IBO titles and was looking to regain them in a fight with Oleksandr Usyk this spring. However, the fight \u2013 which would have crowned an undisputed heavyweight champion \u2013 fell through. Now he will fight ex-UFC champion Francis Ngannou, bizarrely.4. Saul \u2018Canelo\u2019 Alvarez (59-2-2, 39 KOs)Saul Alvarez following his stoppage win against Caleb Plant in 2021  (AP)In the 10 years since his loss to Floyd Mayweather, the Mexican has established himself as the face of boxing, with wins against Erislandy Lara, Miguel Cotto, Amir Khan, Gennadiy Golovkin, Daniel Jacobs, Billy Joe Saunders and many more of note. The effectiveness of the 33-year-old\u2019s counter-punching, slickness of his head movement and beauty of his body work make him a joy to watch.Detractors will point to Alvarez\u2019s clenbuterol controversy in 2018 and the fact that a few of his victories have come via controversial scorecards. Supporters will give more credence to Canelo\u2019s admirable level of activity and the great number of formidable foes he has fought and beaten. His three victories in 2021 \u2013 all stoppages \u2013 saw him ultimately become boxing\u2019s first ever undisputed super-middleweight champion. A title holder in four weight classes, the Mexican failed to add a second light-heavyweight title to his collection when he was outpointed by unbeaten Russian Bivol in May 2022.That result, which surprised a number of fans, marked just the second defeat of Canelo\u2019s professional career and saw him drop from No 1 in our list. He rebounded with a decisive points win against ageing rival Golovkin, though that result proved little at this point. The ambitious Mexican then defended his super-middleweight belts against John Ryder in Guadalajara, dropping the Briton en route to a decision win. Next up for Canelo? Jermell Charlo in September.3. Oleksandr Usyk (20-0, 13 KOs)Oleksandr Usyk (left) has outpointed Anthony Joshua twice in a row  (Getty Images)Was the only ever undisputed cruiserweight champion of the four-belt era before moving up to heavyweight, where he became WBA, WBO, IBF and IBO champion in 2021 by outpointing Anthony Joshua with relative ease. The Ukrainian, 36, is undefeated and most recently beat Joshua on points a second time to retain his heavyweight titles and climb two spots here. The southpaw, an Olympic gold medalist, is as technical and awkward as they come in the heavier weight classes, making a potential match-up with Fury an intriguing prospect \u2013 though that bout collapsed this spring. Next up for Usyk is mandatory challenger Daniel Dubois in August.2. Terence Crawford (40-0, 31 KOs)Terence Crawford outclassed Errol Spence Jr for eight rounds and stopped him in the ninth  (AP)The undisputed welterweight champion has one of the most impressive resumes in the sport, and it just keeps getting better. Five of the American\u2019s last 11 opponents were undefeated before facing him, and all 11 were stopped by Crawford \u2013 who has a tremendous knockout ratio. Wins against big-name boxers Brook and Porter in 2020 and 2021 further enhanced the 35-year-old\u2019s profile, especially his victory over the latter, before Crawford stopped David Avanesyan in December 2022. Then, in July, he schooled Errol Spence Jr in what was widely billed as the fight of the decade, delivering a masterclass to expose a bigger gap between the Americans than anyone had predicted. In beating Spence in Round 9 after scoring three knockdowns, Crawford took his rival\u2019s three titles to become undisputed. The victory also made \u201cBud\u201d the first man in boxing history to become undisputed champion in two weight classes, following his brief reign atop the super-lightweight division in 2017.It is also worth saying there is almost nothing between Crawford and the final name on this list... 1. Naoya Inoue (25-0, 22 KOs)Naoya Inoue stopping Stephen Fulton in July 2023  (AFP via Getty Images)One of the lesser-known names on this list to the more casual fan, the Japanese does not lack in prowess what he may lack in profile. Inoue has the best stoppage percentage of any fighter on this list, part of what makes him such an exciting athlete to watch \u2013 along with his effortless evasiveness, brutal body attacks, and frightening level of output.

However, he vacated his bantamweight belts in January to move up and challenge Stephen Fulton.In July, Inoue took Fulton apart to hand the American his first pro loss and take his WBC and WBO super-bantamweight titles. As a result, the \u201cMonster\u201d became a four-weight world champion and further vindicated his No 1 spot here."}, {"_id": "64cceb1251ac3352961fa952", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/ufc/ufc-rankings-fighters-p4p-list-2023-b2384490.html", "primaryCategory": "UFC", "subCategories": "test", "title": "UFC rankings: The Independent\u2019s pound-for-pound fighters list", "lead": "<p>Here are our top 10 men\u2019s fighters in the UFC, in a list to be updated throughout the year </p>", "author": "Alex Pattle", "datePublished": "2023-08-03 14:27:20", "dateScraped": "2023-08-04 14:12:02.595086", "dateUpdated": "2023-08-03T14:27:20+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/03/20/11/newFile-6.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free sport newsletter for all the latest news on everything from cycling to boxingSign up to our free sport email for all the latest news\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

No biting and no eye gouging\u2019: UFC\u2019s first ever champion Royce Gracie on the night MMA was bornTop 1010. Dustin Poirier (29-8, 1 No Contest; lightweight)Former interim UFC lightweight champion Dustin Poirier  (Getty Images)The American is one of the best boxers in the UFC but is also a very well rounded martial artist, who holds eight wins against six different world champions of the sport. In 2021, he beat Conor McGregor twice to avenge a 2014 loss to the Irishman, and the ex-interim champion also has stoppage wins over Justin Gaethje, Michael Chandler, Max Holloway and Eddie Alvarez to his name. Poirier has twice failed to become undisputed champion, however, losing via submission to Khabib Nurmagomedov and Charles Oliveira, and in July he suffered a shock head-kick knockout by Gaethje in a rematch for the \u2018BMF\u2019 belt.9. Jiri Prochazka (29-3-1, light-heavyweight)Former UFC light-heavyweight champion Jiri Prochazka (Zuffa LLC)The Czech became the first fighter from his country to win a UFC title, when he submitted Glover Teixeira to win the light-heavyweight belt in June 2022. Prochazka\u2019s late victory in that war \u2013 a fight of the year contender \u2013 marked the culmination of a rapid run to the gold; the 30-year-old won the title in just his third UFC fight, having previously knocked out ex-title challengers Volkan Oezdemir and Dominick Reyes in stunning fashion. Unfortunately the Czech suffered a shoulder injury ahead of his planned rematch with Teixeira, and he opted to vacate the belt rather than hold up the division. Prochazka has not fought since, but the dynamic striker\u2019s return is eagerly anticipated.8. Aljamain Sterling (23-3, bantamweight champion)Aljamain Sterling has recorded three title defences, all against ex-champions  (Getty Images)The Jamaican-American was mocked by some fans after winning the bantamweight title via disqualification in 2021, when Petr Yan landed an illegal knee while leading the bout. In a rematch 13 months later, Sterling silenced some doubters and irked others by winning a narrow decision. He then dominated former champion TJ Dillashaw en route to a TKO in October, as the challenger battled a dislocated shoulder, and went on to beat another ex-champion in Henry Cejudo this May, defeating the American \u2013 who had not fought in three years \u2013 via split decision. Some observers attach asterisks to each of Sterling\u2019s title defences, but all have come against former world champions, and \u201cFunk Master\u201d has now won nine fights in a row.7. Charles Oliveira (34-9, 1 NC; lightweight)Charles Oliveira has the most finishes and submissions in UFC history  (Getty Images)The Brazilian\u2019s 2010 debut in the UFC gave way to an inconsistent record with numerous failed weight-cuts along the way, but the former featherweight then turned his career around. An 11-fight win streak over five years saw Oliveira claim and retain the lightweight title vacated by the retired Khabib, then submit Justin Gaethje in May 2022 \u2013 one day after being stripped of the belt for a narrow weight-miss. That win positioned him as No 1 contender as he looked to regain the gold. However, he was submitted by Islam Makhachev in October as the Russian won the vacant title. Oliveira bounced back in June 2023, though, with a TKO win over Beneil Dariush in the first round. That result extended Oliveira\u2019s records for most finishes (19) and most submissions (16) in UFC history.6. Kamaru Usman (20-3, welterweight)Kamaru Usman was a dominant welterweight champion from 2019 until 2022  (AP)In 2021, Usman was arguably the best mixed martial artist in the world, let alone the UFC, and our pound-for-pound No 1. The Nigerian-American is perhaps the most clinical wrestler in the promotion and has added knockout power to his game in recent years, and he was unbeaten for nine years between 2013 and 2022 \u2013 with a dominant welterweight title reign for the last three years of that run. After five successful defences \u2013 two against Colby Covington, two against Jorge Masvidal, and one against Gilbert Burns \u2013 Usman dropped the belt to Leon Edwards last August, dominating his old opponent for much of the fight but falling to an incredible, late head kick. Edwards then outpointed Usman in London this March to retain the gold.5. Israel Adesanya (24-2, middleweight champion)Israel Adesanya celebrates the start of his second reign atop the middleweight division  (Getty Images)One of the most exciting fighters to watch in the history of the sport. The former kickboxer routinely produces striking masterclasses against his opponents, simply proving too slick and too clever for his competition. Adesanya has faced a who\u2019s-who of 185lbers, knocking out a number of them and losing to just one. The \u201cLast Stylebender\u201d suffered his first defeat in pro MMA in 2021, but there was even merit in that as the Nigerian-born New Zealander moved up a weight class to challenge then-champion Jan Blachowicz for the light-heavyweight title.He then began to \u201clap the opposition\u201d with back-to-back rematch wins against Vettori and Whittaker prior to his decision victory over Jared Cannonier at UFC 276. Adesanya then suffered just his second MMA defeat \u2013\u00a0and first at middleweight \u2013 in losing the title to old foe Alex Pereira in November. Pereira, who twice beat Adesanya in kickboxing bouts across 2016 and 2017, stopped the Kiwi in the final round to dethrone \u201cStylebender\u201d at the end of a thrilling encounter. But Adesanya finally exorcised his demon by knocking out Pereira in the second round in April, regaining the title and reasserting himself as the best middleweight in the UFC.4. Leon Edwards (21-3, 1 NC; welterweight champion)Leon Edwards made a successful first defence of the welterweight title in March  (Action Images via Reuters)Edwards became Britain\u2019s second ever UFC champion with a stunning, last-gasp knockout of Usman in August. After taking down the Nigerian-American \u2013\u00a0something no fighter had ever done in the UFC \u2013 in Round 1, Edwards continually rose to his feet amid an onslaught of grappling pressure from the champion over the next few frames, keeping himself in the fight. Then, with a minute left on the clock, Edwards knocked Usman out cold with a perfect head kick to take his gold, beating the man who outpointed him seven years earlier. Then, this March, Edwards outpointed Usman in London to solidify his status as champion. Edwards\u2019 first win over Usman saw him enter our list, while the second propelled him up the rankings. Since his 2015 loss to the \u201cNigerian Nightmare\u201d, Edwards is unbeaten with 11 straight wins (save for a No Contest against Belal Muhammad in 2021).3. Islam Makhachev (24-1, lightweight champion)Islam Makhachev won the UFC lightweight title by submitting Charles Oliveira in November  (AFP via Getty Images)Some used to question the Russian\u2019s credentials, given a lack of top-tier opponents on his record, though that was arguably due to highly-ranked fighters\u2019 tentativeness to risk their spots against a dangerous up-and-comer. Others accused Makhachev of benefiting from his connection to Khabib \u2013 his childhood friend and now one of Makhachev\u2019s coaches. Regardless, the 31-year-old banished any doubt in October when he submitted Oliveira \u2013 the fighter with the most submission wins in UFC history \u2013 to win the vacant lightweight title, suggesting that he would have done the same to most contenders at 155lbs.Makhachev then made it 12 wins in a row by outpointing Alexander Volkanovski in February, matching the Australian\u2019s record streak for an active fighter while retaining his title against the featherweight champion in a very close contest. In advance of that fight, many suggested that a Makhachev win would make him the new pound-for-pound No 1, but Indy Sport was more impressed by Volkanovski\u2019s showing in a higher weight class and would like to see Makhachev add some more notable names to his resume. As such, the Russian was our No 2, until...2. Jon Jones (27-1, 1 NC; heavyweight champion)Jon Jones returned to the UFC in March to collect a title in a second division  (Getty Images)When Jon Jones returned to the UFC in March after a three-year absence, winning the heavyweight title by submitting Ciryl Gane in the first round, many believed that the American confirmed himself as the greatest of all time. A lot of fans also felt that he should go straight to the top of any and all pound-for-pound lists. And Jones\u2019 victory certainly was impressive, particularly due to the manner in which it was achieved and the factors around the 35-year-old\u2019s heavyweight debut. It was also enough for the former two-time light-heavyweight champion to shoot straight into our rankings at No 2, with his long-term resume standing out more than Makhachev\u2019s (Jones has beaten numerous world champions), but his lack of activity keeping him below our No 1 \u2013 for the time being, at least.1. Alexander Volkanovski (26-2, featherweight champion)Alexander Volkanovski has defended and retained the featherweight title five times  (Getty Images)After suffering the sole defeat of his professional career in 2013, Volkanovski won a stunning 22 fights in a row. In fact, his only pro losses have come against a welterweight champion and a lightweight champion. All of the Australian\u2019s recent fights have pitted him against top names. In 2022, Volkanovski put on a clinic against fan favourite Chan Sung Jung before producing a masterclass to outpoint Max Holloway for the third time, leaving no doubt about his superiority over the man he dethroned in 2019. In doing so, the 34-year-old enhanced his own claim to be labelled the 145lbs GOAT. He even holds a win against the other standout contender for that status \u2013\u00a0Jose Aldo \u2013 as well as victories over Chad Mendes, Brian Ortega, and Yair Rodriguez.RecommendedMike Tyson to train Francis Ngannou for Tyson Fury clashNate Diaz reveals \u2018secret\u2019 that he and Jake Paul shareConor McGregor lashes out at Justin Gaethje again with \u2018single shot\u2019 claimVolkanovski is as dynamic, composed and well rounded as they come. He had the chance to confirm his status as pound-for-pound king when he challenged lightweight champion Makhachev on home turf in February, in a bid to become just the fifth ever dual-weight UFC champion, and \u2013\u00a0although he narrowly lost on points \u2013\u00a0he remained our No 1. That is due to the stunning performance produced by the Aussie in that fight, with Volkanovski dropping Makhachev twice, neutralising the Russian in many of the grappling exchanges, and arguably winning the bout despite a significant size disadvantage.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeAnother year of UFC action has passed its midway point, as fans anticipate Conor McGregor\u2019s long-awaited return to the Octagon as well as some major title fights.McGregor, who remains the face of the sport, has not competed since breaking his leg in July 2021 but is due to fight Michael Chandler some time late this year or early next, though new stars have emerged elsewhere to help keep audiences engaged.In one of the biggest fights of 2023, lightweight champion Islam Makhachev retained his title against featherweight king Alexander Volkanovski, narrowly winning a decision on the latter\u2019s home turf in Australia in February. Then, in March, light-heavyweight \u2018GOAT\u2019 Jon Jones moved up to heavyweight after three years away, submitting Ciryl Gane in the first round to win the title vacated by Francis Ngannou in January, when the latter left the UFC.Later in March, Britain\u2019s Leon Edwards retained the welterweight belt with a decision win over Kamaru Usman in London, seven months after taking the title from the \u201cNigerian Nightmare\u201d with a stunning head kick. April then kicked off with Israel Adesanya finally beating long-time rival Alex Pereira, the 33-year-old knocking out the Brazilian to regain the middleweight belt that he lost to Pereira in November.There are plenty more title fights to come, too.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThere was a touch of boxing genius in the work of Terence Crawford in the ring at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas on Saturday night.Crawford dominated and stopped Errol Spence in round nine to unify all four of the recognised belts at welterweight, but the trinkets are just cheap toys in his boxing world.It was meant to be a 50-50 fight, two unbeaten men, both champions, rivals for five years and equals in so many ways; in the end, and from the very start, Crawford took control, dropping Spence three times before the mercy intervention. There were no excuses in defeat for Spence, no gloating in victory for Crawford; the fight\u2019s weird contractual structure gives Spence the right to ask for a rematch. Spence wants the fight again, the next time at light-middleweight, an increase of seven pounds; Crawford will inevitably go with the request and pocket another massive payday. They were each guaranteed $10m on Saturday \u2013 they made and deserved more.On Saturday night, in front of 19,990 paying fans, Crawford took a minute or two to find his range and feet, and then he slowly and painfully took control. Spence was sent down hurt, late in the second and then dropped twice more in round seven.RecommendedErrol Spence reveals date of Terence Crawford rematch \u2013 \u2018We got to do it again\u2019Inside the phone calls that made Spence vs Crawford \u2013 a generational fightTerence Crawford dismantles Errol Spence Jr to become undisputed welterweight world championIt was, make no mistake, a masterclass and that means it was not a classic. It was quality, a pleasure to watch, but Spence was always in danger, always a shot behind. Crawford never wasted a punch or a movement or a moment. He seized any gaps, countered with venom and hurt Spence dozens and dozens of times. Spence\u2019s face started to swell from the punches early in the fight. There is an argument, in another boxing universe, for the fight to have been stopped a round or so earlier, but this end of the brutal game is harsh and unforgiving. When men are paid so much, they are expected to give even more. It is a savage business, make no mistake. Spence was floored by Crawford on three occasions  (Getty)There was no time for tears or reflection at the end from Spence, he was calling for a rematch before he left the ring. There are other fights for Crawford, men chasing his belts, but the cash-sensible fight is a rematch. And Crawford is a cash-sensible type of guy.Spence, in defeat, offered not one excuse. He has been inactive, he has talked for years about letting his body grow, he has suffered eye injuries and serious damage in a sickening car crash. He could have mentioned any of the facts, but he refused. \u201cThe best man won, no excuses,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, let\u2019s do it again.\u201d Spence entered the ring unbeaten in 28 fights, having won his first world title back in 2017; he was the slightest betting underdog. He was also thought to be the bigger man and the bigger puncher. This fight was not meant to be a calculated massacre.Crawford dominated Spence in a boxing masterclass  (AP)Crawford accepts victory like a fighter from another era. He is humble, always humble. It was Crawford\u2019s 40th win, his eighth consecutive stoppage in eight welterweight world title fights. He has been a professional boxer since 2008 and won his first world title back in 2014. He is an old-school fighter, this win just elevated his status, and he will now face comparisons with the men from the ring\u2019s glorious history, the long-lost champions at welterweight. He compares favourably with any of them, trust me. He also has that edge that fighters who started out on the wrong side of the boxing tracks carry with them like some kind of perverse badge of honour. I love that about Crawford.RecommendedErrol Spence Jr drops hint over next move in social-media updateThe sporting weekend in picturesErrol Spence reveals date of Terence Crawford rematch \u2013 \u2018We got to do it again\u2019It is rare, at this level, for one man to dominate another man like Crawford did. There are, Spence is right, no excuses; Crawford just produced a masterclass and made a hard night look so simple and that is something that only the very best can do. A move up in weight will add to his legacy and fights with the younger generation could make him one of the greats. However, there is also a solid argument that he has nothing left to prove \u2013 in the modern business of boxing, too many boxers who have achieved less than Crawford are routinely referred to as \u2018great\u2019. It is often a false declaration. Crawford, however, is special and might just be a great of the ring."}, {"_id": "64cceb1351ac3352961fa956", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/boxing/jake-paul-nate-diaz-fight-b2384895.html", "primaryCategory": "Boxing", "subCategories": "test", "title": "The hidden side of Jake Paul", "lead": "<p>Jake Paul spends a lot of his time being insincere, to devastating effect.

Controversies have arisen at intervals since the American emerged on Vine in 2013, three years before his two-season stint on the Disney Channel series Bizaardvark. Paul, 26, has nevertheless only seen his profile grow in the decade since, with 20 million YouTube subscribers and 23m Instagram followers at the time of writing. Still, he does not identify as a YouTuber or influencer anymore; he\u2019s a professional boxer.If his knockout win over former NBA star Nate Robinson in 2020 didn\u2019t convince you, or his knockouts of MMA stars Tyron Woodley and Ben Askren in 2021, or his decision win over UFC legend Anderson Silva in October, then he hoped his fight with Tommy Fury would have. Well, kind of; Paul would argue he doesn\u2019t care what you think at all, even after Fury outpointed him in February.RecommendedJake Paul vs Nate Diaz live stream: How to watch fight online and on TV this weekendJustin Gaethje stuns Dustin Poirier with brutal head-kick knockout at UFC 291KSI vs Tommy Fury: When is fight and how to watchWhen I start our interview \u2013 conducted a week before that fight \u2013 by asking what the biggest misconception about Jake Paul is, he takes a moment to think, before laughing: \u201cI think people... they don\u2019t think I\u2019m a real person. And I think they judge me from my past a lot, versus looking at who I am today. I think, as humans, we naturally do that, so I get it. But yeah, I think that\u2019s it...\u201cAnd they compare me to my brother,\u201d he quickly adds, referring to Logan, 28, who has followed a similar path to his younger sibling. \u201cWhenever he does something wrong, I get in trouble for it. I would probably say that\u2019s the biggest thing.\u201dJake Paul says people don\u2019t think he\u2019s a \u2018real person\u2019Paul has an almost unrivalled proclivity for, simply put, winding people up. It is one of the clearest explanations for how the American has secured bouts with some of the highest-profile names in combat sports en route to going 6-1, and it is how he secured his fight with Fury \u2013 half-brother of world heavyweight boxing champion Tyson \u2013 and now a clash with UFC icon Nate Diaz.Paul, a lot of the time, is a troll, and some people genuinely detest him for it. When friends first heard that I had interviewed him, their reactions eclipsed any interest they had in the fact that I met Anthony Joshua for the first time on the same day. Love him or hate him \u2013\u00a0and you\u2019d probably say you hate him \u2013 people care about Jake Paul.\u201cI think the smart people in the world see that I\u2019m able to play chess in the entertainment industry and make really smart moves,\u201d the Ohio native explains. \u201cThen there\u2019s the sheep who are like, \u2018Argh, that kid! I saw he said this! Blah, blah, blah.\u2019 Like, I did that on purpose, to get you riled up. It\u2019s marketing at the end of the day.\u201dIt can be argued that the side of Paul that some find irritating is just a facade, and fairly obviously so. Why, then, are people so irked by what he says? \u201cI think because it\u2019s true,\u201d he suggests, a slight smirk splitting his lips. So when Paul says something mean about you, he believes it \u2013 even if he doesn\u2019t mean it. Like the incisive, inebriated insults that you withdraw when the alcohol has washed away.Paul during his defeat by Tommy Fury in Saudi Arabia \u2013 the first loss of his career  (AP)\u201cThe deepest insults are the ones that you believe to be true within your own mind,\u201d Paul continues. \u201cThose are your insecurities. If I\u2019m attacking these people\u2019s insecurities, they\u2019re gonna get all riled up, p****d off, bent out of shape.\u201dPaul, for his part, does not seem to take anything that anyone says about him remotely personally. \u201cWhen they say anything about me, I\u2019ve dealt with all my insecurities as a man. I\u2019ve looked myself in the mirror and gone through so many spiritual, healing journeys. You don\u2019t just all of a sudden not have insecurities, but I\u2019ve dealt with mine. So, if someone brings them up, it\u2019s like... I don\u2019t care, because I love myself.\u201dHe hasn\u2019t always loved himself, though. When asked what motivates a young man who has already reaped such riches, like a reported $38m net worth, to spend so much of his time getting punched in the face, he starts, \u201cIt\u2019s funny...\u201d before following up with reasoning that is anything but that. Still, he smiles as he says it: \u201cI need boxing. Boxing saved me. I was in a super dark place in my life.\u201cI lacked discipline, lacked routine, lacked community, lacked passion, lacked progress. Boxing gave me all of those things, and I loved punching people and getting punched! I love the pace of it, the strategy, everything behind it. It\u2019s an art. Then there\u2019s the build-up, the content, the press conferences, the outfits. All of it made me fall in love with boxing, to a point where I need boxing on a daily basis just to function. I love the sport, that\u2019s really what it is.\u201dPaul knocked out Tyron Woodley in their short-notice rematch in 2021  (AFP via Getty Images)And that\u2019s the thing: For all the criticism Paul used to get for not having fought a \u2018real boxer\u2019, he has always taken this endeavour seriously.\u201cIt\u2019s the most intense thing you can imagine in your mind,\u201d the 26-year-old says of his training. \u201cI\u2019m going to my limit every single day. It\u2019s a team of eight people, fully dedicated to making this operation work \u2013 from strength and conditioning coaches to stretch therapists to three boxing coaches who are watching my every single move. It\u2019s strategy, it\u2019s gameplan, it\u2019s film review, it\u2019s repetition \u2013 pounding it over and over again. I\u2019m studying my opponent and training like a professional athlete, with state-of-the-art facilities. It\u2019s as serious as it gets, because my life\u2019s on the line, so I\u2019m not gonna take that lightly. And I don\u2019t want to lose, and I have all the resources available to have the best team and things around me.\u201dPaul during his decision victory over UFC legend Anderson Silva in 2022  (Getty Images)Before the fact, Paul\u2019s match-up with Fury in February felt like an endgame for the American; win or lose, he would have been able to dismiss jibes that he had not fought a professional boxer. But it was not the endgame that many had predicted; just six months on, Paul is set to box 38-year-old Nate Diaz \u2013 an MMA fan favourite who achieved crossover fame by submitting Conor McGregor in 2016, and who left the UFC in September after submitting Tony Ferguson. At this point, it is unclear what Paul\u2019s endgame will be.Nevertheless, \u201cI think I\u2019ll always box, for sure,\u201d Paul insists. \u201cAnd I hope to be a boxing coach one day. I\u2019m obviously already a promoter; I think I\u2019ll promote fights for the rest of my life,\u201d he says, referencing his significant work with champion Amanda Serrano, for whom he secured the first seven-figure payday in women\u2019s boxing history. \u201cThis sport is now a part of my DNA forever,\u201d he concludes.RecommendedNate Diaz reveals \u2018secret\u2019 that he and Jake Paul shareAmanda Serrano announces surprise return to MMA with PFLWhat time does Jake Paul vs Nate Diaz start this weekend?Talking to Paul, rather than about him, you see glimpses of the \u201creal person\u201d that others don\u2019t believe exists.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeSir Chris Hoy believes Mark Cavendish will mount one final comeback and break the Tour de France stage win record in 2024.Cavendish was initially named in the British squad for Sunday\u2019s UCI World Championship road race in Glasgow but withdrew due to the broken collarbone that ended his Tour hopes.The 38-year-old, seemingly stranded on 35 stage wins and level with Eddy Merckx atop the all-time charts, has been offered one final fling by his Astana Qazaqstan team.\u201cAt the start of the season, I said it was definitely his last year,\u201d said six-time Olympic champion Hoy. \u201cBut having seen how much Cav enjoyed and relished the Tour de France, it wasn\u2019t like he was there with a burden of winning another stage.\u201cHe had a smile on his face from ear to ear, on every stage. He was relishing the challenge and feeling like he was getting back to something like his best.\u201dRecommendedMark Cavendish hopes his documentary makes mental health issues more relatableMark Cavendish expects recovery to be \u2018number of weeks\u2019 after collarbone surgeryMark Cavendish abandons Tour de France after crash ends hopes of record-breaking victoryThe Manx Missile came within a whisker of breaking Merckx\u2019s record on stage eight in Bordeaux before a crash forced him to abandon.Questions of a potential comeback in 2024 were ruled off-limits by Cavendish in a new Netflix documentary, Mark Cavendish: Never Enough, which charts the twilight of his career.Cavendish crashed out of this year\u2019s Tour, breaking his collarbone in the process  (AP)\u201cI wouldn\u2019t put it past Cav,\u201d said Hoy. \u201cI\u2019ve just got a feeling he\u2019ll come back. I don\u2019t know anything, I haven\u2019t been told anything, but I would love to see him have one more year.\u201cI think as long as the passion is still there and he\u2019s injury free, there\u2019s no reason why he can\u2019t be there.\u201cHe might not be the fastest in the world any more but he has the ability to win stages because of his experience.\u201cNo one knows more about positioning in the bunch and lining himself up than him. I\u2019d put money on him winning a stage if he does come back.\u201dHoy will be a central figure in BBC coverage of the UCI World Championships, with track action running until Wednesday in the velodrome that bears his name.Double Olympic champion Katie Archibald specifically requested Hoy to conduct her first major broadcast interview since the tragic death of partner Rab Wardell in August 2022.Archibald wants the World Championships to be a monument to Wardell\u2019s memory and his motto, \u201cride bikes, have fun\u201d.Katie Archibald wants the World Championships to honour the memory of her partner Rab Wardell, who tragically died last summer  (Instagram)\u201cRab was an absolute legend of the sport and he contributed to it in so many different ways,\u201d said Hoy, who was speaking at an event to celebrate how National Lottery players have transformed cycling in the UK, with more than \u00a3143m invested since Lottery funding began.\u201cHe lived his life looking for fun and cycling was at the very heart of his life. A year later, it\u2019s still quite shocking that he\u2019s gone and it\u2019s hard to get your head around.\u201cI think the reception that Katie will receive when she steps on the track \u2013 the crowds are not going to just cheer her on, but pay their respects to Rab \u2013 it\u2019s going to be a very emotional moment for everybody there.\u201dAn in-form Archibald is the most powerful female track rider in the world and she could yet vie for Glasgow gold in the team pursuit, Madison and Omnium events.The 29-year-old has alluded to dropping out of training efforts in recent weeks but Hoy believes she should add to her haul of 11 World Championship medals.\u201cKatie usually underplays her chances,\u201d Hoy said. \u201cShe\u2019s going to come here with everything she\u2019s got.\u201cShe\u2019s going to come here with an extra amount of motivation and energy with this home crowd. There\u2019s definitely a chance she could come away with three gold medals.\u201cShe\u2019s relying on other people in some of those events, and with Laura Kenny having just given birth to her second child, the British team isn\u2019t going to be quite at full strength.RecommendedOn this day in 2012: Sir Chris Hoy wins fifth Olympic gold at London VelodromeBarbie song interrupts Stokes\u2019 press conference \u2013 Wednesday\u2019s sporting socialGreat Britain\u2019s team pursuit world title defence ends with crash in qualifying\u201cBut I\u2019m hoping that Katie can come away with at least one rainbow jersey.\u201dNational Lottery players raise more than \u00a330m a week for good causes including vital funding into sport, from grassroots to elite.

Impeccably sugary and entirely absent of bite, Heartstopper\u00a0is,\u00a0depending on your perspective, either a palate cleanser or a treacly over-indulgence.The second chapter picks up exactly where the first left off. Charlie (Joe Locke) and Nick (Kit Connor) are together, and, at last, their group of misfit friends know about it. But not everything is as simple as their relationship: Elle (Yasmin Finney) and Tao (William Gao) are still pining for each other, while quiet Isaac (Tobie Donovan) is starting to feel left out of the great coupling-up. And it\u2019s not like Charlie and Nick (\u201cChick\u201d or \u201cNarlie\u201d?) are having it all their own way \u2013 there\u2019s a miserable new teacher in town, Nick\u2019s brash brother is back from uni, and GCSEs are looming. \u201cWe are tragic\u00a0star-crossed\u00a0lovers,\u201d Charlie tells Nick, as exams and revision conspire against the teenagers.Set at the fictional Truham Grammar (and Higgs Girls) Schools,\u00a0Heartstopper\u00a0exists in a generic non-urban milieu, bursting with primary colours and noodly indie love songs. The show has been rightly praised, not just for its candour in depicting themes usually unaddressed in teen romances, but for its sweetness. Being gay or being trans is not, here, the misery business that Hollywood thinks. Instead, it\u2019s just another thread in the tapestry of adolescence. \u201cI have a boyfriend,\u201d Charlie proclaims, proudly, to his friends. \u201cYes, we\u2019re all fully aware!\u201d Tao replies wearily. It\u2019s a shame then, that in this rush to be affirming,\u00a0Heartstopper\u00a0forgets to be\u00a0good.Maybe it doesn\u2019t need to be good. Maybe it is enough that it exists, as a beacon of hope for closeted children or an instruction manual for their straight friends. But\u00a0Heartstopper\u00a0rarely rises above the aesthetic quality of, say,\u00a0Byker Grove\u00a0or\u00a0Grange Hill. Of course, there is\u00a0no one\u00a0in\u00a0Heartstopper\u2019s intended demographic who will remember those shows and therefore understand the insult I\u2019ve just levelled, but the writing and acting could have been carved from vast beams of timber. Like a totem pole or a hand-wrought loveseat. Sanded down to an almost slippery smoothness, it presents a\u00a0sanitised\u00a0view of Gen Z and a confused impression of the rest of us. \u201cI\u2019d love a cup of tea,\u201d Charlie tells his floppy-haired paramour. \u201cYou\u2019re such an old man!\u201d Nick responds.Heartstopper\u2019s origins were as a graphic novel, written and illustrated by Alice Oseman who also writes its TV adaptation. Hand-drawn shapes overlay the live action: tiny cartoon fireworks fizz when Charlie and Nick\u2019s fingers touch, electricity crackles when Elle strokes Tao\u2019s hair. It\u2019s a neat way of harking back to its origins. But generally, the show looks bad. It has the over-lit, over-saturated veneer that has typified Netflix\u2019s\u00a0teen-focused\u00a0output, from\u00a0Heartbreak High\u00a0to\u00a0XO, Kitty,\u00a0and a distractingly shallow depth of field. It looks not dissimilar to\u00a0Hollyoaks, only, for some reason, with Academy Award winner Olivia Colman chewing the scenery.RecommendedWolf review: A middle-class family (and their dog) are terrorised in one of the most harrowing dramas in yearsThe Power of Parker review: An intriguing romp with echoes of Steve Coogan and Victoria WoodGood Omens season two review: David Tennant and Michael Sheen\u2019s chemistry make this a hitBeing a soap opera for disenfranchised teens isn\u2019t the worst thing in the world. And\u00a0Heartstopper\u2019s second season makes no attempt to mess with a winning formula. The canvas, inevitably, expands slightly \u2013 much of the series is set in Paris, for example \u2013 but materially the show is a seamless continuation of its smash hit first outing. Tao and Elle continue to carry the weight of character interest (\u201cI try too hard and I talk too much,\u201d Tao moans) while Nick and Charlie persist at a monotone of wide-eyed earnestness (\u201cIt was never going to go perfectly with everyone,\u201d Nick announces of his coming out, with an equanimity the Dalai Lama would aspire to). It\u2019s all nice and watchable, even if it\u2019s not very well executed.For its target audience, the second series of Heartstopper will be another knockout. Others might need to pause their critical faculties for the duration of these half-hour episodes. Affectionate, blunt, caring, didactic, edgeless, flamboyant: Heartstopper runs the alphabet of adjectives, but never quite makes it all the way to good."}, {"_id": "64cceb1951ac3352961fa96f", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/reviews/heartstopper-season-2-review-kit-connor-joe-locke-b2387679.html", "primaryCategory": "Reviews", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Heartstopper review: In its effort to be affirming, this teen show forgets to be good", "lead": "<p>Netflix\u2019s sweet celebratory drama about queer teens was a smash hit when it first launched, so it\u2019s a shame that the follow-up series \u2013 while still watchable \u2013 feels overly sanitised and poorly executed</p>", "author": "Nick Hilton", "datePublished": "2023-08-04 11:28:16", "dateScraped": "2023-08-04 14:12:09.704972", "dateUpdated": "2023-08-04T11:28:16+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/08/02/12/newFile-5.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free IndyArts newsletter for all the latest entertainment news and reviewsSign up to our free IndyArts newsletter\n\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

The canvas, inevitably, expands slightly \u2013 much of the series is set in Paris, for example \u2013 but materially the show is a seamless continuation of its smash hit first outing. Tao and Elle continue to carry the weight of character interest (\u201cI try too hard and I talk too much,\u201d Tao moans) while Nick and Charlie persist at a monotone of wide-eyed earnestness (\u201cIt was never going to go perfectly with everyone,\u201d Nick announces of his coming out, with an equanimity the Dalai Lama would aspire to). It\u2019s all nice and watchable, even if it\u2019s not very well executed.For its target audience, the second series of Heartstopper will be another knockout. Others might need to pause their critical faculties for the duration of these half-hour episodes.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeI\u2019m glad Heartstopper exists. When it premiered last year, it fulfilled a desire to see queer teens be queer teens. Before Netflix\u2019s wholesome high-school drama came along, young people had to look to shows such as Riverdale, Elite and the new Gossip Girl for representation, only to be shown gorgeous 28-year-olds playing a decade younger. Heartstopper, which Alice Oseman has adapted from her extremely popular webcomic series, was made to be authentic, to directly mirror the people watching it. The show returned for season two today and its cast, now newly minted queer stars after season one\u2019s runaway success, look older and more mature. It\u2019s strange, then, that their characters seem frozen in time.What is particularly sweet about the Heartstopper comic is Oseman\u2019s painstaking attention to the nuances that make up the relationship between her central lovesick couple, Nick and Charlie (Kit Connor and Joe Locke). She began the series in 2016 and Nick, 16, and Charlie, 15, only hit third base last month (yes, really), with the timeline of the comic to date taking place over roughly a year. Heartstopper strives to capture that adorable, chaste honeymoon period early in a teen relationship; all soppy texts, giggling between classes and having your mum pick you up after a cinema date. It\u2019s great as a comic, for those willing to wait out its slow burn, but as a TV series, it\u2019s a lot less rewarding.Nick and Charlie\u2019s relationship is strictly romantic, to the extent that the lack of under-the-shirt stuff feels unrealistic. We see montage after montage of Nick and Charlie wrapped up in each other on their beds, making out in every spare minute, and the fact that neither of them even raises the idea of doing anything more just rings false. Fans praise the series for being different to a show like Elite, which has more sex parties and incest than you\u2019d expect for a drama about 17-year-old schoolkids, and I\u2019m glad Heartstopper isn\u2019t that show, but surely there\u2019s a middle ground? By sidestepping sex to preserve the rose-tinted fairytale of Nick and Charlie, Heartstopper is denying itself the opportunity to authentically represent Gen Z queerness.Despite the new series picking up days after season one, the cast has practically doubled in size \u2013 that\u2019s what a year\u2019s delay in filming does to a group of 19-year-olds \u2013 and so it\u2019s all the more obvious that restricting the Netflix show to the comic\u2019s narrow timeline is depriving these characters of the growth they need. It\u2019s worth remembering, too, that Oseman wrote Nick and Charlie as supporting characters in her debut novel, Solitaire, published in 2014, and Heartstopper originally took place in that period. Everything about the show is a product of the 2010s, a time that held very different views about queer young people, and these differences are most apparent in Heartstopper\u2019s scripts, which retain a lot of the comic\u2019s dialogue. In the medium of television, Heartstopper desperately needs to break free of its source material and plough its own furrow.The show\u2019s trademark purity strikes an odd note in season two, now that its actors have become queer public figures with millions of Instagram followers. Yasmin Finney, who plays Nick and Charlie\u2019s friend Elle, is an It-girl and advocate for trans youth, Sebastian Croft (Charlie\u2019s bully, Ben) is a fashion muse, Locke is in a Marvel series and Connor is leading YA adaptations. The whole cast is very openly, prominently queer, and having a ready-made batch of young British queer people to represent their generation, at a time when LGBTQ+ rights are a political battleground, is arguably Heartstopper\u2019s greatest gift to the world. But this only emphasises just how uncool their fictional characters are. For example, in June, Locke posted a photo of Connor partially obscuring a sign so that it read \u201cF****t Square\u201d with the caption \u201cHappy Pride\u201d. If Nick or Charlie were to do something like this, the fabric of Heartstopper\u2019s reality would start to unravel and a black hole would open up above the school.RecommendedFrom The Last of Us to The Bear: Why are the best TV episodes always the ones without the main characters?Angus Cloud was the Euphoria underdog we were all rooting forPlease: no Gavin & Stacey reunionThey\u2019re just too safe and smiling and unproblematic. None of them looks like they have TikTok accounts. At one point in season two, a character drinks too much contraband alcohol on a school trip and when she starts to vomit, the other characters don\u2019t take her to the toilet, they take her to the teachers\u2019 room. On the same trip, a game of spin the bottle is criticised because \u201cit\u2019s too personal, someone might get outed\u201d. The Heartstopper kids are oddly conservative and rule-abiding for a generation that is so laissez-faire \u2013 especially when it comes to sexuality.Locke and Connor lock lips in \u2018Heartstopper\u2019 season two (Netflix)Coming out is used as a narrative device across the entirety of season two, with Nick continuously in a bind over who to come out to and when. While coming out obviously still exists, it is increasingly seen as unnecessary because fewer and fewer people cling to labels now, instead embracing fluidity. But in the world of Heartstopper, labels have never been more important \u2013 everyone has a stated identity. Sure, it makes it easier for queer fans to gravitate towards a character of corresponding sexuality or gender identity, but it just doesn\u2019t feel truthful. In season two, Nick decides to tell people about being bisexual at an end-of-year party, and his decision to make a point of where and when to come out feels plot-driven instead of organic \u2013 a way to stretch the season to eight episodes. In reality, though, many people simply do not care. From my experience, a lot of coming-out moments are now met with indifference, because more of us understand that our sexualities and gender identities are our own personal issues. Coming out is a process inherited from older queer generations, where it was more of a necessity, and it\u2019s odd that Heartstopper relies so heavily and uncritically on it.On a technical level, Heartstopper\u2019s second season is head and shoulders above its first \u2013 there\u2019s a confidence in the performances that wasn\u2019t there before \u2013 but it badly needs some grit to give its characters momentum. There is an emotional complexity to teenagers that Heartstopper circumvents, most apparent in a tin-eared confrontation between Charlie and his school bully, and despite some progress in season two, it feels like we\u2019ve only scratched the surface of these characters. Later on in the season, a needle drop of Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201cseven\u201d soundtracks the kids hanging out together and partying. It is a very sweet, on-point and of-the-moment depiction of Gen Z girls and gays simply vibing and living their lives. If only the show were capable of sustaining this energy in every episode."}, {"_id": "64cceb1a51ac3352961fa971", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/lizzo-banana-sex-show-amsterdam-b2387652.html", "primaryCategory": "News", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Lizzo talks about wanting to go to banana sex show in resurfaced video", "lead": "<p>Singer is seen laughing and miming eating a banana in 2019 interview </p>", "author": "Ellie Harrison", "datePublished": "2023-08-04 10:43:20", "dateScraped": "2023-08-04 14:12:10.490346", "dateUpdated": "2023-08-04T10:43:20+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/08/04/11/Screenshot%202023-08-04%20112246.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Roisin O\u2019Connor\u2019s free weekly newsletter Now Hear This for the inside track on all things musicGet our Now Hear This email for free\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

If that wasn\u2019t enough, there is also a humongous octopus, as well as primaeval lizards.The Meg movies are loosely based on the series of novels by Steve Alten, published during the Nineties.Despite its average reviews from viewers and critics, The Meg performed well at the box office when it was released in 2018, grossing $530m (\u00a3417m) worldwide.RecommendedNetflix leaves fans distraught as it announces end of beloved seriesRadio 1\u2019s Arielle Free \u2018suspended\u2019 after live altercation with fellow DJ Charlie Hedges: \u2018I\u2019m taking your mic down\u2019Lizzo lawsuit \u2013 latest: Ex-dancers condemn singer\u2019s \u2018disheartening\u2019 response to sexual harassment claimsThe scathing reviews for its sequel, however, have a lot more bite.In a two- star review of the film, Digital Spy writes that \u201cthe sequel forgets it\u2019s a shark movie\u201d, warning that those wanting \u201cbig-screen shark carnage\u201d will be disappointed by the \u201cdull espionage thriller\u201d that unfolds.Echoing the same sentiment, The BBC wrote that Meg 2 \u201cdoesn\u2019t know what it is, other than a movie sort of like that first movie, but messier\u201d.Film Review - Meg 2: The Trench (\u00a9 2023 Warner Bros.

Hudson has not, to date, announced any news that the series is close to production.Responding to those concerns, Baker has released a statement saying he is returning the donated money as the project remains stalled indefinitely following Covid delays and Hollywood strikes.Recommended\u2018I was inconsolable\u2019: Game of Thrones star shares honest thoughts on last two seasonsRadio 1 listeners divided as Arielle Free is \u2018suspended\u2019 for one week after tense on-air exchangeEdinburgh Fringe actor consoled by Jason Manford and Dara O\u2019Briain after tearful post\u201cWe apologise about the delay in updates,\u201d Baker said. \u201cWe have been working behind the scenes to get everything on track\u2026\u201cWe are just as excited as all of you to get this project out and truly appreciate all of your patience and support.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeBy now, we all know the feeling of dread that accompanies the news that your favourite celebrity might be problematic. For Lizzo fans, that feared moment came this week. Three ex-dancers for the \u201cAbout Damn Time\u201d singer sued her for alleged sexual harassment and creating a harmful work environment. Lizzo denied the allegations two days later, referring to the accounts as \u201cfalse\u201d and \u201csensationalised stories\u201d. Still, when the news first broke, the stomachs of fans around the world plummeted. Not Lizzo, I despaired. She\u2019s everyone\u2019s fave! Queen of simultaneous twerking and flute playing! The poster girl for self-empowerment! These reports sent fans like me into a crisis \u2013 could this really be true?The lawsuit, which names the singer, her production company and the captain of her dance troupe, Shirlene Quigley, alleges instances of shaming dancers for weight gain, pressuring dancers to touch nude performers during a trip to a strip club, and subjecting some dancers to a brutal 12-hour \u201creaudition\u201d to keep their jobs. Arianna Davis, one of the plaintiffs, claims to have soiled herself in the process, after being afraid that she\u2019d lose her job if she asked for a bathroom break.The detailed reports of the accusations lodged against Lizzo make for a harrowing read. Mere hours after the news emerged, other former employees and collaborators voiced their support for the accusers, as well as their own accounts of feeling \u201cdisrespected\u201d and \u201cgaslit\u201d while working with the singer. In her response, Lizzo stated that while she doesn\u2019t want to be seen as a victim, she is \u201cnot the villain that people and the media have portrayed me to be these last few days\u201d. The nature of these complaints would certainly be upsetting if they\u2019d been about any celebrity. Attached to Lizzo, however, they\u2019re devastating \u2013 because they\u2019re exactly the kinds of qualities she\u2019s spent her whole career standing against. The singer, born Melissa Jefferson, has been known as a beacon of body image positivity and mental wellness. She frequently peppers her pop music with messages of self-love, acceptance and the euphoria that comes with it. \u201cIn case nobody told you today, you\u2019re special,\u201d she sings in the title track of her 2022 album. \u201cBoss up and change your life / You can have it all, no sacrifice,\u201d she encourages listeners in \u201cGood as Hell\u201d. And, of course, in \u201cTruth Hurts\u201d, she inspired countless others to declare themselves \u201c100 per cent that b****\u201d. For legions of fans, whether they were watching her at her recent sold-out arena tour or during her five-star Glastonbury set, there has been power and affirmation in the words she sings.As a plus-sized Black woman, Lizzo is something of an anomaly in the contemporary pop landscape. Since her entry into the industry around a decade ago, she\u2019s been vocal about how hard she works to love herself in a world that quickly seeks to tell her that the way she looks isn\u2019t good enough. She has shown vulnerability in admitting how much the comments get to her, and how hard it can be to brush them off. Still, instead of cowering from fatphobic and racist critiques, Lizzo shouts louder about how her \u201cthick thighs save lives\u201d, and posts bikini pictures \u2013 inspiring many others to do the same. RecommendedLizzo lawsuit \u2013 latest: Singer hits back at \u2018sensationalised stories\u2019 from dancers alleging sexual harassmentLizzo: The poster girl for body positivity, whose empowering image is now under threatLizzo breaks silence and says dancers\u2019 lawsuit claims are \u2018false\u2019To many, Lizzo is a best friend, a big sister, a champion for anyone who needs it \u2013 it\u2019s an identity she\u2019s embraced. The allegations sting precisely because of this persona, making them all the more painful and confusing to her fans. These accounts are in direct opposition to the personality on which she\u2019s built her name. Suddenly, the messages of sunshine and self-worth feel tainted when you consider that the figure so many love could actually be a fabrication.Having seen Lizzo live three times, I have always been moved by seeing her command the stage with her dancers, the Big Grrrls. You realise how rare it is to see bigger bodies as the standard \u2013 not in place as gimmicks or tokens, but as the main, celebrated event. But as much as her centring of bigger bodies has done for body positivity, the accusations of her aiming veiled critiques about a dancer\u2019s weight gain directly contradict her work.It\u2019s unsurprising for celebrities\u2019 front-facing persona to differ slightly behind the scenes. Fame, as we know, can be a breeding ground for bad behaviour, putting people into lofty positions of power. But Lizzo has built her brand on kindness, safety and acceptance; accusations that her behind-the-scenes conduct might be the opposite of these qualities is disappointing at best, and utterly deceitful at worst.Lizzo at Glastonbury 2023  (Photo by OLI SCARFF/AFP via Getty Images)In her statement, Lizzo dismissed the claims as \u201cunbelievable\u201d and \u201coutrageous\u201d, and explained that her passion means that she values hard work and high standards. \u201cSometimes I have to make hard decisions but it\u2019s never my intention to make anyone feel uncomfortable or like they aren\u2019t valued as an important part of the team,\u201d she wrote in a statement, later adding that she would \u201cabsolutely never\u201d criticise an employee\u2019s weight, or terminate their employment because of it. \u201cI know what it feels like to be body shamed on a daily basis,\u201d she noted. Of course, the movements of body positivity, anti-racism and women\u2019s rights don\u2019t rest solely on one person \u2013 the encouraging messages Lizzo has shared in the past are still valid, whatever the outcome of the lawsuit. As we all wait for more details to emerge, it\u2019s too early to say what this situation means for our love of Lizzo and her music going forward. It\u2019s always hard to hear of harmful behaviour from someone we admire. But because of just how much joy and inspiration Lizzo has sparked over the years, this one really hurts."}, {"_id": "64cceb1c51ac3352961fa97a", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/lizzo-sued-by-dancers-statement-b2387431.html", "primaryCategory": "News", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Lizzo\u2019s former dancers react to singer\u2019s \u2018disheartening\u2019 denial against allegations", "lead": "<p>\u2018Truth Hurts\u2019 singer has been accused of inappropriate conduct by three former employees </p>", "author": "Inga Parkel", "datePublished": "2023-08-04 03:23:41", "dateScraped": "2023-08-04 14:12:12.816117", "dateUpdated": "2023-08-04T03:23:41+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/08/02/12/Lizzo-Lawsuit-Arianna-Davis-Big-Grrrls.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Roisin O\u2019Connor\u2019s free weekly newsletter Now Hear This for the inside track on all things musicGet our Now Hear This email for free\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Yes, the Edinburgh Fringe \u2013 the world\u2019s biggest arts festival \u2013 is back, with performers of all types descending upon the Scottish capital for a summer of late nights, long walks and lols.While this year\u2019s Fringe programme might be a bit lacking on the household name front (many of them choosing to give this year\u2019s festival a miss or perform at the first Roundhouse Comedy Festival instead), 2023\u2019s festival provides a great opportunity for punters to take a chance and discover their new favourite performers. Here you\u2019ll find first-timers arriving to make their reputations, some returning stars of 2022 and a few festival stalwarts, all hoping to produce the next hit of the Fringe.I\u2019m always a big proponent of opening the Fringe guide on a random page and picking an act with the stab of a finger \u2013 or the 2023 version of randomly selecting a show on the thankfully returned app (yes, it\u2019s back after being controversially axed last year). However, for anyone looking for recommendations, here are 10 shows worth seeing at this year\u2019s Fringe.RecommendedFrom The Last of Us to The Bear: Why are the best TV episodes always the ones without the main characters?Please: no Gavin & Stacey reunionMiss Succession? The Righteous Gemstones is another feuding family TV drama for the agesChristopher Bliss: An Evening with Christopher BlissIt won\u2019t stop raining and the rental market is a mess \u2013 2023 has been tough on all of us, so who better to guide you through an hour of August than the softly-spoken Christopher Bliss. The creation of character comedian Rob Carter, Bliss \u2013 \u201cShropshire\u2019s worst novelist\u201d and a \u201cson-of-two\u201d \u2013 is a sweet, small-town boy with big dreams. But don\u2019t let his demure delivery trick you; among the poetry and lighthearted audience interaction, you\u2019ll find a set packed with comedy gold.Monkey Barrel Comedy, 3-10 August, 4.45pmHello Kitty Must DieHello Kitty Must Die, based on Angela S Choi\u2019s novel of the same name, is a dark comedy about Asian-American identity. The titular girl-cat hybrid represents the pressures placed on the lead by her duel identities, in a musical described during its New York run as \u201cAli Wong meets American Psycho\u201d. Sign us up.Pleasance Courtyard, 3-27 August (not 8 and 22), 4.50pmMarjolein Robertson: MarjScottish comedian Marjolein Robertson returns to the Fringe with a hell of a lot of hype. Last year, she was a finalist in both the BBC New Comedy and Funny Women Awards, mining her upbringing on the island of Shetland for all its worth with a side-splitting routine about showing up to uni with a suitcase full of lamb meat (from her parents\u2019 farm, naturally). Her 2022 Fringe run sold out and she\u2019s back this year with a new show recommended by Fringe royalty Frankie Boyle. Stardom, I suspect, is imminent.The Stand Comedy Club, 3-28 August (not 14), 5pmBangersPart-theatrical performance, part-UK garage club night, Danusia Samal\u2019s Bangers incorporates original rap and R&B tracks into its coming-of-age story. We follow two teenagers coming of age amid London\u2019s hectic nightlife, in this pacey play that debuted at Soho Theatre last year.Roundabout @ Summerhall, 2-27 August (not 8, 15 and 22), 6.50pmAn Evening of Mayhem with Meg StalterNo one does delusion quite like the US comic Meg Stalter. Online, Stalter specialises in cringe characters, from the \u201ccool girl\u201d attempting to flirt while playing pool at a bar to the corporations greeting that attempts to appeal to LGBT+ customers with the words: \u201cHi, gay\u201d during Pride Month. On stage, Stalter infuses those same excruciating character traits into her stand-up, pushing her on-stage persona to an 11. As you watch the Hacks star, expect to laugh and squirm in equal measure.Gilded Balloon Teviot, 12-27 (not 24), 8.30pmEmmanuel Sonubi: Curriculum VitaeThe antithesis of those twentysomethings who have \u201cnever wanted to do anything but comedy\u201d, Emmanuel Sonubi has lived one hell of a life. The comic only recently fell into stand-up, but has quickly carved a name out for himself, his past lives not only providing him with material but an ease on stage. In his 2022 show Emancipation, which earned him a Best Newcomer nomination at the Edinburgh Comedy Awards, Sonubi spoke about his time as a nightclub bouncer and background in musical theatre, while Curriculum Vitae will see him discuss his other trajectories. The term \u201cclub comic\u201d is sometimes used as a pejorative, but you\u2019ll struggle to find a slicker crowd-pleaser than Sonubi.Underbelly Bristo Square, 2-28 August (not 14), 8.10pmEmmanuel Sonubi  (BBC)Patrick McPherson: The Way, Way DeepOne year after he swept the Fringe with his solo show Colossal, the writer and actor Patrick McPherson is back with his new one-man play The Way, Way Deep. Interweaving theatre, comedy, music and spoken word, McPherson\u2019s explores ideas around friendship, memory and the experience of being in your mid-twenties.Underbelly Cowgate, 3-27 August (not 14), 5.20pmCatherine Cohen: Come for MeThere are certain things you expect from a Catherine Cohen show: her luxuriating old Hollywood drawl, the bejewelled outfits, the confessional comedy songs. The US comedian provided this all in her award-winning debut Fringe hour The Twist\u2026? She\u2019s Gorgeous (since turned into a Netflix special), and brings it back by the bucketload with her new show, Come for Me. Expect candid sex stories and millennial angst, put to a lilting jazzy melody and served with a smile.Pleasance Courtyard, 14-27 August (not 22 and 23), 10.30pmMat Ewins: Mr TikTokIn 2022, the Edinburgh Fringe was flooded with \u201cTikTok comedians\u201d of varying quality. Then there was Mat Ewins \u2013 the creme-de-la-creme of wacky video comedy, despite him having virtually no online presence. In Mr TikTok, the comedian (ignore the \u201cventriloquism\u201d and \u201cflamenco\u201d categories on his Fringe site listing) expands with his specialist brand of multimedia comedy, as he continues his quest to become \u201cthe king of online\u201d. Despite Ewins having more than a decade of Fringe shows under his belt, he still feels like a comedian\u2019s comedian. Being a fan, I promise, will earn you serious Fringe kudos.Monkey Barrel Comedy, 2-27 August, 9.15pmKathy and Stella Solve A MurderRecommendedSteve-O: \u2018It occurred to me I could probably fire a bullet through my cheeks\u2019Rachel Bloom: \u2018AI will be a good writer when it has the trauma of hating itself\u2019Janey Godley: \u2018I always had to fight. I always had to argue\u2019 Has the world had enough of true crime? Not if Kathy and Stella, the stars of Hull\u2019s least successful murder podcast, have anything to do with it! In this comedy musical, which originally appeared in a shorter run in 2022, the two women put their sleuthing to the test as they\u2019re tasked with solving an actual IRL murder. With the team behind previous Fringe hits Baby Reindeer, A Super Happy Story (About Feeling Super Sad), and a little show called Fleabag at the helm, this new musical feels like a surefire winner.Underbelly George Square, 2-27 August, 7.30pm"}, {"_id": "64cceb1f51ac3352961fa986", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/leah-remini-scientology-david-miscavige-lawsuit-b2386617.html", "primaryCategory": "News", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Church of Scientology calls Leah Remini a \u2018bigot\u2019 in response to lawsuit over alleged \u2018psychological torture\u2019", "lead": "<p>\u2018King of Queens\u2019 actor was a member of the controversial organised religion for 35 years before leaving in 2013 </p>", "author": "Inga Parkel", "datePublished": "2023-08-04 05:18:13", "dateScraped": "2023-08-04 14:12:15.964764", "dateUpdated": "2023-08-04T05:18:13+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/08/02/20/Copy%20of%20IndependentPhoto_TEMPLATE%20%281%29.png?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free IndyArts newsletter for all the latest entertainment news and reviewsSign up to our free IndyArts newsletter\n\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Since leaving, she has made numerous claims about the church\u2019s controversial activities in her 2016 book Troublemaker: Surviving Hollywood and Scientology and the Emmy-winning docuseries Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath.In its statement, the church called the actor \u201can anti-free speech bigot\u201d.RecommendedRadio 1\u2019s Arielle Free pulled off air and \u2018suspended\u2019 after live altercation with fellow DJ Charlie HedgesOppenheimer fans point out \u2018disturbing\u2019 shot going unnoticed by many viewersLizzo lawsuit \u2013 latest: Former staff support dancers accusing star of sexual harassment and fat-shaming\u201cIf Remini can no longer get a job, she has nobody to blame but herself,\u201d the Church continued. \u201cObviously everybody in Hollywood now knows what we already knew: That Remini is a horrible person and toxic to so many who have the misfortune to come in contact with her.\u201dRead the Church\u2019s full statement here.Remini\u2019s legal action is a self-described \u201cattempt to end what she alleges are mob-style operations and attacks on her and other alleged victims and survivors of the Church of Scientology and their advocates\u201d.Leah Remini and David Miscavige (Getty Images)\u201cThe lawsuit seeks to require Scientology, and any entity it controls and funds, to cease and desist its alleged practice of harassment, defamation, and other unlawful conduct against anyone who Scientology has labelled as an \u2018enemy\u2019,\u201d the press release continues. \u201cIt also requests compensatory and punitive damages to compensate Remini for the harm she alleges Scientology has inflicted on her and her career.\u201dIt adds: \u201cThe lawsuit lays out the myriad of ways in which Scientology leaders and agents, beginning in 2006, seven years before Remini left Scientology, allegedly financed and ordered coordinated campaigns against Remini, her family, friends, businesses partners, associates, advertisers, proposed future advertisers, future employers and support office staff who have never even met her.\u201dWatch Apple TV+ free for 7 daysNew subscribers only. \u00a36.99/mo. after free trial.

The plaintiffs have accused Lizzo of assault, disability discrimination, and sexual harassment in the lawsuit seen by The Independent. They have questioned the way they were terminated from Lizzo\u2019s production company Big Grrrl Big Touring Inc. In the filed complaint, the dancers accused Lizzo of calling attention to Davis\u2019 weight gain and later berating and then firing her \u201con the spot\u201d after she recorded a meeting because of a health condition.Lizzo accepts the Record Of The Year award for \u2018About Damn Time\u2019 at the 2023 Grammys (Getty Images for The Recording Academy)When Rodriguez objected to Lizzo\u2019s treatment of Davis, and resigned from the cast, Lizzo allegedly \u201caggressively approached\u201d Rodriquez, who said she thought the 35-year-old would have hit her if one of the other dancers hadn\u2019t intervened.Enjoy unlimited access to 70 million ad-free songs and podcasts with Amazon MusicSign up now for a 30-day free trialSign upEnjoy unlimited access to 70 million ad-free songs and podcasts with Amazon MusicSign up now for a 30-day free trialSign upThe accusers have testified to the \u201csexually charged and uncomfortable environment\u201d they were allegedly forced to endure while working with Lizzo and her dance captain and co-defendant Quigley. It is claimed Lizzo \u201cbegan inviting cast members to take turns touching the nude performers, catching dildos launched from the performers\u2019 vaginas, and eating bananas protruding from the performers\u2019 vaginas\u201d during a visit to a strip club in Amsterdam. She allegedly pressured Davis \u201ctouch the breasts [of] one of the nude women\u201d by \u201cleading a chant goading\u201d her. \u201cFinally, the chorus became overwhelming, and a mortified Ms Davis acquiesced in an attempt to bring an end to the chants,\u201d the 44-page lawsuit states. Lizzo allegedly \u201cbadgered\u201d a member of her security team to get on stage where \u201chis pants were pulled down\u201d. \u201cPlaintiffs were aghast with how little regard Lizzo showed for the bodily autonomy of her employees and those around her, especially in the presence of many people whom she employed,\u201d the lawsuit reads.Lizzo performing at Glastonbury 2023  (Photo by OLI SCARFF/AFP via Getty Images)It is alleged the dancers underwent a \u201cbrutal\u201d re-audition after Lizzo became convinced the cast had been drinking before shows, citing their poor performances. Davis claims she soiled herself because she was fearful of taking a washroom break during the 12-hour rehearsal. When she found an interval to change into clean clothes, the wardrobe department allegedly gave her a see-through garment.\u201c[She] was required to finish the rehearsal, dancing in front of male crew members who were known to sexualise the dancers under less revealing scenarios, while wearing completely transparent shorts and no undergarments,\u201d according to the lawsuit. Davis claims Lizzo and her choreographer made \u201cthinly veiled\u201d references to her weight gain, which the singer had allegedly \u201cpreviously called attention to after noticing it at the South by Southwest music festival\u201d.She said she felt she needed to explain her weight gain in order to keep her job, and was \u201churt and emotionally drained by being forced\u201d into disclosing she had been diagnosed with binge eating disorder. Lizzo is said to have offered her time off from rehearsals, but Davis declined because she didn\u2019t want to be seen as \u201ctoo weak\u201d to continue performing with the crew.\u2018Sensationalised stories\u2019 from former employeesNews of the lawsuit shocked fans of Lizzo, a champion of the body positivity movement and women\u2019s rights. Two days later, the singer said the lawsuit was full of \u201csensationalised stories coming from former employees who have already publicly admitted they were told their behaviour on tour was inappropriate and unprofessional\u201d. She continued: \u201cI take my music and my performances seriously because at the end of the day I only want to put out the best art that represents me and my fans. \u201cWith passion comes hard work and high standards,\u201d Lizzo added. \u201cSometimes I have to make hard decisions but it\u2019s never my intention to make anyone feel uncomfortable or like they aren\u2019t valued as an important part of the team.\u201d The \u201cJuice\u201d singer stressed that she does not want to be seen \u201cas a victim\u201d, but added: \u201cI am not the villain that people and the media have portrayed me to be these last few days.\u201d She denied fat-shaming any of her employees, and shared she felt \u201churt\u201d by the claims against her, while expressing her gratitude for the support she has received.\u201cI\u2019m hurt but I will not let the good work I\u2019ve done in the world be overshadowed by this.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeFrench cinema reigns supreme in August, with not one, but three placements on our list of the five best films to watch in cinemas.Now the Barbenheimer craze is in motion and, judging by the box office takings, far from slowing down,\u00a0it\u2019s time to look to the month ahead.There\u2019s fun to be had with Theatre Camp (25 August), a Christopher Guest-inspired mockumentary from directors Nick Lieberman and Molly Gordon, the latter of whom can currently be seen playing the love interest to Jeremy Allen White\u2019s Carmy in acclaimed series The Bear. It\u2019s a reunion-of-sorts, too, as Ayo Edebiri, who plays Sydney in The Bear, has a small role in the comedy squarely aimed at musical theatre lovers. Also deserving of a mention is Kokomo City (4 August), D Smith\u2019s documentary about four Black trans sex workers living in Atlanta and New York City, which explores the persistent threat of violence they face each day.It\u2019s worth noting that Curzon has lauched a Lars Von Trier retrospective, with screenings of Breaking the Waves (4 August) and The Idiots (18 August), while Serpico, the Al Pacino drama from 1973, is receiving a 50th anniversary 4K restoration re-release (also 18 August).RecommendedLizzo lawsuit \u2013 latest: Singer hits back at \u2018sensationalised stories\u2019 from dancers alleging sexual harassmentRadio 1\u2019s Arielle Free \u2018suspended\u2019 after live altercation with fellow DJ Charlie Hedges: \u2018I\u2019m taking your mic down\u2019Taylor Swift and Beyonc\u00e9 fans speak out about sale of \u2018obstructed\u2019 and \u2018no view\u2019 tour ticketsBut below are the five films we think you should prioritise next time you\u2019re planning a trip to the cinema.Lie with MeRelease date: 18 AugustA gentle but no less compelling film from Olivier Peyon, Lie with Me explores the idea of young love cut short and the ripples it causes across the passage of time. It\u2019s based on Philippe Besson\u2019s gay romance novel of the same, published in 2017, and follows Guillaume de Tonqu\u00e9dec\u2019s author as he\u2019s faced with memories of his first love when he returns to his childhood village to promote his new book. The film might have a gloomy undercurrent, but there\u2019s reprieve in the form of the tender performances from de Tonqu\u00e9dec, J\u00e9r\u00e9my Gillet and Victor Belmondo, grandson of French icon Jean-Paul Belmondo.StraysRelease date: 18 AugustFor something a bit different this month, try Strays \u2013 a comedy that might initially seem like a family-friendly film to be enjoyed with your kids, but is... well, not that. The plot follows an abandoned dog (voiced by Will Ferrell), who teams up with other beer-drinking, sofa-humping strays to get revenge on his former owner (Will Forte). In the words of Jamie Foxx\u2019s Bug: \u201cWe\u2019re going to f*** s*** up.\u201d It\u2019s not going to win awards, but Strays, directed by Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar\u2019s Josh Greenbaum, promises to be a fun night out with your friends.The InnocentRelease date: 25 AugustRoschdy Zem and Louis Garrel in 'The Innocent' (Metfilm Distribution)After five directorial efforts, French actor Louis Garrel has made his best film yet. The Innocent is a zippy crime thriller parading as a simple family drama about a son (Garrel) who\u2019s concerned that his mother\u2019s new love interest (Roschdy Zem), an ex-prisoner recently released from jail, is up to no good. The film jumps from twist to twist, albeit in a captivating way, and changes genres in front of your very eyes. Garrel and Zem turn in effective performances, but they wouldn\u2019t work quite so well without Anouk Grinberg and No\u00e9mie Merlant as Garrel\u2019s mother and close friend, respectively.Watch Apple TV+ free for 7 daysNew subscribers only. \u00a36.99/mo. after free trial.

Plan auto-renews until cancelledTry for freeScrapperRelease date: 25 AugustTo compare Scrapper to Aftersun, which many are doing, is to do the film a disservice. On the surface, the plot lines are similar \u2013 it\u2019s focused on an errant father (Harris Dickinson) reuniting with his young daughter (newcomer Lola Campbell) \u2013 but Scrapper has its own strain of DNA to recommend it without comparison, however glowing. The lively film is filled with optimistim as Lola is shown warming to her father when he returns home following the death of her mother (Olivia Brady, dazzling in her scenes). It\u2019s a pleasant debut from director Charlotte Regan.AfireRelease date: 25 AugustThomas Schuber and Paula beer in 'Afire' (The Match Factory)The best new film of the month marks a return to form for German filmmaker Christian Petzold after the underwhelming Undine (2020). In fact, Afire is up there with his best (see: Jerichow, 2008; Phoenix, 2014). It\u2019s an intriguing success from Petzold, whose film is fronted by a cold, uptight and struggling author, played by Thomas Schubert \u2013 and it\u2019s proof that not every lead character has to be instantly likeable for something to be enjoyed.

The piano survived several house moves, took center stage at his mansion, and was the heart of Mercury's musical and personal story from 1975 until his death, auctioneers said Thursday.\u201cOf all the objects that he had, this is the one that meant the most to him,\u201d said Gabriel Heaton, a specialist at the auction house.Other highlights include Mercury's art collection, featuring works by Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dali and Marc Chagall; handwritten invitations to his birthday bashes and dinner parties \u2014 including one dated 1977 that instructed guests to \"Dress to Kill!\u201d; and his eclectic collections of antique furniture, Japanese kimonos and cat figurines. \u201c(Mercury) wrote this: \u2018I like to be surrounded by splendid things. I want to lead a Victorian life, surrounded by exquisite clutter,\u2019\u201d said Sotheby's specialist Thomas Williams. The hundreds of items have turned the auction house's elegant central London building into a shrine to Mercury, with all 15 of its galleries devoted to his story. It is the first time Sotheby's is opening its entire gallery space to the public for the weekslong exhibition, Williams said, adding it is perhaps its \u201cmost democratic sale,\" with items like Mercury's chopsticks and sewing kit starting at under 100 pounds ($125) each. The exhibition, which is free to view, opens Friday and runs until Sept. 5.

What we thought were flashbacks are, in fact, flash-forwards \u2013 her daughter is yet to be born.Atonement (2007)The set-up: Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan) falsely accuses the housekeeper\u2019s son (James McAvoy) of raping her cousin when she becomes jealous of his relationship with her older sister (Keira Knightley).

After he kills them, he is crowned by the cultists.Memento (2000)The set-up: Leonard (Guy Pearce) is tracking down the man who raped and murdered his wife.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeIn the dirty-minded yet sweet-toothed comedy Joy Ride, athletic threesomes and balloons of cocaine stuffed up internal cavities help resolve the tricky battles of identity and self-image. Crazy Rich Asians screenwriter Adele Lim, in her directorial debut, works off a script by Family Guy\u2019s Cherry Chevapravatdumrong and Teresa Hsiao, for a film about reckless, luckless people you can\u2019t help but fall in love with.The film starts with a comedy staple: the odd couple besties. Lawyer Audrey (Ashley Park) is strait-laced and high achieving, while artist Lolo (Sherry Cola) is free and foul-mouthed. It\u2019s a simple set-up fleshed out by more intricate character work \u2013 Audrey was adopted in China by white, American parents. To Lolo, her love of Mumford & Sons, among other things, makes her \u201cbasically white\u201d. Her work involves laughing off her all-male, all-white office\u2019s feeble attempts at \u201callyship\u201d (case in point: they threw her a Mulan-themed birthday party).Lolo, meanwhile, was raised by Chinese immigrant parents. She\u2019s more familiar and more plainly comfortable with her identity. And yet, the sculptures she makes \u2013 sexually explicit versions of traditional imagery, like waving maneki-neko cat figures with gigantic, lolling tongues \u2013 still hint at some buried tension. Ashley has convinced her employers that she\u2019s fluent in Mandarin and so invites Lolo along on a business trip to Beijing to be her furtive guide. Lolo, in turn, invites her K-pop-obsessed, permanently expressionless cousin Deadeye (Sabrina Wu). Once in Beijing, Audrey brings the trio to meet her old college roommate, Kat (Everything Everywhere All at Once\u2019s Stephanie Hsu), the star of a popular, local melodrama. She\u2019s engaged to a devout Christian (Desmond Chiam) who is clueless about his beloved\u2019s sexual history or fondness for vaginal tattoos.Joy Ride is a full-blooded, gross-out comedy. But its jokes about upchucking thousand-year-old eggs or masturbating to Splinter from the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles serve a double purpose \u2013 the punchlines are funny and weird enough to prod at the messiness of dual identities, and the backwards presumptions people have about Audrey, and that Audrey has about China. Her rush to cosy up with the one white, English speaker on a busy train backfires spectacularly. Lim keeps pace with the script, especially when the film barrels headfirst into a K-pop cover of Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion\u2019s \u201cWAP\u201d, which serves as a triumphant ode to cross-cultural horniness.Hsu and Cola balance the mania well against Park\u2019s straight woman sincerity, but it\u2019s Wu, a rising star on the standup scene, who serves as Joy Ride\u2019s surprise MVP. Deadeye is a gender-nonconforming (Wu themself is non-binary), clearly autistic-coded character who, in almost any other comedy film, would serve as the sideline weirdo who cracks a few jokes and then disappears into the background. But Deadeye, even as a supporting character, is given space to explore their gender identity, confront feelings of alienation from their family, act as the neutral ground between bickering friends, and find validation in the social bonds of fandom. That\u2019s the joy of a dumb-smart comedy like Joy Ride \u2013 its humanity sneaks around the corner and catches you unprepared.RecommendedTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem review \u2013 Hyper-aware, affectionate and colourfulTalk to Me review: A neat and nasty Australian horror that dares you to touch a mummified handThe Beanie Bubble review: Apple TV+ movie struggles to extract feminist heroics from a toy crazeDir: Adele Lim.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticePost Malone is the first to admit he doesn\u2019t know when to stop. His fifth album \u2013 Austin \u2013 finds the 28-year-old rapper getting frank about his ongoing quest for the next drink, pill, car, thrill. But it\u2019s a producer\u2019s job to hold up that stop sign. Alas Austin\u2019s main producers, Andrew Watt and Louis Bell, haven\u2019t been able to get Posty to quit on an album that\u2019s been allowed to sprawl on for 18, self-pitying pop-rock tracks. So, although this is a record that was clearly meant to find its star getting personal \u2013 using his birth name for a title and playing (often acoustic) guitar throughout \u2013 the emotional and melodic connection becomes too diluted to sustain a connection with the listener. You drift off the way you would listening to even your most fascinating friend repeating themselves on a drunken loop. Taxi for Posty!This said, there\u2019s good stuff on Austin. It opens with the tender \u201cDon\u2019t Understand\u201d, on which Malone picks ruefully reverberating acoustic as he heads towards a catchy-sad chorus that runs: \u201cI don\u2019t understand how you like me so much/ Cos I don\u2019t like myself.\u201d The song is a terrific showcase for Malone\u2019s vocals that tremble, stretch, yearn, scratch, soothe, ache, shiver and sigh through the raw self-loathing that counterpoints the pretty string arrangements. \u201cSomething Real\u201d brings the stadium-sized synths and a walloping great humble-brag lament that the trappings of global pop celebrity can\u2019t heal a sore soul. Who knew that sipping burgundy in the Maldives or wearing Prada underpants couldn\u2019t make a man happy? Or that a philosophy of \u201cthrow a mil at it, throw a pill at it\u201d wouldn\u2019t solve his problems? Malone\u2019s wordplay does bring some originality to the old story of the sorrowful celeb, though and there\u2019s a neat moment where he references Beethoven\u2019s \u201cF\u00fcr Elise\u201d and then twists his own melody to echo the 17th-century semitones.Sonically, Austin sees Malone moving away from the glitchy trap and hip-hop with which he made his name. Instead, he goes straight for the pop-rock formulae. This would have worked better over a shorter span, but yawning as it does on the same mid-tempo pacing means that tracks blur to filler and some good lines get lost in the sludge. The lack of guest vocalists doesn\u2019t help either. Single \u201cChemical\u201d lifts this pace and features a neat, sing-along-a-chorus of \u201cOutside of the party, smokin\u2019 in the car with you/ Seven Nation Army, fightin\u2019 at the bar with you\u201d. But it\u2019s not all that interesting. Ditto \u201cSign Me Up\u201d on which Malone vows to walk over dead bodies and join a cult for a girl, only to ditch her when she threatens to separate him from his true love: booze. \u201cGreen Thumb\u201d is a quirkier acoustic number on which he also affirms that his one true love is, in fact, brandy. Although in a recent interview with Zane Lowe, Malone credited his fianc\u00e9e and the mother of his infant daughter with helping him pull back from his bad habits.I preferred the more arresting thud-squelch electronica of \u201cTexas Tea\u201d, although lyrically it delivers more of the woe-is-me rockstar stuff (\u201cBaby wanna bone me/ record companies really tryna clone me\u201d). And there\u2019s a cool cruise to the sly R&B of \u201cSpeedometer\u201d, which locks into a smooth Eighties AM radio gear with just a flicker of a strum slipped into the mix. There\u2019s no question Malone can keep delivering the hooks. He just needs to stop slopping them out like pop\u2019s free bar and concentrate on making fewer, more distinctly delicious cocktails."}, {"_id": "64cceb2b51ac3352961fa9ac", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/tv-streaming-ofcom-netflix-bbc-b2387033.html", "primaryCategory": "Features", "subCategories": "test", "title": "I don\u2019t own a television \u2013 and I write about TV for a living", "lead": "<p>As a new report reveals that traditional broadcast TV audiences have seen the sharpest fall since records began, Ellie Harrison shares what life\u2019s like without a telly</p>", "author": "Ellie Harrison", "datePublished": "2023-08-03 12:44:22", "dateScraped": "2023-08-04 14:12:27.085599", "dateUpdated": "2023-08-03T12:44:22+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/08/03/13/newFile-2.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free IndyArts newsletter for all the latest entertainment news and reviewsSign up to our free IndyArts newsletter\n\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeBefore 2007 \u2013 the year of the Motorola Razr2, Preston storming off Never Mind the Buzzcocks and the launch of a then little-known streaming site called Netflix \u2013 the number one requirement when applying for a job in TV journalism would have been: own a television. That was before the streaming era began in earnest. BBC iPlayer also arrived in 2007. Sky\u2019s NOW came in 2012 and Amazon\u2019s platform followed in 2014. Channel 4\u2019s 4OD was actually ahead of the curve, having launched in 2006 (it later rebranded to All4 but no one noticed). A long while later, in 2019, I started writing about TV for The Independent \u2013 and not one day of the past four years has a TV graced my living room. This has not been a particularly conscious move \u2013 I\u2019m not against having a telly, I\u2019ve just never really got around to it \u2013 but today I\u2019ve discovered it may be an increasingly common one: a new Ofcom report has revealed that the number of viewers tuning in to watch broadcast television each week has seen the sharpest fall since records began. The proportion of people watching traditional TV \u2013 scheduled programmes on linear channels such as BBC One or Channel 4 \u2013 each week declined from 83 per cent in 2021 to 79 per cent in 2022. Granted, this definitely doesn\u2019t mean that people don\u2019t own TVs \u2013 it just means that they are using them differently, for streaming and catch-up, and that there is probably a lot more viewing happening on computers and phones. Perhaps soon, though, television sets around the country will be replaced in our homes with candle clusters and cat climbing frames.When I watch TV, either because I\u2019m writing or editing a piece about a show, or\u2026 very occasionally, just for fun, I watch it on my laptop. Mostly prone on the sofa or my bed, sometimes during lunch breaks at work, or with one eye open after a night out, or while cooking something that requires minimal concentration. (But never on my phone or at 2x speed \u2013 I have to draw the line somewhere.) And I get access to TV through a chaotic mix of press previews (so I can watch shows ahead of release) and streaming accounts borrowed from a friend of a friend\u2019s ex-boyfriend who helpfully shared his login on a WhatsApp group three years ago. Thanks Dave. There are a few exceptions to this rule. If I\u2019m at my parents\u2019 house, do not be mistaken, we will be sitting down after dinner to watch Clive Myrie\u2019s solemn reporting on the News at Ten. And I prefer to watch Wimbledon or football on a TV at the pub. I do also own a projector, and if I\u2019m feeling fancy I\u2019ll switch that on. Especially for a nature series. Sometimes I just want to see a quivering, fuzzy albatross chick displayed across a whole wall of my flat. Not having a TV brings with it positives and negatives. The fan on my cheap projector is, well, deafening. I can see the baby albatross but I cannot hear its chirrups or David Attenborough\u2019s breathy rasp. And ITVX is about as reliable as Boris Johnson\u2019s memory. I have also woken up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat, frantically googling whether resting a laptop on your stomach for hours causes cancer.

And any good telly would take up a lot of real estate in my very modest living room. It\u2019s also one less thing to break when I move house this autumn. One less expense on the electricity bill. And best of all, I never lose the remote down the side of the sofa.

Just a couple of months ago, she lit up Glastonbury\u2019s Worthy Farm, performing a set that many said should have earned her a headliner slot. Building on two years of dominating the airwaves with her inspiring messages and impressive flute solos, Lizzo was at the top of her game. But new allegations of sexual harassment and fostering a hostile work environment have thrown that image into doubt. On Tuesday (1 August), three of Lizzo\u2019s former dancers accused her and her production company Big Grrrl Big Touring of a series of shocking claims \u2013 including fat-shaming, disability discrimination, false imprisonment, assault, and more. The lawsuit was filed by Arianna Davis and Crystal Williams, who competed on Lizzo\u2019s Amazon Prime reality series Watch Out for the Big Grrrls in 2021, and Noelle Rodriguez, who performed in the singer\u2019s \u201cRumors\u201d music video.It has long seemed as though Lizzo\u2019s rising star was unstoppable. The pop superstar, born Melissa Viviane Jefferson, has become not just one of the most adored names in music, but a fully-fledged global superstar, with numerous appearances on screen, her own aforementioned TV series and global tour, entitled \u201cThe Special Tour\u201d, which began last September.She\u2019s also won the hearts of millions with her sincerity and fervent wish for fans to love themselves, no matter what they look like. It\u2019s felt personal for her, Lizzo regularly addressing criticism of her weight and calling out bullies and trolls while advocating for Black women in the music industry. She\u2019s also condemned racism and the marginalisation of minority groups such as the LGBT+ community. Her songs have similarly become sing-along anthems for those who felt seen \u2013 and heard \u2013 by her.Dancers who filed lawsuit against Lizzo describe star's alleged 'weight-shaming'But the recent lawsuit threatens to send Lizzo\u2019s star hurtling back down to earth. The 44-page suit details claims that Lizzo allegedly \u201chounded\u201d her employees to \u201ctouch\u201d nude performers during a trip to Amsterdam strip club Bananenbar against their wishes. A separate incident alleges that the star made her dancers take part in an \u201cexcruciating\u201d 12-hour audition after accusing them of drinking before performances \u2013 with her later firing Williams after she had challenged the singer\u2019s assertion. Meanwhile, Davis also alleged that Lizzo told her she seemed \u201cless committed\u201d to her role in April, which she understood as a \u201cthinly veiled\u201d comment about her weight.RecommendedLizzo lawsuit \u2013 latest: Former staff support dancers accusing star of sexual harassment and fat-shamingLizzo: Did Beyonc\u00e9 change lyrics on her tour to omit singer\u2019s name amid sexual harassment claims?Dancer suing Lizzo suggested in 2021 she felt pressured to pose nude for singer\u2019s Big Grrrls reality showOn Thursday (3 August), Lizzo released a response to the allegations, calling them \u201cfalse\u201d and describing her former employees\u2019 claims as \u201cunbelievable\u201d and \u201coutrageous\u201d. She alluded to how it has impacted her, calling the days since the suit was filed \u201cgut-wrenchingly difficult and overwhelmingly disappointing\u201d. Likewise, the lawsuit sent shockwaves through her fandom and beyond. Many expressing their shock online are aghast at the details included in the 44 pages, allegations that do not seem to align with the pop star they thought they knew. Since news of the lawsuit broke, Lizzo\u2019s ex-colleagues, including another former dancer Courtney Holliquest, former creative director Quinn Wilson, and filmmaker Sophia Nahli Allison, have come forward to support it.In an Instagram Story, Allison, who was initially hired by Lizzo to direct her 2022 documentary Love, Lizzo, described the \u201cTruth Hurts\u201d singer as \u201carrogant, self-centred and unkind\u201d. This description is in sharp contrast with the personality that Lizzo shares with her fanbase, which often encourages kindness and consideration for others.\n\nThe term \u2018body positivity\u2019 only exists because of body shaming. People should naturally be body positive, and body positivity should be something that\u2019s built into our cultureLizzoLizzo\u2019s pre-fame beginnings were humble: while trying to break into the music industry, she lived and slept in her car for a year. This period of the star\u2019s life, which occurred at age 21 after the death of her father, contained \u201ctraumatic experiences\u201d for the singer, she has previously said. Speaking to Entertainment Weekly after her documentary was released, Lizzo said: \u201cI don\u2019t think about it often, but recently I thought about it a lot where I\u2019m having this full-circle moment of like, wow, I\u2019m in my house that I\u2019ve purchased and I\u2019m watching this documentary about my life, talking about when I was sleeping in my car and on Thanksgiving. It\u2019s very cyclical and full-circle.\u201d After moving to Minneapolis, Lizzo became a regular performer on the underground circuit as she performed with indie hip-hop groups. In 2013, she released her debut album Lizzobangers, which was described by The Guardian as \u201cat times joyfully nonsensical\u201d, with \u201clethally pointed\u201d rap bars. Reminiscing about her underground days during an appearance on YouTube series Hot Ones, Lizzo said: \u201cI dropped so many Lizzo bangers there and they supported me so f***ing much in Minneapolis.\u201dEnjoy unlimited access to 70 million ad-free songs and podcasts with Amazon MusicSign up now for a 30-day free trialSign upEnjoy unlimited access to 70 million ad-free songs and podcasts with Amazon MusicSign up now for a 30-day free trialSign upIt was all upwards for Lizzo from there. The following year, she was named by Time magazine as one of the 14 music artists to watch in 2014. In response to the killings of Jamar Clark in Minneapolis and 12-year-old Tamir Rice in Cleveland, Ohio, Lizzo wrote \u201cMy Skin\u201d for her subsequent album Big GRRRL Small World. The song was also about body image, as Lizzo wrote in Vice: \u201cThis is a summoning of bodies: all shapes, sizes and shades to unite in their pride, and wear their skin like the gift it is.\u201dBut it was after Lizzo wholeheartedly embraced a message of body positivity that she became a household name. Her next two albums, Coconut Oil and Cuz I Love You, sent her career stratospheric. \u201cGood as Hell\u201d, widely considered a huge self-love anthem, was released as the lead single from Coconut Oil and featured on the soundtrack for the 2016 film Barbershop: The Next Cut. Lizzo began speaking more openly about body positivity and self-love, and declared her intention to \u201cfight for the right to be you and to be beautiful and to be accepted\u201d.She told CBC Radio at the time: \u201cThe term \u2018body positivity\u2019 only exists because of body shaming. People should naturally be body positive, and body positivity should be something that\u2019s built into our culture.\u201d \u201cJuice\u201d, a pumped-up anthem bursting with confidence and self-esteem, went viral on TikTok and featured in the Netflix film Someone Great. \u201cTruth Hurts\u201d, also from Cuz I Love You, drew even more success and became her first No 1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100.A pre-fame Lizzo performs in 2016 (Getty)With \u201cTruth Hurts\u201d, Lizzo became the first Black solo female R&B singer to reach the peak of the Top 100 since Rihanna in 2012 with her track \u201cDiamonds\u201d. She performed at Coachella Music Festival for the first time, as well as with her flute at the 2019 BET Awards, earning her a standing ovation. She then played on the West Holts stage at Glastonbury. She also ventured into acting, playing a supporting role in Hustlers, which starred Jennifer Lopez and Constance Wu, and voicing a character in the animated film UglyDolls.Between 2020 and 2022, Lizzo continued to gain further recognition. She signed a production deal with Amazon Studios and released her reality series Lizzo\u2019s Watch Out for the Big Grrrls in 2022. The show saw 13 women \u2013 including Davis and Williams \u2013 competing to be dancers for Lizzo. It received six nominations at the 74th Primetime Emmy Awards in 2021, winning three of them. Last year, she also released her fourth studio album Special, which featured the hit song \u201cAbout Damn Time\u201d. However, she also courted controversy after fans complained about the use of the word \u201cspaz\u201d in her song \u201cGrrrls\u201d. She later replaced the lyric and said in a statement: \u201cAs a fat Black woman in America, I have had many hurtful words used against me so I understand the power words can have (whether intentionally, or in my case, unintentionally) \u2026 As an influential artist, I\u2019m dedicated to being part of the change I\u2019ve been waiting to see in the world.\u201dWhile that storm blew over quickly once Lizzo acknowledged the hurt caused by her lyric and acted swiftly to change things, the current lawsuit she faces has much wider and more damaging implications. Whether or not it will turn her army of fans against their favourite singer remains to be seen, as many are still processing her response to the allegations. Just last week, she was praised for speaking kindly to an 11-year-old girl who asked her to help her deal with online bullies during the Australian leg of her Special tour. Lizzo told the young girl: \u201cThe words that we say have a long-lasting effect on people.\u201d It may turn out that the singer realises this applies to her actions as well.RecommendedLizzo breaks silence on sexual harassment claims from former dancersBeyonc\u00e9\u2019s mother addresses speculation singer changed song lyrics after Lizzo lawsuitFilmmaker says she quit Lizzo documentary as singer was \u2018arrogant, unkind and cruel\u2019The Independent has contacted Lizzo\u2019s representative for comment.This article has been updated following the release of Lizzo\u2019s statement."}, {"_id": "64cceb2b51ac3352961fa9ae", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/lizzo-profile-fame-body-shame-lawsuit-b2386328.html", "primaryCategory": "Features", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Lizzo: The poster girl for body positivity, whose empowering image is now under threat", "lead": "<p>The \u2018Good as Hell\u2019 singer has crafted a globally successful brand of body positivity and self-love, backed up by a litany of empowerment anthems.

Just a couple of months ago, she lit up Glastonbury\u2019s Worthy Farm, performing a set that many said should have earned her a headliner slot. Building on two years of dominating the airwaves with her inspiring messages and impressive flute solos, Lizzo was at the top of her game. But new allegations of sexual harassment and fostering a hostile work environment have thrown that image into doubt. On Tuesday (1 August), three of Lizzo\u2019s former dancers accused her and her production company Big Grrrl Big Touring of a series of shocking claims \u2013 including fat-shaming, disability discrimination, false imprisonment, assault, and more. The lawsuit was filed by Arianna Davis and Crystal Williams, who competed on Lizzo\u2019s Amazon Prime reality series Watch Out for the Big Grrrls in 2021, and Noelle Rodriguez, who performed in the singer\u2019s \u201cRumors\u201d music video.It has long seemed as though Lizzo\u2019s rising star was unstoppable. The pop superstar, born Melissa Viviane Jefferson, has become not just one of the most adored names in music, but a fully-fledged global superstar, with numerous appearances on screen, her own aforementioned TV series and global tour, entitled \u201cThe Special Tour\u201d, which began last September.She\u2019s also won the hearts of millions with her sincerity and fervent wish for fans to love themselves, no matter what they look like.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeTo many people, the French Quarter epitomises New Orleans, aka NOLA. Street parties, dazzling parades, cigar-chomping jazz virtuosos playing in dimly lit clubs and time-patinaed buildings, their characterful wrought iron balconies dripping in ferns and flags, are the kernel of the city\u2019s soul. Simply wandering the streets is an experience in and of itself. There\u2019s always something going on, something to see or an event to attend.The French Quarter is deceptively small. Sprinkled along a bend of the Mississippi River as it snakes towards the Gulf of Mexico. Bound by Canal Street to the south, North Rampart Street to the west, Esplanade Avenue to the north and the Mississippi River to the east makes it just 14 blocks by six, laid out in their original grid pattern, unchanged since the early-18th century.The name French Quarter is misleading in that many of the buildings date from the late-18th century, after the two New Orleans fires of 1788 and 1794 destroyed over 80 per cent of the city. By that point, French colonisers had been replaced by the Spanish, who rebuilt much of the NOLA that survives today. Bourbon Street marks the rambunctious centre, while the northern blocks are genial residential areas containing many of the best-preserved buildings.Colour radiates from all parts of the neighbourhood (Getty/iStockphoto)DoRecommendedBest UK hotels 2022Best boutique hotels in Paris 2022 for style and locationIndependent Traveller guide to best hotels and short breaksPace the old gridThe French Quarter is at its most graceful in Jackson Square, dominated by the tri-spired fa\u00e7ade of St Louis Cathedral. Next door, the Presbyt\u00e8re exhibits an array of whimsical and flamboyant Mardi Gras costumes. One room also takes a look at the destructive imprint of hurricanes on the city. On the other side of the cathedral sits the Cabildo, formerly the Spanish colonial government\u2019s headquarters and now housing a local history museum. Visit to get a keen insight into the various cultures and races, whose worlds combined in NOLA to create such a singular city.Read more on USA travel:USA travel guide: Everything you need to know before you go6 of the best Texas cities to visit on your USA tripHow to do the great American road trip: Florida to MinnesotaFrom Jackson Square, follow the old city grid northeast to the daily French Market, where food, souvenirs such as Mardi Gras masks and local art are on sale. Head away from the Mississippi from here, where the streets are at their most genteel. Don\u2019t expect to see the French flag in the French Quarter. Instead, the NOLA tricolore comes in purple, green and gold: the official colours of Mardi Gras. On reaching Bourbon Street, drop one street south onto Royal Street where you might catch musicians, such as the fabulous Doreen J Ketchens and her band (who play in the street outside the stunning LaBranche House), doing their thing.Get jazzed upIf you\u2019re in the street, you\u2019ll likely hear music  (Getty)Propping up the northeast corner of the French Quarter is New Orleans Jazz Museum. This multi-storey museum, inside the neoclassical former US Mint building, tracks jazz music, the birth and evolution of which was central to New Orleans, through the decades. Exhibits include an exploration of how the drum kit, as we know it, was improvised into existence here, exultations of the biggest names in NOLA jazz and plenty of chances to listen to their works. Time your visit to catch a live performance in their top-floor performance space (shows, listed on the website, are included in your ticket).When you\u2019re done learning about the history of jazz, you might want to see how it\u2019s getting on today. When closed, you\u2019d likely walk right past Preservation Hall, thinking it was a derelict and unloved old building. But if you catch a jazz performance in New Orleans only once, make it here. The nation\u2019s best and brightest jazz musicians perform between two and five shows an evening here. Tickets often sell out in advance.Meet the MississippiOriginally a port city on the Mississippi River, New Orleans has long had an uneasy association with the water. While this snaking behemoth is steeped in a certain romanticised history, it has also caused plenty of pain, not least of all when breaking through the levees designed to protect the city from storm surges and flooding. Nevertheless, strolls and picnics along Moonwalk promenade through Woldenberg Riverfront Park are the perfect antidote for those wanting a break from the intensity of the French Quarter.The current Natchez steamer has been in operation for almost 50 years  (Getty)Get even closer to the mighty river by getting on it. To see the steamboat Natchez, with its white balconies and red paddlewheel, is to understand the grace of the southern states. Daily two-hour cruises up and down the Mississippi are often accompanied by a live jazz band, some historical narration, and an optional buffet and drinks.EatMr. B\u2019s BistroTucking into a bowl overflowing with authentic Creole food is as much an attraction in New Orleans as the Mississippi itself. But buyer beware, there are many tourist-tipsy places in the French Quarter that have lost their edge while upping their prices. Mr. B\u2019s Bistro is still right on the money, however, with loaded plates of saut\u00e9ed crawfish tails and fettuccine, greased with smoked tomato butter, and seafood gumbo packed with shrimp and crab from the Gulf of Mexico.Irene\u2019sNaming restaurants after the proprietor is common practice in these parts. You\u2019ve got Adolfo\u2019s, Brennan\u2019s and Elizabeth\u2019s; they\u2019re all fine establishments. Then you have Irene\u2019s, a traditional-style Italian restaurant with refined wood panelling, a piano bar to tap into the musical legacy of the French Quarter and a way with their fish dishes akin to sorcery. The oysters aren\u2019t bad either. Save space for the Bananas Foster, a dessert invented in New Orleans.House of BluesFood in the French Quarter is frequently accompanied by a live band. And if you\u2019re keen to switch things up from jazz for a while, blues and rock are on the bill at the House of Blues. The painted wooden entrance and reverential, bas-relief ceiling carvings of the top players gives this place a temple of music vibe. Mercifully for vegetarians, there are a couple of good options available, such as the vegan burger, in a city not known for its meat-free dishes.DrinkFritzel\u2019s European Jazz PubBourbon Street is the kind of place you might not enjoy unless you lean into it; a twisted Disneyland for adults, with all the finesse of an Ibizan bachelor party at 2am, albeit with a soundtrack provided by some of the finest musicians in America. A good place to start is Fritzel\u2019s, where the jazz is generally groovy, attracting a calmer, music-loving clientele.Bourbon Street after darkAfter a few libations and some swingin\u2019 jazz tunes, Bourbon Street is your oyster (or crawfish, if we\u2019re keeping it local). Highlights include the Old Absinthe House, where the American football helmets hanging above the bar make an absurd sort of sense, especially after a few glasses of the aromatic green elixir. The further northeast along Bourbon you go, the less party-heavy the place becomes. One of the standout bars in the neighbourhood is Lafitte\u2019s Blacksmith Shop Bar, which is rumoured (although branding superlatives in the States are to be taken with a pinch of salt) to be the oldest building currently used as a bar in the country.Ramos gin fizzTechnically, it\u2019s one street over from the French Quarter, but sipping a Ramos gin fizz at The Sazerac, bar of the Grand Roosevelt Hotel, is an essential NOLA drinking experience. The drink contains orange flower water, lemon juice, lime juice, sugar and gin, naturally. Although it\u2019s the cream and egg white that give the drink its frothy character, but only after being vigorously shaken for a good few minutes.ShopRoyal Street antiquesIt may only be one block south of Bourbon Street, but Royal Street is a far classier affair, with dozens of antiques shops specialising in rare pieces and fine art. At the higher end of the scale is M.S. Rau selling anything from antique canes and perfume bottles to genuine Louis XIV cabinets. For a good browse, there\u2019s Keil\u2019s Antiques, which has been around for a while itself, in business since 1899.Local artworkAlso on Royal Street is a range of art galleries, often run by the artists whose work is on show. Examples include Rodrigue Studio, where you can pick up copies of the instantly recognisable blue dogs of George Rodrigue. Gallery Rinard is owned and run by Matt Rinard, whose playful artworks are rooted in French Quarter life. Meanwhile the Angela King Gallery showcases a well-curated range of artworks from artists based in the wider Louisiana state and beyond.StayHotel MonteleoneIt\u2019s hard to imagine a hotel of Monteleone\u2019s size and grandeur fitting into the French Quarter. After all, the 570 rooms, which include around 50 luxury suites, sound enough to fill a good proportion of the neighbourhood. In business since 1886, there is plenty of historic charm laced throughout, including a Belle \u00c9poque-style carousel bar. You can also expect excellent breakfast beignets (a local take on the fried pastries) and freshly renovated rooms with high ceilings.Hotel St. MarieOne of the highlights of staying in the French Quarter is the opportunity to call one of the unique 18th-century buildings home for a day or two. At Hotel St. Marie, the best rooms even offer access to your own private, wrought-iron balcony overlooking the street. These are highly sought after during Mardi Gras, given that the hotel is less than a block away from Bourbon Street.Hotel ProvincialIt might not equate to a night at the museum, but thanks to its listing on the National Register of Historic Places, everything from the fa\u00e7ade to the rooms of Hotel Provincial maintains a wistful sense of yesteryear. Rooms contain period features such as original fireplaces and antique wooden furniture. The building envelops a former courtyard, which has been repurposed into a pool area. There\u2019s also a caf\u00e9 and bar on site.Read more: Best Hotels in New OrleansGetting thereRecommendedThe essential guide to Newport BeachMeet the New York brewery cats living their best lives right nowWhy Cincinnati deserves to be your next US city breakDirect flights from London Heathrow to New Orleans\u2019 Louis Armstrong International depart three to five times a week, taking roughly 10 hours.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeYou may be familiar with the excellent BBC TV series, Race Across the World, in which contestants are given a modest budget with which to reach a target destination as soon as possible, with no flying allowed. This weekend a similar challenge gets under way \u2013 but with no television cameras and, in the words of one participant, nearly 100 \u201cself-selecting nerds\u201d.Each has paid \u00a399 to a company called Lupine Travel for the chance to Race Across Europe from London to Istanbul, using only public transport \u2013 and walking. They will have to reach checkpoints at three mystery locations along the way.Anything that emphasises the opportunities and rewards of terrestrial long-distance travel using buses, trains and ferries is to be applauded. I love the idea of a race with plenty of jeopardy from missed or made connections. I will follow the quest avidly \u2013 many of the contestants will use social media to report on their experiences. But while I identify as a transport nerd, I will not be taking part. And here is why.First, the timing. While I relish the prospect of travelling overland between the two greatest European cities, starting on the first Saturday of August would not be my top choice. All the participants have been told the first checkpoint is in Paris (the secret three will be revealed only as the race starts). So they could organise travel to the French capital in advance, which is just as well: the only seats on the first possible Eurostar train from London to Paris are currently selling at \u00a3325.Yet even when they reach France, they will be competing for space with hundreds of thousands of Parisians leaving for their summer holidays. The obvious eastbound connection for Strasbourg, leaving half-an-hour after the prime Eurostar arrival, is showing as fully booked, which could flummox contestants early on in the race.RecommendedTourist documents \u2018nightmare\u2019 experience of being trapped in cable car for hoursHolidaymakers parking at airports warned over \u2018serious financial sting\u2019\u2018Let them stay with your kids\u2019: Mother has last laugh when passenger won\u2019t swap seatsNext, the indeterminate cost: while an Interrail pass costing \u00a3303 for seven days\u2019 travel looks a good option (and may even help with the journey home from Istanbul), in France reservations for express trains are essential and require additional payment \u2013 as do sleeper trains, where they are available. Where an overnight journey is not feasible, a short-notice hotel booking could prove expensive.Third: the rules. No taxis, no hitchhiking. I agree it would be ridiculous to allow someone to hire a cab to take them, say, the length of Austria. But in the Balkans, where rail travel is slow and coach departures sometimes sparse, taxis are regarded as a component of public transport for medium-distance journeys \u2013 teaming up with others to cut the cost. For example, Nis in southeast Serbia and the Bulgarian capital, Sofia, are less than 100 miles apart. Yet there is no rail connection and only a couple of cross-border buses daily, as far as I can see. A shared taxi is the obvious solution.I could reluctantly accept the taxi ban, but not the hitchhiking prohibition. Suppose (as I half-expect) the fine Slovenian capital, Ljubljana, is included as a \u201cmystery checkpoint\u201d. There are only three daily trains onward to Zagreb in Croatia. Hitchhiking (still widely practised in the former Yugoslavia) would be the obvious option, with the A2 motorway junction just a half-hour walk south of the city centre.Hitching would also guarantee interesting encounters with local people, which is an essential ingredient of a trip across Europe by land rather than air.Maybe the rules will change before the 2024 race \u2013 in which case I could join the 100-plus participant who have already signed up for next year\u2019s event. But in any case I wish the inaugural contestants happy and exciting journeys, and as much luck as they need."}, {"_id": "64cceb2c51ac3352961fa9b1", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/uk/england/london/royal-lancaster-london-hotel-bee-hives-b2386363.html", "primaryCategory": "London", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Beeswax and breakfast in bed: What\u2019s abuzz at this London hotel\u2019s rooftop hives", "lead": "<p>The first central London hotel to install hives on its roof has launched a new partnership centred on its honey bees \u2013 <strong>Benjamin Parker</strong> finds out if it\u2019s as sweet as it sounds </p>", "author": "Benjamin Parker", "datePublished": "2023-08-04 11:10:39", "dateScraped": "2023-08-04 14:12:28.355769", "dateUpdated": "2023-08-04T11:10:39+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/08/02/14/newFile-3.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Simon Calder\u2019s free travel email for expert advice and money-saving discountsGet Simon Calder\u2019s Travel email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticePearls of sweat appeared on my forehead as summer heat began to sting. Bodies surrounded me, contorting in any available space in the midst of a swarm; I felt a buzz of anticipation as I edged closer to my destination, until finally we came to a halt.Doors sprang open, and we bumbled off the Central line train, strangers unglued from strangers, pollination of awkwardness complete.I emerged at Lancaster Gate, the drone of the London Underground now faded, opposite an entrance to Hyde Park. Perhaps two minutes around the corner, I reached the grand entrance to the Royal Lancaster London hotel \u2013 but what had brought me here wasn\u2019t on street level.The Royal Lancaster was the first hotel in London to install bee hives on its roof, back in 2009. Since then, it\u2019s become somewhat of a trend: St Ermin\u2019s, Ham Yard and The Ritz have all welcomed colonies. But here, more than a decade later, they\u2019re firmly integrated into the fabric of the property.Hive mind: The beehives on the roof  (Royal Lancaster London)RecommendedThe best luxury hotels in London for a stylish city breakThe best spa hotels in London for pampering and indulgenceBest boutique hotels in London 2022\u201cOnce guests clock that we have bees, it really connects with them and they start to see the honeycomb pattern everywhere,\u201d said general manager Sally Beck. It\u2019s true. Once I\u2019d noticed one motif, I began to spy them in the shape of the lighting and the patterns on carpets. Even the stands brought to the table for afternoon tea are hexagonal.Read more on London travel:London city guide: Where to stay, eat, drink and shop in the UK capitalThe best dog-friendly hotels in London for city breaksThe best shopping spots in London: Where to spend and stayThe relationship between insect and hotel goes deeper than the aesthetic. Sally told me that they \u201cbelieve it\u2019s important to protect these pollinators, who play a key role in maintaining the balance of ecosystems\u201d. My visit coincides with the launch of the \u201cBee Our Guest\u201d package, where \u00a310 from every stay supports the partnership between the hotel and Bees Abroad, a charity that helps educate and mentor communities in best beekeeping practices, allowing bee farmers to get better prices for quality honey. The Royal Lancaster has twinned with a project on Kome Island, Tanzania, that is focused on empowering rural women.From my room, I spotted the honey farm, 10 hives on a grass-topped flat roof; you\u2019re guaranteed a view of them if you book the package, so if you bafflingly miss the thread running through the place \u2013 which extends in my suite to a vivid bee pillow and charge of in-house honey \u2013 you have an inescapable reminder.Perhaps more impressive was the colossal panoramic view over Hyde Park (also guaranteed in the package; they know what people want). Facing south, the sky met a canvas of conifers and pines, with little more than hints of the Italian Gardens and a glimmer of the Long Water to interrupt the greenery. As the sun slipped away, I soaked its dregs on a velvet sofa while reading.High life: A different view of Hyde Park  (Ben Parker)In the bar downstairs, I met Jo Hemesley, who has led the beekeepers at the Royal Lancaster over the last 14 years. Her enthusiasm for these furry pollinators is obvious \u2013 they\u2019re \u201cendlessly fascinating\u201d, she says \u2013 as well as infectious.She first spent time beekeeping as a teenager during her Duke of Edinburgh Award and is now training a new team to look after the hives. She describes the work of Bees Abroad as \u201cvital, local and empowering\u201d, and loves how her work gives her \u201cthe chance to be outside and in nature.\u201dWe chatted as she demonstrated how to make a candle using beeswax from the hotel\u2019s hives, tightly rolling the honeycomb-pocked sheets around a wick, and incorporating wildflowers. I thought I\u2019d done a stellar job; her effort was much better. I found what came more naturally to me was simply sipping the Royal Bumblebee, a heady mix of gin, citrus and hibiscus tea, and \u2013 of course \u2013 the honey farmed high above to give it a sweet note. It\u2019s served in a beeswax tumbler, moulded from melted wax and cleaned, melted down and remade afterwards.First impressions: The lobby of Royal Lancaster London  (Royal Lancaster London)I\u2019d be doing the hotel \u2013 where spaces are packed with marble and dark wood, plus Insta-friendly leather booths and brushed gold touches \u2013 a disservice to only focus on the bees. It\u2019s not just a gimmick, nor is it shoved in your face. In fact, one of the most compelling reasons to visit isn\u2019t permeated by the bees: the in-house restaurant, Nipa Thai. It\u2019s an all-female, all-Thai kitchen under head chef Sanguan Parr, where the sublime is served within a teak-heavy dining room. The som tam roared with the salty-sweet-spicy-sour combination that defines Thailand\u2019s finest dishes, while lamb chops gently eased off the bone into\u00a0creamy massaman.I fell asleep that night, sated by a dessert of mango sticky rice, with the blinds half-open; I woke early to savour the view, brooding over the day ahead. Breakfast came to the room, and the first thing I did was drizzle the very local honey over Greek yoghurt, a delightful sweet-tart pairing. The full English \u2013 an important baseline for judging any hotel \u2013 impressed. In fact, it\u2019s now my favourite of any London hotel: thick, just-crisp slices of bacon, fat pork sausages, a creamy dollop of scrambled eggs, and a tomato half properly grilled rather than warmed.After checking out, I descended to the Central line again, hotter than hell. I was expecting bees to occupy my mind, but they were swatted aside by thoughts of my breakfast. Until, that is, a further swarm of commuters boarded at the next stop, and I returned to feeling like a worker bee packed in his hive.Travel essentialsThe Royal Lancaster London\u2019s Bee Our Guest package costs from \u00a3469 for two guests, B&B. It includes a guaranteed view of Hyde Park and the hotel\u2019s honey farm from the room, a Royal Bumblebee cocktail each in the Park Lounge Bar, and a \u00a310 donation to Bees Abroad.RecommendedWoman accidentally books entire hotel instead of Airbnb in BaliJust Stop Oil activists stage sit-down protest at Fortnum & Mason in LondonBest cheap hotels in London 2023: Where to stay for style on a budgetRead more on the best London hotels"}, {"_id": "64cceb2c51ac3352961fa9b2", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/tourist-trapped-cable-car-tiktok-b2387594.html", "primaryCategory": "News &amp; Advice", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Tourist documents \u2018nightmare\u2019 experience of being trapped in cable car for hours", "lead": "<p>Man jokes that \u2018it\u2019s a good way to go\u2019 while thousands of metres above ground </p>", "author": "Benjamin Parker", "datePublished": "2023-08-04 09:38:54", "dateScraped": "2023-08-04 14:12:28.564824", "dateUpdated": "2023-08-04T09:38:54+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/08/04/09/Stuck%20in%20a%20cable%20car.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Simon Calder\u2019s free travel email for expert advice and money-saving discountsGet Simon Calder\u2019s Travel email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Quite literally, because the maximum speed limit on the narrow country lanes is just 35mph (and when I say narrow, I mean it\u2019s perfectly normal practice to mount the pavement to pass a car coming in the opposite direction). But there\u2019s still plenty of opportunity to get your heart-pumping \u2013 perhaps with coastal hikes along granite cliffs, kayaking in secluded coves or a surf lesson or two. The island is one of the few places in the world without major fast-food chains, which is what makes people feel they are stepping back in time. It encourages you to enjoy crab sandwiches from beachside cafes, or leisurely lunches on sunny restaurant terraces.At just 24 square miles, the island\u2019s size means you\u2019re never far from anywhere, so you can choose your Channel Island accommodation freely. Whether you want to splash out on a grand five-star hotel in the picturesque capital Saint Peter Port, or opt for a budget room in a country pub, you\u2019ll be able to explore the whole of Guernsey from your chosen base.

Its spa is the best on the island, with an outdoor hot tub to enjoy on sunny days along with an indoor pool with thermal suite and top-notch Elemis treatments. Just beware, it can get busy on weekends with celebrations. Choose a room with a terrace for a private sunbathing spot. If you\u2019re into golf, you\u2019ll find the island\u2019s largest driving range within walking distance of the hotel.

This is Guernsey\u2019s answer to a grand-luxe hotel, with a choice of dining experiences (a French brasserie and fine-dining Indian restaurant), a superb breakfast with all the latest options (there\u2019s kale and avocado and green juice along with the traditional eggs Benedict and full English, to be washed down by a glass of champagne).

The first to arrive beside the Bosphorus will win a prize worth \u00a32,000.Unlike the BBC\u2019s popular Race Across the World series, which challenges participants to reach a specific destination using public transport with a set limit and without mobile phones, travel budgets can be unlimited. Mobiles are not merely allowed: they are likely to be essential for on-the-move organisation.\u201cIt\u2019s going to attract self-selecting nerds,\u201d Mr Houtenbos cheerfully accepts. \u201cMy wife is very happy for me to be going on this journey alone.\u201dThe race starts from Trafalgar Square in the centre of the capital at 10am on Saturday, 5 August. It is organised by the Wigan-based adventure company, Lupine Travel. The company\u2019s James Finnerty is race director.RecommendedIs it safe to travel to Turkey? Latest advice as wildfires spread across EuropeUS nationals will need a visa to travel to Europe in 2024 - Everything to know 8 of the best hotels in Guernsey for a relaxing 2023 holidayTrial run: Adventurer Bram Houtenbos on a rail trip through the Netherlands  (Bram Houtenbos)\u201cThe idea has really had a better response than expected,\u201d he says. \u201cWe initially hoped for 30-50 people but ended up having to limit it at 100 for the first year.\u201cThere\u2019s already 100-plus people on the waiting list for the launch of our 2024 race later this month. We plan to allow 250 people for that one.\u201dThe inaugural race has a hurdle to prevent contestants setting up everything ahead of time. When the competition was launched in May 2023, entrants were told a first checkpoint will be in Paris, to enable them to source public transport to the French capital at reasonable prices.They will also be required to register at a three secret checkpoints across Europe \u2013 which will be revealed only at the start of the race, at which point they can start organising onward travel.From Paris, the obvious route continues via Munich, Vienna, Budapest, Belgrade and Sofia. Mr Houtenbos, who is using a \u20ac446 (\u00a3384) one-week Interrail pass for the trip, has speculatively booked space on trains from the French capital to Basel in Switzerland and from Zurich to Budapest.But contestants could instead find they are routed on a more northerly trajectory via Berlin or Prague, or south through Ljubljana or Venice, or even via southern Italy with a ferry to Greece.Contestants are split equally between women and men. Most are British, but there are entrants from across Europe as well as North America, India, Australia and New Zealand.The oldest participant is 71, the youngest just 11 \u2013 several families are competing.\u201cThe family entrants were a total surprise but a really lovely one,\u201d says Mr Finnerty.Most of the contestants are in groups of two, three or four, but there are 27 solo entrants \u2013 including Bram Houtenbos, who says: \u201cI\u2019m going hell for leather.\u201dLupine Travel has calculated that the journey should take between four and six days without overnight travel.\u201cI think the winners might bring this down to three days with overnight transport,\u201d says James Finnerty.\u201cTheir first onward transport out of Paris will pose a big challenge as they\u2019ll have short notice to arrange this. Those who manage to push on from Paris immediately will be in a good position to win.\u201dBut Saturday is a very busy day for holidaymakers leaving the French capital and it may be difficult to find space at any price.For short-notice, high-speed rail, fares are likely to be high. The fare for the first possible train from London to Paris on Eurostar is currently \u00a3218, though most contestants will have booked travel earlier at a lower fare. But the onward journey from the French capital to Vienna \u2013 a plausible location for the next checkpoint \u2013 is currently priced at \u00a3423 for the 12-hour rail journey.A Wizz Air flight from London Luton to Istanbul, departing 10 minutes after the race begins, is currently on sale at \u00a3252 for the four-hour journey to Turkey\u2019s largest city.As well as the main prize for the fastest contestant, there are additional prizes for the cheapest trans-European journey. With hitchhiking banned, the winner is likely to spend a long time on coaches.Flixbus is currently selling a Paris-Sofia journey for \u00a3196, taking 36 hours including a change of coach in Munich. The remaining nine-hour journey to Istanbul costs around \u00a330 on the Turkish bus line Kamil Ko\u00e7. Whether Munich and Sofia are on the chosen route remains to be seen.A further prize will be awarded to the person who visits the most countries along the way. Participants keen to win this category will probably route themselves via Luxembourg \u2013 where nationwide free travel will allow them to easily tick off Belgium with a trip to the border and back. The trans-Liechtenstein express train that runs nonstop through the diminutive Alpine principality en route from Switzerland to Austria is another possibility.Flag-counters might even build in a long diversion to southern France and Italy to collect fun-sized nations such as Monaco, San Marino and Vatican City, or a routing through the western Balkans allowing them to gallop through the fragments of the former Yugoslavia.But how will the organisers prevent cheating \u2013 for example, participants taking tactical taxis or even a time-saving flight?Recommended8 of the best hotels in Guernsey for a relaxing 2023 holidayMinibreaking in Madrid?

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeFourteen months on from the start of the first national rail strikes since the 1980s, the disputes between the main rail unions and train operators over pay, jobs and working conditions appear as intractable as ever.July saw the resumption of industrial action aimed at more than a dozen rail firms, which has continued into August.The biggest rail union, the RMT, and Aslef, representing train drivers, say many of their members have not had a pay rise for four years. They are demanding no-strings increases that take into account the high level of inflation. The unions say they are prepared to discuss reforms, but these must be negotiated separately. They will expect any changes to be accompanied by commensurate pay boosts. Train operators and ministers \u2013 who must sign off any deal \u2013 insist modernisation is essential following the collapse of rail revenue. Much of the \u201cbedrock\u201d of season ticket sales has vanished since the Covid pandemic. The only way to award even a modest increase, the employers say, is to fund it out of efficiency savings,Caught in the middle: the long-suffering passenger. Since June 2022, national rail strikes and other forms of industrial action have scuppered the travel plans of tens of millions of train passengers. Stoppages have been called frequently, causing massive disruption and making advance travel planning difficult.RecommendedRail passengers to face more disruption amid train drivers\u2019 overtime banGovernment accused of preventing settlement as RMT members strikeAll the UK strike dates confirmed for July and August 2023These are the key questions and answers.Who is taking industrial action, and when?The biggest rail union, the RMT, says 20,000 of its members were out on strike on Thursday 20, Saturday 22 and Saturday 29 July. Thousands of trains were cancelled each day at the start of the main summer school holidays in England.No further strikes are currently announced. But with no progress in talks since April, and no future negotiations planned, news of fresh strikes is expected soon from the RMT.On the most recent strike day, 29 July, RMT general secretary Mick Lynch said: \u201cOur members keep voting for more strike action because they haven\u2019t got a settlement we can work with.\u201dThe train drivers\u2019 union, Aslef, is mounting \u201caction short of a strike\u201d in the shape of a series Monday-to-Saturday overtime bans. The latest began on Monday 31 July and runs until Saturday 12 August, with the exception of Sunday 6 August/Hundreds of trains are likely to be cancelled each day as a result.Which train operators are involved in the national disputes?The RMT strikes and Aslef overtime bans are aimed at rail firms in England contracted by the Department for Transport. They include the leading intercity operators:Avanti West CoastCrossCountryEast Midlands RailwayGreat Western RailwayLNERTransPennine ExpressMost London commuter operators will be hit:C2C (not involved in the Aslef action)Greater AngliaGTR (Gatwick Express, Great Northern, Southern, Thameslink)SoutheasternSouth Western Railway Operators focusing on the Midlands and north of England will be affected:Chiltern RailwaysNorthern TrainsWest Midlands RailwayWhat is happening about the London Underground?The Underground, the London Overground and the Elizabeth Line are unaffected by the planned industrial action. But some routes that offer alternatives to rail services hit by industrial action, such as in south London, may be busier than normal.Why were the July and August dates chosen?Like any unions, the RMT and Aslef are seeking the biggest impact \u2013 ie to cause as much disruption as they can. With rail commuting sharply down since the Covid pandemic, the target is now leisure passengers.The RMT union\u2019s national walk-outs targeted what were likely to be three of the busiest days of the month, with many families on the move at the start of school holidays in England, particularly to and from seaside resorts.The first two dates also fell during the Open golf championship at Royal Liverpool Golf Club, and the third hit cricket fans hoping to travel to London for the fifth Ashes Test between England and Australia at the Oval.Aslef\u2019s rolling overtime bans are aimed at leisure travellers in the peak holiday month.Which trains will run during the Aslef industrial action and any future RMT strikes?Passengers can expect normal service on:Caledonian SleeperGrand Central (except for dozens of cancellations due to fleet issues)Heathrow ExpressHull TrainsLondon OvergroundLumoMerseyrailScotRailTransport for WalesSoutheastern: The Aslef overtime ban is unlikely to hit services. Any future RMT strike days will see much reduced services. Links wil run from London Victoria to Bromley South, London Bridge to Dartford and Sevenoaks and London St Pancras International to Ashford International, Canterbury and Ramsgate, with reduced service hours.Southern: A reduced timetable will operate on all days of industrial action, but largely with normal hours. On Saturday 5 August there will be no trains between London and Brighton\u00a0\u2013 the location for a big Pride celebration. All coastal services, linking Southampton and Portsmouth with Brighton, Eastbourne, Lewes and Hastings, are cancelled on Saturday.Gatwick Express: Cancelled on all days of industrial action, but alternative Southern services are available (and are much cheaper).Thameslink: The Thameslink core between London Bridge and St Pancras International will be closed during all industrial action.During the Aslef overtime ban, an emergency timetable with fewer services will operate.On any future RMT strike days, a much-reduced service will run between 7am and 7pm.Southwestern: Reduced services during Aslef overtime ban. On any future RMT strike day, a skeleton network will run linking London Waterloo with Guildford, Southampton, Ascot and Hampton Court.Great Western Railway (GWR): The Aslef overtime ban \u201cis likely to cause some short-notice alterations or cancellations\u201d. All Night Riviera sleeper services have been cancelled for two weeks, resuming on 13 August.On any future RMT strike days, a core service is likely between London Paddington and Oxford, Cardiff, Bath, Bristol, Exeter and Plymouth.CrossCountry: Expect short-notice alterations or cancellations during the Aslef overtime ban.On any future RMT strike day, a reduced network with nothing north of Edinburgh or west of Plymouth is likely. Cardiff to Nottingham trains will not run, and the usual link from Birmingham to Stansted Airport will terminate at Peterborough.Chiltern: Fewer trains and reduced hours during the Aslef overtime ban, with additional cancellations due to engineering work\u00a0\u2013including on HS2.On any future RMT strike days the network will be reduced to a limited service linking London Marylebone with Aylesbury, Banbury and Oxford.West Midlands Railway: During the Aslef train drivers\u2019 overtime ban, \u201cservices will be subject to on the day alterations/cancellations\u201d.In addition, buses will replace trains on the Leamington Spa-Coventry-Nuneaton link and some Birmingham-Hereford services. Some Birmingham-Shrewsbury services will be cancelled.Avanti West Coast: The Aslef overtime bans are not expected to have an impact. On any future RMT strike days, the basic pattern to and from London Euston will be one train each hour to/from:ManchesterLiverpool (via Birmingham)Preston, with a limited service onwards to Glasgow.Northern: \u201cDisruption is expected between 31 July and 5 August, due to industrial action called by Aslef.\u201dTransPennine Express: The Aslef overtime ban will mean some services starting later and finishing earlier than usual, with possible night-before or on-the-day cancellations.On any future RMT strike days a very limited number of trains will run on the Manchester Piccadilly-Leeds-York-Scarborough route; between Preston and Manchester Airport; and between Sheffield and Cleethorpes.East Midlands Railway: \u201cThere will likely be several train cancellations\u201d \u2013 that is the prediction for the Aslef overtime bans. On any RMT strike days, the operator says: \u201cOnly travel by rail if absolutely necessary and if you do travel, expect severe disruption.\u201dLNER: During Aslef overtime ban, the state-owned rail firm serving the East Coast main line says: \u201cWe expect to run a normal timetable during these times, however, it is possible there will be short-notice alterations and cancellations.\u201dOn RMT strike days, LNER traditionally runs regular services on the London-York-Newcastle-Edinburgh route, with first departures around 7am and final arrivals around 10pm. London-Leeds services will run approximately 7am-6pm.Great Northern: \u201cAn amended timetable with fewer services will run. Services will be busier than usual, especially in peak hours. It\u2019s likely you will need to queue and you may not be able to board your chosen service. You should allow extra time for your journey.\u201dGreater Anglia: \u201cA number of cancellations\u201d during the Aslef overtime ban.Why are all trains to Brighton cancelled for Pride?All trains going anywhere near the Sussex city on the day of the LGBTQ+ event, Saturday 5 August, are cancelled. Normally GTR, the Southern/Thameslink/Gatwick Express franchise, runs dozens of additional trains for the event, with tens of thousands of extra passengers. These involve drivers working overtime, which will not happen this year.The train operator says: \u201cAfter exploring all possible options, and following discussions with the police, emergency services and local council, we simply cannot run a safe service with enough capacity for the extraordinary number of passengers that travel to Brighton for Pride.\u201cWe can\u2019t in good faith bring people into Brighton that cannot get home again, potentially leaving thousands of people stranded \u2013 safety must come first.\u201dBut Aslef general secretary Mick Whelan said: \u201cThe fact that GTR Thameslink has chosen not to run services for passengers on Saturday reveals that this is a clear, conscious, and deliberate decision to disrupt \u2013 and ruin \u2013 Brighton Pride.\u201cIt is outrageous \u2013 and utterly ridiculous \u2013 to try to blame Aslef for problems which are entirely of this train company\u2019s own making.\u201cThe simple fact is that this company does not employ enough drivers to deliver the services it has promised passengers, businesses, and the Department for Transport it will run. That\u2019s why it is dependent on drivers working overtime.\u201cThe company should do the right thing \u2013 give our members, their drivers, the pay rise they deserve \u2013 and give the people of Brighton the train service they need. Not just on the Saturday of Brighton Pride. But on every day, of every week, and for the rest of this year.\u2019Will airport trains run during industrial action?The Gatwick Express between the Sussex airport and London is suspended during the Aslef action, but Southern trains are available on the London Victoria-Gatwick link.Note that Brighton will be cut off from Gatwick during the city\u2019s Pride festivities on Saturday 5 August.Gatwick, Luton, Stansted, Southampton, Birmingham and Manchester airports will have some trains during any future RMT walk-outs.Heathrow airport is unaffected by the national walk-outs: it is served by the Heathrow Express and Elizabeth Line, as well as the London Underground.Will Eurostar be affected?No, but connections to and from the train operator\u2019s main hub at London St Pancras International may be difficult because of industrial action at all three domestic train operators at the station (East Midlands Railway, Southeastern and Thameslink) serving the station.Why is Aslef taking industrial action?Mick Whelan, Aslef\u2019s leader, said: \u201cOnce again we find ourselves with no alternative but to take this action. We have continually come to the negotiating table in good faith, seeking to resolve the dispute.\u201cSadly, it is clear from the actions of both the train operating companies and the government that they do not want an end to the dispute. Their goals appear to be to continue industrial strife and to do down our industry.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to inconvenience the public. We just want to see our members paid fairly during a cost of living crisis when inflation is running at above 10 per cent, and to not see our terms and conditions taken away.\u201cIt\u2019s time for the government and the companies to think again and look for a resolution.\u201dWhy is the RMT striking?The RMT general secretary Mick Lynch has described the latest offer from the train operators \u2013 represented by the Rail Delivery Group (RDG) \u2013 as \u201csubstandard\u201d. He said: \u201cThis latest phase of action will show the country just how important railway staff are to the running of the rail industry.\u201dThe government continues to shackle the companies and will not allow them to put forward a package that can settle this dispute.\u201cRMT will continue its industrial campaign until we reach a negotiated settlement on pay, working conditions and job security.The RMT has staged walk-outs on 33 days in the current wave of strikes, with Aslef stopping work on 13 previous occasions.What do the train operators say?A spokesman for the RDG said: \u201cMore strikes are totally unnecessary. After a year of industrial action all the RMT has achieved is losing their members more money than they would have received in the pay offers they refused to put to put out to a vote, despite having agreed the terms with the negotiators the room.\u201cWe have now made three offers that the RMT executive have blocked without a convincing explanation. We remain open to talks and we have said repeatedly that we want to give our people a pay rise.\u201cBut until the union leadership and executive is united in what it wants and engages in good faith with the 30 per cent shortfall in revenue the industry is continuing to grapple with post-Covid, it is difficult to move forward.\u201cSadly our staff, our customers and the communities across the country which rely on a thriving railway are the ones that are suffering as a result.\u201dWhat does the government say?A spokesperson for the Department for Transport said: \u201cAfter a year of industrial action, passengers and rail workers alike are growing tired of union bosses playing politics with their lives.\u201cIt\u2019s high time the union leaders realised that strikes no longer have the impact they once did and are simply driving people away from the railway.\u201dI have a ticket booked for a day hit by industrial action. What can I do?Passengers with Advance, Anytime or Off-Peak tickets can have their ticket refunded with no fee if the train that the ticket is booked for is cancelled, delayed or rescheduled.Train operators are likely to offer flexibility to travel on a wide range of non-strike days.Passengers with season tickets who do not travel can claim compensation for the strike dates through Delay Repay.RecommendedMore rail disruption as union announces new August overtime ban for train driversTrain strike day?

Since June 2022, national rail strikes and other forms of industrial action have scuppered the travel plans of tens of millions of train passengers. Stoppages have been called frequently, causing massive disruption and making advance travel planning difficult.RecommendedRail passengers to face more disruption amid train drivers\u2019 overtime banGovernment accused of preventing settlement as RMT members strikeAll the UK strike dates confirmed for July and August 2023These are the key questions and answers.Who is taking industrial action, and when?The biggest rail union, the RMT, says 20,000 of its members were out on strike on Thursday 20, Saturday 22 and Saturday 29 July. Thousands of trains were cancelled each day at the start of the main summer school holidays in England.No further strikes are currently announced. But with no progress in talks since April, and no future negotiations planned, news of fresh strikes is expected soon from the RMT.On the most recent strike day, 29 July, RMT general secretary Mick Lynch said: \u201cOur members keep voting for more strike action because they haven\u2019t got a settlement we can work with.\u201dThe train drivers\u2019 union, Aslef, is mounting \u201caction short of a strike\u201d in the shape of a series Monday-to-Saturday overtime bans. The latest began on Monday 31 July and runs until Saturday 12 August, with the exception of Sunday 6 August/Hundreds of trains are likely to be cancelled each day as a result.Which train operators are involved in the national disputes?The RMT strikes and Aslef overtime bans are aimed at rail firms in England contracted by the Department for Transport. They include the leading intercity operators:Avanti West CoastCrossCountryEast Midlands RailwayGreat Western RailwayLNERTransPennine ExpressMost London commuter operators will be hit:C2C (not involved in the Aslef action)Greater AngliaGTR (Gatwick Express, Great Northern, Southern, Thameslink)SoutheasternSouth Western Railway Operators focusing on the Midlands and north of England will be affected:Chiltern RailwaysNorthern TrainsWest Midlands RailwayWhat is happening about the London Underground?The Underground, the London Overground and the Elizabeth Line are unaffected by the planned industrial action. But some routes that offer alternatives to rail services hit by industrial action, such as in south London, may be busier than normal.Why were the July and August dates chosen?Like any unions, the RMT and Aslef are seeking the biggest impact \u2013 ie to cause as much disruption as they can. With rail commuting sharply down since the Covid pandemic, the target is now leisure passengers.The RMT union\u2019s national walk-outs targeted what were likely to be three of the busiest days of the month, with many families on the move at the start of school holidays in England, particularly to and from seaside resorts.The first two dates also fell during the Open golf championship at Royal Liverpool Golf Club, and the third hit cricket fans hoping to travel to London for the fifth Ashes Test between England and Australia at the Oval.Aslef\u2019s rolling overtime bans are aimed at leisure travellers in the peak holiday month.Which trains will run during the Aslef industrial action and any future RMT strikes?Passengers can expect normal service on:Caledonian SleeperGrand Central (except for dozens of cancellations due to fleet issues)Heathrow ExpressHull TrainsLondon OvergroundLumoMerseyrailScotRailTransport for WalesSoutheastern: The Aslef overtime ban is unlikely to hit services. Any future RMT strike days will see much reduced services. Links wil run from London Victoria to Bromley South, London Bridge to Dartford and Sevenoaks and London St Pancras International to Ashford International, Canterbury and Ramsgate, with reduced service hours.Southern: A reduced timetable will operate on all days of industrial action, but largely with normal hours. On Saturday 5 August there will be no trains between London and Brighton\u00a0\u2013 the location for a big Pride celebration. All coastal services, linking Southampton and Portsmouth with Brighton, Eastbourne, Lewes and Hastings, are cancelled on Saturday.Gatwick Express: Cancelled on all days of industrial action, but alternative Southern services are available (and are much cheaper).Thameslink: The Thameslink core between London Bridge and St Pancras International will be closed during all industrial action.During the Aslef overtime ban, an emergency timetable with fewer services will operate.On any future RMT strike days, a much-reduced service will run between 7am and 7pm.Southwestern: Reduced services during Aslef overtime ban. On any future RMT strike day, a skeleton network will run linking London Waterloo with Guildford, Southampton, Ascot and Hampton Court.Great Western Railway (GWR): The Aslef overtime ban \u201cis likely to cause some short-notice alterations or cancellations\u201d. All Night Riviera sleeper services have been cancelled for two weeks, resuming on 13 August.On any future RMT strike days, a core service is likely between London Paddington and Oxford, Cardiff, Bath, Bristol, Exeter and Plymouth.CrossCountry: Expect short-notice alterations or cancellations during the Aslef overtime ban.On any future RMT strike day, a reduced network with nothing north of Edinburgh or west of Plymouth is likely. Cardiff to Nottingham trains will not run, and the usual link from Birmingham to Stansted Airport will terminate at Peterborough.Chiltern: Fewer trains and reduced hours during the Aslef overtime ban, with additional cancellations due to engineering work\u00a0\u2013including on HS2.On any future RMT strike days the network will be reduced to a limited service linking London Marylebone with Aylesbury, Banbury and Oxford.West Midlands Railway: During the Aslef train drivers\u2019 overtime ban, \u201cservices will be subject to on the day alterations/cancellations\u201d.In addition, buses will replace trains on the Leamington Spa-Coventry-Nuneaton link and some Birmingham-Hereford services. Some Birmingham-Shrewsbury services will be cancelled.Avanti West Coast: The Aslef overtime bans are not expected to have an impact. On any future RMT strike days, the basic pattern to and from London Euston will be one train each hour to/from:ManchesterLiverpool (via Birmingham)Preston, with a limited service onwards to Glasgow.Northern: \u201cDisruption is expected between 31 July and 5 August, due to industrial action called by Aslef.\u201dTransPennine Express: The Aslef overtime ban will mean some services starting later and finishing earlier than usual, with possible night-before or on-the-day cancellations.On any future RMT strike days a very limited number of trains will run on the Manchester Piccadilly-Leeds-York-Scarborough route; between Preston and Manchester Airport; and between Sheffield and Cleethorpes.East Midlands Railway: \u201cThere will likely be several train cancellations\u201d \u2013 that is the prediction for the Aslef overtime bans. On any RMT strike days, the operator says: \u201cOnly travel by rail if absolutely necessary and if you do travel, expect severe disruption.\u201dLNER: During Aslef overtime ban, the state-owned rail firm serving the East Coast main line says: \u201cWe expect to run a normal timetable during these times, however, it is possible there will be short-notice alterations and cancellations.\u201dOn RMT strike days, LNER traditionally runs regular services on the London-York-Newcastle-Edinburgh route, with first departures around 7am and final arrivals around 10pm. London-Leeds services will run approximately 7am-6pm.Great Northern: \u201cAn amended timetable with fewer services will run. Services will be busier than usual, especially in peak hours. It\u2019s likely you will need to queue and you may not be able to board your chosen service. You should allow extra time for your journey.\u201dGreater Anglia: \u201cA number of cancellations\u201d during the Aslef overtime ban.Why are all trains to Brighton cancelled for Pride?All trains going anywhere near the Sussex city on the day of the LGBTQ+ event, Saturday 5 August, are cancelled. Normally GTR, the Southern/Thameslink/Gatwick Express franchise, runs dozens of additional trains for the event, with tens of thousands of extra passengers. These involve drivers working overtime, which will not happen this year.The train operator says: \u201cAfter exploring all possible options, and following discussions with the police, emergency services and local council, we simply cannot run a safe service with enough capacity for the extraordinary number of passengers that travel to Brighton for Pride.\u201cWe can\u2019t in good faith bring people into Brighton that cannot get home again, potentially leaving thousands of people stranded \u2013 safety must come first.\u201dBut Aslef general secretary Mick Whelan said: \u201cThe fact that GTR Thameslink has chosen not to run services for passengers on Saturday reveals that this is a clear, conscious, and deliberate decision to disrupt \u2013 and ruin \u2013 Brighton Pride.\u201cIt is outrageous \u2013 and utterly ridiculous \u2013 to try to blame Aslef for problems which are entirely of this train company\u2019s own making.\u201cThe simple fact is that this company does not employ enough drivers to deliver the services it has promised passengers, businesses, and the Department for Transport it will run. That\u2019s why it is dependent on drivers working overtime.\u201cThe company should do the right thing \u2013 give our members, their drivers, the pay rise they deserve \u2013 and give the people of Brighton the train service they need. Not just on the Saturday of Brighton Pride. But on every day, of every week, and for the rest of this year.\u2019Will airport trains run during industrial action?The Gatwick Express between the Sussex airport and London is suspended during the Aslef action, but Southern trains are available on the London Victoria-Gatwick link.Note that Brighton will be cut off from Gatwick during the city\u2019s Pride festivities on Saturday 5 August.Gatwick, Luton, Stansted, Southampton, Birmingham and Manchester airports will have some trains during any future RMT walk-outs.Heathrow airport is unaffected by the national walk-outs: it is served by the Heathrow Express and Elizabeth Line, as well as the London Underground.Will Eurostar be affected?No, but connections to and from the train operator\u2019s main hub at London St Pancras International may be difficult because of industrial action at all three domestic train operators at the station (East Midlands Railway, Southeastern and Thameslink) serving the station.Why is Aslef taking industrial action?Mick Whelan, Aslef\u2019s leader, said: \u201cOnce again we find ourselves with no alternative but to take this action. We have continually come to the negotiating table in good faith, seeking to resolve the dispute.\u201cSadly, it is clear from the actions of both the train operating companies and the government that they do not want an end to the dispute. Their goals appear to be to continue industrial strife and to do down our industry.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to inconvenience the public. We just want to see our members paid fairly during a cost of living crisis when inflation is running at above 10 per cent, and to not see our terms and conditions taken away.\u201cIt\u2019s time for the government and the companies to think again and look for a resolution.\u201dWhy is the RMT striking?The RMT general secretary Mick Lynch has described the latest offer from the train operators \u2013 represented by the Rail Delivery Group (RDG) \u2013 as \u201csubstandard\u201d. He said: \u201cThis latest phase of action will show the country just how important railway staff are to the running of the rail industry.\u201dThe government continues to shackle the companies and will not allow them to put forward a package that can settle this dispute.\u201cRMT will continue its industrial campaign until we reach a negotiated settlement on pay, working conditions and job security.The RMT has staged walk-outs on 33 days in the current wave of strikes, with Aslef stopping work on 13 previous occasions.What do the train operators say?A spokesman for the RDG said: \u201cMore strikes are totally unnecessary. After a year of industrial action all the RMT has achieved is losing their members more money than they would have received in the pay offers they refused to put to put out to a vote, despite having agreed the terms with the negotiators the room.\u201cWe have now made three offers that the RMT executive have blocked without a convincing explanation. We remain open to talks and we have said repeatedly that we want to give our people a pay rise.\u201cBut until the union leadership and executive is united in what it wants and engages in good faith with the 30 per cent shortfall in revenue the industry is continuing to grapple with post-Covid, it is difficult to move forward.\u201cSadly our staff, our customers and the communities across the country which rely on a thriving railway are the ones that are suffering as a result.\u201dWhat does the government say?A spokesperson for the Department for Transport said: \u201cAfter a year of industrial action, passengers and rail workers alike are growing tired of union bosses playing politics with their lives.\u201cIt\u2019s high time the union leaders realised that strikes no longer have the impact they once did and are simply driving people away from the railway.\u201dI have a ticket booked for a day hit by industrial action. What can I do?Passengers with Advance, Anytime or Off-Peak tickets can have their ticket refunded with no fee if the train that the ticket is booked for is cancelled, delayed or rescheduled.Train operators are likely to offer flexibility to travel on a wide range of non-strike days.Passengers with season tickets who do not travel can claim compensation for the strike dates through Delay Repay.RecommendedMore rail disruption as union announces new August overtime ban for train driversTrain strike day?

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeHolidaymakers whose trips to Rhodes were cut short by wildfires have been offered a week\u2019s free stay on the island by the Greek prime minister.After wildfires ravaged up to 15 per cent of Rhodes, Kyriakos Mitsotakis told ITV Good Morning Britain: \u201cThe island is perfectly back to normal.\u201dAround 20,000 tourists were evacuated from resorts in the southeast of the island when wildfires spread on 22 July.Many overseas visitors were placed in emergency shelters set up in schools and other public buildings, and flown back early in an airlift.RecommendedSimon Calder: What the Rhodes wildfire crisis has taught us about holiday risks Rhodes holidaymaker says tour operator Tui urged to ignore evacuation orderWhat are the rules for items brought in from the EU?Anyone whose holiday ended early is, according to the prime minister, entitled to a free week.Mr Mitsotakis said: \u201cFor all of those whose holidays were cut short as a result of the wildfires, the Greek government \u2013 in cooperation with the local authorities \u2013\u00a0will offer one week of free holidays on Rhodes next spring and next fall, so that we make sure that they come back to the island and that they enjoy its natural beauty.\u201dIt is not clear how the offer will work, with key questions unanswered:How holidaymakers will prove they were evacuated before their holiday was completed.Whether some holidaymakers who had traumatic experiences may not want to return.Timing: the offer clearly excludes peak summer, which may be regarded as extending from June to September 2024. April, May and October are low-season months with plentiful accommodation.Will air fares be included? It seems extremely unlikely, since buying return tickets for 20,000 overseas visitors would cost at least \u00a35m.The deal may prove beneficial to airlines, but not necessarily to tour operators who would normally be selling package holidays in spring and autum. A spokesperson for Tui, one of the big two holiday companies, said: \u201cWe are aware of the kind offer from the Greek government and we are awaiting further information.\u201dThe Greek National Tourism Organisation said in a statement: \u201cThe Greek government has initiated a series of discussions with stakeholders including, but not limited to, tour operators, travel agencies, hoteliers and airlines.\u201cIn collaboration with all stakeholders we are collecting data required to define the number and requirements of potential beneficiaries in order to inform them about the next steps.\u201cThe process will be facilitated by a digital tailor-made platform for the claimants of the vacation package.\u201dThe Greek prime minister added: \u201cWe have no active wildfires as we speak and the weather for the next 15 days looks relatively benign.\u201cWe\u2019ve always had the wildfires in the Mediterranean for millennia.\u201cWhat has changed over the past years as a result of climate change is their intensity.RecommendedTourists flying into Greece inferno reveal why they refuse to cancel holiday Greece wildfires: Is it safe to travel to Corfu, Zante and Rhodes right now?Summer holidays to fire-hit Rhodes on sale for just \u00a3295\u201cWe understand that this caused some inconvenience for visitors, but I\u2019m happy to report that Rhodes today is more welcoming than ever.\u201dOffering free holidays after a natural disaster is believed to be a first for the travel industry."}, {"_id": "64cceb2f51ac3352961fa9bc", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/uk/england/liverpool/best-liverpool-hotels-b1988790.html", "primaryCategory": "Liverpool", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Best hotels in Liverpool 2023: Where to stay for style, location and value for money", "lead": "<p>Find your own Mersey paradise with this selection of the best hotels in Liverpool</p>", "author": "David Atkinson and Jade Bremner", "datePublished": "2023-08-03 17:11:19", "dateScraped": "2023-08-04 14:12:31.014546", "dateUpdated": "2023-08-03T17:11:19+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/03/16/liverpool-main.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Simon Calder\u2019s free travel email for expert advice and money-saving discountsGet Simon Calder\u2019s Travel email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

The terrace suite is the room to book with spa baths for two from which to watch the skyline city views.The restaurant, The London Carriage Works, continues to offer modern British cuisine in a brasserie setting, plus a cocktail bar and good-value prix fixe menu.

There are only four rooms, each with its own individual flourishes. Our pick is the attic for the best views of the city\u2019s landmark Anglican Cathedral illuminated by night.

There\u2019s a lot of navy and charcoal, but cerise and purple pop up too, while indigo sofas in the bar are conducive to decadent slouching when you slope back with your shopping haul. With a restaurant that is packed with well-heeled locals and mid-century modern style in the rooms, the T\u00f3tem exudes chic glamour.Best for a girls\u2019 weekend: ME Madrid Reina VictoriaEnjoy drinks at the Radio ME roof terrace (ME Reina de Victoria)Neighbourhood: Barrio de las LetrasYou can always find your way back to this gleaming white building, as a purple beacon shines from the slate turret on the corner. Located on Plaza de Santa Ana, with its pavement caf\u00e9s and tapas bars, the hotel is right in the thick of things, but the fabulous food at the trendy Ana La Santa restaurant at street level and the cocktails up on the Radio ME roof terrace mean you might struggle to leave the premises.

Best for mixing culture and nightlife: Room Mate AlbaRoom Mate Alba (Room Mate Alba)Neighbourhood: Barrio de las LetrasThis is the latest opening from the cool Room Mate group, which has four other hotels in Madrid. The Alba, in a handsome traditional building, is on one of the best streets in the city for bars and restaurants, but is also a short stroll from the Prado, Thyssen-Bornemisza and Reina Sofia museums. The d\u00e9cor combines Turkish and Chinese details with Op-Art features, a bit of Bauhaus and quite a few other influences too. It\u2019s all rather louche and decadent \u2013 a perfect fit for a barrio that was once home to writers such as Cervantes and Lope de Vega. Best for soaking up history: Pestana Plaza MayorPestana (Pestana)Neighbourhood: Madrid de los Austrias Occupying the historic Casa de la Carnicer\u00eda building, which forms part of Madrid\u2019s landmark square, the Plaza Mayor, this new hotel is literally part of the fabric of the city. Contemporary design in the courtyard bar and restaurant draws on the gold, teal and mauve tones used by Vel\u00e1zquez and Goya. Up on the roof, you can gaze across the skyline of slate pinnacles as you slump on a red deckchair by the guests-only pool. In winter, you might prefer to loll in the sumptuous hammam under the brick vaults of the former cellars.Best for discreet glamour: Relais & Ch\u00e2teaux OrfilaRelax in the refined Italianate terrace (Hotel Orfila)Neighbourhood: AlmagroThe ornate design at this boutique hotel still oozes old-school charm.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeAny traveller who\u2019s availed themselves of the delights offered by America\u2019s burgeoning legal cannabis industry will be able to sympathise with Gigi Hadid. Last month, the 28-year-old supermodel was arrested at an airport in the Cayman Islands when officials found \u201cganja and utensils used for the consumption of ganja\u201d in her luggage after she disembarked her private plane. Despite the fact the products had been purchased legally with a medical licence in New York, and the fact cannabis has been legal for medical use in Grand Cayman since 2017, Hadid was fined $1,000 before being released to continue her holiday \u2013 without her weed.Now that cannabis is legal for recreational use in 23 US states (plus Washington DC) and for medical use in 38 states (and DC), it might be tempting for flyers to think they\u2019re allowed to travel with weed as long as it\u2019s legal at both ends of their journey, but this is not the case. Being famous doesn\u2019t make you immune to the law: Gigi Hadid was fined for carrying cannabis  (Gigi Hadid/Instagram)Air travel in the United States is governed by federal law, which still considers cannabis a schedule-one narcotic with \u201cno accepted medical use\u201d. Until there\u2019s a change in the law at the federal level, taking any amount of cannabis across state lines remains very much illegal. RecommendedIndependent Traveller guide to best hotels and short breaksBest UK hotels 2022Best hotels in Paris for 2023If you think it\u2019s frustrating to have to leave your trusty vape behind before boarding, spare a thought for cannabis growers. The continuing federal ban means legal farmers in different states can\u2019t trade product, which has led to weed surpluses in certain places, such as Oregon and Washington, and scarcity in others.However, while the law prohibiting travelling from state to state with cannabis is pretty clear-cut, enforcement does vary and, in practice, it\u2019s unlikely the feds are going to spend too much time worrying about the THC gummies in your carry-on. The official policy at LAX in Los Angeles is that you\u2019re perfectly fine to have up to 28.5g of cannabis in the airport \u2013 but not while trying to go through a security checkpoint. If you\u2019re found with weed while going through TSA anywhere in the country, it will almost certainly be confiscated, and you may be turned over to local law enforcement. They could then involve the DEA (Drug Enforcement Administration), especially if the amount of cannabis you\u2019re carrying exceeds personal use or if officers find other reasons to believe you\u2019re involved in the sale and distribution of the drug (such as carrying excessive amounts of cash). Many US airports, such as Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare International, now have cannabis amnesty boxes, where travellers can choose to discard their weed before flying.Cannabis is legal in 23 US states  (Getty Images/iStockphoto)Flying highIt should probably go without saying, but transporting cannabis purchased legally in the US back to the UK remains very much forbidden \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t stop people trying. In January this year, British officers arrested nine American citizens who were attempting to smuggle more than 700lb of weed from LAX to Heathrow. Then, in July, a French woman flying from Philadelphia to London was stopped with 20lb of cannabis after being identified by a sniffer dog named Gini. She got off relatively lightly \u2013 while customs seized the weed, they allowed the traveller to continue to London and did not criminally charge her.When it comes to travelling with cannabis elsewhere in the world, the risks can be much greater. Last year, professional basketball player Brittney Griner sparked an international incident when she was arrested at an airport in Russia with cannabis oil in her luggage. Griner told a Moscow court that she had been prescribed the product for medicinal reasons in Arizona and had not intended to break Russian law, explaining: \u201cI was in a rush packing and the cartridges accidentally ended up in my bags.\u201d Griner was sentenced to nine years in prison, although she was eventually released in December, after the United States agreed to a prisoner swap for convicted arms dealer Viktor Bout.Facing the death penaltyTravellers in southeast Asia would also be well-advised to double check their luggage before going anywhere near a plane. Last June, Thailand removed cannabis from its list of banned narcotics \u2013 a move that led to the opening of legal dispensaries and booming sales of \u201cweed pizzas\u201d in the country. However, nearby holiday hotspot Bali, in Indonesia, is far less relaxed about it. Indonesia has some of the strictest anti-drug laws in the world, with prison sentences of up to 12 years for simple possession and even the possibility of the death penalty for serious traffickers. Earlier this year, officials in Bali said they\u2019d arrested 15 travellers \u2013 including Brits, Americans and Russians \u2013 in just two months for arriving in their country with cannabis purchased legally in Thailand.Drugs picked up by airport security will likely be confiscated  (Getty Images)Along with Indonesia, the United Arab Emirates are also noted for their zero-tolerance policy on drugs. Travellers to Abu Dhabi, Dubai and the other Emirates should be aware that the possession of cannabis, or any other banned narcotic, carries a mandatory minimum sentence of four years. Even having detectable amounts in your bloodstream can be considered possession. If you have enough to be considered a trafficker, you could face the death penalty. Japan also has notoriously strict cannabis laws, which can see those caught in possession handed up to five years\u2019 jail time even for a first offence. Famously, Paul McCartney was arrested in Tokyo in 1980 with 219g of cannabis in his luggage. After being threatened with seven years\u2019 hard labour, the former Beatle eventually served just 10 days in prison and has credited his celebrity for the relative leniency of his punishment.\u201cLouis smokes marijuana?\u201dPerhaps McCartney should have taken a leaf out of Louis Armstrong\u2019s book. In 1958, the jazz icon was travelling the world as a cultural ambassador for the United States. Due to his official duties, Armstrong had become accustomed to not being searched, but that changed one day when he arrived back in the US from Asia with 3lb of cannabis stuffed inside his trumpet case and was told to stand in line for customs.

When that was done, Nixon was only too happy to carry Armstrong\u2019s bags over the border for him. Much later, when he was informed of the ruse, Nixon is said to have spluttered disbelievingly: \u201cLouis smokes marijuana?\u201dThat brazen tactic might have worked for Armstrong but, for those of us who aren\u2019t travelling with a gullible politician in tow, the best legal advice is simply to remember that planes and cannabis don\u2019t mix. If you must get high, choose one or the other.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThere seems to be an unspoken rule that you can\u2019t mention the Ionian isle of Kefalonia without also mentioning Captain Corelli\u2019s Mandolin, Louis de Bernieres\u2019 1994 literary gem (and 2001 film) set on the island against the backdrop of the Second World War. Even though it\u2019s been nearly 30 years since the novel\u2019s debut, no fewer than three people brought it up to me during a recent trip, which is fair enough.Casting the island as a rustically charming and authentically Greek destination, the story has helped cement Kefalonia\u2019s reputation as a firm holiday favourite among the British. But these days, there\u2019s more to talk about. A crop of smart new openings, from restaurants to retreats, has infused the quiet island with a breath of fresh air; one that\u2019s decidedly more grown-up, sophisticated and three-dimensional.\u201cOne of my early summer memories is the island flooded by Italian tourists, who lived in basic-service rooms and used to pay the rental fee by selling the fish they caught while scuba diving,\u201d says Gavriela Danali, the owner (and interior designer) of the three-bedroom, bohemian-chic Villa Arterra in the sleepy village of Makriotika. \u201cBut Kefalonia has been obviously upgraded in the last years, with visitors looking for sophisticated accommodations and fine dining.\u201dVilla Arterra, one of the new batch of luxe-leaning places to stay in Kefalonia  (Arterra)Read more on Greece travel:RecommendedThe best family holidays to Greece to keep the kids entertainedSix best Greece holiday destinations and when to travel thereThe ultimate Greece travel guideGreece island hopping: A guide to the best routesThe six best Greece holiday destinations \u2013 and when to travel thereThe best hotels in GreeceSpurred on by this new demand, Danali opened her villa in 2018. She credits the increase in direct flights from European destinations for driving tourism (the airport was upgraded in 2019, which no doubt also helped). A mix of antiques and modern, housed within a building made of local stone, this villa is emblematic of the island\u2019s new calibre of tourists: yes, they want upmarket Korres toiletries and designer kitchens, but they also still want the authentic, raw Ionian experience, in rugged hillside villages where there are more goats than people.Kefalonia\u2019s forested, green interior has its charms, but it\u2019s easy to get swept away by the famous beaches. Fifteen minutes from Makriotika is Myrtos, the beach of postcard recognition, with blindingly white pebbles and water the iridescent blue-green of a peacock\u2019s breast, while Sami \u2013 another island favourite \u2013 is 20 minutes away. Boats like the Explorer 40 are available to hire, and open up the blue waters around the island  (Click&Boat)However, if you\u2019re looking for a crowd-free experience, the best beaches are the ones that are only accessible by boat, like Platia Ammos and Fteri. Bespoke boat trips have never been more convenient and comfortable thanks to new arrivals like the 2023 Explorer 40, available for day charters via Click&Boat (starting from \u20ac1,700/\u00a31,470 for a full day with up to 12 people).About 45 minutes north of Makriotika is the historic harbour of Fiskardo, perhaps the island\u2019s most upmarket destination, with shiny, celeb-studded yachts, stylish restaurants and Venetian architecture, mercifully left untouched by the 1953 earthquake that ravaged the rest of the island. In 2019, archaeologists discovered a 2,000-year-old Roman shipwreck just off the harbour, its cargo of amphorae spilt across the seabed.Culinary delights inspired by the surrounding sea (Fishkardo)This summer, the big news in Fiskardo is the two new restaurants by Lefteris Lazarou, the first Greek chef awarded a Michelin star. Tra Due shows off the island\u2019s Italian influences, while the harbourside Fishkardo is a study in show-off Ionian seafood. Salt-baked lavraki (Mediterranean sea bass) set aflame in ouzo, grilled cuttlefish with pine nuts and feta mousse, and steamed monkfish with massive, sweet onions from the nearby island of Zakynthos, visible from Kefalaonia\u2019s southern shores, crowd a promising menu.Speaking of the southern coast, two new upscale hotels have arrived just in time for summer: the four-star Celestial Suites and the most impressive new arrival, the five-star Eliamos. A 12-suite temple of high design, Eliamos infuses the island with the kind of high-flying style usually reserved for Mykonos or Santorini, with private saltwater pool villas, yoga and reformer pilates sessions, and e-bikes for local exploration.\n\nKefalonia has historically been an island of less development, as the local people have been protective of its natural beautySpyro Korsianos, owner of Eliamos hotel\u201cThere are very few luxury hotels in Kefalonia aimed at discerning, design-savvy travellers,\u201d says Spyro Korsianos, who co-owns Eliamos with his wife, interior architect Maike Gruna. Korsianos\u2019s mother and father are from Kefalonia, giving him an insider\u2019s perspective. \u201cKefalonia has historically been an island of less development, as the local people have been protective of the island\u2019s natural beauty.\u201cBut as the local community and hoteliers have embraced concepts around sustainability \u2013 for example, sustainable fisheries and protecting local heritage (such as the Unesco Geopark initiative) \u2013 we have gradually seen Kefalonia attract more tourism from those who want to get away from some of the busier, more traditionally popular islands.\u201dLose hours by the pool at this hotel  (Eliamos)Eliamos may offer a new reason to visit, but summer in Kefalonia is easily whittled away on timeless pursuits. Watch the massive loggerhead sea turtles come in with the morning fishing boats in the capital of Argostoli. Sip local crisp and citrusy robola at Orealios winery. Visit the 16th-century Monastery of Agios Gerasimos, patron saint of the island \u2013 or, because some things never get old, just spend the day soaking up that famed Grecian sunshine.Travel essentialsGetting thereJet2 and easyJet fly direct from the UK to Kefalonia.Staying thereGIC The Villa Collection offers a seven-night holiday staying in the Amos Suite at Eliamos Villas and Spa Hotel, Kefalonia, starting from \u00a32,439pp, B&B, based on May 2024 departure, including return flights from Gatwick, 23kg of hold luggage and car hire.RecommendedThe best family holidays to Greece to keep the kids entertainedSix best Greece holiday destinations and when to travel thereThe ultimate Greece travel guideRead more on the best Greece hotels"}, {"_id": "64cceb3051ac3352961fa9c1", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/who-is-andrew-tate-b2274224.html", "primaryCategory": "Lifestyle", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Who is Andrew Tate?

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeAndrew Tate, the former kickboxer and social media influencer who gained notoriety over the years for peddling misogynistic views, was charged with rape, human trafficking and forming a criminal gang to sexually exploit women, by Romanian prosecutors on Tuesday 20 June. Tate and his brother Tristan have just won their appeal against being placed under house arrest as they await trial, along side two Romanian women over the alleged abuses they stand accused of committing against seven women, accusations that all four defendants have continued to deny. The trial will not start immediately because, under Romanian law, the case gets sent to the court\u2019s preliminary chamber, where a judge has 60 days to inspect the case files to ensure legality.The four were held in police custody from 29 December until 31 March before a Bucharest court put them under house arrest. They have now been released but will require official permission before leaving the municipality.Here\u2019s everything you need to know about the controversial figure. RecommendedAndrew Tate released from house arrest over sex trafficking chargesAndrew Tate claims \u2018truth will be known very soon\u2019 as he arrives at Court of AppealAndrew Tate: A timeline of his rise and fallWho is Andrew Tate?Emory Andrew Tate is a social media influencer and former kickboxer.Tate was born in the US but came to live in Britain when he was four years old.He is also the founder of Hustler\u2019s University, an online \u201cacademy\u201d where members pay a monthly membership fee in exchange for advice on how to make a passive income from several online industries.Andrew Tate (PA)How popular is he and does he have a girlfriend?Prior to being banned, Tate had a huge Instagram following of 4.6 million. His popularity soared after videos of him began circulating on TikTok.Tate has been rumoured to be in a relationship with Naghel Georgiana Manuela. He shared a photograph of himself and Naghel aboard a private plane on his Instagram in October 2021.\u201cFlying in my Jet with the only woman I trust. Magic powers,\u201d he captioned the post.Tate first joined Twitter in 2011, but was banned in 2017 for violating its terms of service with tweets he wrote about violence against women. His account was reinstated in November 2022, after Twitter\u2019s policy changed under Elon Musk, who promotes \u201cfreedom of speech, but not freedom of reach\u201d.\u201cNegative/hate tweets will be max deboosted and demonetised, so no ads or other revenue to Twitter. You won\u2019t find the tweet unless you specifically seek it out, which is no different from rest of Internet,\u201d Mr Musk said.Tate is banned from several popular social media platforms including Facebook, Instagram and TikTok but was reinstated on Twitter after Mr Musk took over the platform.Is Andrew Tate rich?Andrew Tate and Tristan Tate are escorted by police officers outside the headquarters of the Directorate for Investigating Organized Crime and Terrorism in Bucharest  (Reuters)Tate has previously claimed that he is the world\u2019s first trillionaire. This is completely unproven.He has different \u201cbusiness ventures\u201d like Hustler\u2019s University, an online \u201cacademy\u201d where members paid a monthly membership fee.It was an online school that apparently helped people make money through 18 wealth creation methods and reportedly had around 100,000 paying subscribers who were charged around $49 per month until it was shut down last summer.Tate also sells digital products and access to \u201cprivate communities\u201d on his website. In an interview with The Mirror in March 2022, Tate and his brother Tristan revealed they run an adult webcam business, which employs lingerie-clad models to have chat sessions with men.During the chats, which are charged at $4 (\u00a33.30) an hour, the models tell male callers about \u201cfake sob stories\u201d.The brothers admitted that the operation was a \u201ctotal scam\u201d, but they are protected by two lines in their terms and conditions.Tristan said: \u201cOne is broadcasting is \u2018for entertainment purposes only\u2019. That means if a model says she has a sick dog or a sick grandma it doesn\u2019t have to be true. The next is that all cash given to models is \u2018a voluntary sign of gratitude for their time broadcasting\u2019.\u201dAndrew Tate has appeared frequently on the Piers Morgan Uncensored  (Piers Morgan Uncensored)What are the controversies surrounding him?In 2016, Tate was booted from the 17th season of Big Brother after just six days, after a video surfaced showing Tate hitting a woman with a belt. In a statement, Tate and the woman in the video both said the actions in the video were consensual.Tate has been the subject of much criticism since then, primarily for his views on women, which have been denounced as misogynistic.In one video in which he is seen discussing feminism, Tate said women should \u201cshut the f*** up, have kids, sit at home, be quiet and make coffee\u201d.Some of his most viral videos see him expressing opinions such as \u201cwomen can\u2019t drive\u201d, that men can cheat but women cannot and that 18-year-old women are \u201cmore attractive than 25-year-olds because they\u2019ve been through less d***\u201d.On 29 December 2022, Tate hit out at climate campaigner Greta Thunberg in a tweet, asking her to offer her comments on the carbon emissions of his cars.\u201cI have 33 cars,\u201d he claimed, before listing the specifications for his fleet of Bugatti and Ferraris.\u201cThis is just the start,\u201d Tate, 36, continued. \u201cPlease provide your email address so I can send a complete list of my car collection and their respective enormous emissions.\u201dTate\u2019s attempt to bait Thunberg into a conversation about the environmental impact of his many vehicles resulted in the climate campaigner responding publicly on 29 December.In the reply, Thunberg replied with a brutal response: \u201cYes, please do enlighten me. email me at smalld***energy@getalife.com.\u201dTate later responded: \u201cHow dare you?!\u201dAndrew Tate and Greta Thunberg\u2019s Twitter conversation went viral in December  (Andrew Tate/Twitter)That same day, reports emerged that Tate had been detained in Romania on suspicion of human trafficking, rape, and forming an organised crime group, prosecutors said. The siblings have been under criminal investigation since April, it was reported.Prosecutors said they had found seven women who claimed to have been sexually exploited by the suspects.Authorities allegedly used Tate\u2019s social media post in which he ridiculed a Romanian pizza chain, Jerry\u2019s Pizza, to confirm he was in the country.It is speculated that the arrest may not have happened if he had not posted a comeback video to mock Thunberg on Twitter.On 30 December, Thunberg responded to the news that their online spat had aided in Tate\u2019s arrest.The climate activist wrote on Twitter: \u201cThis is what happens when you don\u2019t recycle your pizza boxes.\u201dWhich social media platforms have banned him and why?TikTok has confirmed it has permanently banned an account belonging to Tate as part of an ongoing investigation to remove content that violates its policies.\u201cMisogyny is a hateful ideology that is not tolerated on TikTok. We\u2019ve been removing violative videos and accounts for weeks, and we welcome the news that other platforms are also taking action against this individual,\u201d a spokesperson told The Independent.However, most viral videos of Tate on the platform are shared by fan pages and other users.TikTok said it is using technology to remove duplicated clips of Tate\u2019s content from the platform altogether and is reviewing new content as it is shared.Tate has also been removed from Facebook and Instagram. A spokesperson for Meta confirmed to The Independent that Tate had been banned from both platforms for violating its policies, citing the company\u2019s guidelines on \u201cDangerous Individuals and Organisations\u201d.What have people said about him?The extent of Tate\u2019s influence became evident in August 2022 when radio presenter and TV personality Abbie Chatfield revealed that she has been receiving abusive direct messages from Tate\u2019s fans.Greta Thunberg and Andrew Tate (Getty)In an appearance on the Australian talk show The Project, Chatfield said she had first-hand experience of how Tate\u2019s views are influencing young boys.\u201cI\u2019m getting DMs [direct messages] from what appears to be early teen boys, saying \u2018I hope Andrew Tate destroys you\u2019.\u201cI also get comments calling me Abby Tate, comments on TikTok especially. That\u2019s where it\u2019s really rife.\u201d In a statement to The Independent in response to Chatfield\u2019s comments, Tate said: \u201cEveryone is entitled to an opinion and open discourse is very important for society to find the truth.\u201cI receive 10,000 hateful messages a day from her fans also. She has caused me more hate than I\u2019ve ever caused her.\u201cTruthfully I wish nobody received any hateful messages at all and we could discuss issues openly without fear. I wish her the best in all aspects of her life!\u201dWhat have women\u2019s groups said about him?In November 2022, White Ribbon, a charity that works to end male violence against women, raised the alarm that Tate\u2019s videos could have a concerning effect on young boys and men. The organisation also called on TikTok to remove content about Tate from its platform.\n\nDangerous cultures and environments for women and girls to exist inWhite Ribbon\u201cMen and boys regularly watching and listening to negative presentations of masculinity may begin to adopt these attitudes and behaviours, believing that they are acting as the \u2018ideal man\u2019,\u201d the charity told MailOnline.\u201cThis relates to being seen as tough, aggressive and suppressing emotion. These traits feed into gender norms, what \u2018being a man\u2019 and \u2018being a woman\u2019 is. Gender inequality is a direct result of traditional and negative stereotypes which confine women\u2019s and men\u2019s roles in society.\u201dThey continued: \u201cNot only does this create a lot of pressure on men and boys, often affecting their mental health and self-image, it also creates dangerous cultures and environments for women and girls to exist in.RecommendedMen have a problem \u2013 and it won\u2019t be solved by either Andrew Tate or Caitlin MoranWhere is Melania Trump?

Dr Shan YinKnown risk factors include obesity, inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, and being an adult male.For the study, the Dr Yin and colleagues analysed data from more than 28,000 people who were part of the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) survey.Each person\u2019s daily intake of added sugars was estimated from their self reported food and drink consumption.They also received a healthy eating index score (HEI-2015), based on the food they ate, whether it was beneficial foods such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, or less healthy options such as refined grains or saturated fat.The researchers adjusted for factors such as gender, age, race or ethnicity, income, body mass index, HEI-2015 score, smoking status, and whether the people taking part in the study had a history of diabetes.The researchers said people who received more than 25% of their total energy from added sugars had a 88% greater odds than those who had less than 5% of their total energy from added sugars.Results also showed people below poverty levels had greater odds of developing kidney stones when exposed to more added sugars than those at or slightly above poverty levels.Dr Yin said: \u201cFurther studies are needed to explore the association between added sugar and various diseases or pathological conditions in detail.\u201cFor example, what types of kidney stones are most associated with added sugar intake?RecommendedWhy TikTok is going wild for lip oil5 late summer blooms to plant nowWhy have the birds disappeared from my garden?\u201cHow much should we reduce our consumption of added sugars to lower the risk of kidney stone formation?\u201cNevertheless, our findings already offer valuable insights for decision-makers.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64cceb3351ac3352961fa9cc", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/recruiter-phone-call-tiktok-jobs-b2387141.html", "primaryCategory": "Lifestyle", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Recruiter issues warning about answering calls from unknown numbers after job applicant\u2019s \u2018rude\u2019 response", "lead": "<p>Recruiter says job applicant\u2019s response was \u2018triggering her anger issues\u2019 </p>", "author": "Brittany Miller", "datePublished": "2023-08-04 07:04:47", "dateScraped": "2023-08-04 14:12:35.335816", "dateUpdated": "2023-08-04T07:04:47+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/08/03/16/phone.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Stay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletterStay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeA recruiter has shared a reminder about answering phone calls from unknown numbers after she encountered a \u201crude\u201dresponse while trying to schedule a job applicant for an interview. Reilly Duke, who goes by the username @reillyduke on TikTok, took to the platform to share the warning while recalling how one man answered the phone when she called him to schedule a job interview.In the video, she began by providing context about her job, explaining that she is a recruiter so it\u2019s her responsibility to call applicants and schedule them for interviews and other parts of the hiring process.During interaction in question, she called a man named Ignacio. \u201cI said: \u2018Hi, is this Ignacio?\u2019 He said: \u2018Yes it is and I\u2019m very busy. What do you want?\u2019\u201d Duke said. She said she was so taken aback that she said: \u201cExcuse me?\u201d to get the applicant to repeat himself, only for him to repeat a second time, \u201cI\u2019m very busy.

Duke responded with her name and workplace, explaining that she was calling to schedule an interview for a job he applied for before asking him if he was still interested in the job.The phone then went silent for \u201cat least 15 seconds\u201d before the man responded. \u201cOh\u2026yeah\u2026yes I do, please yes,\u201d Ignacio said, according to Duke. After getting the interview confirmed, the TikToker said he profusely apologised for his earlier response. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry about that. I didn\u2019t know who you were. I was just kidding,\u201d he said.\u201cI said: \u2018Not a problem, we\u2019ll see you on this date\u2019,\u201d Duke said. She used the end of the TikTok to issue a warning to anyone who decides to answer an unrecognisable phone number. \u201cPlease be kinder to the people that you don\u2019t know who are on the other side of the phone,\u201d she began. \u201cBecause if I were a worse person, I would not have scheduled this person.\u201dThe video from 21 July has since gone viral on TikTok, where it has been viewed nearly 50,000 times. Dozens of viewers have commented explaining what they would do in the applicant\u2019s position as well as in Duke\u2019s.Some said they would never answer the phone like that. \u201cWhen I know I\u2019m applying for jobs I answer every phone call with \u2018Hello?\u2019\u201d one person commented. \u201cIf I know I\u2019m applying for multiple positions I am expecting multiple phone calls.

On 30 July, Dianne Victoriano and Paulo Padilla hosted their nuptials at the Barasoain Church in Malolos, trudging down the aisle in rainboots and bare feet. In a video posted by the groom\u2019s second cousin, Maria Jasmin Halili, Victoriano could be seen approaching the altar, surrounded by 50 guests who were brave enough to go out in the storm. The bride slowly walked towards her soon-to-be husband, as the train of her gown drowned in the water behind her. Meanwhile, Padilla wore a neutral-coloured suit with rubber shoes to protect the bottom of his feet.The province of Bulacan was hit with a disastrous typhoon on Saturday, before Victoriano and Padilla tied the knot. According to CNN Philippines, more than 228,000 families from 17 \u201cbarangays\u201d were affected by the storm. Due to the ongoing storms in the following days, the province announced a state of calamity on Monday. Speaking with Insider, Victoriano expressed her increased concern the week ahead of her wedding because of the continued monsoons. \u201cA week before the wedding, we were anxious and worried because of the non-stop rain. Then another storm came exactly on our wedding day,\u201d she confessed.

Halili admitted that she noticed a few guests had gone out and retrieved proper footwear before the ceremony began. Padilla\u2019s second cousin was just as stunned by the damage as the bride and groom.\u201cI thought the flood would be at the parking lot and the road on the way to the church, but we were all surprised to see that it had made its way inside,\u201d Halili told Insider. \u201cEven though there was a typhoon, they pushed through with the wedding.\u201d She continued: \u201cWhen the bride arrived, she just told her parents, \u2018Let\u2019s go down the aisle.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeA 26-year-old woman who \u201cjust never stopped playing with dolls\u201d now has a reborn hyper realistic doll collection, often \u201cdressing them up\u201d and thinks her \u201cfun and therapeutic hobby\u201d is something more women should do as \u201cmen don\u2019t have to give up their hobbies\u201d as they get older.Rochelle Sadd, a disability support worker, from New South Wales, Australia, always loved playing with dolls, especially baby dolls and Barbies, and when she was around 12 years old she saw an advert for reborns and instantly it was all she could think about, she says.She could not wait to go into year nine of secondary school, as students got an option to take home a RealCare baby, a baby doll that simulated a real baby.When she finally got to take one home, she thought it was \u201cso cool\u201d and \u201cloved playing with it\u201d and began repairing dolls in her spare time.At 17 years old, Rochelle got a second-hand reborn baby, which she thought was the \u201cbest thing ever\u201d and she now has six dolls in total, with the most expensive doll costing 1,000 Australian dollars (\u00a3514).RecommendedA big mistake: And Just

day, Rochelle dresses the dolls up, but asserts that she knows \u201cthey are dolls\u201d and does not act \u201cas if they are completely real\u201d.Now, Rochelle shares her hobby online, on YouTube and Instagram,\u00a0 where she goes by Shell Bell, to her thousands of followers, and has found a reborn community \u2013 she often meets up with a group of women with reborn dolls despite the public acting like they are \u201cnot happy or they don\u2019t approve\u201d.Rochelle told PA Real Life: \u201cI just never stopped playing with dolls \u2013 I\u2019ve always loved it.\u201cI think they\u2019re beautiful and it\u2019s a fun and therapeutic hobby.\u201cI love dressing them up in cute clothes and collecting them, and I always think it shouldn\u2019t be considered weird or stigmatised \u2013 men get to play with train sets and video games when they get older, so why can\u2019t women?\u201cMen don\u2019t have to give up on their hobbies.\u201dWhen Rochelle was around 12 years old she saw an advert for reborn dolls on her mother\u2019s computer and became desperate to own one.She explained: \u201cWhen I was a little girl, I saw an email advertising this gorgeous, beautiful lifelike doll that was in a beautiful dress, and they were very expensive.\u201cI just remember thinking I wish I could have one of those, I really wanted one, it\u2019s all I could think about.\u201dOne of Rochelle\u2019s high school highlights was having a RealCare baby doll to take home as it was the closest thing to a reborn doll.She said: \u201cI could not wait to go into year nine in high school so I could have this real doll and play with it.A woman holds a super realistic doll during a gathering of collectors and producers in a mall in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais state, Brazil on November 6, 2022 (AFP via Getty Images)\u201cI was just so fascinated by it, I thought it was so cool.\u201cI loved playing with it so much.\u201cIn my spare time, I started buying dolls and repairing them, but I always wanted my own.\u201dAt age 17, she finally got her hands on a reborn doll, she said: \u201cMy mum got me a second-hand reborn and I thought it was the best thing ever.\u201cI played with it all the time and I started to get into the reborn community.\u201dView of super realistic dolls during a gathering of collectors and producers in a mall in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais state, Brazil on November 6, 2022 (AFP via Getty Images)Rochelle\u2019s family were not too surprised about her purchase, she explained: \u201cAt that point, I was buying doll parts and repairing them so it didn\u2019t come as much of a shock.\u201cNot every single person in my life knows about the dolls either.\u201cI mainly tell people that are going to see them if they come over to my house.\u201dOver time, Rochelle bought an additional five dolls, with her most expensive toy costing 1,000 dollars.She said: \u201cI\u2019ve got three newborns and two three-month-olds.\u201cMy favourite is Nixon, so he has brown hair, he looks like he\u2019s sleeping \u2013 perhaps he\u2019s my favourite because he looks like me and if I had a son, maybe that\u2019s what he would look like.\u201cI went through a phase of when I enjoyed open-eye babies but now I love hyper realistic ones that look like they are sleeping.\u201dDay to day, Rochelle plays with her dolls and displays them in a nursery in prams.She said: \u201cI love playing with them, dressing them up , but I wouldn\u2019t say I roleplay with them as if they are completely real \u2013 I know they are dolls.\u201cI have clothes for them which I love putting them in, they look super cute, but I don\u2019t pretend to feed them.\u201dNow, Rochelle shares her hobby online, on YouTube and Instagram, with her 13,900 and 19,900 followers respectively, and films herself playing with them.She explained: \u201cI only roleplay with them when I\u2019m filming \u2013 I\u2019ll feed them, put them in a pram, cuddle them, just act as if they are completely real, but that\u2019s purely for the sake of a video.\u201cI\u2019ll film tutorials on how to clean prams, role play videos, tutorials, hauls.\u201dHer boyfriend even helps her record her videos and is very supportive of her unusual interest.She said: \u201cHe will help me with things especially if I need to film something.\u201cHe\u2019ll hold the camera and stuff but he doesn\u2019t really want anything to do with it, that\u2019s fine.\u201cIt\u2019s definitely my separate hobby.\u201dSince posting about her hobby, Rochelle has found a reborn community online, and even meets up with fellow reborn mums.She explained: \u201cSo when there\u2019s a group of five or so prams together with reborn dolls some people will think we\u2019re in a mother\u2019s group, some people think it\u2019s cute, and some people think it\u2019s weird and walk away.\u201cThey usually are really quick to walk away but I\u2019ve never really had major negative issues \u2013 maybe they\u2019ll say something under their breath.\u201dOn whether she would recommend reborns to others, she said: \u201cI can see that there could be a lot of benefits to people even if it is just something as simple as empty nest syndrome, where you have children and they\u2019ve grown up and it\u2019s just you at home now and you feel a little bit lonely.RecommendedCharity boss speaks

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeA woman has detailed how she redesigned her wedding dress into an enchanted look for Taylor Swift\u2019s Eras Tour. TikToker Miranda Mendelson, who goes by the username @slashedbeauty, had sparks flying in her mind when she transformed her long white wedding gown into a Speak Now-inspired dress ahead of the singer\u2019s recent concert in Los Angeles. She posted a two-part video to her page on 24 July to show the step-by-step process that went into cutting and dying the formerly white gown. Speaking to Insider, Mendelson said that she and her friends had struggled to get tickets for the first weekend of shows in California, but eventually landed tickets from some mutuals. Once their seats were secured, the creator and her peers decided they would each dress up as an era, and of course, she chose Swift\u2019s 2010 album. \u201cI immediately knew I wanted to claim \u2018Speak Now,\u2019 as it\u2019s one of my favourite Taylor albums that I connected so deeply with at the time it was released when I was a senior in high school,\u201d she said. \u201cThis was before we even knew that \u2018Speak Now (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u2019 was coming out this year.\u201dFollowing the theme of the album covers \u2013 Swift wore a purple Reem Acra design on both the original and \u201cTaylor\u2019s version\u201d - Mendelson was motivated to reimagine her 2017 wedding gown in a completely different form. RecommendedTaylor Swift and Beyonc\u00e9 fans speak out about sale of \u2018obstructed\u2019 and \u2018no view\u2019 tour ticketsPoliticians urge Taylor Swift to postpone LA concerts in solidarity with striking hotel workersMoment Taylor Swift fans cause \u2018earthquake\u2019 at Seattle concert\u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to reuse my wedding dress for something special for awhile now,\u201d she admitted in part one of her series. \u201cI got this wacky idea. It\u2019s been sitting in my closet for six years... excited to give it a second life.\u201dFirst, the TikToker wanted to crop the length of her dress to be above the knee, so she left the previously floor-length gown with a seamstress in her neighbourhood. After two weeks, Mendelson picked up the finished product and headed home to try it on. \u201cIt\u2019s so freaking cute,\u201d she proclaimed as she tried on the much-shorter dress. \u201cI mean how adorable is it at this length? This came out way better than I even expected. I love it.\u201d Next step was to dye the dress purple. Mendelson admitted she was \u201cnervous\u201d about this part of the process because she risked ruining the dress, especially since she wasn\u2019t able to keep it boiling in the colour on the stove as directed as the clothing was too \u201cbulky\u201d to keep in a pot. Instead, she grabbed a huge black bin and filled it with heaps of boiling water. \u201cLuckily, I live in Las Vegas where our tap water can get pretty hot in the summer - and also added some boiling water to a large bin - and crossed my fingers it would work out,\u201d she said. The bodice of the dress was first to absorb the radiant purple, while the skirt slowly assumed a light shade over an hour and a half. After letting the fabric dry overnight, Mendelson couldn\u2019t believe the finished product. \u201cEven though there were some surprises - the top layer of the skirt ended up staying white - I was pleasantly surprised with the results and I actually liked the variation I got in colour,\u201d the TikTok user noted, referring to the contrast of the now-deep purple bodice and faint purple hues in the layered skirt. In the clips, Mendelson also contemplated adding butterflies to the tulle bottom but didn\u2019t confirm she would. Both videos were posted to Instagram and Facebook, attracting about 1.5m views across both platforms. While there appeared to be an overwhelming amount of support and awe for Mendelson\u2019s wedding gown transformation, there were also a few critics, who weren\u2019t supportive of the TikToker\u2019s decision to strip the gown of its pure form. \u201cShould be a tutorial on how to mess up your wedding dress,\u201d one critic claimed.However, according to Mendelson, \u201cshe has no regrets\u201d. And, contrary to the criticism, the Swiftie is excited to give her gown additional \u201csentimental value\u201d and continue to wear it. \u201cPersonally, I find it much more special that I can continue to wear this dress, and add to its sentimental value through upcycling and rewearing it versus storing it away to collect dust,\u201d Mendelson explained. \u201cDyeing and shortening it doesn\u2019t get rid of any of the sentimental value for me. It\u2019s still what I wore on my wedding day, except more functional for me at this point in my life.\u201d RecommendedMark Zuckerberg says he\u2019s a \u2018girl dad\u2019 after taking family to Taylor Swift\u2019s concertTravis Kelce admits to trying, and failing to get Taylor Swift\u2019s numberTaylor Swift fan sparks backlash after filming herself in singer\u2019s former apartmentShe also revealed that, when the gown doesn\u2019t fit her anymore, she plans to donate it to a teenager in an underprivileged community.

Once their seats were secured, the creator and her peers decided they would each dress up as an era, and of course, she chose Swift\u2019s 2010 album. \u201cI immediately knew I wanted to claim \u2018Speak Now,\u2019 as it\u2019s one of my favourite Taylor albums that I connected so deeply with at the time it was released when I was a senior in high school,\u201d she said. \u201cThis was before we even knew that \u2018Speak Now (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u2019 was coming out this year.\u201dFollowing the theme of the album covers \u2013 Swift wore a purple Reem Acra design on both the original and \u201cTaylor\u2019s version\u201d - Mendelson was motivated to reimagine her 2017 wedding gown in a completely different form.

It\u2019s been sitting in my closet for six years... excited to give it a second life.\u201dFirst, the TikToker wanted to crop the length of her dress to be above the knee, so she left the previously floor-length gown with a seamstress in her neighbourhood. After two weeks, Mendelson picked up the finished product and headed home to try it on. \u201cIt\u2019s so freaking cute,\u201d she proclaimed as she tried on the much-shorter dress. \u201cI mean how adorable is it at this length? This came out way better than I even expected. I love it.\u201d Next step was to dye the dress purple. Mendelson admitted she was \u201cnervous\u201d about this part of the process because she risked ruining the dress, especially since she wasn\u2019t able to keep it boiling in the colour on the stove as directed as the clothing was too \u201cbulky\u201d to keep in a pot. Instead, she grabbed a huge black bin and filled it with heaps of boiling water. \u201cLuckily, I live in Las Vegas where our tap water can get pretty hot in the summer - and also added some boiling water to a large bin - and crossed my fingers it would work out,\u201d she said. The bodice of the dress was first to absorb the radiant purple, while the skirt slowly assumed a light shade over an hour and a half. After letting the fabric dry overnight, Mendelson couldn\u2019t believe the finished product. \u201cEven though there were some surprises - the top layer of the skirt ended up staying white - I was pleasantly surprised with the results and I actually liked the variation I got in colour,\u201d the TikTok user noted, referring to the contrast of the now-deep purple bodice and faint purple hues in the layered skirt. In the clips, Mendelson also contemplated adding butterflies to the tulle bottom but didn\u2019t confirm she would. Both videos were posted to Instagram and Facebook, attracting about 1.5m views across both platforms. While there appeared to be an overwhelming amount of support and awe for Mendelson\u2019s wedding gown transformation, there were also a few critics, who weren\u2019t supportive of the TikToker\u2019s decision to strip the gown of its pure form. \u201cShould be a tutorial on how to mess up your wedding dress,\u201d one critic claimed.However, according to Mendelson, \u201cshe has no regrets\u201d. And, contrary to the criticism, the Swiftie is excited to give her gown additional \u201csentimental value\u201d and continue to wear it. \u201cPersonally, I find it much more special that I can continue to wear this dress, and add to its sentimental value through upcycling and rewearing it versus storing it away to collect dust,\u201d Mendelson explained. \u201cDyeing and shortening it doesn\u2019t get rid of any of the sentimental value for me. It\u2019s still what I wore on my wedding day, except more functional for me at this point in my life.\u201d RecommendedMark Zuckerberg says he\u2019s a \u2018girl dad\u2019 after taking family to Taylor Swift\u2019s concertTravis Kelce admits to trying, and failing to get Taylor Swift\u2019s numberTaylor Swift fan sparks backlash after filming herself in singer\u2019s former apartmentShe also revealed that, when the gown doesn\u2019t fit her anymore, she plans to donate it to a teenager in an underprivileged community.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeAfter a month-long honeymoon hiatus from social media, beauty influencer Mikayla Nogueira has finally addressed claims that her wedding was sponsored.  @mikaylanogueira So many questions about my big day! Here\u2019s some answers \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb #marriage #wedding #makeup #beauty #greenscreen \u266c original sound - Mikayla Nogueira  In a series of TikTok videos posted on 1 August, the influencer got ready on camera while responding to all the questions and rumours that have been circulating since her big day on 1 July. The 24-year-old Boston-based TikToker tied the knot with long-time boyfriend Cody Hawken in Newport, Rhode Island, in front of 175 people, including celebrity makeup artist Mario Dedivanovic and hair guru Chris Appleton. Other familiar TikTok celebrities in attendance included Dylan Mulvaney, Chris Olsen, and James Charles. While the day was meant to be a celebration of Nogueira and Hawken\u2019s lasting love, the makeup mogul\u2019s at-home audience was quick to judge, with many suggesting her wedding looked to be more of a brand trip.On 27 June, Nogueira announced the launch of a new collaboration with e.l.f. cosmetics to honour her impending nuptials. She and the popular drugstore makeup company released a lip kit called \u201ce.l.f. x Mikayla Marriage Material Lip Duo,\u201d which Nogueira planned to use for her wedding look. Although a lot of fans praised the product, others felt the timing was disingenuous and a ploy to sell more at the big event.Speaking to her followers on 1 August, Nogueira revealed that she had woken up the day after her wedding to a flood of text messages encouraging her to stay off TikTok due to the backlash surrounding her nuptials. Although she still has not read any of the negative content, she said she has heard the claims from others close to her.

The biggest question: \u2018Was my wedding sponsored?\u2019\u201d The content creator giggled in disbelief at the fact she even had to respond to such a claim. \u201cNo, my wedding wasn\u2019t sponsored, none of it,\u201d Nogueira said. She then explained how she and her wedding planner had the idea to combine a kissing booth with her e.l.f. products to distribute as party favours that guests could take home with them. However, she made it clear that her wedding was not sponsored by the brand, adding that she\u2019d paid for everything herself and asked the makeup company if she could use their logo on the booth. \u201cI don\u2019t think you understand how much it means to me that I got to work with e.l.f., so of course I wanted to include them in my big day,\u201d she added. Additionally, Nogueira also addressed rumours that she uninvited close friends to her wedding so she could make room for more influencers. In a now-erased Reddit post, allegedly written by a friend of 10 years, they\u2019d indicated that they had not received an invitation to the wedding after getting a save-the-date from the influencer.\u201cMy wedding was 175 people. Ten per cent of that was influencers. The only reason why it seemed like it was all influencers was because the only people posting on TikTok are influencers,\u201d the popular influencer noted. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re wondering about the friend that I chose not to invite, they\u2019re not my friend and I\u2019m sure you can see why.\u201d \u201cInfluencers are just people, dude. These are my coworkers I\u2019ve been getting to know and befriended over the last three years. I see them all the time at events. We talk everyday. I\u2019ve gotten close to a lot of influencers, so of course I wanted to have them at my wedding,\u201d she remarked. \u201cInfluencers at my wedding weren\u2019t influencers. They were just my friends.\u201d After responding to the most controversial claims made about her wedding, Nogueira opened up about how the negative rumours made her feel. \u201cIt was really disheartening that so many people had so much to say about my wedding before I could even say anything,\u201d she said. \u201cI understand if you don\u2019t like me, I get it. But it\u2019s my wedding day. I only have this day once in my life, and to see so many people try to destroy it was just really sad. The way society is, we pray for people\u2019s downfalls, and that\u2019s really sad.\u201d Upon her return to TikTok, Nogueira was then forced to post a follow-up video acknowledging a different narrative, about her taking diabetes medication Ozempic. A commenter wrote on her previous post and said: \u201cMy guess is you\u2019re on Ozempic? But won\u2019t disclose that. You know when you stop taking it, you gain it all back.\u201d In response to the claim, the beauty fan was taken aback, with Nogueira telling viewers: \u201cThis is like such a thing, dude, on TikTok. Anybody makes a video: \u2018You\u2019re on Ozempic.\u2019 My video has nothing to do about my weight, my body, nothing. I literally can\u2019t. It\u2019s everywhere, bro.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeAfter a month-long honeymoon hiatus from social media, beauty influencer Mikayla Nogueira has finally addressed claims that her wedding was sponsored.  @mikaylanogueira So many questions about my big day! Here\u2019s some answers \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb #marriage #wedding #makeup #beauty #greenscreen \u266c original sound - Mikayla Nogueira  In a series of TikTok videos posted on 1 August, the influencer got ready on camera while responding to all the questions and rumours that have been circulating since her big day on 1 July. The 24-year-old Boston-based TikToker tied the knot with long-time boyfriend Cody Hawken in Newport, Rhode Island, in front of 175 people, including celebrity makeup artist Mario Dedivanovic and hair guru Chris Appleton. Other familiar TikTok celebrities in attendance included Dylan Mulvaney, Chris Olsen, and James Charles. While the day was meant to be a celebration of Nogueira and Hawken\u2019s lasting love, the makeup mogul\u2019s at-home audience was quick to judge, with many suggesting her wedding looked to be more of a brand trip.On 27 June, Nogueira announced the launch of a new collaboration with e.l.f. cosmetics to honour her impending nuptials. She and the popular drugstore makeup company released a lip kit called \u201ce.l.f. x Mikayla Marriage Material Lip Duo,\u201d which Nogueira planned to use for her wedding look. Although a lot of fans praised the product, others felt the timing was disingenuous and a ploy to sell more at the big event.Speaking to her followers on 1 August, Nogueira revealed that she had woken up the day after her wedding to a flood of text messages encouraging her to stay off TikTok due to the backlash surrounding her nuptials. Although she still has not read any of the negative content, she said she has heard the claims from others close to her.

The biggest question: \u2018Was my wedding sponsored?\u2019\u201d The content creator giggled in disbelief at the fact she even had to respond to such a claim. \u201cNo, my wedding wasn\u2019t sponsored, none of it,\u201d Nogueira said. She then explained how she and her wedding planner had the idea to combine a kissing booth with her e.l.f. products to distribute as party favours that guests could take home with them. However, she made it clear that her wedding was not sponsored by the brand, adding that she\u2019d paid for everything herself and asked the makeup company if she could use their logo on the booth. \u201cI don\u2019t think you understand how much it means to me that I got to work with e.l.f., so of course I wanted to include them in my big day,\u201d she added. Additionally, Nogueira also addressed rumours that she uninvited close friends to her wedding so she could make room for more influencers. In a now-erased Reddit post, allegedly written by a friend of 10 years, they\u2019d indicated that they had not received an invitation to the wedding after getting a save-the-date from the influencer.\u201cMy wedding was 175 people. Ten per cent of that was influencers. The only reason why it seemed like it was all influencers was because the only people posting on TikTok are influencers,\u201d the popular influencer noted. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re wondering about the friend that I chose not to invite, they\u2019re not my friend and I\u2019m sure you can see why.\u201d \u201cInfluencers are just people, dude. These are my coworkers I\u2019ve been getting to know and befriended over the last three years. I see them all the time at events. We talk everyday. I\u2019ve gotten close to a lot of influencers, so of course I wanted to have them at my wedding,\u201d she remarked. \u201cInfluencers at my wedding weren\u2019t influencers. They were just my friends.\u201d After responding to the most controversial claims made about her wedding, Nogueira opened up about how the negative rumours made her feel. \u201cIt was really disheartening that so many people had so much to say about my wedding before I could even say anything,\u201d she said. \u201cI understand if you don\u2019t like me, I get it. But it\u2019s my wedding day. I only have this day once in my life, and to see so many people try to destroy it was just really sad. The way society is, we pray for people\u2019s downfalls, and that\u2019s really sad.\u201d Upon her return to TikTok, Nogueira was then forced to post a follow-up video acknowledging a different narrative, about her taking diabetes medication Ozempic. A commenter wrote on her previous post and said: \u201cMy guess is you\u2019re on Ozempic? But won\u2019t disclose that. You know when you stop taking it, you gain it all back.\u201d In response to the claim, the beauty fan was taken aback, with Nogueira telling viewers: \u201cThis is like such a thing, dude, on TikTok. Anybody makes a video: \u2018You\u2019re on Ozempic.\u2019 My video has nothing to do about my weight, my body, nothing. I literally can\u2019t. It\u2019s everywhere, bro.
