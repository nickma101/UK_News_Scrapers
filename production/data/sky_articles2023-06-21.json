It could be partially submerged, and of course, there's lots of submarine canyons and submarine seamounts... those issues are very difficult.\"Sounds could be from Titanic itselfThe sounds picked up on sonar could be \"spurious\" as there is \"a lot of noise coming from the ocean\", an ex-Navy officer has said.Former rear admiral Chris Parry said the Titanic itself \"makes a lot of noise even as the current shifts through it\", and attention should be focused on the area of \"likely accident to the vessel itself\".Analysing the current situation with the now-international rescue effort for the submersible, Mr Parry said there is a \"concentrated section of aircraft and support vessels\" around the Titanic wreck site. \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nShahzada Dawood and his son Suleman are on board the submersible\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\n(L-R) Paul-Henri Nargeolet, Hamish Harding and Stockton Rush.

He worked as a doctor for IS while she looked after the household, two daughters and the women they captured.In 2015, they moved to the city of Mosul in Iraq, which by then was under IS control.They moved, with Naveen, between Iraq and Syria as the fighting continued and coalition forces started to recapture land and defeat the terror organisation. They took the Yazidi woman with them and tried to force her to abandon her faith.The couple were eventually arrested by Kurdish forces in March 2019 and Nadine K was extradited back to Germany in 2021. \n\n\nThe Yazidi genocide background\n\nIn 2014, Islamic State militants seized large parts of Iraq and Syria, killing 1,200 Yazidis and enslaving as many as 12,000 women and girls. \nMuch of the minority Yazidi population in Iraq, around 550,000, was forced to flee their homes, mainly around the Mount Sinjar area. \nThe women were taken to captivity in Iraq and Syria, tortured, raped and forced to work for Islamic State.\n\nThe UN team investigating the massacre concluded that there was \"clear and convincing evidence that genocide was committed\", and a number of governments, including Germany have officially recognised it as such.\nThe Yazidis are an ancient group, mainly based in northwest Iraq but also small pockets in Syria and Turkey.\nTheir religious beliefs have roots in Christianity, Judaism, Islam and Manichean but unlike many religions Yezidism has no central holy book.\n\nIslamic State, which perpetuated an extreme interpretation of Islam, believed they were devil worshippers and tried to force them to convert or killed them.\n\n\n\n\n'I cried... watching Naveen relive the horrors'The Yazidi captive was eventually released and made it to safety after making herself known to a Scottish man, called Alan Duncan, in the al Hol camp in Syria.Speaking to Sky News, Mr Duncan said: \"I have been following Naveen on this journey for the last four years, from the moment we found her in the al Hol camp and freed her from ISIS.Read more:Countries file torture complaint against Syria over 'unlawful killing' of thousands of civiliansGreece migrant boat disaster: Survivors 'swam for hours surrounded by children's bodies'\"I cried as I sat in the courtroom watching Naveen relive the horrors that she was put through.\"She had to recount intimate details to a foreign court, in front of people she didn't know, in a language she couldn't understand.\"She, like so many other survivors, never gave up hope.

I said this was an opportunity and told them I was Yazidi.\"The witness, whose mother died while she was in captivity, gave evidence at the trial in Germany, to face down her former captor.\"I saw a lot at the hands of Daesh,\" she said. \"I want to see that day when I face that Daesh because I saw a lot of torture and difficulty at her hand. The same way I was in prison because of her, she would be in prison too.\"It is true that she tortured me alone but as a Yazidi girl when she violated me, she violated all the Yazidis. They felt the pain when I was in prison.

Use our calculators below to compare how recent events have affected the cost of your groceries, clothing, and leisure activities.\n\nStuart Parkinson, an economist at Retail Economics, told Sky News:\n\n\n\n\"Historically, it typically takes two or three things to go wrong in relatively quick succession to really let the cat out of the bag with respect to inflation.\"Unfortunately, that's what has happened just in recent years: Brexit was punch one; COVID, punch two; and then Russia/Ukraine punch three.\"And once the inflation cat gets out of the bag, it leaves policymakers with a heck of a job getting it back in. And that's where we are now.\"People are starting to realise that the road back to 2% inflation is far trickier and more hazardous than they realised, and it can also take a long time.\"See how your spending has gone up compared to five years ago \n\nThe price of a can of baked beans has nearly doubled since 2018 from 56p up to \u00a31.07, the biggest food price increase over the period. A pack of frozen burgers has increased by 65%, from \u00a32.01 in January 2018 up to \u00a33.32 now.The item with the biggest increase in the shopping basket was a day's car hire, which has increased from \u00a337.63 in 2018 to \u00a378.80 now. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrexit and the pandemic have contributed to price rises2020 saw the double shock of the UK's official exit from the European Union at the end of January, closely followed by the global COVID pandemic with lockdowns starting in March.Initially, inflation remained low as the nation headed into lockdown and spent less money. Once lockdowns had eased in 2021, pent-up demand combined with supply disruptions saw prices increase rapidly.Paula Bejarano Carbo, associate economist at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, told Sky News that COVID-related supply chain issues were a major driver of inflationary momentum in 2021:\"There was a sudden overheating of the UK economy.\"The UK is not a country that typically has a very high savings rate. But over the pandemic there was excess saving as people were not able to spend.\"As soon as restrictions started lifting people started spending quite quickly and there was excess demand in the economy which pushed up prices.\" \n\nSome household DIY items have seen the biggest price rises since 2020. MDF fireboard has gone up 73%, from \u00a318.59 to \u00a332.16, while a box of ceramic tiles has increased from \u00a311.39 to \u00a318.08.Some 29 of the top 50 price increases since 2020 are within the food and drink category.Researchers at The Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics have looked at isolating the inflationary impact of Brexit from other recent economic events.Their latest report suggests that Brexit contributed an additional 30 percentage points to food price inflation between December 2019 and March 2023, with food prices increasing by 25% over the time period. Had the UK not exited the European Union, their analysis estimates, the increase would have been 17%.Nikhil Datta, assistant professor in the Department of Economics at the University of Warwick, who co-authored the research, told Sky News that non-tariff trade barriers - border frictions other than taxes - were the biggest driver of Brexit-specific inflation.He said: \"When we say frictions, we mean things which are going to make it costly for firms to move things across borders. Food products in particular face quite a few of these as a result of regulatory differences across different countries.\"Firms may also be anticipating future issues and hiring additional employees or consultants to assist with border frictions, and adapting prices accordingly.\"So, when adhering to regulations at the border there is the cost of actually doing it at the border, like the veterinary check, but there's also the fact that you've got to change the structure of your business somewhat.\"That is part of what we're seeing now. When we start seeing these hard checks at the border [in the future], these price increases might be larger. Or it could be that actually businesses have already taken these into account in their current pricing structure.\"Food prices have rocketed since Russia invaded UkraineThen came Russia's invasion of Ukraine, sending further shocks through the international economy. Energy, fertiliser and grain prices rise significantly last year, with a particularly big impact on food and fuel bills. \n\nThe price of olive oil increased more than any other food product since 2022, rising by 58% from \u00a33.91 to \u00a36.16.None of the 152 types of food tracked by the ONS have become cheaper since February 2022. Only cereal bars have managed to avoid any price increase, staying at 31p.Persistent inflation has knock on effects on the rest of the economy, and the Bank of England has been raising interest rates in an attempt to control price rises.Stuart Parkinson explained: \"Central bankers have created a host of ways to manage financial shocks in the past 20 years - and, let's face it, they've also had plenty of practice.\"But their inflation-fighting toolkit is much more limited, and their main tool - raising interest rates - inflicts a lot of collateral damage in the process, hence their reticence to deploy it to its fullest effect.\"MethodologyThe ONS collects these prices by visiting thousands of shops across the country and noting down the prices of specific items. There are upwards of 100,000 prices published every month, from more than 600 products.The items that form the \"official shopping basket\" change each year to reflect how the purchasing habits of the population have changed. For example in March 2021, after a year of the pandemic, hand gel, loungewear bottoms and dumbbells were added, while canteen-bought sandwiches were among the items removed.Where there aren't the exact equivalent items available at a survey shop, ONS officials pick the best alternative and note that they've done this so it's weighted correctly when the averages are worked out.Shops are weighted as well, so the price in a major chain supermarket will have a greater impact on the average than an independent corner shop.During the pandemic, more of the survey was carried out over the phone and work is ongoing to digitise the system to be able to take in more price points by getting data from supermarket receipts, rather than making personal visits.The Data and Forensics team is a multi-skilled unit dedicated to providing transparent journalism from Sky News.

These are known as \"active\" sonobuoys.\nThere are also \"passive\" sonobuoys, which are used to simply listen for sounds in the water - such as the sound of enemy submarines.\nThe buoys were initially developed in the Second World War to detect German U-boats -

They took the Yazidi woman with them and tried to force her to abandon her faith.The couple were eventually arrested by Kurdish forces in March 2019 and Nadine K was extradited back to Germany in 2021. \n\n\nThe Yazidi genocide background\n\nIn 2014, Islamic State militants seized large parts of Iraq and Syria, killing 1,200 Yazidis and enslaving as many as 12,000 women and girls. \nMuch of the minority Yazidi population in Iraq, around 550,000, was forced to flee their homes, mainly around the Mount Sinjar area. \nThe women were taken to captivity in Iraq and Syria, tortured, raped and forced to work for Islamic State.\n\nThe UN team investigating the massacre concluded that there was \"clear and convincing evidence that genocide was committed\", and a number of governments, including Germany have officially recognised it as such.\nThe Yazidis are an ancient group, mainly based in northwest Iraq but also small pockets in Syria and Turkey.\nTheir religious beliefs have roots in Christianity, Judaism, Islam and Manichean but unlike many religions Yezidism has no central holy book.\n\nIslamic State, which perpetuated an extreme interpretation of Islam, believed they were devil worshippers and tried to force them to convert or killed them.\n\n\n\n\n'I cried... watching Naveen relive the horrors'The Yazidi captive was eventually released and made it to safety after making herself known to a Scottish man, called Alan Duncan, in the al Hol camp in Syria.Speaking to Sky News, Mr Duncan said: \"I have been following Naveen on this journey for the last four years, from the moment we found her in the al Hol camp and freed her from ISIS.Read more:Countries file torture complaint against Syria over 'unlawful killing' of thousands of civiliansGreece migrant boat disaster: Survivors 'swam for hours surrounded by children's bodies'\"I cried as I sat in the courtroom watching Naveen relive the horrors that she was put through.\"She had to recount intimate details to a foreign court, in front of people she didn't know, in a language she couldn't understand.\"She, like so many other survivors, never gave up hope.

Then the official data comes in and it turns out inflation is not falling as fast as predicted. And then everyone gets depressed.Spending calculator: See which prices have gone up or down\n\n\n\n\n\nThat pattern repeated itself today.Economists thought the headline inflation rate - the consumer price index annual rate - would drop in May from 8.7% to 8.4%. Instead, it stayed precisely where it was in April.Even worse, the core rate of inflation, which is what you're left with when you strip out volatile stuff like fuel and food, actually rose from 6.8% to 7.1%.This will all unnerve an already nervous Bank of England. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt pays more attention to these underlying adjusted measures, which give you more of a sense of whether price rises are becoming embedded in the economy.And all the signs suggest that that is precisely what is happening: what began as a rise in one-off, explicable prices seems to be turning into a stickier phenomenon.Read more:No decrease in inflation as it remains at 8.7%Jeremy Hunt rules out mortgage support and capping food pricesWhile it's possible that inflation may fall sharply later on this year, that likelihood diminishes with every month that core inflation remains so high.There are a few obvious consequences.The first is that the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee will certainly raise interest rates again in the coming months, putting further pressure on mortgage borrowers.A couple of months ago those bank rates were expected to peak at around 5%. Now they are expected to hit 6%.This will be very painful for households with mortgages and may have a bearing both on the housing market and the wider economy.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpreaker\n\n                This content is provided by Spreaker, which may be using cookies and other technologies.\n                To show you this content, we need your permission to use cookies.\n                You can use the buttons below to amend your preferences to enable Spreaker cookies or to allow those cookies just once.\n                You can change your settings at any time via the Privacy Options.\n            \n\n                Unfortunately we have been unable to verify if you have consented to Spreaker cookies.\n                To view this content you can use the button below to allow Spreaker cookies for this session only.\n            \n\nEnable Cookies\nAllow Cookies Once\n\n\n\nListen and subscribe to the Ian King Business Podcast hereHowever those who've paid off their mortgages and are net savers will see an increase in their fortunes (though banks are always slower to pass on savings rates than to put up borrowing rates).The other consequence is political.Higher inflation and mortgage rates are likely to be one of the big factors in the coming election.The prime minister pledged earlier this year to halve inflation. That pledge now looks far less likely than it did back in January.He also pledged to keep the economy growing but despite having avoided recession thus far, higher interest rates will possibly depress UK gross domestic product, which is barely flatlining at present.In short, these figures are not good for the Bank of England and, in their separate way, not good for the prime minister and chancellor.Many years ago, a famous German economist once described inflation as being a little toothpaste: very easy to squeeze out of the tube; very hard to put back into the tube.We are being reminded of just how right he was.\n"}, {"_id": "64931c7a51ac331b72e25dd6", "url": "https://news.sky.com/story/economy-woes-will-see-conservatives-do-battle-over-tax-cuts-as-election-time-looms-12906808", "primaryCategory": "business", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Economy woes will see Tories do battle over tax cuts as election looms", "lead": "This has not been a good week for Rishi Sunak.

He is batting away louder calls for direct mortgage relief or tax cuts.But it threatens to be a slow burn crisis for millions of homeowners, and also renters who are seeing prices soar as landlords try to recoup their costs.Last month, Mr Hunt told Sky News' Ed Conway that he would support a rise in interest rates north of 5% - \"even if that would precipitate a recession\" - to bring down inflation.One of his economic advisers, Karen Ward of JP Morgan Asset Management, made the argument this morning that the Bank should go further and only recession-like conditions - with companies deciding against prices rises and workers deciding against asking for pay rises - would curb inflation.In the Treasury, sources say fiscal support for people with mortgages could be disastrous and the chancellor must stick the course - but it could take far longer than hoped.This is hardly the backdrop for what is expected to be the traditional debate in the Conservative Party at election time about lowering the tax burden - currently at a 70-year high.With the Liz Truss period in mind, those publicly calling for tax cuts have been sidelined.

He is batting away louder calls for direct mortgage relief or tax cuts.But it threatens to be a slow burn crisis for millions of homeowners, and also renters who are seeing prices soar as landlords try to recoup their costs.Last month, Mr Hunt told Sky News' Ed Conway that he would support a rise in interest rates north of 5% - \"even if that would precipitate a recession\" - to bring down inflation.One of his economic advisers, Karen Ward of JP Morgan Asset Management, made the argument this morning that the Bank should go further and only recession-like conditions - with companies deciding against prices rises and workers deciding against asking for pay rises - would curb inflation.In the Treasury, sources say fiscal support for people with mortgages could be disastrous and the chancellor must stick the course - but it could take far longer than hoped.This is hardly the backdrop for what is expected to be the traditional debate in the Conservative Party at election time about lowering the tax burden - currently at a 70-year high.With the Liz Truss period in mind, those publicly calling for tax cuts have been sidelined.

Now they are expected to hit 6%.This will be very painful for households with mortgages and may have a bearing both on the housing market and the wider economy.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpreaker\n\n                This content is provided by Spreaker, which may be using cookies and other technologies.\n                To show you this content, we need your permission to use cookies.\n                You can use the buttons below to amend your preferences to enable Spreaker cookies or to allow those cookies just once.\n                You can change your settings at any time via the Privacy Options.\n            \n\n                Unfortunately we have been unable to verify if you have consented to Spreaker cookies.\n                To view this content you can use the button below to allow Spreaker cookies for this session only.\n            \n\nEnable Cookies\nAllow Cookies Once\n\n\n\nListen and subscribe to the Ian King Business Podcast hereHowever those who've paid off their mortgages and are net savers will see an increase in their fortunes (though banks are always slower to pass on savings rates than to put up borrowing rates).The other consequence is political.Higher inflation and mortgage rates are likely to be one of the big factors in the coming election.The prime minister pledged earlier this year to halve inflation. That pledge now looks far less likely than it did back in January.He also pledged to keep the economy growing but despite having avoided recession thus far, higher interest rates will possibly depress UK gross domestic product, which is barely flatlining at present.In short, these figures are not good for the Bank of England and, in their separate way, not good for the prime minister and chancellor.Many years ago, a famous German economist once described inflation as being a little toothpaste: very easy to squeeze out of the tube; very hard to put back into the tube.We are being reminded of just how right he was.\n"}, {"_id": "64931c7e51ac331b72e25de1", "url": "https://news.sky.com/story/jeremy-hunt-rules-out-mortgage-supports-and-capping-food-prices-12906082", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Chancellor rules out mortgage support and capping food prices", "lead": "The chancellor has ruled out mortgage bill support for fear it would increase inflation.", "author": "\nSarah Taaffe-Maguire\n", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 14:27:00", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:51:26.327794", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "SkyNews", "image": "https://e3.365dm.com/23/05/70x70/skynews-jeremy-hunt-file_6167289.jpg?20230525145559", "body": "\nThe chancellor has ruled out mortgage bill support for fear it would increase inflation.

For context, the Titanic shipwreck lies about 12,000ft below the surface.While officials said an investigation of the banging sounds they had picked up had come back negative, experts insist sonobuoys could still prove crucial in narrowing the search. \n\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\n\n\n3:09\n\n\n\n\n\nHow the missing sub saga unfolded\n\n\n\n\"The seabed is enormous, the water depth is enormous,\" said Mr Welham, who compared searching for the submersible to trying to find a coin on a football pitch.Noise from the Titan should be distinguishable from the ambience of the North Atlantic, and the decision to investigate the banging sounds suggests officials thought there was something to them.Dr Jamie Pringle, a reader in forensic geosciences, said they were \"unlikely\" to be from a surface ship propeller or another submarine.\"Acoustic noise travels far in water, so that is both good and bad news,\" he said.\"You would still need three of those static buoys to be able to triangulate the sound source to get a position fix.\"\n"}, {"_id": "64931c7f51ac331b72e25de5", "url": "https://news.sky.com/story/pixel-tablet-googles-latest-comes-with-a-twist-but-can-it-find-an-audience-12905398", "primaryCategory": "technology", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Google's so committed to its new tablet design - you can't buy it without one key feature", "lead": "As smartphone screens have got bigger, and laptops more powerful, tablets have gone through something of an identity crisis.", "author": "None", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 09:21:00", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:51:27.555620", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "SkyNews", "image": "https://e3.365dm.com/23/06/70x70/skynews-google-pixel-tablet_6192451.png?20230619144749", "body": "\nAs smartphone screens have got bigger, and laptops more powerful, tablets have gone through something of an identity crisis.Once pitched as an obvious middle ground between the computer in your pocket and the one on your lap, the thinking behind them seems increasingly muddled.\n\n\n\nThere are iPads for people who want a keyboard and powerful processor (but not a laptop?), and those who want a small screen (but not a bigger phone?).Samsung makes tablets, occasionally with a stylus, while also making phones that fold out into screens even bigger than some tablets. And don't forget Amazon's various Kindles and Microsoft's array of Surfaces.If your head hurts thinking about them all, you're not alone. As someone who recently helped research a new family tablet purchase, it's more difficult than ever to know which models to choose from as use cases vary so wildly.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut that hasn't stopped Google from coming up with yet another use case for a tablet - what if it was also a smart home display?The Pixel Tablet launches today into a field more crowded than ever, priced \u00a3599. It's got the same chip as the company's flagship Pixel 7 smartphones, an 11-inch screen, and a bunch of apps optimised to take advantage.But the standout feature is the dock, which you slap the tablet on to with some powerful magnets and effectively transforms the device into a home hub.You can see information like time and weather, have it cycle through photos, play music from the in-built speakers, control your lights, and its \"Hey Google\" voice assistant is always listening. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nThe tablet is designed to be placed on a dock when not in active use\u2026\n        \n\n\n\nNo dock, no diceThe idea is that rather than leave it teetering on the arm of the sofa, down the side of the bed, or worse still at the mercy of your children, you pop it on the dock and make it the centre of your smart home.Google's so committed to this idea, you can't buy the tablet without the dock.It's a very different approach to that taken by other tech companies, and almost seems as much designed to target Amazon's dominance in the smart speaker market as Apple's in the tablet space.Of course, at \u00a3599, it comes in much more expensive than your average home hub - even the pricier ones like Amazon's Echo Show and Google's own Nest Hub.Google has long made great and popular smartphones, and its Pixel range is one of the very best for anyone who favours the Android operating system.But the search giant has never quite found solid footing in the tablet space, and its previous attempt offered a completely different pitch to today's release. The Pixel Slate, from 2018, was a pricey Frankenstein-esque bid to combine tablet with Chromebook, and it was discontinued after just two years.Sceptics will no doubt suspect a similar fate awaits the Pixel Tablet. Google certainly has history when it comes to killing off products and services beyond just misguided tablets, with its Glass headset and Stadia games platform (dead after two and three years, respectively) among the most high-profile examples. \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\n\u2026and used as a normal tablet when picked up\n        \n\n\n\nBut as you'd expect, its executives are bullish about the Pixel Tablet and the tech is impressive.The thicker bezels and matte finish make it nice and grippy, albeit less premium feeling; it's really fast; offers eight megapixel cameras on the front and back, which work especially well for video calling; and Google promises the battery will survive 12 hours of video streaming.And while Android has never felt nearly as at home on a tablet as on a phone, during our hands-on time we found popular apps - from Google's own like YouTube and Gmail to others like Disney+ and WhatsApp - were rather well optimised and could be used split-screen.The Pixel Tablet also supports multiple accounts, making it more shareable among a household than Apple's iPad, which will help put parents' minds at ease.Most importantly, the dock works as advertised, turning the tablet into an attractive fixture of your living room, with pretty solid speakers for playing music, radio, and podcasts.Read more:Google's first folding phone has eye-watering price\u2026\u2026but it's still some way cheaper than Apple's new headset \n\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News\nInstall the Sky News app for free\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven that ever more muddled space between smartphones and tablets, Google will hope its decision to have it flirt with the smart home market proves a master stroke.Considering its history with new products, we'll know in about two years.\n"}, {"_id": "64931c8051ac331b72e25de6", "url": "https://news.sky.com/story/taking-regular-naps-is-good-for-the-brain-study-finds-12905780", "primaryCategory": "technology", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Adults who take naps could have bigger brains", "lead": "Taking a nap during the day can leave you feeling refreshed, recharged and ready to take on the world.

And the figures are reflected on screen - a 2021 diversity study by gaming website Diamond Lobby, of more than 100 of the best-selling titles from the previous five years, found 54% of main characters are white, while just 8% are non-white women.But the celebratory focus of Windrush Tales shifted when, with pre-production barely under way, news broke of a scandal that shook the team's faith to its core. \n\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\n\n\n0:40\n\n\n\n\n\n'People traumatised' by Windrush scandal\n\n\n\nThe Windrush scandalBack in 2018, with the 70th anniversary of the Windrush's arrival on the horizon, it emerged that many of those who made the same journey over subsequent decades had been wrongly detained, deported, and denied legal rights by a \"hostile environment policy\" that cracked down on those deemed to have arrived in the UK illegally.Some of those deported later died.Among those worst affected by the government's policy, introduced by the then home secretary Theresa May in 2012, were members of the Windrush generation - who arrived in the UK legally, and with the government's encouragement, between 1948 and 1973. Many, like Rose, took jobs in the NHS - and other sectors impacted by Britain's post-war labour shortage.While indefinite leave to remain was automatically granted upon their arrival in the UK, many weren't issued with any documents confirming their status and were later unable to prove their right to stay when immigration officers came knocking. Jobs and properties were lost, health care and benefits were denied, and in the worst cases, people were deported to countries they barely knew.Read more:Home Office knew policy would hit Windrush generation \n\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\n\n\n0:59\n\n\n\n\n\nI felt like an alien, says Windrush scandal victim\n\n\n\n'A generation were pushed aside'The game's writer Corey Brotherson - who is also a descendant of the Windrush generation - says the scandal shifted the \"entire tone\" of the game, and gave the team extra purpose in their work.\"For a lot of people, Windrush was something that was either not known about much or forgotten,\" he says. \"The contributions of the Windrush generation were pushed aside.

One of his grandfather's first experiences was being ripped off by a taxi driver, and he also struggled for acceptance in the workplace.\"My grandad was a hard worker, but sometimes it was difficult to find work,\" Brotherson says. \"Sometimes if he got a promotion, his white co-workers would be antagonistic towards him.\"It was typical of the racism, bigotry and pushback his generation experienced when they were trying to establish themselves.\" \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nCorey Brotherson, writer of Windrush Tales.

Now is the time to do that.\"The 58-year-old is suing Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN), the publisher of the Daily and Sunday Mirror and the Sunday People, for damages over alleged unlawful information gathering between 1991 and 2011.He claims journalists there were linked to phone hacking; so-called \"blagging\" or gaining information by deception; and the use of private investigators for unlawful activities. \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nPrince Harry gave evidence in his case earlier on in the trial\n        \n\n\n\nMGN denies Le Vell's claim, arguing there is \"no evidence\" of voicemail interception or unlawful information gathering relating to him.Richard Munden, lawyer for MGN, previously alleged Le Vell's case is \"particularly weak\", saying that some articles in the claim were before phone hacking started or when it had \"significantly dropped off\".Le Vell was followed on the witness stand by Alan Halsall who is supporting his claim. \"To think that people did not trust him and wrongly suspected him of leaking information to the defendant is heartbreaking to me and to him,\" Halsall said in his witness statement. \n\n\n\n\n\nSpreaker\n\n                This content is provided by Spreaker, which may be using cookies and other technologies.\n                To show you this content, we need your permission to use cookies.\n                You can use the buttons below to amend your preferences to enable Spreaker cookies or to allow those cookies just once.\n                You can change your settings at any time via the Privacy Options.\n            \n\n                Unfortunately we have been unable to verify if you have consented to Spreaker cookies.\n                To view this content you can use the button below to allow Spreaker cookies for this session only.\n            \n\nEnable Cookies\nAllow Cookies Once\n\n\n\nClick to subscribe to the Sky News Daily wherever you get your podcastsHalsall also talked about his own experiences of phone hacking; he described voicemails \"going missing\" for a period or described dialling in to listen to a voicemail and hearing an \"engaged tone\".At the end of the submissions in court on Tuesday, the judge, Mr Justice Fancourt, read a list of journalists' names, including Matthew Wright, Neil Wallis, Katie Hind, and former Daily Mirror editor Piers Morgan, and questioned why none of them had been called as witnesses in the case.Mr Morgan, who has always denied any knowledge of phone hacking or illegal activity at the Daily Mirror, was yesterday accused of knowing how to hack phones, and explaining how to do it to others, by a former Mirror journalist. \n\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News\nInstall the Sky News app for free\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Justice Fancourt said he had a \"question in my mind\" about whether several people, including three or four associates of the Duke of Sussex, \"could and should have given some evidence\".The judge then specifically referred again to Mr Morgan and former Sunday People editor Neil Wallis, whom he said had \"relatively recently had a lot to say about this matter outside of court\".Closing submissions will be entered this week before final arguments pick up again in court on Tuesday.The case will formally conclude at the end of next week, with a ruling expected at a later date.\n"}, {"_id": "64931c8551ac331b72e25df3", "url": "https://news.sky.com/story/bruce-willis-daughter-shares-rare-picture-of-star-with-new-granddaughter-12906276", "primaryCategory": "entertainment", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Bruce Willis's daughter shares rare picture of star with new granddaughter", "lead": "Bruce Willis's daughter shared a heartwarming photo of the actor with her daughter Louetta on Father's Day.", "author": "None", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 17:16:00", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:51:33.492193", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "SkyNews", "image": "https://e3.365dm.com/23/06/70x70/skynews-bruce-willis-us-actor_6193694.jpg?20230620155039", "body": "\nBruce Willis's daughter shared a heartwarming photo of the actor with her daughter Louetta on Father's Day.Rumer Willis, 34, said the Father's Day memory would be something she would \"treasure\" for the rest of her life.\n\n\n\nIn the photo, Willis is captured for the first time with his new granddaughter Louetta Isley, who is eight weeks old.The accompanying post said: \"Fathers to the old and new.
