But he stressed: \"There was no mooring rope,\" suggesting that there was no attempt to tow the boat or tether to it for any length of time. <br/>\"They refused it, they said 'no help, we go to Italy' and continued on their way.\"<br/>The question of whether any of the ships tried to attach a rope to the migrant boat was first raised by an activist who said people on board had said they feared it could prompt their highly crowded boat to turn over. <br/>A total of 104 people were saved from the sea soon after the ship sank shortly after 02:00 local time on Wednesday but the chances of finding any more are disappearing fast. <br/>The UN International Organization for Migration has described the sinking as one of the biggest tragedies in the Mediterranean.<br/>The coastguard's timeline and account have been challenged, notably by one organisation that says it was in contact with people on the fishing boat. An email sent by Alarm Phone on Tuesday afternoon warned the coastguard that as many as 750 people were on board and they were urgently asking for help.<br/>The coastguard has stressed that from the first moment it was in contact with the crew during the afternoon no request for assistance was made. Two commercial ships provided the boat with water during the evening, but coastguard officials have said repeated offers of assistance were turned down.<br/>The Greek government's insistence that no mooring rope was used follows a report by Greek newspaper Kathimerini on Friday that a coastguard vessel turned on searchlights and used loudspeakers to tell those on board they were in danger and would not be able to reach the Italian coast. <br/>This was said to have taken place around three hours before the boat went down.<br/>Members of the coastguard tied a rope to the fishing boat so that its own crew could check conditions inside, according to the source. Some of those on board then untied the rope in order to continue their route northwards to Italy. <br/>But two accounts from survivors have suggested a rope may have led to the boat going down.<br/>One has come from a local councillor in the port city of Kalamata who had earlier spoken to a 24-year-old Syrian. <br/>\"The coastguard boat tied them with some rope and tried to tow them to the left. For an unknown reason the boat veered to the right and suddenly sank,\" said Tasos Polychronopoulos.<br/>Another survivor gave a similar version to former Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras during a visit to Kalamata on Thursday.<br/>\"The Greek coastguard asked the vessel to follow them, but they couldn't,\" a translator told Mr Tsipras. \"The coastguard then threw a rope but because they didn't know how to pull the rope, the vessel started dangling right and left.\"<br/>\"The coastguard boat was going too fast but the vessel was already dangling to the left, and that's how it sank.\"<br/>Hellenic coastguard spokesman Cpt Nikos Alexiou was adamant on Friday that \"there was no attempt to moor the boat\", although he did say ropes had been thrown by sailors from a commercial ship that provided supplies during the evening.<br/>\"Since the ship had not asked for help, we could not intervene,\" he told public broadcaster ERT. \"You cannot enter international waters if a vessel is not engaged in smuggling or some other crime,\" <br/>\"The boat was illegally transporting people. We had not entered the critical phase to be able to enable the rescue operation,\" he said.<br/>Nine people, including several Egyptians, have been arrested on suspicion of people trafficking, Greek TV is reporting.<br/>Georgios Vasilakos, a volunteer rescue doctor for the Hellenic Red Cross, told the BBC's Today programme that no women and children were among the survivors.<br/>He said survivors reported that \"all women and children were isolated below deck\". <br/>\"This is why, because of the rapid unfolding of events and the rapid capsizing of the boat, they were unable to get out in time,\" he said. <br/>People on the boat had been drinking sea water for at least two days before it sank, he said. <br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Survivors winched to safety after Greece boat disaster<br/>Families of some of the missing have arrived in Kalamata in search of their loved ones.<br/>\"My relatives were on the boat,\" said Aftab, who had travelled from the UK and said at least four of his relatives from Pakistan were unaccounted for.<br/>A Syrian man from the Netherlands broke down as he revealed his wife and brother-in-law were missing.<br/>\"The authorities are looking for their bodies in the sea...They're looking in hospitals, they're looking among dead bodies, and among the survivors,\" Kassam Abozeed said.<br/>Several marches in protest at the tragedy took place on Thursday evening, in the capital Athens, the second city Thessaloniki and elsewhere.<br/>Greece is one of the main routes into the European Union for refugees and migrants from the Middle East, Asia and Africa.<br/>Last month the Greek government came under international criticism over video reportedly showed the forceful expulsion of migrants who were set adrift at sea.<br/>Are you in Greece?

Instead she was in for months while Sam Eljamel operated on her seven times. <br/>The BBC can reveal her surgeon - the former head of neurosurgery at NHS Tayside - was harming patients and putting them at risk for years but the health board let him carry on regardless.<br/>NHS Tayside has consistently claimed it only knew about concerns from June 2013 and that they put him under supervision at that point but an NHS whistleblower has told the BBC the health board knew as early as 2009 that there were serious concerns.<br/>BBC Scotland has spoken to three surgeons who worked under Mr Eljamel at Tayside. All three said he was a bully who was allowed to get away with harming patients.<br/>All three said there was a lack of accountability in the department and that Mr Eljamel was allowed to behave as if he were a \"god\" - partly because of the research funding he brought to the department. <br/>The health board told the BBC it was working with the Scottish government to support an independent review of patients' care under Mr Eljamel and that it could not comment on individual cases. <br/>Before her operation in 2011 Leann used to work full-time and go on holidays abroad with friends but her life was blighted by migraines. <br/>Mr Eljamel, reputed to be the best neurosurgeon in Scotland, told her he could help. <br/>It would be one operation and she would be home in a matter of days, she was told. <br/>He would remove a small part of her skull to alleviate pressure and he told her he would use a new glue to seal the wound. <br/>Leann told the BBC: \"Unfortunately it did not seal properly and it burst.<br/>\"The wound burst open and the brain fluid started to pour out the back of my neck.\"<br/>She says the next day her hospital bed was \"soaked\" with her spinal fluid. <br/>When she got up to use the bathroom she collapsed and said the fluid went all over the floor. A nurse put a wet floor warning sign on the area. <br/>Leann says that her mum had to chase Mr Eljamel down a corridor to get him to come and look at her - at which point she was rushed back into surgery. <br/>Leann spent months in hospital. She contracted meningitis and developed hydrocephalus. Mr Eljamel ordered her to have four lumbar punctures - which her medical notes say she specifically should not have had. <br/>Leann knows now he was using the glue as part of a research trial. <br/>\"Experimenting on me - that's what he was doing,\" she says. <br/>\"There can't be any other reason to try a glue, try different shunts, that's experimenting.<br/>\"I was his guinea pig.\" <br/>She adds: \"He had free rein on my body. He was playing God with my body and the NHS handed him the scalpel, seven times.\"<br/>When Leann tried to raise concerns with staff she was told that Mr Eljamel had saved her life. She was not told that he was under investigation, nor that he had been later forced to step down. <br/>It was only after seeing recent BBC coverage she realised she was not alone. <br/>Leann is now 33. She lives in constant pain. She needs crutches to walk and has a tube - called a shunt - through her body controlling her spinal fluid. <br/>\"Everything is changed,\" she says. \"My dream was to be a police officer and that will never happen.<br/>\"I struggle with that, not being able to have the career you want, not being able to have the lifestyle you want, not being able to have children.<br/>\"A lot of things have been taken away through no fault of my own.\"<br/>Leann is one of 100 patients calling for a public inquiry to find out exactly what harm Mr Eljamel did. <br/>The damage to her and other patients is irreversible but she wants to ensure the health board is held accountable and that no other surgeon can cause such damage. <br/>She says she only realised he had harmed patients after seeing a story by BBC Scotland.<br/>\"I thought it was just me, I didn't know there was 99 other people,\" she says. <br/>\"I don't understand how he got to wash the blood off his hands and go home.\"<br/>Mr Eljamel was suspended by NHS Tayside following internal and external reviews in 2013 and went to work in Libya.<br/>For the first time, three people who worked with Mr Eljamel have spoken to the BBC.<br/>Mark, not his real name, says he is speaking out now because he fears the health board has still not learnt the lessons of the past. <br/>\"I did raise concerns at the time but I was shut down,\" he says. <br/>\"Part of me feels guilty I did not do anything [more] about it but I was too junior. <br/>\"We were told we would never get our traineeship.\"<br/>He says nurses, senior surgeons and managers knew at least as early as 2009 that Mr Eljamel was regularly away from the hospital doing private work when he was meant to be operating on patients.<br/>Mark says that on a weekly basis Mr Eljamel left junior surgeons to operate unsupervised. <br/>\"Letting a junior operate when you're not even in the building and a patient coming to harm is negligent,\" he says. <br/>\"NHS Tayside has covered things like this up for a long time in Dundee.<br/>\"It went all the way up to the board. They all knew about it.\"<br/>Mark remembers on one occasion being in surgery to watch the junior operating on Mr Eljamel's patient when the junior surgeon accidentally cut through the spinal cord. <br/>He said the spinal fluid was \"pouring out\" and that he and another surgeon were sent running to find a more senior surgeon. That patient was left permanently disabled. <br/>\"What has this top neurosurgeon done to these patients?\" He says. \"I think serious harm. Cover-ups happen so these things need to be looked into again. <br/>\"Drawing a line is easy to say but the culture will not change if you just draw a line in the sand. You need to change the culture first to protect the patients.\" <br/>The three surgeons told us Mr Eljamel discouraged the use of X-rays because he was so arrogant and because it saved him money. <br/>It is thought that as a result he operated in the wrong place on the spines of at least 70 patients - leaving many permanently disabled.<br/>Mark says one of the reasons Mr Eljamel was considered \"untouchable\" was that he brought so much money in to the department through research projects which many of them considered to be \"odd and even questionable\".<br/>A spokeswoman for NHS Tayside said: \"The NHS Tayside medical director and chief executive met with the cabinet secretary and local Tayside MSPs in April to discuss the ongoing concerns of patients of Professor Eljamel. <br/>\"It was agreed at the meeting that NHS Tayside would work with Scottish government regarding the next steps to support individual patients through a process independent of both the health board and government. <br/>\"NHS Tayside remains committed to do whatever is required to support the independent process recognising it will be tailored to the circumstances of individual patients. <br/>\"While we cannot comment on individual patients and their treatment due to patient confidentiality, we would invite Ms Sutherland to contact NHS Tayside's Patient Liaison Response Team.\"<br/>Health board review over botched operations surgeon<br/>Damning report on top surgeon's botched operations<br/>Surgeon ordered to pay \u00a32.8m compensation bill<br/>Top surgeon harmed patients for years<br/>African leaders tour Kyiv after air raid alert<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Greece denies coastguard rope led to boat tragedy<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

But when their father was diagnosed with early on-set Alzheimer's aged just 55, two young brothers made lifestyle changes and revised career ambitions to help with his care. So what is it like becoming your parent's parent?<br/>When Simon Ruscoe started acting strangely in 2015, it was initially put down to work stress. <br/>The hands-on, active husband and father was increasingly starting to forget things and get words muddled. He forgot directions. <br/>After many years of probing, his family eventually learnt he had early on-set Alzheimer's in 2020. <br/>In October that year, he left his job as an IT service delivery manager and the family's life changed dramatically.<br/>\"When I first found out my dad had Alzheimer's, I kept it to myself,\" said Simon's youngest son Oliver, 21.<br/>\"I didn't want people to feel sorry for me.\"<br/>As their father's condition deteriorated, Oliver and his brother Alex, 26, had to take on more care responsibilities as everything from eating to getting dressed became a challenge.<br/>\"The most basic tasks are the most straining,\" said Oliver.<br/>\"We have to make sure he has sun cream on, when he goes to the bar we have to make sure he gets the right drink, we have to get his food for him.\"<br/>Alex, who had moved out but moved back home after the diagnosis, added: \"If you put out a clean pair of clothes for him, he will put the dirty clothes back on. <br/>\"You have to ask him when he needs to go to the toilet. <br/>\"Sometimes he'll be fidgeting and you can tell there's something not quite right but he hasn't got the ability to tell you.\"<br/>Career sacrifices and adjustments have also been made by the brothers. <br/>Alex, a full time civil servant, became a registered carer and reduced his days in the office.<br/>Oliver, a part time supermarket assistant who wants to be a train driver, stopped considering jobs away from their home in Solihull, West Midlands.<br/>They have also adjusted their social lives - choosing family holidays over trips with friends and bringing their father when they go to the pub or friends' houses.<br/>A care rota was introduced so their mother, Emma, could have downtime too. <br/>\"Oliver and Alex have been absolutely unbelievable,\" said Emma, who works in adult social care at Solihull Council alongside caring for her husband. <br/>\"I wouldn't be able to have Simon at home without their support. I wouldn't cope. I don't know how people do it without support from family. <br/>\"I am so incredibly proud.\"<br/>The brothers said it was \"mentally draining\" seeing their father unable to complete basic activities. <br/>But they want to pay him back for being \"a brilliant dad\" when they were younger.<br/>And, despite the challenges, they said it had brought the family closer together. <br/>\"We are just so grateful he is with us and he's happy,\" said Oliver.<br/>Alex said: \"I know some people my age and their parents aren't around, so I've got to be grateful for the fact he is here. <br/>\"Obviously there is that diminishing capability but I'll take him any day at 50%, 75% - whatever I can get.\"<br/>Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

And I just thought, oh my goodness, where have we come to?\"<br/>Glynis Rosser had just turned eight when she and her family arrived in Australia after registering on the 'ten pound Poms' scheme - the focus of the BBC's current big-budget drama.<br/>About 4m viewers in the UK have tuned in to the series, which has also been screened in Australia. <br/>The six-parter, whose finale is due to air on BBC One this Sunday, has sparked interest in a little-known part of modern history - when Brits left post-war austerity in search of sunshine and opportunities down under. <br/>For some, the dream turned into a nightmare when they were housed in former war camps and faced hostility from some locals.<br/>However, for others, it led to prospects that were unavailable back home.<br/>Dr Jim Hammerton, who interviewed several British emigrants for his book Ten Pound Poms: Australia's Invisible Migrants, says: \"To get on a boat for six weeks and go to an unknown continent was a huge thing. It could be devastating, and it could be wonderful.\"<br/>Ms Rosser says her parents' main motivation was to \"give my sister and me easy access to opportunities\".<br/>She describes her Kent-born mother, and her father, from Newport - who both left school at 14 - as being \"bright\" but lacking prospects for a better life at home.<br/>Her father took jobs from shovelling coal to driving a taxi, while her mother worked in a sweet shop.<br/>It was during her father's time in the Merchant Navy that he saw the openings available for migrants from the UK, which led to the family enrolling on the so-called 'ten pound Pom' scheme.<br/>Officially known as the Assisted Passage Migration Scheme, the cut-price offer to move to the other side of the world - for about \u00a3315 in today's money - was advertised with better job prospects and a sunnier future for any children.<br/>Ms Rosser remembers the dry heat being a \"challenge\" after their arrival in 1967, particularly at a time when air conditioning wasn't readily accessible.<br/>Their initial accommodation was similar to the wartime huts depicted in the drama, and they met a family there who hadn't moved for two years.<br/>\"My dad was so appalled by the conditions,\" Ms Rosser said.<br/>\"He was very enterprising and went out the next day, got a newspaper and found a job as a photographer.\"<br/>The family only stayed for two nights in the basic camp conditions before they moved into a two-bedroom flat furnished with a bed and fridge.<br/>It wasn't the first time that Brits were encouraged to move to Australia. <br/>Since the 1830s - following the British colonisation of Australia - people from the British Isles had been paid or subsidised to migrate in order to boost the economic prospects of both countries.  <br/>\"The larger picture was that, after World War Two in Australia, there was a very small population of about 10 million people,\" Dr Hammerton says.<br/>The government feared being \"swamped by Asia, particularly by China\", he says, and so launched migration programmes to increase the population.<br/>He adds that there was a \"pro-British sentiment built in\", particularly amid the backdrop of the White Australia policy that had formalised the restriction of non-white immigration since 1901, while enabling Brits to relocate.  <br/>\"Britain was in a series of post-war shortages, so it was seen as logical to transfer what was seen at the time as excess population,\" Dr Hammerton says.<br/>The ten pound Pom scheme targeted families and single women because of Australia's demand for labour and a bigger population, with the skilled working classes mainly taking up the offer.<br/>While the cost increased some decades later, more than a million Brits emigrated between 1947 and 1981, most of them as part of the assisted passage scheme.  <br/>Ms Rosser recalls that \"some of the promotional material was a bit misleading\", adding that those who \"put their back into it\" eventually did manage to build a new life.<br/>\"The Australian culture wasn't hard to adjust to - it was different - but a hot Christmas did feel so alien,\" she said.<br/>She says there was hostility \"to a certain extent\" from some locals, adding: \"I was teased at school because I was pale and I never got tanned - I only used to burn - and because of my English accent.<br/>\"This is a country full of migrants, so that whole thing passes after a while.\"<br/>Widespread migration also meant \"a common theme was missing your family\", she says.<br/>The homesickness led to a quarter of British migrants returning to the UK.<br/>Dr Hammerton said there were \"complex reasons\" for the returnees.<br/>\"Some never adjusted, they didn't like the climate, the people, the work that was available and they missed things about Britain,\" he said.<br/>\"Most migrants will have complaints about their new home because everything's strange. The British were no exception, but most Australians didn't really like that.\"<br/>Hence the term \"whingeing Pom\" was coined, he wryly adds.<br/>But at least a third of the British returnees moved back to Australia, leading to the phenomenon of 'Boomerang Poms'. <br/>As one of them, Ms Rosser remembers feeling \"out of place\" after she returned to Chatham after spending her formative years away, to the extent she now had an Australian accent.<br/>She felt like she had \"come back home\" when they relocated a few years later to Sydney.<br/>The Ten Pound Poms drama, featuring Michelle Keegan and Warren Brown, shows Brits facing challenges while adjusting abroad and being accommodated in difficult conditions.<br/>After watching the first episodes, Dr Hammerton points out that, unlike in the series, most of the huts were based in cities and suburbs to increase employment, and it was rare to be in the outback.<br/>Prejudices about class and regional differences also existed within the migrant community, so the drama seems \"a bit unrealistic in showing British migrant workers getting friendly with the Aboriginal characters, but some were\", he adds.<br/>\"There are a few rags-to-riches stories but the vast majority did well in their chosen occupation and they managed to get their big dream, which was to get their own house.\"<br/>Speaking from Adelaide, where she is now a manager providing elderly care, Ms Rosser says: \"I really feel grateful for the opportunities. I had a free education to a very high level.<br/>\"I've heard stories of some feeling ripped off [by the migration schemes] but I fail to understand that perception.<br/>\"Like anywhere, you have to work for what you want and if you had the opportunity, it could work out as it did for so many of us.\"<br/>Why young Aussies are shunning their national holiday<br/>Aboriginal Australians: 'Could the Queen have done more?'<br/>Britons sent abroad as children sue UK<br/>'Boomerang Poms' flee Australia's traffic and TV<br/>Find \u2018rewrites' Australian human history<br/>BBC One - Ten Pound Poms<br/>Suspected drunk driver causes damage to 12 parked vehicles in Maidstone<br/>Everything you need to know about the hosepipe ban<br/>Thunder, lightning and hail set to batter Kent this weekend<br/>Let\u2019s all go down The Strand in Medway \u2013 bananas optional!<br/>Beloved mum \u2018let down\u2019 by mental health services before death<br/>Tip closures \u2018sending completely the wrong message\u2019<br/>African leaders tour Kyiv after air raid alert<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Greece denies coastguard rope led to boat tragedy<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

And how do they make sure they're picking the right ones to keep people listening?<br/>One person who knows is Al Smith. <br/>He's a music programmer who's helped to choose the tunes for some of the UK's biggest youth radio stations over the last 10 years. <br/>It's a big responsibility. What you choose - and sometimes, what you don't - will shape the sound of a station.<br/>So how do you decide?<br/>Al tells BBC Newsbeat the most important factor by far is \"understanding what the target audience would enjoy\". <br/>For Al, that's anything that appeals to young people.<br/>So how do you get into the shoes of an ideal listener? <br/>It used to be the case that major music labels had a lot of power, having direct contact with decision-makers at radio stations and putting forward their artists.<br/>But Al's noticed a shift. <br/>\"Music programmers are pretty open-minded as to where a song has come from,\" he says. <br/>\"Stations will promote unsigned artists if there are other factors that are causing that song to do well\".<br/>Step in TikTok. Remember Mae Stephens' banger of a heartbreak song If We Ever Broke Up? <br/>Mae was unsigned and putting songs out on the platform when the track went viral. Within a short time, her song was fast-tracked onto the playlists of pop music stations.<br/>As well as being useful tools for artists, TikTok and other social media mean fans have more power than ever.<br/>It's what Al calls the \"democratisation of music.\"<br/>He explains there are now many places where fans can consume music, including music streaming platforms and YouTube.<br/>This means stations are under more pressure to reflect what fans want in their playlists.<br/>But you can't please everyone.<br/>That's something UK radio stations, including BBC Radio 1, have been finding out recently.<br/>You might have noticed a lot of tweets criticising them for leaving Kylie's Padam Padam off their playlists - even though the song almost broke into the UK top 10.<br/>In a statement Radio 1 told Newsbeat it considers tracks for its playlist \"based on its musical merit and whether it is right for our target audience\". <br/>It said it makes decisions on \"a case-by-case basis\".<br/>Al agrees that it's all about pleasing your target audience.<br/>\"Some stations aim younger and it may be the view that Kylie isn't the right artist for that,\" he says.<br/>\"Unfortunately, you're always going to make somebody unhappy with the decisions you make. <br/>\"There's only so many hours in a day to play songs.\"<br/>It's not just station listeners that feel passionately about the songs they want to hear.<br/>In fact, Al says debates among playlisters are common too.<br/>\"You get a lot of fiery opinion because one person's potential bias is normally outweighed by somebody else's counter-view.\" <br/>Asked whether personal music taste ever impacts his own decision making. Al says he tries to avoid it.<br/>\"Objectivity is an art, but you can't ever say that you haven't let a personal opinion get in the way of a decision.<br/>\"Ultimately we do this job because we're passionate about about music, so if you hear a song that you think is incredible, you want others to hear it.\" <br/>Follow Newsbeat on Twitter and YouTube.<br/>Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.<br/>Bollywood hits disappear from Spotify<br/>Playlists 'more popular than albums'<br/>African leaders tour Kyiv after air raid alert<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Greece denies coastguard rope led to boat tragedy<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

You'll know in your heart when it's good.\"<br/>\"We try to be good first time,\" smiles singer Cristal Ramirez.<br/>The US quartet are recording their first ever session for BBC Radio 1, who've made their single, Always Get This Way, the station's tune of the week.<br/>There are a couple of false starts: A drum sample isn't firing and an autotune effect is misbehaving. Guitarist Katie Henderson commandeers a laptop from their sound engineer, swipes through two dozen menus and recalibrates the backing track. <br/>\"Autotune's hella scary when it goes wrong,\" she observes. <br/>But once they rip into their three-song set, there's no stopping them. Even when Cristal \"chokes on my own spit\" during the final chorus of Always Get This Way.<br/>Spirits are justifiably high: A couple of hours ago, they released their third album, I've Loved You For So Long, and the reviews are trickling in.<br/>\"Seven out of 10 from The Line Of Best Fit,\" announces their PR. \"Eight out of 10 from Clash.\"<br/>This prompts a brief, animated discussion about how publications arrive at their scores; and whether a seven is positive or merely average.<br/>\"In the end, I don't really care about reviews,\" concludes Cristal. \"But I want a 10.\"<br/>The release couldn't be any more different to their last record, Under My Influence, which dropped a couple of weeks into the first lockdown in 2020. <br/>At the time, the band were still confident they'd get to play those songs live when summer rolled around.<br/>\"We really were in denial for a while,\" laughs bassist McKenna Petty. \"We thought it would all be over soon.\"<br/>Instead, their plans were ripped out of their hands. The album was left in limbo. The pressure to build on the buzz surrounding their debut vanished, leaving bigger questions about their future. <br/>\"We were kind of mourning our career, not sure how that was gonna go,\" says Alisa Ramirez, the band's drummer and Cristal's younger sister. \"We went into a really dark place.\"<br/>Cristal started having panic attacks, knocking on her sister's door every night at 3am. Alisa would try to comfort her, making her oatmeal and talking her back to sleep.<br/>But her anxiety had deeper roots than the pandemic.<br/>All four Aces were brought up in Provo, a deeply religious town in the US state of Utah, about 45 minutes away from the headquarters of the Mormon church.<br/>\"If you're not familiar with Mormonism, it's just intense Christianity, really,\" says Cristal. \"But it's a way of life in Utah. It's the world you live in. We didn't know people that weren't Mormon in high school.\"<br/>The sisters, who were \"tomboys from the time we were little kids\", were \"constantly reminded we don't fit in,\" says Alisa. <br/>\"The culture is super homophobic, super patriarchal,\" agrees McKenna. \"There's a blueprint you're supposed to follow, as women especially, of getting married young, having a family, not having a career. <br/>\"Just for some context, Utah has the highest suicide rate among LGBTQ youth in the whole country. So it's a really big issue, how they isolate queer youth, especially.\"<br/>Cristal had her first crush on another girl in kindergarten but she squashed her feelings, believing they were sinful. She tried praying to be straight and dated boys in high school before coming out to her sister at the age of 18. <br/>Alisa didn't bat an eyelid before replying, \"Oh, same.\"<br/>As soon as they could, they disavowed Mormonism and fled Utah for Los Angeles. But though their bandmates supported them, they were still tied to the church.<br/>So when, in 2016. the sisters presented the band with a song called Loving Is Bible - a \"grand declaration\" that God is tolerant of all sexualities - it caused a certain amount of internal friction.<br/>\"That song almost didn't come out because it was really upsetting to Kenna and Katie,\" says Alisa.<br/>\"The church conditions you to be scared because your salvation is on the line,\" McKenna explains. \"I was really scared of what other people would think.\"<br/>Five years later, things have changed. Katie has also come out as queer and left the church. McKenna, the band's only straight member, also stepped away from Mormonism despite getting married in the LDS Temple in 2019.<br/>\"I really didn't have a good experience there [at the temple]. That was kind of the catalyst of me leaving.<br/>\"But my biggest issue was when the girls came out to me. I was like, 'This feels real and what the church is teaching doesn't. There's something wrong with the church.'\"<br/>I've Loved You For So Long is the first album The Aces have recorded where they're all on the same page. But it was only possible after the solitude of the pandemic forced them to confront their past.<br/>\"As sisters, it started clicking that we'd spent the last six years running away from our hometown and trying to not be associated with our upbringing,\" says Alisa. <br/>\"We were ashamed about it and embarrassed about it. It deeply affected our mental state and and it's still affecting us to this day.\"<br/>At first, Cristal was reluctant to share those feelings in her lyrics. <br/>\"I was like, 'I don't want to talk about that'. I want to go to studio and not talk about it because that's my whole existence, all the time, and it's miserable.\"<br/>The breakthrough came when they were working on, of all things, a sexually-charged pop song about lust at first sight. Originally called Don't Speak, Alisa texted her sister, suggesting she change the lyrics to \"don't freak\" and making it about her panic attacks.<br/>\"I was like, 'Wait, that's actually really cool',\" says the 27-year-old. \"And it opened up these big conversations about mental health and anxiety and identity.\"<br/>Don't Freak came out as a standalone single in 2021, but its confessional approach reverberates throughout The Aces' new album.<br/>\"Everything I love / I'm told I shouldn't touch / Cause good girls love Jesus / Not that girl from Phoenix,\" sings Cristal, reliving her childhood with justifiable anger on the punky Suburban Blues.<br/>I Always Get This Way was written as Cristal's mental health unravelled, addressing her guilt at \"falling apart\", and the way it affects her relationships.<br/>But the album ends with the gorgeously catchy jangle-pop of Younger, where the singer tells her 14-year-old self: \"I wouldn't change anything.\"<br/>\"When I was 14, I was in so much pain about my identity, about what my life was going to look like, but all I needed was someone to say 'You're okay and you're gonna figure it out',\" she says.<br/>United by their experiences, the band tear into their new songs with a fresh musical ferocity. <br/>The spiky guitars on Girls Make Me Wanna Die are a direct callback to their beginnings, playing Paramore covers in a neighbour's garage before they were even teenagers. Other tracks draw on The Cure and Depeche Mode, who they'd hear around the house growing up.<br/>Katie, the most reserved in conversation, is the band's musical backbone, playing funky, staccato guitar riffs on the poppy title track, and shimmering shoegazy lines on the more introspective Person.<br/>\"That's really what elevated our band, was when we added Katie,\" says McKenna. \"That's when everything got better.\"<br/>\"It's just so cool to watch her chase sounds, chase tones,\" agrees Cristal. \"She's such an amazing musician that we're always just like, 'Yeah, let's throw solo in there.

What might take a human copywriter between 60 and 90 minutes to write, the AI could do in 10 minutes or less.<br/>Around four months after the AI was introduced, Mr Meadowcroft's four-strong team was laid off.<br/>Mr Meadowcroft can't be certain, but he's pretty sure the AI replaced them.<br/>\"I did laugh-off the idea of AI replacing writers, or affecting my job, until it did,\" he said.<br/>The latest wave of AI hit late last year when OpenAI launched ChatGPT.<br/>Backed by Microsoft, ChatGPT can give human-like responses to questions and can, in minutes, generate essays, speeches, even recipes.<br/>Other tech giants are scrambling to launch their own systems - Google launched Bard in March.<br/>While not perfect, such systems are trained on the ocean of data available on the internet - an amount of information impossible for even a team of humans to digest.<br/>So that's left many wondering which jobs might be at risk.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>Earlier this year, a report from Goldman Sachs said that AI could potentially replace the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs.<br/>Any job losses would not fall equally across the economy. According to the report, 46% of tasks in administrative and 44% in legal professions could be automated, but only 6% in construction and 4% in maintenance.<br/>The report also points out that the introduction of AI could boost productivity and growth and might create new jobs.<br/>There is some evidence of that already. <br/>This month IKEA said that, since 2021, it has retrained 8,500 staff who worked in its call centres as design advisers.<br/>The furniture giant says that 47% of customer calls are now handled by an AI called Billie. <br/>While IKEA does not see any job losses resulting from its use of AI, such developments are making many people worried.<br/>A recent survey by Boston Consulting Group (BCG), which polled 12,000 workers from around the world, found that a third were worried that they would be replaced at work by AI, with frontline staff more concerned than managers. <br/>Jessica Apotheker from BCG says that's partly due to fear of the unknown. <br/>\"When you look at leaders and managers, we have more than 80% of them that use AI at least on a weekly basis. When you look at frontline staff, that number drops to 20% so with the lack of familiarity with the tech comes much more anxiety and concern on the outcomes for them.\"<br/>But perhaps there is good reason to be anxious.<br/>For three months last year, Alejandro Graue had been doing voiceover work for a popular YouTube channel.<br/>It seemed to be a promising line of work, a whole YouTube channel in English had to be re-voiced in Spanish. <br/>Mr Graue went on holiday late last year confident that there would be work when he returned.<br/>\"I was expecting to have that money to live with - I have two daughters, so I need the money,\" he says.<br/>But to his surprise, before he returned to work, the YouTube channel uploaded a new video in Spanish - one he had not worked on.<br/>\"When I clicked on it, what I heard was not my voice, but an AI generated voice - a very badly synced voiceover. It was terrible. And I was like, What is this? Is this like going to be my new partner in crime like the channel? Or is this going to replace me?\" he says.<br/>A phone call to the studio he worked for confirmed the worst. The client wanted to experiment with AI because it was cheaper and faster.<br/>That experiment turned out to be a failure. Viewers complained about the quality of the voiceover and eventually the channel took down the videos that featured the AI-generated voice.<br/>But Mr Graue did not find that very comforting. He thinks the technology will only improve and wonders where that will leave voiceover artists like him.<br/>\"If this starts to happen in every job that I have, what should I do? Should I buy a farm? I don't know.  What other job could I look for that is not going to be replaced as well in the future? It's very complicated,\" he says.<br/>If AI is not coming for your job then it is likely you might have to start working with one in some way.<br/>After a few months of freelance work, former copywriter Dean Meadowcroft took a new direction.<br/>He now works for an employee assistance provider, which gives wellbeing and mental health advice to staff. Working with AI is now part of his job.<br/>\"I think that is where the future is for AI, giving quick access to human-led content, as opposed to completely eliminating that human aspect,\" he says.<br/>You can see the full interviews with Dean Meadowcroft and Alejandro Graue on Talking Business with Aaron Heslehurst on BBC News.<br/>Viewers in the UK can watch on BBC iPlayer from 11:30 on Saturday.

One is an ordinary North Korean citizen who has agreed to risk all to be interviewed by the BBC. The other is a source, working for an organisation in South Korea to leak information out of the country.  <br/>At a secure location that cannot be bugged, the source relays one of our questions to the citizen and notes down the answer. Later, when it is safe, they will send it back to us, in multiple instalments. Sending even one full answer at a time is too risky. <br/>This is the start of a painstaking process that will take us many months, as we investigate the consequences of the North Korean government's decision to seal the country's border more than three years ago. <br/>North Koreans are forbidden from talking to anyone outside the country, especially journalists, and if the government finds out they have done so, they could be killed. <br/>But when the border was shut in January 2020, in response to the coronavirus pandemic, a country that was already difficult to report on became virtually impenetrable.  <br/>All the sources that journalists would ordinarily rely on to relay what was happening on the ground dried up, as foreign diplomats and aid workers left the country. It also became nearly impossible for North Koreans to escape and share their experiences.  <br/>At the same time, there was good reason to suspect the border closure was causing people significant suffering, based on our knowledge of how people in North Korea make their living and acquire their food. Then, last year, we started to get unconfirmed reports of severe food shortages and possible starvation.  <br/>This is why we decided to take such extraordinary measures, to interview three ordinary North Koreans inside the country. <br/>First, we sought advice from those who work closely with North Koreans and understand the risks. Sokeel Park, from the organisation Liberty in North Korea, who has been working with escapees for more than a decade, was of the view this was an important and worthwhile undertaking, in spite of the risks. <br/>\"There is not a single North Korean who won't understand the danger, and if people want to do this, I think we should respect that,\" he told us. \"Every conversation with people inside North Korea, every titbit of information, is so valuable, because we know so little,\" he said.  <br/>But to do this, we could not work alone. We teamed up with a news organisation in South Korea, Daily NK, that has a network of sources inside the country. These sources found us people who wanted to be interviewed. Aware we would only be getting a snapshot of life inside the country, we chose to speak to people of varying ages from different areas.  <br/>We explained what the BBC was, and how far and wide their interviews would be seen and heard, and they gave their consent. <br/>\"They are looking forward to telling the world how bad the situation is in North Korea,\" said Daily NK's editor-in-chief Lee Sang-yong. \"They hope the international community will take notice.\"  <br/>Mr Lee has been working with his sources for 13 years to smuggle information out of North Korea. He assured us that his methods of communication were robust. He was confident he could keep people safe but warned that the process would take time.  <br/>As we waited, there were moments we worried we might not get enough information. What if we received one-line answers - perhaps not even enough to report? This was the gamble.  <br/>But when we finally collated the messages, we were blown away by the level of detail. People revealed far more than we had expected, and the situation was worse than we had imagined. It pointed to a dire humanitarian and human rights situation unfolding in the country, and chronic food shortages. <br/>We then set about verifying as much as we could. Helpfully, our three interviewees corroborated each other. They all cited the same quarantine rules and the same new laws which frightened them. They all spoke about the scarcity of food and medicine, and had experienced increasingly severe crackdowns and punishments. They even shared many of the same hopes and fears. <br/>But there were also illuminating differences. It appeared there was more government support in the capital Pyongyang than in the border towns, but also more control, surveillance and fear there - which was in line with what we had expected.  <br/>Our next step was to take our interviews to NK Pro, a news service in Seoul which monitors North Korea. One of the only remaining sources of information on North Korea is the country's own state-run newspaper and TV channel. While much of the content is propaganda, NK Pro's state media expert Chung Seung-yeon monitors this daily, combing it for clues as to what is really happening in the country.  <br/>\"We think of North Korea as a very secret state. Certainly, they never speak loudly about their problems, but they drop hints,\" she said. And when they actually mention a problem, as they have done with the food crisis, this means it's \"a really big deal\", she explained.  <br/>She showed us one news report from February in which North Korean party members were praised for donating rice to the government. \"That the state is receiving grain from its people, shows us how desperate the food situation is,\" she pointed out.  <br/>With Ms Chung's help we were also able to confirm many of the quarantine and lockdown rules our interviewees had cited, and the new laws and punishments that had been introduced. <br/>To corroborate other details, we analysed the available data on food prices and trade, and viewed satellite images of the border. We combed the texts of new laws that had been smuggled out the country, while cross-referencing our interviews with reports from the South Korean government, the UN, and other sources, until we were confident that our interviews - while not comprehensive - provided reliable snapshots of life in North Korea.  <br/>As much as we have published, there are many details we have held back, to protect our interviewees. But through their bravery, we know so much more about the situation in North Korea than we did before.  <br/>\"The world has not realised how bad things are for the North Korean people right now,\" said Sokeel Park. \"These interviewees are not the full picture. In future years, we'll probably learn in depth just how difficult this period has been,\" he said.  <br/>When we last checked in with our interviewees, through Daily NK, they were all safe. <br/>In depth: Read the full BBC investigation<br/>North Korean experts on what BBC testimony tells us<br/>African leaders tour Kyiv after air raid alert<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Greece denies coastguard rope led to boat tragedy<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

The problem though is that often employees of coal, oil and gas companies are not open about their affiliations. <br/>At COP26 in Glasgow, there were more delegates from the fossil fuel industries than from any single country.<br/>Last year at COP27 in Egypt, the numbers had swollen by a quarter, with more than 600 representatives according to analysis from campaign group, Global Witness.<br/>With registration for delegates to this year's COP28 summit in Dubai set to open soon, the UN will now put in place a mandatory question on affiliation. <br/>\"From now onwards, every single badged participant attending the event will be required to list their affiliation and relationship to that organisation,\" said UN climate chief Simon Stiell, speaking at the closing of a preparatory meeting in Bonn.<br/>Campaigners say the step is long overdue.<br/>\"As long as UN climate talks have existed, the fossil fuel industry lobbyists have been flooding these talks seeking a seat at the table where the rules of climate action are written,\" said Rachel Rose Jackson from Corporate Accountability.<br/>\"It's actually no small thing that for the first time ever, all participants, will have to be honest to the world about who they are.\"<br/>Observers say that the new requirement might prevent a recurrence of what happened last year when BP chair Bernard Looney attended the talks as a delegate of Mauritania, a poor African country where the company has major investments. <br/>Similarly, four senior employees of Total, the French oil company, came to the COP as representatives of a mysterious German environmental campaign group. <br/>However while information on a delegate's affiliation will now be mandatory, participants will be allowed to opt out on the nature of their relationship to that organisation. <br/>There will also be no requirement to say who's financing the trip to the COP.<br/>If delegates do opt out from providing some information, the UN will publish these blank answers in their lists, allowing people to draw their own conclusions.<br/>\"This information should help prevent those representing the interests of fossil fuels from sneaking through the back door without declaring their true intentions,\" said Alice Harrison, from Global Witness, who compile an annual list of fossil fuel delegates attending the COP. <br/>\"We'll be certain to dig into those who refuse to declare.\" <br/>The move comes as delegates left the meeting in Bonn meeting meant to prepare the ground for COP28.<br/>Deep divisions between rich and poor were again apparent, with huge frustration on the part of developing countries that their financial needs are not being met, as climate impacts ramp up around the world. <br/>\"The credibility of this process is under threat. Let's remember there is nowhere else to go to solve these issues,\" warned UN climate executive secretary Simon Stiell.<br/>There was also ongoing rancour about the role of Sultan Al Jaber from the United Arab Emirates, who will preside over COP28.<br/>Many have questioned the suitability of an oil company chief executive for this crucial role. <br/>Supporters say he is well positioned to help major oil producing nations transition away from fossil fuels. <br/>On a short visit to the talks last week, Sultan Al Jaber said that the \"phasedown of fossil fuels is inevitable\".<br/>Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc.<br/>African leaders tour Kyiv after air raid alert<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Greece denies coastguard rope led to boat tragedy<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

It doesn't mean prices dropping, it just means prices going up less fast.\"<br/>On a call with reporters, Mr Murphy also said Tesco's board had \"acted in the best interests\" of the company regarding the departure of its chairman John Allan.<br/>Mr Allan announced he was stepping down last month following allegations over his conduct.<br/>He has strongly denied three of four claims made against him. <br/>\"It was a difficult decision but at the same time, I think it coincides with the fact that the search for a new chairman was already well under way,\" Mr Murphy said.<br/>Sainsbury's and Asda told not to block rival stores<br/>Supermarkets probed over food and fuel prices<br/>Plans for supermarket price cap on basic food<br/>Food prices 'worryingly high' as sugar and milk soar<br/>Sainsbury\u2019s boss denies profiting from high prices<br/>African leaders tour Kyiv after air raid alert<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Greece denies coastguard rope led to boat tragedy<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

who was Mr Johnson's chancellor - has not said whether he will vote on the report.<br/>Johnson loyalists - including former ministers Sir Simon Clarke, Nadine Dorries and Sir Jake Berry - have said they will vote against the report's findings.<br/>It is likely that many more Conservative MPs could abstain, or simply not turn up to the vote, while Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the SNP are all expected to support the committee's findings.<br/>But Conservative MPs still face a dilemma over Monday's vote.<br/>Voting against the recommendations risks alienating local party activists who want Mr Johnson gone, voting for it risks angering his fans, who believe he has been hounded out of Parliament.<br/>Allies of Mr Johnson warned Tory MPs they could face battles with their local parties to remain as candidates at the next election if they back the motion.<br/>Senior Conservative MP Damian Green told the BBC that \"deliberately abstaining is not really rising to the importance of the occasion\".<br/>The former cabinet minister under Theresa May said he intended to vote to approve the report with a \"heavy heart\".<br/>Sir Jake - an ally of Mr Johnson - said he was \"almost certain that Parliament will vote in favour\" of the report on Monday.<br/>But Sir Jake said he would \"certainly be one of those in the no lobby opposing this report, whose conclusions he called \"wrong\".<br/>So far, 15 Conservatives have publicly criticised the committee:<br/>Liberal Democrats say the report \"speaks for itself\" and should be approved without a debate.<br/>Sir Ed Davey criticised the amount of time the government is spending debating Mr Johnson's conduct, and said the Conservative party is operating \"in absolute chaos\".<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Key moments from Boris Johnson's Partygate grilling<br/>Following a year-long investigation, the seven-person Privileges Committee found Mr Johnson had had \"personal knowledge\" of Covid-rule breaches in Downing Street but had repeatedly failed to \"pro-actively investigate\" the facts. <br/>The committee said officials had not advised Mr Johnson that social distancing guidelines were followed at all times, contrary to what he said in the House of Commons at the time. <br/>In key evidence, Martin Reynolds - one of Mr Johnson's most senior officials - said he had advised the PM against making the claim, questioning whether it was \"realistic\".<br/>Mr Johnson announced last Friday that he was standing down as an MP with immediate effect after being shown a draft of the report.<br/>A by-election will be held on 20 July in his Uxbridge and South Ruislip constituency.<br/>In an eviscerating statement he branded the committee a \"kangaroo court\" and its findings \"deranged\", accusing Harriet Harman, the Labour chairwoman of the committee, of bias.<br/>The committee said the initial proposed sanction was increased \"in light of Mr Johnson's conduct\" in recent days - including breaching confidentiality rules and \"being complicit in the campaign of abuse and attempted intimidation of the committee\".<br/>Mr Johnson's statement was \"completely unacceptable\", they said.<br/>Responding to the report, Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said Mr Johnson had \"disgraced himself\", and the Liberal Democrats' Daisy Cooper said he had treated Parliament with \"total disdain\".

It has been such a labour of love.\" <br/>The Wall Street Journal quoted an Archewell spokeswoman as saying Meghan was \"continuing to develop more content for the Archetypes audience on another platform\".<br/>When the agreement with Spotify was first announced, it was billed as a relationship which would produce several series - but in the end, only one materialised. <br/>American media reports suggest the royal couple failed to meet the productivity benchmark required by Spotify, and therefore wouldn't be receiving the full value of the contract.<br/>Since splitting from the royal family, Harry and Meghan have looked to capitalise on their global fame in order to become financially independent.<br/>That has included a multi-million dollar content deal with Netflix, and Harry's huge contract with Penguin Books, which has already produced his autobiography Spare.<br/>It follows Spotify's announcement last week that it was cutting 200 jobs in its podcast division after a period of heavy investment in the medium, saying it was embarking on a \"strategic realignment\".<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Meghan: 'They were concerned how that would look for the institution'<br/>Is the 'have-a-go' podcaster era coming to an end?<br/>Where do Harry and Meghan get their money?<br/>Harry and Meghan dismiss South Park lawsuit rumour<br/>I want to stop hate towards Meghan, Harry tells court<br/>Harry surrounded by 'web of unlawful activity'<br/>African leaders tour Kyiv after air raid alert<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Greece denies coastguard rope led to boat tragedy<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

They explicitly outline eight scenarios where it is difficult for a victim to \"form, express, or fulfil an intention not to consent\" to sexual intercourse.<br/>These include situations where the victim is intoxicated with alcohol or drugs; or subject to violence or threats; or is \"frightened or astonished\". Another scenario appears to describe an abuse of power, where the victim is \"worried\" of the consequences of refusal.<br/>This is only the first time Japan has changed its age of consent since its enactment in 1907. <br/>Previously, Japan had one of the lowest age of consent among developed nations. However, a person who has had sex with a minor aged 13 to 15 will be punished only if the person is five or more years older than the minor.<br/>Meanwhile, the statute of limitations or legal window for reporting rape will be extended to 15 years from 10 years, to give survivors more time to come forward.<br/>The changes also ban \"photo voyeurism\" which includes upskirting and secret filming of sexual acts, among other things.<br/>It follows multiple rape acquittals in 2019 that caused national outcry and helped spur a nationwide Flower Demo campaign against sexual violence. On the 11th day of every month since April 2019, activists have gathered throughout Japan to demand justice and show solidarity with sexual assault survivors.<br/>But some activists have told the BBC that these legal reforms address only one part of the problem. <br/>\"Distorted ideas\" about sex and consent that have pervaded for generations must be addressed, says Kazuko Ito, vice-president of the Tokyo-based Human Rights Now. <br/>Survivors of sexual assault who go public also often receive threats and nasty comments online. <br/>Even if the reforms are enacted, survivors must feel empowered to report their attacks, activists say.<br/>In Japan, survivors of sexual violence are often reluctant to come forward because of stigma and shame. A 2021 survey by the government showed that only about 6 per cent of women and men reported an assault half of the women polled felt they couldn't do so because of \"embarrassment\".<br/>\"Nationwide learning and educational effort is essential for this norm to be embedded in the society. This is only way to prevent actual sexual violence along with ending culture of impunity,\" Ms Ito says.<br/>Japan should also offer more financial and psychological help for sexual assault survivors, lawyer and rights advocate Sakura Kamitani told the BBC. <br/>Attackers too should receive support to prevent recidivism, she added.<br/>Tessa Wong, BBC News<br/>The biggest and most significant change to the laws is the one that redefines rape from \"forcible sexual intercourse\" to \"non-consensual sexual intercourse\" - effectively making legal room for consent in a society where the concept is still poorly understood.<br/>Activists argue that Japan's narrow definition has led to even narrower interpretations of the law by prosecutors and judges, setting an impossibly high bar for justice and fostering a culture of scepticism that deters survivors from reporting their attacks.<br/>In a 2014 Tokyo case, for instance, a man had pinned a 15-year-old girl to a wall and had sex with her while she resisted. He was acquitted of rape as the court ruled his actions did not make it \"extremely difficult\" for her to resist. The teenager was treated as an adult.<br/>\"The actual trial processes and decisions vary - some defendants were not convicted even if their acts were proven to be non-consensual, as they did not meet the case of 'assault or intimidation',\" says Yuu Tadokoro, a spokesman for Spring, a sexual assault survivor group.<br/>But the reforms address only one part of the problem, say activists, whose call for change stretches well beyond the courtroom.<br/>Sexual assault is still a taboo subject in Japan and has gained national attention only in recent years in the wake of high-profile cases such as Shiori Ito's court battle, former member of the Self Defence Force and sexual assault survivor Rina Gonoi's public statements, and the Johnny Kitagawa expose.<br/>Read more of our story on why Japan finally reformed its sex assault laws. <br/>The women fighting Japan\u2019s sexual violence stigma<br/>Catching the men who sell subway groping videos<br/>Why is Japan redefining rape?<br/>Japan to ban upskirting in stronger sex crime laws<br/>Japan\u2019s J-pop predator - exposed for abuse but still revered<br/>Japan aims to raise age of consent from 13<br/>African leaders tour Kyiv after air raid alert<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Greece denies coastguard rope led to boat tragedy<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Now it is one of the world's most powerful technology companies, with an annual revenue of $200bn (\u00a3158.2bn). <br/>It is best known for making more than half of Apple's products - from iPhones to iMacs - but it also counts Microsoft, Sony, Dell and Amazon among its clients.<br/>For decades, it has thrived on a playbook perfected by multinational corporations - they design products in the US, manufacture them in China and then sell them to the world. That is how it grew from a small component-making business to the consumer electronics giant it is today.<br/>But as global supply chains adjust to souring ties between Washington and Beijing, Foxconn finds itself in an unenviable spot - caught between the world's two biggest economies, the very nations that have powered its growth until now. <br/>The US and China are at loggerheads over many things, from trade to the war in Ukraine. But one of the biggest potential flashpoints is Taiwan, where Foxconn is headquartered.<br/>Taiwan has been a thorny issue for a long time but Chinese leader Xi Jinping's repeated pledges of \"reunification\" have upset the uneasy status quo. Meanwhile, the US, under President Joe Biden, has been more vocal in its support for Taiwan in case of an attack.<br/>Some US voices have crossed China's red line, calling for independence, although the White House has reaffirmed its position that it maintains diplomatic relations with Beijing and not Taipei.<br/>There are hopes of a thaw with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken visiting China this weekend. But there are also fears of a conflict - one US general has estimated it could happen as soon as the next few years.<br/>\"The United States and China are engaged in what we see as strategic competition,\" said Shihoko Goto, the deputy director for the Asia programme at the Wilson Center in Washington DC.<br/>\"Foxconn wants to do business with both, but there can only be one winner.\"<br/>But Mr Liu does not think it is that simple. For one, he said, Foxconn's business model, which relies on US designs and Chinese manufacturing, is far from over.<br/>\"We hire a lot of workers and most countries, including China, want to support their workers,\" Mr Liu said, adding that the Chinese government wants companies like Foxconn to keep going because of the huge number of jobs they create.<br/>Are rising tensions putting pressure on the model? \"So far? We haven't seen it,\" he told us.<br/>But the West and its allies have called for countries and companies to \"de-risk\" from China - a long-term shift to curb global reliance on China that is yet to play out.<br/>When asked if that was impacting business, Mr Liu responded cautiously. <br/>Some overseas clients had pushed to move production out of China, he said, but this was their decision to make, not Foxconn's.<br/>\"They get the push from their government about de-risking, and then they will let us know.\"<br/>Geopolitics aside, Covid-19 is another reason companies might consider \"de-risking\" from China.<br/>A mix of harsh Covid policies, a lack of space for quarantine and the infectiousness of the Omicron variant led to protests and riots at Foxconn's factory in Zhengzhou - the world's biggest iPhone plant - in late 2022. Hundreds of workers, who feared the spread of the virus, fled the campus on foot.<br/>Mr Liu said the scenes that played out for the world to see were caused by a lack of transportation due to Beijing's unyielding zero-Covid policy.<br/>But when pressed further, he admitted that he should have handled things differently.<br/>\"If the same situation occurs again, I would stop production altogether,\" he said, reiterating that he would have made that decision even at the risk of irking clients like Apple.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>WATCH: Chinese protesters clash with riot police at giant iPhone factory<br/>The company's success certainly rests on its impressive client base, but Foxconn is just as indispensable to those clients.<br/>To understand how essential it is to Apple, for instance, you just need to look at how much of the iPhone is made by Foxconn - around 60%, by some estimates. The factories in China make some of the most essential parts of the device - camera modules, connectors, even the back of the phone casing.<br/>That expertise is also what Mr Liu is hoping will fuel Foxconn's next big bet: electric cars.<br/>\"Look at this - this is a big iPhone, so we're very familiar with this,\" he said, pointing to a panel that controlled the car he had taken us for a drive in.<br/>Built for families and priced for an aspiring global middle class, the shiny white SUV is one of several models manufactured by Foxconn. <br/>\"The reason why we think this is a great opportunity for us is that with the traditional gas engine, you have engines which are mostly mechanical. But with EVs, it's batteries and motors,\" he explains. <br/>That is a familiar language for a technology company like Foxconn, he added. <br/>Foxconn's hopes to capture about 5% of the global electric vehicle market in the next few years - an ambitious target given the firm has only made a handful of models so far. But it is a gamble that Mr Liu is confident will pay off.<br/>\"It doesn't make sense for you to make [EVs] in one place, so regionalised production for cars is very natural,\" he added. Foxconn car factories will be based in Ohio in the US, in Thailand, Indonesia and perhaps even in India, he said. <br/>For now, the company will keep focusing on what it does best - making electronic products for clients. But perhaps not too far in the future, Foxconn will start selling its own cars.<br/>Either way, with the foray into electric cars, Foxconn is diversifying not just production but also supply lines - both of which, Mr Liu believes, hold the key to the company's future.<br/>iPhone maker hikes pay ahead of new model launch<br/>iPhone maker sees revenue slump as demand weakens<br/>African leaders tour Kyiv after air raid alert<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Greece denies coastguard rope led to boat tragedy<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

but were outvoted.<br/>Expulsion is extremely rare in Parliament's history, having occurred only three times in the last hundred years or so.<br/>But suspending him is no longer an option, given that he's already stood down as an MP in his blistering resignation statement last week.<br/>However, the report says that now, given what he's said about the committee, they would have recommended a ban of 90 days - an extremely long ban by the standards of recent years. <br/>And it says he should not get a parliamentary pass, which former MPs would normally be able to apply for. <br/>Perhaps the greatest punishment in the report, ultimately, will be the damage it does to his reputation among Conservative MPs -

He had just been elected mayor of London, a job that would launch him on the path to Downing Street.<br/>Now he is heading for the exit with all guns blazing, with a scathing attack on the MPs who sought to punish him for misleading Parliament over Covid rule-breaking.<br/>His reaction to the Privileges Committee report is vintage Johnson - colourful, amusing in parts - the references to \"Mystic Meg\" and nudist colonies - but with an unfamiliar edge of bitterness and anger. <br/>Whether it turns out to be the final raging testament of a man destined for the political wilderness remains to be seen.<br/>He has bounced back from many, mainly self-inflicted, disasters before.<br/>And he is clearly in no mood to settle for comfortable semi-retirement. <br/>He has already earned more than \u00a35m for giving speeches around the world since he quit as prime minister.<br/>He is also about to become a father again, at 58, with wife Carrie expecting their third child. The family have just moved into a \u00a33.8m Grade II listed manor house in Oxfordshire, complete with its own moat.<br/>There are books to write - his memoir of his time in Downing Street is well under way apparently, and talk of business opportunities.<br/>But this may be thin gruel for someone with Boris Johnson's outsize personality.<br/>From his earliest childhood days, when he famously declared he wanted to be \"world king\", Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson has had his eyes on life's big prizes.<br/>He came into the world in 1964 in the Upper East Side of Manhattan, in New York, where his father, Stanley, was studying economics. <br/>One of four children, he spent his early years on the family farm in Somerset, before moving to north London and then Brussels, where Stanley was working for the European Commission.<br/>The Johnson siblings were close and highly competitive with one another. Young Boris, or Al, as he was known to the family, was largely brought up by his artist mother Charlotte, helped by au pairs.<br/>He won a scholarship to Eton College, England's most prestigious private school, where he made a lasting impression on his teachers and classmates.<br/>In a widely quoted excerpt from a school report, teacher Martin Hammond said of the 17-year-old Johnson: \"Boris sometimes seems affronted when criticised for what amounts to a gross failure of responsibility. <br/>\"I think he honestly believes it is churlish of us not to regard him as an exception, one who should be free of the network of obligation which binds everyone else.\"<br/>Simon Veksner, a school friend of Johnson, told author Simon Kuper in his recent book Chums: \"Boris's charisma even then was off the charts, so funny, warm, charming, self-deprecating,\" <br/>At Oxford University, he was elected president of the union - a debating society dating back to 1823. He also joined the infamously rowdy and exclusive Bullingdon Club, alongside future prime minister David Cameron.<br/>After Oxford, he was taken on as a trainee reporter at the Times newspaper, but was sacked after falsifying a quote. <br/>It proved to be a minor setback however, and in 1988 he was given a job on the Daily Telegraph by then-editor Max Hastings.<br/>As the Telegraph's Brussels correspondent, Johnson specialized in ridiculing regulations passed by the European Commission - although many of his fellow reporters in Brussels felt his stories were exaggerated and in some cases simply untrue. <br/>In 1999, he became editor of influential right-wing magazine the Spectator, and two years later finally achieved his ambition to enter Parliament, as the Tory MP for Henley, in Oxfordshire.<br/>Things did not go smoothly.<br/>He insisted on continuing to edit the Spectator, even when he was promoted to the Tory frontbench by then leader Michael Howard.<br/>He came unstuck in 2004 when the magazine published an article blaming the Hillsborough disaster on the behaviour of Liverpool football fans. <br/>An incensed Howard ordered Johnson to Liverpool to apologise to the entire city.<br/>He survived \"Operation Scouse Grovel\", as he dubbed it, only to be sacked by Howard a month later for lying about claims he had had an affair with journalist Petronella Wyatt.<br/>Johnson's colourful private life has long been a source of fascination for fellow journalists - in particular, the question of how many children he has fathered.<br/>He has declined to confirm a number when asked, but it is thought be seven, with another on the way.<br/>He has four children from his second marriage, to barrister Marina Wheeler, which ended in divorce, and another from an affair with art consultant Helen Macintyre.<br/>In May 2020, Johnson married Carrie Symonds, a former Tory aide, at a private ceremony at Westminster Cathedral. The couple had their first son together, Wilfred, in April 2020. Their second child, daughter Romy, was born in December 2021.<br/>It was Johnson's two terms as London mayor - starting in 2008 - that transformed his political career. <br/>Up until then, he had been stuck in the slow lane, better known as a TV celebrity and comedy turn than a serious politician.<br/>His ability to harvest votes from Labour supporters - and project an upbeat, positive vision of Conservativism - made him a powerful electoral asset for his party.<br/>His popularity reached its peak during the 2012 London Olympics, despite, or perhaps because of, being pictured dangling from a zip wire gamely waving a pair of union flags. <br/>In 2015, he returned to Parliament as MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip, with his sights set on the top job, and a major dilemma. David Cameron's decision to hold an EU referendum was a defining moment for the country, but also for the old friends and rivals.<br/>Johnson's decision - after much agonising - to join forces with the pro-Brexit campaign came as a severe blow to Cameron's hopes of keeping the UK in the EU. But it was seen as a game-changing moment by the pro-Brexit campaign, run by tough-talking strategist Dominic Cummings, a man Cameron had once dismissed as a \"career psychopath\".<br/>When his side emerged victorious, Johnson threw his hat into the ring to replace Cameron as Conservative leader and prime minister. <br/>However, his campaign was dramatically undermined when colleague and close friend Michael Gove withdrew support and decided to run for the leadership himself, saying he did not think Johnson was up to the job of prime minister. <br/>Not for the first time, he was contemplating the end of his political career. Yet in a surprise move Theresa May, the eventual winner, appointed Johnson as foreign secretary.<br/>He quit May's cabinet in 2018, in protest at her Brexit deal, which he claimed would lead Britain into \"the status of a colony\". <br/>When she was forced to resign as Tory leader the following year, he finally got his hands on the top job.<br/>He was immediately plunged into turmoil, as he battled to govern with the non-existent majority inherited from May.<br/>In an audacious and highly controversial move, later ruled unlawful by the Supreme Court, he attempted to prorogue, or suspend, Parliament, after his attempts to push through a Brexit deal faltered ahead of his own deadline of 31 October 2019.<br/>After two failed attempts to get MPs to vote for a general election, he finally went to the country in December 2019, promising to \"Get Brexit Done\", a slogan dreamed up by Dominic Cummings, who was now his closest aide.<br/>The gamble paid off, and he was returned to power with the biggest Conservative majority since Margaret Thatcher's 1980s heyday. Crucially, he had won seats in former Labour strongholds across the North of England, what came to be known as the Red Wall.<br/>His Brexit deal was approved and on 31 January 2020 the UK left the EU. <br/>It looked as though negotiating a trade deal with the EU would be his government's first key task - and Brexit his abiding legacy. But, within weeks, he was engulfed by an all-consuming crisis that few - least of all Mr Johnson - had seen coming: the coronavirus pandemic.<br/>In April 2020, he tested positive for Covid himself and spent three nights in intensive care. Downing Street played down the seriousness of his condition but when he was discharged, the PM admitted \"it could have gone either way\".<br/>As the UK emerged from the pandemic, Mr Johnson's government was under fire from all sides for its handling of the pandemic.<br/>He hailed the success of the UK's vaccine roll-out, which was the fastest in the developed world.<br/>But his political problems were mounting up.<br/>In November 2020, he lost Dominic Cummings and other senior aides after a bout of bitter infighting in Downing Street.<br/>Worse was to come in November 2021, when the Daily Mirror accused Johnson of breaking Covid rules by attending parties in Downing Street when indoor mixing was banned. There was a further bombshell just over a week later when video footage emerged of Downing Street staff laughing and joking about holding a Christmas party. <br/>Then the Daily Telegraph revealed that Downing Street staff had held booze-fuelled parties the night before the Duke of Edinburgh's funeral. Johnson later apologised to the Queen.<br/>Johnson, his then-Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Carrie Johnson were among those fined by police, while a damning report by senior civil servant Sue Gray laid bare a Downing Street culture of drunkenness and contempt for the rules.<br/>Johnson did his best to sound contrite in public, telling MPs he had learned lessons and had launched a shake-up of backroom staff, but he continued to insist that he had not broken Covid rules on purpose.<br/>The cabinet rallied round the prime minister, but a steadily growing band of backbench Conservatives, from different wings of the party, had come to the conclusion that he had to go, amid rising public anger. <br/>He survived a confidence motion in June 2022, despite nearly half of his MPs voting against him. But a string of by-election defeats led MPs to fear he had become an electoral liability. The old magic, it seemed, was no longer working.<br/>The final straw for many MPs was when ministers were sent out to defend the prime minister in a row over an MP facing allegations of sexual misconduct, armed with misleading information from Downing Street.<br/>A mass walkout by ministers, including Chancellor Rishi Sunak, followed and after 48 hours of defiance, in which he repeatedly vowed to \"get on with the job\" of governing, he was finally forced to face up to reality.<br/>He did not go quietly. And within a few short months he would get an unexpected chance to make another comeback, following the spectacular implosion of Liz Truss's premiership.<br/>He flew back from a Caribbean holiday in October 2022 to launch a bid to replace Truss, who had won the contest to replace him. <br/>But despite managing to scrape together just enough nominations from Tory MPs to get on the ballot, Johnson pulled out of the contest, paving the way for the coronation of Rishi Sunak, who had far more support in the Parliamentary party.<br/>He insisted he would remain an MP, fuelling rumours that another comeback might be on the cards.<br/>But questions about his conduct during the Covid pandemic refused to go away, with the committee of MPs investigating whether he had lied to Parliament eventually delivering their damning verdict.<br/>Only a fool would write Boris Johnson off entirely - and he retains a band of loyal supporters, who point to his leadership over the war in Ukraine and his espousal of traditional Tory free market values as reasons for his return - not to mention his formidable campaigning skills.<br/>But the road back looks like a long and steep one.<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

This punishment is absolutely extraordinary to the point of sheer vindictiveness.\"<br/>Bassetlaw MP Brendan Clarke-Smith said he was \"appalled\", adding, \"I'm backing fairness and justice - not kangaroo courts.\"<br/>Meanwhile, Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg - also given a knighthood in the resignation honours last week - described the report as \"fundamentally flawed\". <br/>Nadine Dorries, who has said she plans to stand down as a Conservative MP, tweeted that the report had \"overreached\".<br/>Education Secretary Gillian Keegan said Mr Johnson had \"made his decision, he made the decision to resign\" after he saw the report last week, and added: \"Boris has achieved an awful lot.\"<br/>But senior Tory MP Tobias Ellwood said he hoped the report would allow MPs to move on from the \"public pantomime\".<br/>Former attorney-general and Conservative MP Dominic Grieve dismissed any suggestions the committee \"had it in\" for the former primer minister.<br/>The sanctions recommended by the committee were \"a result of his own actions,\" he said, adding: \"The history of his lying is just epic.\"<br/>Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said Boris Johnson was \"not only a lawbreaker, but a liar\". <br/>\"He's not fit for public office.

This does not apply for \"personal\" actions against them, for example if they are sued for libel.<br/>As a former minister, he would normally be expected to receive taxpayer-funded legal help for his evidence to the ongoing Covid inquiry.<br/>Documents submitted to the inquiry show that he was receiving support from the government's in-house legal department, but he cut ties with them in May after being referred to police for potential rule breaches during the pandemic.<br/>Shortly afterwards, he said he was \"instructing new solicitors\" but this was dependent on funding being agreed with the Cabinet Office.<br/>The department, however, has since said he won't get funding if he tries to \"undermine\" the government's position in relation to the inquiry, amid a row over the submission of his unredacted WhatsApps.<br/>All former prime ministers since John Major have been entitled to a yearly \u00a3115,000 allowance to support their \"special position in public life\".<br/>They can claim from it to fund things like running an office, paying for staff, and travel to events where they are appearing as an ex-PM. The money can't be used to support private or parliamentary duties.<br/>It is not yet known whether Mr Johnson has claimed it since leaving No 10, as the most recent annual figures are yet to be published.<br/>Former premiers have not always claimed the full amount. It is not paid automatically, and they have to provide receipts.<br/>In addition, they can claim up to 10% of the yearly allowance to put towards the pensions of their staff.<br/>Ex-MPs are entitled to a parliamentary pass, the so-called former member's pass, which was known as an \"X\" pass.<br/>It gives access to certain parts of Parliament and some of the catering facilities.<br/>Former MPs are not allowed to use the pass to help with \"lobbying\" - or trying to influence - government ministers.<br/>But the committee has recommended that Mr Johnson shouldn't be given one.

These include immunity from legal prosecution for anything said in Parliament, to allow MPs to speak freely.<br/>The committee was established in its current form in 2013 in the House of Commons. Similar work was previously done by a larger committee called the Standards and Privileges Committee. <br/>Ahead of the release of its report, Boris Johnson accused members of the committee of having a bias against him. He said: \"Their purpose from the beginning has been to find me guilty, regardless of the facts.\"<br/>However, four of the seven members of the committee are Conservative MPs (Sir Bernard Jenkin, Sir Charles Walker, Andy Carter and Alberto Costa).<br/>Two members are Labour MPs (Harriet Harman and Yvonne Fovargue) and one represents the SNP (Allan Dorans).<br/>The rules state the chair has to be a member of the official opposition - ie from the Labour party. Harriet Harman was unanimously elected to the post in June 2022.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: What is the hearing all about? Harriet Harman explains<br/>The committee has said that if Mr Johnson had not already resigned as an MP, it would have recommended a 90-day suspension, which is an unusually long period.<br/>A suspension of more than two weeks can trigger something called a recall petition, which in turn could lead to a by-election.<br/>Two MPs on the committee - the SNP's Allan Dorans and Labour's Yvonne Fovargue - wanted Mr Johnson expelled from the House of Commons - a far more serious sanction.<br/>In addition to the suspension, the committee also recommended that he should not be given a parliamentary pass, as is common for former MPs.<br/>Commons leader Penny Mordaunt has confirmed that MPs will be able to debate \"an amendable motion\" related to the report in Parliament on Monday. <br/>The debate will be followed by a free vote, which means political parties will not tell MPs what to do. <br/>Boris Johnson was widely criticised for describing the committee as \"a kangaroo court\" in his resignation statement.<br/>The phrase generally refers to a group acting without legal authority which hastily reaches a verdict without considering evidence.<br/>Mr Johnson's conduct was referred to the committee after a vote in the House of Commons in April 2022. It did not call for evidence until June 2022, once the police investigation into Partygate had finished.<br/>At his evidence hearing, Mr Johnson criticised committee chair Harriet Harman for having \"said some things about this matter before reading the evidence\". <br/>He was referring to comments she made on Twitter in April 2022, when she said that if Boris Johnson and then Chancellor Rishi Sunak accepted a fine for a lockdown breaking party, \"they are also admitting that they misled the House of Commons\".<br/>Ms Harman replaced the previous chair Sir Chris Bryant, who decided he should not lead the investigation because of his previous criticism of Mr Johnson's rule-breaking. <br/>No - it can also decide if non-MPs have been in contempt of Parliament.<br/>In 2019, the Privileges Committee examined the refusal of Boris Johnson's former adviser Dominic Cummings to give evidence to another parliamentary committee.<br/>It found that Mr Cummings was in contempt of Parliament and recommended that the House of Commons should pass a resolution criticising him. <br/>African leaders tour Kyiv after air raid alert<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Greece denies coastguard rope led to boat tragedy<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

This incident took place just under two miles (3.2km) away from the scene of the first two killings.<br/>The suspect then attempted to run over a man in the Milton Street area - he was left in a critical condition, but a Nottingham University Hospitals (NUH) NHS Trust spokesman said he was now stable. <br/>He then attempted to run over two other pedestrians in the Sherwood Street area, who are believed to have suffered minor injuries. <br/>In a statement released on Thursday afternoon, police said they had reported this part of the incident to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IPOC), because a marked police car followed behind the suspect's van for a short distance before it hit the two pedestrians. <br/>Police said they then stopped the van in Maples Street where a 31-year-old man was Tasered and arrested at about 05:30 BST.<br/>The two 19-year-olds killed in Ilkeston Road were students at the University of Nottingham who had just finished their exams at the end of their first year.<br/>They have been formally identified as Barnaby Webber and Grace O'Malley-Kumar.<br/>Mr Webber, from Taunton in Somerset, was studying history at Nottingham and was a talented amateur cricketer.<br/>His parents, David and Emma Webber, and younger brother Charlie, said he was \"a beautiful, brilliant, bright young man, with everything in life to look forward to.\"<br/>Speaking to thousands of students gathered at a vigil at the university on Wednesday, his father said: \"I'm lost for words, I've lost my baby boy.\"<br/>\"I know Barney would be super touched by everyone here,\" he said.<br/>Speaking at another vigil on Thursday, Mrs Webber said her son dreamed of one day becoming a pilot. <br/>\"I'm not sure how a history degree from Nottingham was part of the plan - but perhaps he wanted to fly Spitfires,\" she joked. <br/>She said the \"monstrous individual\" who killed him \"will not define us\" and that he \"will receive the retribution\" he deserves. <br/>But she also called on people to \"hold no hate that relates to any colour, sex or religion\". <br/>In a statement, Taunton School, where he attended from nursery through to sixth form, said: \"In his long association with the school, he touched the lives of many staff, pupils and parents and his loss will be very difficult to come to terms with.\"<br/>Ms O'Malley-Kumar was a medical student who had undertaken work placements in a GP surgery and volunteered for the nationwide vaccination programme in the Covid pandemic. <br/>She was also said to have been a talented hockey player, having been a member of England Hockey's under-16 and under-18 squads.<br/>Her parents and brother James said she was \"truly a wonderful and beautiful young lady. As parents, words cannot explain our complete and utter devastation. She will be so dearly missed.\" <br/>Speaking at Wednesday's vigil, her father Sanjoy Kumar said Grace loved being at the university and was full of stories of her time there.<br/>At the vigil on Thursday her mother described her as \"treasured and adored\" child who wanted to be a doctor.<br/>She said the accused \"must face justice\", but called on people to \"be kind to each other - don't have hate in your hearts\". <br/>She added: \"The magnitude of the grief reflects the magnitude of the love we had for her.\" <br/>Bancroft's Independent School, which she left at the end of the last academic year, described her as an \"immensely gifted and dedicated scholar and sportswoman\".  <br/>The 65-year-old man who was found dead in Magdala Road has been formally identified as Ian Coates, a caretaker who worked at Huntingdon Academy, part of the LEAD Academy Trust.<br/>\"Ian was a much-loved colleague who always went the extra mile for the benefit of our children and will be greatly missed,\" the trust said in a statement.<br/>At Thursday's vigil in central Nottingham, Ross Middleton, headteacher at Huntington Academy, spoke of a man who \"always put the children first\". <br/>He said Mr Coates was well-loved in the school, putting on \"show-stopping Christmas displays\", and had also helped children with sewing projects, and created castles for reading corners.  <br/>\"He was full of fun, with a mischievous glint in his eye,\" Mr Middleton said, describing Mr Coates's \"caring nature\", and speaking of the \"love and pride\" he had for his grandson. <br/>Mr Coates's sons, Lee and James Coates, said the avid Nottingham Forest fan had been due to retire in four months' time and his death had \"rocked everyone's world\".<br/>The 31-year-old suspect in custody is originally from West Africa but had been in the UK for many years, official sources have confirmed.<br/>He is not a British citizen but he had settled status, meaning he had permission to stay in the country for several years.<br/>He did not have a criminal record and was not known to the security services.<br/>Police said the suspect is a former University of Nottingham student, but they do not believe this to be connected with the attack. <br/>It is also understood that the man has a history of mental health issues.<br/>Police said on Thursday that they had been given another 36 hours to question the suspect. They have said they are keeping an \"open mind\" and working alongside counter-terrorism police, as would normally be the case for an incident like this.<br/>A statement released on Thursday said: \"A team of dedicated detectives is continuing to question the suspect and building up a strong picture of what happened that morning.<br/>\"This has included CCTV gathering, forensics, eye-witness accounts and searching a number of properties in the city.\"<br/>They said the families of all victims were being supported by specially trained officers. <br/>The police are not looking for anyone else in connection with the attacks.<br/>Officers searched a number of addresses across the city throughout Tuesday.<br/>Around lunchtime on Tuesday, armed officers raided a property in Ilkeston Road, the street where Mr Webber and Ms O'Malley-Kumar were earlier found dead.<br/>Forensic officers were also looking at a dented white Vauxhall van in Bentinck Road near the scene of the arrest.<br/>A dedicated police phone line has been set up and anyone concerned about family or friends can call 0800 096 1011.<br/>Lynn Haggitt witnessed the van being driven into two people in Milton Street. <br/>She said she saw the driver look in his mirror and see a police car behind him. At that point, he \"quickened up\" before going \"straight into\" them, she said.<br/>\"The woman went on the kerb and the man went up in the air,\" she said. \"It was such a bang - I wish I never saw it - it's really shaken me up.<br/>\"I went over. Perhaps I shouldn't have gone over, but I wanted to see if I could help.\"<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Nottingham attack eyewitness: 'I wish I never saw it'<br/>The University of Nottingham's Vice-Chancellor Shearer West characterised events as a \"senseless loss of two first-year students who have had their bright futures brutally curtailed by a seemingly random act of violence\".<br/>\"The university is supporting Grace and Barnaby's families at this immensely difficult time,\" she added.<br/>At Thursday's vigil, Ms West said the university was \"trying to process\" the information that the suspect was a former student. <br/>Thousands also gathered for an outdoor vigil on campus at Djanogly Terrace on Wednesday evening.<br/>The University of Nottingham's student union community officer Daisy Forster told those gathered that \"shock waves echo throughout our student community\" after the deaths. <br/>\"We will always be here when you need us,\" she told the families of Grace and Barnaby, and pointed to thousands of students behind them.<br/>The university has also asked those who need support now or in the coming days to contact wellbeing services. <br/>If you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this story you can visit BBC Action Line.<br/>Three killed, three injured in city centre attacks<br/>Van used in Nottingham attack was stolen from victim<br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Greece denies coastguard rope led to boat tragedy<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Despite being stricken with grief, they both talked about their children with eloquence and empathy, in a moment that those who witnessed it are unlikely to forget.<br/>Flowers were laid for the students, who were killed as they walked home after a night out.<br/>Mr Webber read history at the university and Ms O'Malley-Kumar studied medicine.<br/>In a moving speech, student union community officer Daisy Forster told the families the city's students would support them, adding \"we will always be here when you need us\".<br/>The Reverend Grant Walton, from the university chaplaincy, described the deaths as \"one of those moments which we hoped we'd never encounter\" while the university's vice-chancellor, Professor Shearer West, said the lives of the victims had been \"curtailed\" by a \"seemingly random\" act of violence.<br/>Both students were keen and talented sportspeople and their university team-mates, wearing sports kit, were among the crowd assembled to remember them.<br/>Mr Webber, of Taunton, Somerset, played hockey, rugby and cricket and Ms O'Malley-Kumar played hockey and cricket.<br/>Prof Shearer West told the crowd: \"What should have been a time of celebration and relaxation following the exam period has become a time to mourn tragic loss in the most unimaginable of circumstances.\"<br/>She said the university was supporting both students' families, adding support was available to any students or colleagues affected by the tragedy.<br/>The university and communities across Nottingham had come together in \"grief and remembrance of two much-loved students\", she added.<br/>Mr Coates, whose sons had earlier left tributes at the scene of his death, was also remembered at the event.<br/>While visiting the scene where Mr Coates was found fatally stabbed, Lee and James Coates said their dad was due to retire in four months.<br/>\"He used to take under-privileged kids fishing just to get away from crime.

Established and funded by government, they are led by an independent chair.<br/>An inquiry has the power to make people appear as witnesses and can demand evidence. <br/>No one is found guilty or innocent, but conclusions about lessons learned are published. Inquiries can make recommendations although these do not have to be adopted by ministers. <br/>The Covid inquiry, launched by Boris Johnson in May 2021, covers decision-making during the pandemic in both Westminster and the devolved administrations.<br/>At the time, Mr Johnson said all aspects of the UK's response would be \"under the microscope\". <br/>It is being chaired by Baroness Heather Hallett, a retired judge and crossbench peer.<br/>She previously led the inquests into the 7/7 London bombings.<br/>The inquiry has no formal deadline but is due to hold public hearings across the UK until at least 2025.<br/>At the first public hearing in London, Baroness Hallett said she planned to publish updates and reports \"as we go along\" on the inquiry's website. <br/>Public hearings are streamed on the inquiry's YouTube channel, and witness transcripts will be published on its website.<br/>Members of the public can apply to attend public hearings in person. <br/>The inquiry is split into different parts.<br/>Work in four areas has already begun:<br/>Future strands - with hearings due in 2024 and 2025 - will look at:<br/>Scotland is also holding a separate inquiry.<br/>Baroness Hallett's team is expected to focus on the biggest and most controversial aspects of the government's response, including:<br/>The inquiry is also expected to consider whether too many restrictions were imposed as the pandemic progressed. <br/>Over the course of 80 days in autumn 2020, for example, England went from the so-called \"rule of six\" to a tiered system of regulations, then into a national lockdown and then back to tiers.<br/>The government's policy towards schools is also likely to be on the agenda. Schools closed to most pupils in March 2020 and then again in January 2021.  <br/>The first public hearings have taken evidence from independent experts, including infectious-diseases specialist Prof David Heymann, and some government officials. <br/>Former Prime Minister David Cameron and former Chancellor George Osborne will appear before the committee in the second week of hearings, as will the current Deputy Prime Minister, Oliver Dowden, and Chancellor (and former Health Secretary) Jeremy Hunt. <br/>Sir Chris Whitty, the UK government's chief medical adviser during the pandemic, and Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser will also give evidence. <br/>Members of the public have been invited to share their experiences through the inquiry's Every Story Matters project.<br/>The Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice campaign group - which has been critical of the government's handling of the pandemic - has urged the inquiry to ensure these voices are heard.<br/>The inquiry asked to see unredacted WhatsApp messages between Boris Johnson and 40 people. <br/>They include former No 10 adviser Dominic Cummings, Cabinet Secretary Simon Case and former chancellor and current Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. <br/>What is the UK Covid inquiry and how long will it take?<br/>The Cabinet Office launched a legal challenge against the request, arguing some of the messages were irrelevant. This is thought to be the first time a government has taken legal action against its own public inquiry.<br/>Baroness Hallett said it was her job to decide if material was relevant.<br/>However Mr Johnson said he was \"perfectly content\" for the inquiry to have WhatsApp messages sent after May 2021. He said earlier messages were not available because his mobile phone was involved in a security breach and had not been used since. <br/>Former Health Secretary Matt Hancock also said he was happy to share his messages, although many of these have already been leaked by the journalist Isabel Oakeshott, who helped Mr Hancock write his book, Pandemic Diaries.<br/>Covid-19 Public Inquiry<br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Greece denies coastguard rope led to boat tragedy<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

This includes those who had not been tested for the virus prior to their death.<br/>The most deaths reported in this way on a single day was on 19 January 2021, when 1,490 people were registered.<br/>At this point in the pandemic, the first variant of the virus seen in the UK - initially detected in Kent - was dominant. This was subsequently named the 'Alpha' variant by the WHO.<br/>The UK was also only a month into the first stages of its vaccine rollout, which started to reduce the risk of death and serious illness from the virus.<br/>Another way of looking at the impact coronavirus had on the number of people dying in the UK is by counting all deaths over and above the expected number since the pandemic began, sometimes referred to \"excess deaths\". <br/>As of 5 May 2023, this was over 208,000 deaths. For most of the previous three years there were above average levels of deaths in the UK.<br/>The highest peaks in the first two years of the pandemic were during periods when many people died directly from Covid. Out of nearly 13,000 excess deaths in mid-April 2020, about 9,500 were attributed to the virus.<br/>But a larger portion of the excess seen in the second half of 2022 were driven by other factors, including flu and pressure on the NHS. Of the 3,300 excess deaths in mid-January 2023, about 600 were from Covid.<br/>More than 44 million people in the UK were estimated to have had the virus between April 2020 and February 2022, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This is the most accurate measure available as the total number of infections across the country will never be known.<br/>The ONS ran a regular survey through the pandemic: testing randomly chosen people in order to estimate the number of people who had the virus.<br/>Based on the survey, the estimated peak of the pandemic, in cases if not in deaths, was in late March 2022, where at one point about 4.9 million people were thought to have the virus. However, the survey did not capture the first wave of the pandemic, with trials only beginning in England in April 2020.<br/>Figures are still regularly published on the number of recorded coronavirus cases across the UK, from PCR and lateral flow tests. However, recorded cases are not considered to present the most accurate picture for a variety of reasons, including the availability and reach of testing.<br/>Patients were admitted to hospital with coronavirus more than 1.1 million times between March 2020 and 5 May 2023 across England, Scotland and Northern Ireland.<br/>These were people who tested positive up to two weeks before arriving at hospital, or while being treated. <br/>In Wales the figures were counted differently, with about 43,000 admissions of those who either had, or were suspected to have, the virus.<br/>The number of patients in hospital with coronavirus peaked in the week to 20 January 2021, at more than 38,000 people.<br/>When a new national lockdown was announced on 5 January 2021, across hospitals in England about one in four general admission beds were occupied by patients with coronavirus.<br/>This period was the first time the health service had to cope with both normal winter pressures, and the additional strain from Covid, which was spreading among an unvaccinated population with little immunity.<br/>What is the UK Covid inquiry and how long will it take?<br/>'Little thought' about lockdown impact pre-pandemic, inquiry hears<br/>The questions we want the Covid inquiry to answer<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

They lost loved ones and the ability to mourn properly.\"<br/>Lady Hallett said she would do \"everything in her power\" to explore what happened and what lessons needed to be learned, saying the inquiry would be \"thorough and fair\".<br/>\"Those who have suffered will be at the heart of the inquiry,\" she added.<br/>During the session in London it was also announced which individuals and organisations will be core participants for the first module - this entitles them to access documents and make submissions.<br/>Groups representing bereaved relatives, government departments, the health secretary, the UK Health Security Agency and NHS England have all been appointed core participant status, alongside public health officials and ministers in the devolved nations.<br/>Lawyers have also been setting out how the inquiry will proceed. Members of the public and other groups not awarded core participant status will still get to submit evidence, and there will be more informal listening events around the country which people can attend.<br/>The public hearings where people are called to give evidence do not start until the spring. But the start of the first preliminary hearing is still being seen as an important milestone for the families who lost loved ones.<br/>However, the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice campaign said the listening exercise was flawed.<br/>Group co-founder Matt Fowler said he was concerned families would be marginalised, since the listening exercise was being run by a third-party, including PR firms that had won government contracts during the pandemic.<br/>\"This clearly risks a conflict of interest, and it's hard to see how we can have confidence that our experiences will be listened to accurately and fairly,\" he said.<br/>Lindsay Jackson's mother, Sylvia, 87, died from Covid during the first lockdown, after contracting it at a care home.<br/>Ms Jackson, of the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice campaign group, said it was essential lessons were learned.<br/>She was \"really pleased\" the inquiry was finally starting, but said it had taken too long to reach this stage. <br/>\"It's two-and-a-half years since the pandemic started. We lost so many people. If people have done things wrong, they need to be held accountable.<br/>\"For me, my family and the others who lost loved ones, it's important that answers are found to the questions that we have.\"<br/>Several reports have already put the UK government's handling of the pandemic at the start, under the spotlight.<br/>Last year, a report by MPs on the Health and Social Care Committee and the Science and Technology Committee, said the UK's failure to do more to stop Covid spreading early in the pandemic was one of the country's worst public health failures.<br/>It said the government approach - backed by its scientists - to try to manage the situation and in effect achieve herd immunity by infection had delayed the first lockdown, costing thousands of lives.<br/>And a report by spending watchdog the National Audit Office, published in late 2021, found ministers had not been properly prepared for a pandemic like Covid-19 and lacked detailed plans on shielding, job-support schemes and school disruption.<br/>One issue likely to come under scrutiny in module one is how much was learned from Exercise Cygnus, a 2016 government exercise simulating a flu pandemic. <br/>Meanwhile, Lady Poole, the judge appointed in December, to lead the inquiry into the Scottish government's Covid response has resigned from the role for personal reasons.<br/>UK Covid infections continuing to rise<br/>Covid Inquiry: The UK pandemic in numbers<br/>Covid inquiry's public hearings to begin in 2023<br/>UK Covid inquiry draft terms of reference set out<br/>Ex-judge to chair Covid pandemic inquiry<br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Greece denies coastguard rope led to boat tragedy<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

It calls for ethnic minority communities to be \"placed firmly at the centre\" of the inquiry.<br/>It has been signed by 26 other organisations - a mix of equality campaigners, such as the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants and the Ubele initiative, and health bodies, including the NHS BME Network and London-based Guys and St Thomas's Foundation.<br/>The letter was sent ahead of a preliminary hearing on Tuesday, which is looking at the role of the healthcare system in the pandemic. <br/>The inquiry will begin hearing evidence in June. Before then, preliminary sessions are being held to agree which issues should be examined in each section of the inquiry.<br/>The Covid inquiry told BBC News that it is committed to looking at inequalities, and that their impact on the pandemic will be at the forefront of its investigations.<br/>For those who've lost family members, this promise to look at inequalities generally doesn't go far enough. They believe ethnicity should be examined separately.<br/>Lobby Akinnola, whose father, Femi, died with Covid in April 2020 at the age of 60, said \"there's no way [race] couldn't have\" played a role in his dad's death.<br/>His father was a regular gym-goer, with no underlying health conditions, he said.<br/>\"He was a black man in England,\" Lobby, of Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, said. <br/>\"Racism is pervasive in every aspect of life. My dad really highlights why it's so important to look at this as a systemic and structural problem, because he did everything right.\"<br/>As a carer, Femi was a \"key worker\". At the time, people from minority ethnic communities were statistically more likely to be classified as key workers - particularly in people-facing jobs that left them more exposed to the virus.<br/>\"He was going to work with his winter gloves and scarves as makeshift PPE. There's nothing more this man could have done to try and stay alive,\" Lobby said.<br/>At a hearing on 14 February, the inquiry's barrister said looking at racism in the first part of the inquiry - which will examine how prepared the UK was for a pandemic - would be \"an impossible task\". <br/>The Covid inquiry told BBC News it had instructed \"two world-leading inequalities experts\" to contribute to the first module.<br/>Lobby wants stories like his father's to be heard in the inquiry \"because we've seen first-hand the consequences\" of racial inequality. <br/>\"As a black man from a black family, it feels like race and the impact that race had in the pandemic has also... just been sidelined, too. It feels like it's more of an afterthought than being a priority for the inquiry.\"<br/>The inquiry has set up a listening exercise to gather people's experiences. <br/>The letter sent to Lady Hallett also alleges that the listening exercise appears to be an \"entirely separate process\" to the main inquiry.<br/>Rabinder Sherwood, whose parents both died with Covid in January 2021, took part in the exercise two weeks ago by filling in an online survey.<br/>She said the form was \"really cold\", with some \"brutal\" questions including: \"When did your experience start?\" and \"When did your experience end?\"<br/>After submitting it, she said: \"That's it, an abrupt end - thank you, goodbye, no signposting to any support you may need.\"<br/>Jean Adamson, whose father died in a care home during the pandemic's first wave, said she felt \"nobody is listening to us\".<br/>She said Lady Hallett had \"promised us that bereaved families would be front and centre of the inquiry\". <br/>\"I feel a sense of betrayal, because that isn't happening,\" she added.<br/>Lady Hallett told Tuesday's preliminary hearing that the aim of the listening exercise was \"to ensure that we reach as many people as possible, across the United Kingdom - from those who are seldom heard to those who are more often heard - to find out from them directly what their experience of the pandemic was\".<br/>The responses, she added, will \"be fed into the inquiry and can inform the findings and recommendations that I make\". <br/>A spokesperson for the inquiry also told BBC News it had appointed specialists in research and communications to \"enable thousands of people across the UK to share their experiences of the pandemic\".<br/>Loss and suffering at heart of Covid inquiry<br/>Ethnic minority Covid death gap closes \u2013 ONS<br/>How coronavirus tore through Britain's ethnic minorities<br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

But he stressed: \"There was no mooring rope,\" suggesting that there was no attempt to tow the boat or tether to it for any length of time. <br/>\"They refused it, they said 'no help, we go to Italy' and continued on their way.\"<br/>The question of whether any of the ships tried to attach a rope to the migrant boat was first raised by an activist who said people on board had said they feared it could prompt their highly crowded boat to turn over. <br/>A total of 104 people were saved from the sea soon after the ship sank shortly after 02:00 local time on Wednesday but the chances of finding any more are disappearing fast. <br/>The UN International Organization for Migration has described the sinking as one of the biggest tragedies in the Mediterranean.<br/>The coastguard's timeline and account have been challenged, notably by one organisation that says it was in contact with people on the fishing boat. An email sent by Alarm Phone on Tuesday afternoon warned the coastguard that as many as 750 people were on board and they were urgently asking for help.<br/>The coastguard has stressed that from the first moment it was in contact with the crew during the afternoon no request for assistance was made. Two commercial ships provided the boat with water during the evening, but coastguard officials have said repeated offers of assistance were turned down.<br/>The Greek government's insistence that no mooring rope was used follows a report by Greek newspaper Kathimerini on Friday that a coastguard vessel turned on searchlights and used loudspeakers to tell those on board they were in danger and would not be able to reach the Italian coast. <br/>This was said to have taken place around three hours before the boat went down.<br/>Members of the coastguard tied a rope to the fishing boat so that its own crew could check conditions inside, according to the source. Some of those on board then untied the rope in order to continue their route northwards to Italy. <br/>But two accounts from survivors have suggested a rope may have led to the boat going down.<br/>One has come from a local councillor in the port city of Kalamata who had earlier spoken to a 24-year-old Syrian. <br/>\"The coastguard boat tied them with some rope and tried to tow them to the left. For an unknown reason the boat veered to the right and suddenly sank,\" said Tasos Polychronopoulos.<br/>Another survivor gave a similar version to former Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras during a visit to Kalamata on Thursday.<br/>\"The Greek coastguard asked the vessel to follow them, but they couldn't,\" a translator told Mr Tsipras. \"The coastguard then threw a rope but because they didn't know how to pull the rope, the vessel started dangling right and left.\"<br/>\"The coastguard boat was going too fast but the vessel was already dangling to the left, and that's how it sank.\"<br/>Hellenic coastguard spokesman Cpt Nikos Alexiou was adamant on Friday that \"there was no attempt to moor the boat\", although he did say ropes had been thrown by sailors from a commercial ship that provided supplies during the evening.<br/>\"Since the ship had not asked for help, we could not intervene,\" he told public broadcaster ERT. \"You cannot enter international waters if a vessel is not engaged in smuggling or some other crime,\" <br/>\"The boat was illegally transporting people. We had not entered the critical phase to be able to enable the rescue operation,\" he said.<br/>Nine people, including several Egyptians, have been arrested on suspicion of people trafficking, Greek TV is reporting.<br/>Georgios Vasilakos, a volunteer rescue doctor for the Hellenic Red Cross, told the BBC's Today programme that no women and children were among the survivors.<br/>He said survivors reported that \"all women and children were isolated below deck\". <br/>\"This is why, because of the rapid unfolding of events and the rapid capsizing of the boat, they were unable to get out in time,\" he said. <br/>People on the boat had been drinking sea water for at least two days before it sank, he said. <br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Survivors winched to safety after Greece boat disaster<br/>Families of some of the missing have arrived in Kalamata in search of their loved ones.<br/>\"My relatives were on the boat,\" said Aftab, who had travelled from the UK and said at least four of his relatives from Pakistan were unaccounted for.<br/>A Syrian man from the Netherlands broke down as he revealed his wife and brother-in-law were missing.<br/>\"The authorities are looking for their bodies in the sea...They're looking in hospitals, they're looking among dead bodies, and among the survivors,\" Kassam Abozeed said.<br/>Several marches in protest at the tragedy took place on Thursday evening, in the capital Athens, the second city Thessaloniki and elsewhere.<br/>Greece is one of the main routes into the European Union for refugees and migrants from the Middle East, Asia and Africa.<br/>Last month the Greek government came under international criticism over video reportedly showed the forceful expulsion of migrants who were set adrift at sea.<br/>Are you in Greece?

Now it is one of the world's most powerful technology companies, with an annual revenue of $200bn (\u00a3158.2bn). <br/>It is best known for making more than half of Apple's products - from iPhones to iMacs - but it also counts Microsoft, Sony, Dell and Amazon among its clients.<br/>For decades, it has thrived on a playbook perfected by multinational corporations - they design products in the US, manufacture them in China and then sell them to the world. That is how it grew from a small component-making business to the consumer electronics giant it is today.<br/>But as global supply chains adjust to souring ties between Washington and Beijing, Foxconn finds itself in an unenviable spot - caught between the world's two biggest economies, the very nations that have powered its growth until now. <br/>The US and China are at loggerheads over many things, from trade to the war in Ukraine. But one of the biggest potential flashpoints is Taiwan, where Foxconn is headquartered.<br/>Taiwan has been a thorny issue for a long time but Chinese leader Xi Jinping's repeated pledges of \"reunification\" have upset the uneasy status quo. Meanwhile, the US, under President Joe Biden, has been more vocal in its support for Taiwan in case of an attack.<br/>Some US voices have crossed China's red line, calling for independence, although the White House has reaffirmed its position that it maintains diplomatic relations with Beijing and not Taipei.<br/>There are hopes of a thaw with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken visiting China this weekend. But there are also fears of a conflict - one US general has estimated it could happen as soon as the next few years.<br/>\"The United States and China are engaged in what we see as strategic competition,\" said Shihoko Goto, the deputy director for the Asia programme at the Wilson Center in Washington DC.<br/>\"Foxconn wants to do business with both, but there can only be one winner.\"<br/>But Mr Liu does not think it is that simple. For one, he said, Foxconn's business model, which relies on US designs and Chinese manufacturing, is far from over.<br/>\"We hire a lot of workers and most countries, including China, want to support their workers,\" Mr Liu said, adding that the Chinese government wants companies like Foxconn to keep going because of the huge number of jobs they create.<br/>Are rising tensions putting pressure on the model? \"So far? We haven't seen it,\" he told us.<br/>But the West and its allies have called for countries and companies to \"de-risk\" from China - a long-term shift to curb global reliance on China that is yet to play out.<br/>When asked if that was impacting business, Mr Liu responded cautiously. <br/>Some overseas clients had pushed to move production out of China, he said, but this was their decision to make, not Foxconn's.<br/>\"They get the push from their government about de-risking, and then they will let us know.\"<br/>Geopolitics aside, Covid-19 is another reason companies might consider \"de-risking\" from China.<br/>A mix of harsh Covid policies, a lack of space for quarantine and the infectiousness of the Omicron variant led to protests and riots at Foxconn's factory in Zhengzhou - the world's biggest iPhone plant - in late 2022. Hundreds of workers, who feared the spread of the virus, fled the campus on foot.<br/>Mr Liu said the scenes that played out for the world to see were caused by a lack of transportation due to Beijing's unyielding zero-Covid policy.<br/>But when pressed further, he admitted that he should have handled things differently.<br/>\"If the same situation occurs again, I would stop production altogether,\" he said, reiterating that he would have made that decision even at the risk of irking clients like Apple.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>WATCH: Chinese protesters clash with riot police at giant iPhone factory<br/>The company's success certainly rests on its impressive client base, but Foxconn is just as indispensable to those clients.<br/>To understand how essential it is to Apple, for instance, you just need to look at how much of the iPhone is made by Foxconn - around 60%, by some estimates. The factories in China make some of the most essential parts of the device - camera modules, connectors, even the back of the phone casing.<br/>That expertise is also what Mr Liu is hoping will fuel Foxconn's next big bet: electric cars.<br/>\"Look at this - this is a big iPhone, so we're very familiar with this,\" he said, pointing to a panel that controlled the car he had taken us for a drive in.<br/>Built for families and priced for an aspiring global middle class, the shiny white SUV is one of several models manufactured by Foxconn. <br/>\"The reason why we think this is a great opportunity for us is that with the traditional gas engine, you have engines which are mostly mechanical. But with EVs, it's batteries and motors,\" he explains. <br/>That is a familiar language for a technology company like Foxconn, he added. <br/>Foxconn's hopes to capture about 5% of the global electric vehicle market in the next few years - an ambitious target given the firm has only made a handful of models so far. But it is a gamble that Mr Liu is confident will pay off.<br/>\"It doesn't make sense for you to make [EVs] in one place, so regionalised production for cars is very natural,\" he added. Foxconn car factories will be based in Ohio in the US, in Thailand, Indonesia and perhaps even in India, he said. <br/>For now, the company will keep focusing on what it does best - making electronic products for clients. But perhaps not too far in the future, Foxconn will start selling its own cars.<br/>Either way, with the foray into electric cars, Foxconn is diversifying not just production but also supply lines - both of which, Mr Liu believes, hold the key to the company's future.<br/>iPhone maker hikes pay ahead of new model launch<br/>iPhone maker sees revenue slump as demand weakens<br/>African leaders tour Kyiv after air raid alert<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Greece denies coastguard rope led to boat tragedy<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

It comes just as Kyiv is launching its much-vaunted counter-offensive. <br/>So, what can this mission actually achieve? <br/>South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa offered no timeline or proposals when he made the announcement last month, joining a crowded field of would-be peacemakers that includes China, Turkey and the Pope.   <br/>\"What is the strategic thrust of this intervention?\" asks Kingsley Makhubela, a South African risk analyst and former diplomat. \"It's not clear. Is this a photo op by African heads of state?\"  <br/>The mission is an unusual burst of activism given Africa's largely hands-off approach to a conflict that many here see primarily as a confrontation between Russia and the West.  <br/>It is also a rare attempt at diplomatic intervention outside the continent - a \"welcome development\" given Africa's growing demand to have a bigger voice at the UN and other international organisations, says Murithi Mutiga, Africa director at the International Crisis Group (ICG) think-tank.   <br/>The man who has prepared the ground, Jean-Yves Ollivier, has talked about modest goals. <br/>He heads a UK-based organisation known as the Brazzaville Foundation, which focuses primarily on peace and development initiatives in Africa, although his long-standing links to Congo-Brazzaville's authoritarian leader have made him a controversial figure.   <br/>Mr Ollivier has stopped commenting publicly about the trip since the dates became official. But in previously published interviews he has laid out his approach.  <br/>He said the aim was to start talking rather than to resolve the conflict, to begin a dialogue on issues that do not directly affect the military situation and build from there.   <br/>One of them is a potential swap of Russian and Ukrainian prisoners of war.   <br/>The other is to try and find solutions to issues that matter to Africa, like grain and fertiliser.   <br/>The war has severely restricted the export of grain from Ukraine and fertiliser from Russia, intensifying global food insecurity. Africa, which depends on imports of both, has suffered the most.<br/>Mr Ollivier said the African leaders would seek to persuade the Russians to extend the fragile agreement that allows Ukraine to ship grain through the Black Sea. <br/>And it will urge Kyiv to help find ways to ease restrictions on the export of Russian fertiliser currently being held up in ports.    <br/>There are indications, however, that the leaders \"seek to offer a more substantive deal between the two sides\", says Mr Mutiga. <br/>The delegation has been designed for breadth and balance, with members from different parts of Africa who have different views on the conflict. <br/>It includes four presidents, Egypt's prime minister, and representatives from Uganda and Congo-Brazzaville<br/>South Africa and Uganda are seen as leaning towards Russia, while Zambia and Comoros are closer to the West. Egypt, Senegal and Congo-Brazzaville have remained largely neutral.   <br/>But recent developments in South Africa appear to be influencing the venture.   <br/>Mr Ramaphosa's government has come under growing pressure from the US because of its alleged support for Russia's war. This centres on claims of an arms shipment to Moscow, which South Africa has denied. <br/>The Biden administration is waiting for the outcome of Pretoria's official investigation, but a bipartisan group of US lawmakers wants the White House to punish South Africa by reconsidering important preferential trade benefits.   <br/>\"I think [the mission] is now aligned with a need for South Africa to explain itself,\" says Alex Vines, director of the Africa Programme at London's Chatham House think-tank.  <br/>Dr Vines says the Americans are no longer trying to make Africa choose sides in the conflict as they did when Russia first invaded Ukraine. <br/>Many African states have maintained a non-aligned position, a stance the US acknowledges is rooted in the history of the Cold War and does not necessarily mean support for Moscow.   <br/>Washington now \"advocates true non-alignment\", he says, \"hence the pressure on South Africa at the moment to prove that it's truly non-aligned\". <br/>Mr Ramaphosa has been a driving force in getting the trip into shape, nailing it down with calls to Mr Putin and Mr Zelensky, and briefing UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres.  <br/>Although neither Russia nor Ukraine have shown any interest in peace talks, both have an interest in this visit.   <br/>Moscow has been cultivating influence in Africa as a counterweight to the West and is hoping to showcase that in a Russia-Africa summit in St Petersburg next month.   <br/>Ukraine has been trying to catch up on African diplomacy from a standing start. It recently sent its foreign minister to the continent to plead its case and would welcome another chance to do so.   <br/>The Ukrainians \"will probably try to persuade the African mediators not to attend the summit\", says Dr Makhubela. <br/>\"The Russians want to show that they are not isolated. But their interests are\u2026 mutually exclusive. That's why this is going to create a dilemma for African heads of state as to whether they go to St Petersburg,\" he adds. <br/>Analysts see the summit as an important indicator of Africa's relations with Russia, but not an ideological one.   <br/>\"Africans are transactional in this,\" says Dr Vines, noting that the biggest worry of ex-guerrilla fighters in Mozambique he had spoken to recently was the cost of living because of \"this distant European war\".   <br/>\"It's not their war,\" he says.  <br/>That is in fact one of the few advantages the African leaders could bring to the peace table as mediators, according to Mr Mutiga, should the parties ever decide to sit at it.   <br/>This video can not be played<br/>Ukraine is behind Russia when it comes to diplomatic relations with Africa<br/>Putin - South Africa's big headache<br/>Why Russia's invasion of Ukraine still divides Africa<br/>Why is South Africa's navy joining exercises with Russia?<br/>African leaders tour Kyiv after air raid alert<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Greece denies coastguard rope led to boat tragedy<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

But not Mr Alhassan - he was returning from a market. <br/>He shows no emotion as he returns to the bank of the river where he had managed to swim to safety.<br/>It is low tide when I meet him. The river is still and his gaze is fixed on the horizon.<br/>But as he remembers the parents who drowned with their children, including his sister and her eight-year-old son, the tears come flooding down his face.<br/>\"The women remained behind trying to carry their children - some of them had three or four children.<br/>\"There were also fathers who died the same way trying to save their kids,\" he says.<br/>Had he tried to help save them too, he would have drowned, he says.<br/>So he swam to safety, but as he did so, he saw the horrifying scene as mothers and fathers sank along with their children as they tried to save them.<br/>He is thankful he survived but still traumatised from seeing all those people die, especially the children.<br/>Close to 300 people were travelling in the wooden boat when it capsized on Monday, authorities said.<br/>Travelling across the Niger, Nigeria's longest river, can be perilous in some areas. The wooden boats are often overcrowded, there are not enough life jackets and some of the journey is made in the dark, so accidents are not uncommon especially during the rainy season between April and October.<br/>Most of the incidents happen in the central Niger state and neighbouring areas. Three years ago in Kebbi state at least 50 people died after their boat capsized. <br/>There have also been other deadly boat accidents recently in Kano in the north, and the southern states of Lagos and Anambra, where 76 people died in October last year. <br/>Despite the dangers, for many communities that live on the banks of the River Niger, it is the only form of travel they know.<br/>Most of them, like Mr Alhassan have made the journey countless times in the past.<br/>He was sitting at the head of the boat this time, he recalls. <br/>The boat had left in darkness just before 03:00GMT, some of the children had dozed off in their parents' arms and were carried on board. <br/>But five minutes after they took off, he heard a loud crack that split the boat in two, he says.<br/>The police say the boat capsized after part of the vessel collapsed, causing it to flood. But the Emir of Patigi - the local traditional ruler - told journalists that river waves overtook the boat and forced it to crash into a tree that had washed into the river.<br/>In Ebo, a community in Kwara state which lost 61 people in the tragedy, many of the young survivors have gathered under the biggest tree in the middle of the village.<br/>On another day, they might have been discussing a football match or joking with each other, but they are in mourning.<br/>Some of them were on the boat and managed to swim to safety but the horrors of seeing friends, relatives and strangers they had met at the loading dock drown, is one they will never forget.<br/>Aisha Mohammed, who lives close to the tree, was not on the boat but her three daughters were.<br/>She had bid them farewell as they travelled to the wedding, looking forward to the day when guests would come to her house for wedding ceremonies. All three daughters were set to get married this year, she says in the local Nupe language.<br/>\"We are all grieving from this sad incident and only pray Allah to ease our pains,\" says the local chief Liman Umar.<br/>\"In our community we do things together. When we rejoice, we do as one and now that this has befallen us, we are all not sleeping,\" he says.<br/>He was coordinating the rescue efforts, relaying information from the divers to the emir but that has now been abandoned.<br/>Local people say they have faced heavy rains in the last couple of days and received no help from the government to find survivors.<br/>They are now waiting for missing bodies to float to the river surface so they can collect them, their leaders say.<br/>Some of the boats that ply the Niger travel at night to evade authorities and passengers are often indifferent about the life jackets, many tell me.<br/>But this has to change says Abdul Gana, a local leader in the nearby town of Kpada which lost four people in the tragedy.<br/>\"We want  government to wade in and provide protective gear for the people whenever they make use of the boats.\"<br/>\"The governor should look into road infrastructure - the reason our people prefer travelling on the Niger is because there are no access roads to link up with other communities,\" he says.<br/>It is a sentiment shared by state governor Abdulrahaman Abdulrazaq, who visited the community to offer condolences.<br/>He talked about providing 1,000 life jackets to the community to enhance their safety during travels.<br/>There was also talk of stronger laws to punish those who refuse to abide by safety regulations.<br/>But as he left, the banks of the Niger were already teeming with the wooden boats and their passengers, hardly any of whom were wearing life jackets.<br/>There is a feeling the life jackets will take some time to arrive, but like the flow of the tide on the Niger, life must continue.<br/>Over 100 dead after Nigeria wedding boat capsizes<br/>At least 76 killed in Nigeria boat accident<br/>African leaders tour Kyiv after air raid alert<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Greece denies coastguard rope led to boat tragedy<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

But they're all fearing the worst.<br/>The 31-year-old now lives in Germany but he's Syrian and from the majority Kurdish city of Kobane. He knows of 12 people who are believed to have been on the boat.<br/>It's one of the worst migrant tragedies in recent years with nearly 80 people dead and at least 100 rescued. But it's suggested that as many as 750 people may have packed onto the boat, including 100 children.<br/>\"We hadn't heard from them for days and didn't even know if they were on the boat,\" said Mr Ali, adding that the group's last contact with relatives back in Syria took place almost a week ago.<br/>Since 14 June, he and his family have received conflicting news about whether the group is dead or alive.<br/>\"In incidents like this, you can't know for certain whether someone is dead or alive. One word can destroy the morale of the whole family,\" he said.<br/>For British Pakistani journalist Raja Faryad Khan, it's good news - his 22-year-old nephew Adnan Bashir is one of the few survivors, <br/>But his relief is tinged with sadness as up to 16 people from his village in Pakistan-administered Kashmir could have been on the boat.<br/>Mr Khan travelled from the UK to the Greek port city of Kalamata to meet his nephew but was only allowed a few moments with him by the security guard. <br/>\"(My nephew) said the boat was shaking and it became one sided, and then the boat was just gone into the sea,\" said Mr Khan.<br/>Back in Germany, Mr Ali is living with the agony of uncertainty as he describes the journey his relatives took. <br/>They were smuggled from Syria to Lebanon before flying to Libya where they stayed for 40 days waiting for a chance to cross the Mediterranean Sea and reach Italy.<br/>According to Mr Ali, the group paid at least $5,000 each to the smugglers, but this didn't save them from harsh treatment by their hosts.<br/>\"The smugglers picked them up from the airport and chucked them anywhere they could,\" he said.<br/>He says his relatives were placed in a \"block of concrete\" with no furniture and had to sleep on blankets laid out on the hard floor.<br/>The last time he spoke to anyone from the group was early June, when some of his relatives hinted that a crossing could be imminent.<br/>\"They told me they would leave soon because the weather was hot and the sea was calm enough,\" Mr Ali recalled.<br/>His relatives shared photos that raised alarm bells. \"I saw expressions of sadness in their eyes but it could also have been fatigue.\"<br/>What makes his pain deeper is that he himself risked his life to escape the war in Syria in 2016.<br/>But he said that at that time, it was much easier for people to reach Europe, as more migration routes were available.<br/>Mr Ali crossed the Turkish border before setting off on a much shorter boat journey to Greece.<br/>\"I took a dingy to get to Greece but it was a 4km journey,\" he said. \"When we left, we could see the lights from some of the Greek islands.\"<br/>The distance from Libya to Italy is at least 725km. Another difference pointed out by Mr Ali is that the passengers on his dinghy all had life jackets.<br/>The Greek coastguard has said none of the people on board the capsized fishing boat were wearing them.<br/>Mr Ali can easily place himself in his relatives' shoes though, imagining what they \"must have been thinking\" before getting on the fishing boat.<br/>\"You don't know what will happen. You worry someone might die, someone might fall off,\" he said. \"No matter how I try, I can't describe how I feel in relation to this tragedy.\"<br/>The 31-year-old is disgusted at the role played by smugglers, whom he accuses of \"treating people like meat\".<br/>\"I imagine those smugglers do not even count how many people they are putting on a boat. They don't care about the consequences.\"<br/>And then an appeal for more understanding and solidarity.<br/>\"People need safer routes.

One is an ordinary North Korean citizen who has agreed to risk all to be interviewed by the BBC. The other is a source, working for an organisation in South Korea to leak information out of the country.  <br/>At a secure location that cannot be bugged, the source relays one of our questions to the citizen and notes down the answer. Later, when it is safe, they will send it back to us, in multiple instalments. Sending even one full answer at a time is too risky. <br/>This is the start of a painstaking process that will take us many months, as we investigate the consequences of the North Korean government's decision to seal the country's border more than three years ago. <br/>North Koreans are forbidden from talking to anyone outside the country, especially journalists, and if the government finds out they have done so, they could be killed. <br/>But when the border was shut in January 2020, in response to the coronavirus pandemic, a country that was already difficult to report on became virtually impenetrable.  <br/>All the sources that journalists would ordinarily rely on to relay what was happening on the ground dried up, as foreign diplomats and aid workers left the country. It also became nearly impossible for North Koreans to escape and share their experiences.  <br/>At the same time, there was good reason to suspect the border closure was causing people significant suffering, based on our knowledge of how people in North Korea make their living and acquire their food. Then, last year, we started to get unconfirmed reports of severe food shortages and possible starvation.  <br/>This is why we decided to take such extraordinary measures, to interview three ordinary North Koreans inside the country. <br/>First, we sought advice from those who work closely with North Koreans and understand the risks. Sokeel Park, from the organisation Liberty in North Korea, who has been working with escapees for more than a decade, was of the view this was an important and worthwhile undertaking, in spite of the risks. <br/>\"There is not a single North Korean who won't understand the danger, and if people want to do this, I think we should respect that,\" he told us. \"Every conversation with people inside North Korea, every titbit of information, is so valuable, because we know so little,\" he said.  <br/>But to do this, we could not work alone. We teamed up with a news organisation in South Korea, Daily NK, that has a network of sources inside the country. These sources found us people who wanted to be interviewed. Aware we would only be getting a snapshot of life inside the country, we chose to speak to people of varying ages from different areas.  <br/>We explained what the BBC was, and how far and wide their interviews would be seen and heard, and they gave their consent. <br/>\"They are looking forward to telling the world how bad the situation is in North Korea,\" said Daily NK's editor-in-chief Lee Sang-yong. \"They hope the international community will take notice.\"  <br/>Mr Lee has been working with his sources for 13 years to smuggle information out of North Korea. He assured us that his methods of communication were robust. He was confident he could keep people safe but warned that the process would take time.  <br/>As we waited, there were moments we worried we might not get enough information. What if we received one-line answers - perhaps not even enough to report? This was the gamble.  <br/>But when we finally collated the messages, we were blown away by the level of detail. People revealed far more than we had expected, and the situation was worse than we had imagined. It pointed to a dire humanitarian and human rights situation unfolding in the country, and chronic food shortages. <br/>We then set about verifying as much as we could. Helpfully, our three interviewees corroborated each other. They all cited the same quarantine rules and the same new laws which frightened them. They all spoke about the scarcity of food and medicine, and had experienced increasingly severe crackdowns and punishments. They even shared many of the same hopes and fears. <br/>But there were also illuminating differences. It appeared there was more government support in the capital Pyongyang than in the border towns, but also more control, surveillance and fear there - which was in line with what we had expected.  <br/>Our next step was to take our interviews to NK Pro, a news service in Seoul which monitors North Korea. One of the only remaining sources of information on North Korea is the country's own state-run newspaper and TV channel. While much of the content is propaganda, NK Pro's state media expert Chung Seung-yeon monitors this daily, combing it for clues as to what is really happening in the country.  <br/>\"We think of North Korea as a very secret state. Certainly, they never speak loudly about their problems, but they drop hints,\" she said. And when they actually mention a problem, as they have done with the food crisis, this means it's \"a really big deal\", she explained.  <br/>She showed us one news report from February in which North Korean party members were praised for donating rice to the government. \"That the state is receiving grain from its people, shows us how desperate the food situation is,\" she pointed out.  <br/>With Ms Chung's help we were also able to confirm many of the quarantine and lockdown rules our interviewees had cited, and the new laws and punishments that had been introduced. <br/>To corroborate other details, we analysed the available data on food prices and trade, and viewed satellite images of the border. We combed the texts of new laws that had been smuggled out the country, while cross-referencing our interviews with reports from the South Korean government, the UN, and other sources, until we were confident that our interviews - while not comprehensive - provided reliable snapshots of life in North Korea.  <br/>As much as we have published, there are many details we have held back, to protect our interviewees. But through their bravery, we know so much more about the situation in North Korea than we did before.  <br/>\"The world has not realised how bad things are for the North Korean people right now,\" said Sokeel Park. \"These interviewees are not the full picture. In future years, we'll probably learn in depth just how difficult this period has been,\" he said.  <br/>When we last checked in with our interviewees, through Daily NK, they were all safe. <br/>In depth: Read the full BBC investigation<br/>North Korean experts on what BBC testimony tells us<br/>African leaders tour Kyiv after air raid alert<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Greece denies coastguard rope led to boat tragedy<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

We will not allow dirty oil from an Arab country to destroy our pristine environment,\" says Manasi Bole.<br/>She is among thousands of people protesting plans to acquire an expansive laterite plateau - flanked by cliffside fishing villages, mango orchards and ancient petroglyphs - to build the world's largest petrochemical refinery in western India's ecologically fragile Konkan belt. <br/>In late April, angry protests erupted in Ratnagiri district of the western Indian state of Maharashtra when authorities began testing the soil for the mega project to be built by a consortium of Indian state-run oil majors and global giants Saudi Aramco and Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC).<br/>Thousands of villagers, led by women, braved the intense summer temperatures and lay on the roads to prevent officials from entering the site. Many others shaved their heads and went on a hunger strike to mark their dissent. <br/>Click here to watch a video about the protests<br/>When talks with the villagers proved unsuccessful, police imposed a curfew on their movement and used batons and teargas to disperse the protesters. Women protesters and anti-refinery activists were detained, some for several days. <br/>Across the region, there's now simmering discontent over what villagers allege were \"undemocratic and coercive\" tactics by authorities to saddle them with a mammoth industrial project they've vehemently opposed for nearly a decade.  <br/>Across the villages we travelled to, there was anxiety about the refinery.<br/>\"They say the plateau is a barren wasteland, but it's a source of water for our springs, a place where we go to forage for berries, and grow vegetables\" Ms Bole said. <br/>Aboard his trawler boat, fisherman Imtiaz Bhatkar said he was worried about losing his livelihood every day because of the proposed refinery.  <br/>\"We won't be allowed to fish in a 10km (6.2 mile) radius because the crude tankers will be moored at sea,\" Mr Bhatkar said. \"Nearly 30,000 to 40,000 people - local and from outside - depend on fishing in just this one village. What will they do?\" <br/>Mango growers in the region - famed for the prized Alphonso mangoes - told us the slightest air pollution and deforestation would severely damage their yields given how sensitive the Alphonso variety is to the vagaries of wind and weather patterns. <br/>Successive state governments in Maharashtra have been expedient in their stance on the refinery. They have supported it when in power and challenged it when in opposition. <br/>Initially planned as a $40bn (\u00a331.6bn) venture, the size of the 60m-tonne-per-annum project has had to be cut by a third because of the long delays in getting it off the ground. <br/>The project was first announced in 2015 to be built in Nanar village, a few kilometres away from the current site in Barsu village in Ratnagiri. The plans were scrapped after it met with stiff opposition from the residents of Nanar, its village council and environmental groups. <br/>The state's previous chief minister Uddhav Thackeray revived it last year, proposing Barsu as the new site. <br/>But out of power now, he has changed his view in support of the locals.  <br/>The present-day government - which comprises of a splintered faction of Mr Thackeray's party and the BJP - says resistance to the project is politically motivated<br/>\"This is a non-polluting green refinery. As the industries minister, it is my job to clear the misunderstandings of people who are being misled by external forces,\" Uday Samant, a state minister told the BBC. <br/>Contrary to widespread claims, there will be no damage to the petroglyphs - or rock carvings - in the region which are now part of UNESCO's tentative world heritage list, he said.<br/>Mr Samant also claimed the government has already acquired 3,000 of the 5,000 acres of land on which the refinery will be built. <br/>What the BBC saw on the ground, however, belied some of his assertions. <br/>The soil testing for the project, for instance, took place barely a few metres away from some of the 170 petroglyphs on the plateau. Letters of objection from at least six local village councils were brushed aside by authorities, saying people from these hamlets didn't own the land on which the refinery would come up. <br/>But locals say they were conned into selling land parcels at throwaway prices to investors - some of which included politicians, police officials and civil servants - without being informed that it would be given away for a refinery project. <br/>\"The government is allowing the fate of this region to be decided by 200 investors rather than by its people,\" said Satyajit Chavan, an anti-refinery activist who spent six nights in jail for social media posts urging residents of the region to join in the protests. <br/>Divisions over the refinery have been drawn on several lines in this tropical idyll, including geography, class and ideological leanings. <br/>Away from the rural interiors, in the town of Rajapur, Suraj Pednekar, a small business owner, insisted the project will vastly improve the fate of Ratnagiri district, an industrial laggard in the country's richest province. <br/>The government's own estimates suggest Maharashtra's GDP will get a 8.5% boost. <br/>\"Entire generations of young men and women have to go to Mumbai and Pune every year to make a living,\" Mr Pednekar said. \"Villages are being emptied out because there are no jobs. If we get the refinery here and it employs 50,000 people, the population will go up and it will help local businesses. Why should we resist that?\"<br/>His views are echoed by several others in the bigger towns whose traditional livelihoods will not be directly affected by the project. But they are drowned out by villagers. <br/>\"These so-called jobs will go to educated graduates, not the local fishermen. We don't need such jobs,\" said Mr Bhatkar. <br/>According to Ms Bole, even if the locals are given work, it will be lower level jobs of sweepers or watchmen.<br/>Across the state, there appears to be growing support for this people's fight. <br/>At a meeting in Pune city recently, local writers, poets, activists and resistance groups vowed to galvanise massive crowds to mount pressure on authorities to scrap the project. <br/>\"Our campaign will focus on urging people to not vote for politicians or political parties who are in favour of the refinery,\" Mr Chavan told the BBC.<br/>From Enron in the 1990s to an attempt by the French to construct a now stalled nuclear power plant here in the early 2000s to various major industrial proposals by Indian conglomerates like the Reliance Group and the Tata Group, over the years, local resistance groups have made several behemoths retreat from the Konkan. <br/>Whether or not the proposed refinery meets the same fate remains to be seen. But crowd after crowd of local villagers told us they will fight till their very last breath till it goes away. <br/>Yet again, it appears, this region has become a faultline between India's economic ambitions and the ecological sensitivities of its people. <br/>BBC News India is now on YouTube.

Thousands of people were swept away, and many bodies were never recovered. Ten years after the disaster, Ram Karan Beniwal - who was in the temple town of Kedarnath, one of the worst-affected areas - recalls the day the floods tore apart his family.<br/>On 9 June 2013, my wife and I and five others (my two brothers, their wives and one more relative) left for Kedarnath from our home town of Jodhpur in Rajasthan. My children were busy with studies and work and decided not to join us. <br/>My wife Chhota Devi and I had already visited three of the four main Dhams (the four Hindu pilgrimage sites of Kedarnath, Badrinath, Yamunotri and Gangotri) earlier. Kedarnath was the only one left.<br/>On 16 June, we reached the holy Kedarnath temple. After praying there, we headed down to Rambara (a small village that serves as a resting place for devotees). On our way there, it started raining heavily. We reached Rambara at 17:00 local time (11:30 GMT) and decided to spend the night there.<br/>Click here to watch Ram Karan Beniwal narrate his story<br/>Late in the night, we were sitting by the Alaknanda river (on the foothills of the Himalayas), chanting the name of Lord Ram. Suddenly, I heard loud noises from the river and rocks nearby.<br/>It felt like the mountain began to tremble. It was pitch dark, so we couldn't see clearly. Then huge boulders started rolling down, sweeping people into the violently flowing river. <br/>I saw my wife and one of my sisters-in-law being swept away, followed by my elder brother. I couldn't see my other relatives. I ran and stood by a large boulder, which protected me from the avalanche of rocks coming from the top. <br/>I noticed that the hills with large trees on them weren't crumbling as quickly as the ones that were rocky and barren. I quickly ran up one of these hills and clung on to the branch of a tree. From a distance, I saw an entire mountain dissolve into the river in front of my eyes. <br/>That is when my mind went numb. I couldn't process what I just saw. It was freezing cold, and my clothes were wet. There were other people around me, also holding on to trees. But no one spoke a word. Everyone was gloomy and desolate. I dislocated my shoulder while hanging on to the tree, but I just put it back into place. It hurts even today.<br/>I sat on the tree for the next four days as the floods and landslides continued. I saw people around me who had huddled near trees die of starvation, dehydration and the cold. All the mobile towers had washed away. There was no communication with the outside world. In my mind, I was convinced that there was no way I would survive. Only god could help me now.<br/>On 20 June, a rescue helicopter arrived. The crew would rescue five people at a time, as and when the weather permitted. The helicopter took me to Guptkashi (a town near Kedarnath) where I changed choppers to reach Dehradun (capital of Uttarakhand). There, I was admitted to a hospital. <br/>I was very weak after days of staying wet with no food and water. My skin was damaged and peeling off. I finally managed to contact my daughter, who hung up the phone the moment I told her that I was the only one left. A day later, my brother-in-law and nephew came to Dehradun to pick me up.<br/>No one can replace the void a mother leaves, but my children were glad that at least I was back home. The bodies of my wife and the others were never found. <br/>Initially, my children were in denial, thinking that their mother may have survived somehow. They were still hopeful that she would return home one day. But I was convinced of what I had seen, and my children also came to terms with reality over time. <br/>Ten years later, I look back at the destruction and loss of life and property that happened. So many tourists, pilgrims and locals lost their lives. I still remember the parking lot in Gaurikund (the starting point of the trek to the Kedarnath shrine) where almost 5,000 cars were parked, including ours with all our belongings. We lost everything.<br/>It was a natural disaster and god's will. I think of it as a train journey where everyone chats through the journey, but has to get down when the station arrives. Maybe Kedarnath was my wife's final station. <br/>I now spend my time meditating and chanting god's name to distract myself. If you ask me whether I would go to Kedarnath again, the answer would be an emphatic yes. There is no point in living with fear, and there is no fear now. In fact, I would take my children there as well.<br/>As told to Devang Shah<br/>BBC News India is now on YouTube.

But it's still not clear which countries will be willing to provide the jets, how many, or even when.<br/>Supplying Ukraine with F-16 fighter jets will \"not be a silver bullet\" or a \"quick fix\", says the head of Norway's Air Force. Maj Gen Rolf Folland says it'll take time for Ukraine to develop the ability to operate Western jets with complex weapons. <br/>We meet at a large allied air exercise taking place over Norway, Finland and Sweden. It involves 150 fighter planes - many more than the entire Ukrainian Air Force. <br/>Gen Folland says the training is about dominating the skies - to avoid what he calls the type of \"old fashioned\" conflict now taking place in Ukraine. <br/>To gain supremacy of the air requires a level of scale and sophistication that Ukraine will not be able to replicate. Even providing a small fleet of F-16s could prove a major challenge.<br/>It took Pulse, a Belgian pilot, three years to master his F-16 fighter. We've been asked to use his call sign, not his real name. <br/>He shows us round his F-16, originally designed in the late 1970s, long before he was born.<br/>\"It flies like a dream\", he says. \"But flying is the easiest part. The rest is more difficult.\" <br/>That includes learning to operate the F-16's radar, sensors and weapons. Ukraine, which currently has more pilots than aircraft, is hoping to compress that training into months.<br/>Pulse sees the logic of providing Western jets to Ukraine. He points to his F-16's weapons: air-to-air missiles to destroy enemy aircraft, and bombs to hit targets on the ground. \"That's important,\" says Pulse, \"because you can use any weapons from Nato stocks with this jet.\"<br/>But then there's the question of maintaining the jets. <br/>The Norwegian Air Force, like others in Europe, has transitioned to the more modern F-35. So in theory there should be F-16s available for Ukraine. <br/>At Orland air base they use two of their old F-16s to train aircraft engineers. That can take a year - even longer for a senior aircraft technician. <br/>\"You can't just hand over a fighter aircraft and say off you go!\" Col Martin Tesli, the base commander and a former F-16 pilot, says. <br/>He says there's a large logistical tail - spare parts, software and weapons. But he too understands the need to modernise Ukraine's fleet of old Soviet-era jets. <br/>\"At a certain point, if they're not provided with another aircraft, they won't have an air force to defend themselves.\"<br/>Justin Bronk of the Royal United Services Institute says Ukraine would probably need the help of Western contractors to keep any F-16s flying. The obvious question, is what country is willing to accept the obvious risks of putting their own people on the ground? <br/>Professor Bronk adds that Russia is only more likely to target Ukraine's air bases if it's supplied with Western jets. That's a danger for the single engine F-16, which has a large intake that can suck up debris from the runway.<br/>These are good reasons why the US has, for so long, resisted pressure from Ukraine to provide F-16s. It's less about fears of escalation, and more about the practicalities of operating and maintaining the jets. The Pentagon has warned it'll be both complex and costly.<br/>Nor is providing Ukraine with Western fighters likely to significantly alter the battle on the ground. <br/>Lt Col Neils Van Hussen, a former F-16 pilot of the Royal Netherlands Air Force, says \"not a single weapons system will change a big war\". F-16s, he believes, would simply give Ukraine \"the ability to sustain what they're doing now\". <br/>The reality of this war is that even Russia, with its sizeable air force, has not been able to dominate the skies. Ground-based air defence systems are helping to prevent that from happening.<br/>Providing Ukraine with more air defences will continue to be the immediate priority for the West.

Let me suggest to you that in putting him back in the White House, the re-runs will be worse than the original show.\"<br/>Mr Christie served two terms as New Jersey governor from 2010-18. His time in office was overshadowed by a political scandal involving bridge lane closures - part of an alleged political vendetta against a Democratic mayor. <br/>Before being elected as governor, Mr Christie served as New Jersey's top prosecutor under President George W Bush from 2002-08.<br/>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has worked hard to emulate Mr Trump, and is viewed as the candidate most capable of defeating him in a head-to-head race.<br/>Boosted to the governorship by Mr Trump's endorsement, he romped to re-election in last year's midterms by more than 1.5 million votes, the largest margin in the state in more than four decades.

I'm angry,\" Cheryl's brother Ricki told the BBC's Jon Kay at the time, for the podcast Fairy Meadow.<br/>But Australian police continued to investigate, and in 2020 the NSW government increased its reward for information to A$1m (\u00a3540,000; $680,000).<br/>Now the Grimmer family have sent a letter to Mr Speakman's successor, Michael Daley, asking him to look again at the judge's decision. The BBC has approached Mr Daley's office for comment. <br/>The Grimmer family had only just moved to Australia from the UK when Cheryl disappeared. She was last seen in showers near the beach, where she had spent the afternoon with her mother and three older brothers.<br/>Witnesses at the time reported seeing an unknown male carrying a child wrapped in a towel towards the beach car park.<br/>Cheryl Grimmer's family are determined to get her case back into court. <br/>Fifty-three years after she disappeared, her brother Ricki still devotes hours every day to what he calls his campaign for justice. Researching, emailing, cold-calling anyone who he thinks might be able to help. <br/>Ricki has told me with heart-breaking honesty that he remains \"haunted\" by what happened to his sister. He says he will not rest until he feels he has achieved justice for her.<br/>Cheryl vanished from the changing rooms at Fairy Meadow when Ricki was looking after her. He was only seven at the time. <br/>The family believes that the recent change in state government in New South Wales - and the appointment of a new attorney general - might create an opportunity for the case to be examined and reviewed with fresh eyes. <br/>In dismissing the 2019 case, Justice Robert Allan Hulme said the teenage suspect had no guardian or lawyer present during the 1971 police interview. <br/>He described the boy as of \"low average intelligence\" and \"more vulnerable than the average 17-year-old as a result of his disturbed upbringing\".<br/>But the Grimmer family say that decision gave no consideration to \"the victim of the crime\", and describe the omission of Cheryl's name from the judgement as \"something that sickens the family\". <br/>\"I would suggest that this sits very awkwardly against Australia's obligations under human rights instruments,\" says the letter signed by Michael Grimmer, Cheryl's cousin.<br/>The family says details in the confession were \"corroborated during a 2016-17 reinvestigation\".<br/>The letter calls on Attorney General Daley to allow an application to the NSW Supreme Court for a fresh inquest, and to lift media restrictions preventing the previous suspect's name being published to prompt other possible witnesses to come forward. <br/>You can stream or download the Fairy Meadow podcast on BBC Sounds.<br/>African leaders tour Kyiv after air raid alert<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Greece denies coastguard rope led to boat tragedy<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Little known until recently, his popularity now rivals that of President Volodymyr Zelensky.<br/>Gen Zaluzhny, or \"our Valera\" as friends and old classmates like to call him, was appointed commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian military in July 2021. <br/>Those who know him well say the appointment, pushed through personally by President Zelensky, came as a surprise to the general and many others too as his  promotion involved climbing several steps on the career ladder. <br/>Zaluzhny was already known as an ambitious and modern commander, but also an unpretentious man who liked to joke with his subordinates and didn't put on airs. <br/>Within seven months he was leading Ukraine's defence against full-scale invasion. <br/>By 26 February 2022 it was clear that Russian troops were failing to \"take Kyiv in three days\", which had initially seemed a likely outcome. <br/>But the reality remained grim and Ukrainian authorities were calling on the public not to panic. Russian troops were advancing in the north, east and south of Ukraine and posed a considerable threat to the capital.<br/>One idea floating among Ukraine's top officials was to start blowing up bridges near Kyiv over the vast Dnipro river, to prevent the Russians crossing from the eastern left bank to the western right bank, where, among other strategic objects, the government quarter was situated. <br/>They phoned Gen Zaluzhny for his view. \"Under no circumstances are we to do that,\" he is reported to have replied, at the time sitting in a smoke-filled bunker with other top brass. <br/>\"This will be a betrayal of both civilians and the military remaining on the eastern bank.\" <br/>The BBC has heard matching accounts from two sources involved in the episode that indicate this is what happened.<br/>Many other crucial decisions followed and by early April 2022 Ukrainian troops pushed the Russian army back to the north and east of Kyiv.<br/>Born into the family of a Soviet serviceman, Valery Zaluzhny once said he was always committed to distancing himself from the excessive hierarchy of the Soviet Army. <br/>By the time he went to military school in the mid-1990s Ukraine was already an independent state. <br/>While his textbooks at military college may have dated back to the Soviet era, he learnt about the reality of war first-hand. In 2014 he was appointed a deputy commander in an area of eastern Ukraine where the conflict with separatists, backed by the Russian army, was getting under way.<br/>Colleagues we spoke to say that from the onset of his career he was keen on building relationships of trust with his subordinates as well as delegating command decisions.<br/>Zaluzhny's former aide who was by his side in the first days of the Russian invasion, Lyudmyla Dolhonovska, told the BBC he barely slept and kept in touch with military staff on the frontline. <br/>\"He spoke on the phone to his generals a lot, but the conversations were always focused and calm,\" she said.<br/>Analysts say the flexibility shown by Ukrainian units with junior officers able to make decisions on the battlefield gave them a considerable advantage over the top-heavy decision-making structures of the Russian army. <br/>Some sources in the Ukrainian military even go as far as to say that it is the decisive commanders on the ground who are collectively responsible for Ukraine's successes, while Gen Zaluzhny should only be credited with leaving them with the freedom to operate.<br/>As the war ground on, President Zelensky played a key role in maintaining the morale of the Ukrainian public through his nightly addresses. <br/>He pushed an image of strong governance while exerting pressure on foreign partners for financial and military support. <br/>Gen Zaluzhny's focus was on getting military strategy right.<br/>After successful advances in late summer and early autumn, Ukrainian troops liberated large swathes of the Ukrainian territory in the east and south.<br/>The commander-in-chief became a national hero, despite being rarely seen in public and even more rarely agreeing to interviews.<br/>His name became synonymous with bravery and determination, and his reputation spawned anecdotes and turns of phrase.<br/>\"When Zaluzhny walks into an unlit room, he doesn't switch on the light, he switches off the darkness,\" one such phrase went.<br/>His popularity ratings drew level with Zelensky's, and conspiracy theorists began speculating on a possible rift between them.<br/>There was talk of Zelensky replacing Zaluzhny as military chief or even of Zaluzhny challenging the president's political leadership.<br/> So far, neither has happened.<br/>A source in the presidential administration told the BBC that \"President Zelensky simply has no time for such jealousy as he is 102% preoccupied with getting military support for Ukraine from its partners\".<br/>The two men appear quite happy to let each other get with their jobs. <br/>Gen Zaluzhny told Time magazine last June that he did not bother to explain to Mr Zelensky all the minute details of military strategy.<br/>\"He doesn't need to understand military affairs any more than he needs to know about medicine or bridge-building.\" <br/>Political analysts and sociologists have told the BBC that Zaluzhny's popularity is natural in the current situation where Ukrainians need ways to boost morale. They also highlight his human touch. <br/>Once he turned up at a wedding of a soldier forced to delay the ceremony because he had been sent to the front line at Bakhmut. Eventually the soldier was given a short period of leave to get the chance to marry his fianc\u00e9e.<br/>As talk of a forthcoming Ukrainian offensive intensified, Russian military bloggers began circulating rumours in mid-May that Gen Zaluzhny had been critically wounded or even killed. <br/>This was picked up by Russian foreign intelligence chief Sergei Naryshkin who said: \"Naturally, we have all information about the state of health of the commander of the Ukrainian Army but we will not disclose it.\"<br/>Col Anatoly Shtefan, who is close to Gen Zaluzhny, said that while Ukraine's top brass poked fun at the rumours -  which they described as the \"height of Russian propaganda madness\" - it was clear that Ukrainians were starting to worry too. <br/>At the beginning of June, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence published several photos of Gen Zaluzhny attending a military ceremony in Kyiv. <br/>For now Valery Zaluzhny's hero status among Ukrainians is secure, but with so many pinning their hopes on the commander-in-chief the future is likely to be complicated. <br/>Even if the defence of Ukraine ultimately succeeds, Ukraine will face a harsh reality, warns sociologist Oleksiy Antypovych, and Zaluzhny may choose to steer clear of politics.<br/>\"It is highly likely that after the war Ukraine will face a severe economic crisis, if not a complete collapse. It will be a completely different ball game.\"<br/>Political analyst Mykola Davydiuk believes that if the military chief were to move into politics, he might succeed. <br/>\"While Zelensky is a leader who didn't abandon Ukrainians, Zaluzhny was the one who defended them. It's an organic narrative for him and there is a demand for it in our society.\"<br/>The BBC asked Gen Zaluzhny for an interview.

For several months, he's been at the centre of India's biggest sporting row.<br/>The allegations against him are grave. Some of India's top wrestlers, including Olympic medallists and world champions, accuse him of sexually harassing female athletes and have held months of protests demanding his arrest. <br/>Mr Singh, who until recently had been the chief of the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) for the past 12 years, has denied the allegations. He accuses the wrestlers of being \"politically motivated\" and recently said he would \"hang himself even if a single allegation is proved\" against him. <br/>After months of headline-making protests by wrestlers - and a nudge from the Supreme Court - police in the capital Delhi registered two cases against him in April. Seven female wrestlers told the police that he had molested and groped them at training camps and tournaments. <br/>As one of them is a minor, police invoked the stringent Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act. In the past few days, reports say the minor has withdrawn her allegations. Wrestler Sakshi Malik told the BBC she believed \"the player was pressurised into withdrawing the charges\". Mr Singh refused to comment on the allegation, saying \"let law take its course\".<br/>Lawyer Akshat Bajpai says most people charged under Pocso are immediately arrested - but six weeks later, police are yet to act against Mr Singh. <br/>Although the government denies shielding him, the protesters and opposition politicians allege that the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi is giving him a long rope because of political expediency. <br/>Born on 8 January 1957 in Gonda district in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, the six-term MP claims substantial support in a number of parliamentary constituencies and analysts say with general elections due next year, he is expected to play a pivotal role. <br/>But Sharat Pradhan, senior journalist in the state capital Lucknow, says Mr Singh is never far from controversy and the 66-year-old is often in the news for the wrong reasons.<br/>A 2021 video that has resurfaced on social media in recent months shows him hitting a young under-15 wrestler on stage for \"misbehaving\". And last year, he bragged on camera that he had murdered a man who had killed his friend Ravinder Singh. \"Whatever people say, let me tell you that I have committed one murder,\" he told the reporter. \"I put a rifle to [his] back and shot him. He died.\" <br/>Mr Singh was neither censured for his violent outburst against the young athlete nor was he arrested or charged for murder despite his confession.<br/>Also, these were not the only times Mr Singh fell foul of the law - although he has never been convicted, he was named in more than three dozen cases amid accusations of theft, rioting, attempt to murder and kidnapping. <br/>Mr Singh, who studied law in college and participated in wrestling competitions in his youth, became politically active while a student and joined the BJP in 1988. He was elected to parliament in 1991.<br/>He first came into prominence for aggressively participating in the BJP's movement for the construction of a temple in the town of Ayodhya. Along with several party leaders and workers, he was named as an accused in the December 1992 demolition of the 16th-Century Babri Mosque. Years later, they were all absolved. <br/>But a few months before the 1996 elections, Mr Singh was arrested on charges of sheltering some associates of Dawood Ibrahim, India's \"most wanted man\" who was charged with masterminding the 1993 deadly Mumbai bombings. <br/>According to court documents, Mr Singh had accommodated the criminals in his official Delhi home and had even lent them his phone to speak to the underworld don. He spent nearly three months in jail under TADA, the stringent Terrorist and Disruptive Activities Act, although he was finally cleared for a lack of evidence. <br/>In the 2004 parliamentary elections, when the BJP candidate from Gonda, Ghanshyam Shukla, died in a road crash on the day of voting, many called it a murder and blamed it on Mr Singh. A decade later, in an interview with news website Scroll, Mr Singh confirmed that even Atal Bihari Vajpayee - BJP leader and then prime minister - had accused him of murder, but added that the rumour was started by his opponents.<br/>In 2008 when the BJP expelled him for not following the party whip in a key vote in parliament, he cosied up to the regional Samajwadi Party leader Mulayam Singh Yadav, and won a seat for the party in the 2009 elections. But before the next elections in 2014, he was back with the BJP - badmouthing Mr Yadav. He won, and was re-elected in 2019.<br/>Despite the controversy surrounding him at present, Mr Singh insists that he will contest next year's elections.<br/>Last Sunday, he addressed a rally - his first since the allegations - in his home town where he arrived in a huge convoy, leading a 25km-roadshow that was seen as a show of strength by analysts.<br/>As local party leaders fawned over him, a female party colleague called him \"the pride of the region\" and an \"inspiration for the youth\".<br/>In Gonda and some of the adjoining districts, where Mr Singh and his family own and run more than 50 schools and colleges, he enjoys tremendous popularity. <br/>When BBC Hindi's Anant Zhanane recently visited one of the colleges to ask the students about allegations against Mr Singh, they started shouting slogans hailing him.<br/>\"He's our guardian, a messiah for the poor. We will be with him for life,\" said Sonu Tiwari. Another student Vishwajeet Kumar Singh said the MP \"lives in my heart, he's my god\".<br/>Mr Pradhan says, \"Singh is cast in the same mould as mafia don-turned-politicians Atiq Ahmad [who was recently killed on live TV] or Mukhtar Ansari. He wields influence among those he helps and tries intimidation to control others.\" <br/>But, he believes, that his influence may be over-rated.<br/>\"The talk of him being able to deliver four-five seats for the BJP in the next elections is exaggerated. He's formidable at present because he has the BJP's backing. The moment the BJP cuts him off, his power would begin to wane.\" <br/>And that, he says, would very likely happen soon. The wrestlers' protests have made global headlines and after a number of medal-winners were dragged through the streets last month when they tried to march on parliament, even the International Olympic Committee weighed in, calling on India to ensure the safety of athletes and carry out a fair investigation.<br/>\"Dropping Mr Singh may not help the BJP in undoing the damage already done to India's reputation,\" Mr Pradhan says, \"but it may contain it from getting worse.\"<br/>BBC News India is now on YouTube.

How do their cases differ?<br/>Mr Trump is in the deepest trouble. He has been indicted on 37 charges related to files found at his Florida home. <br/>His supporters are pointing to the examples of Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton as a double standard applied to Democratic politicians.<br/>This is how all these cases compare.<br/>More than 325 classified files - including some marked with Secret and Top Secret designations - were discovered over the course of last year at Mr Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate.<br/>Aides to Joe Biden discovered classified documents in Washington and at his Delaware home.<br/>Former Vice-President Mike Pence also made headlines when documents were found unsecured at his home in Indiana. The US Department of Justice told him recently they are not pursuing charges.<br/>Those three discoveries were within a few months of each but the classified material saga concerning Hillary Clinton goes back a few years.<br/>She used a personal email address while working as secretary of state from 2009-13 under President Barack Obama. This meant some classified material was shared on her server at home, which was unsecured.<br/>The National Archives initiated contact with Mr Trump's office after determining that it did not have possession of some notable records from his presidential term.<br/>The former president's team provided some material but the archivists did not believe they had been fully co-operative. <br/>That set in motion the FBI inquiry that led to a surprise search of the Mar-a-Lago estate and the discovery of more than 100 additional documents.<br/>Mr Biden's personal lawyers discovered his classified documents as they were moving his stuff out of an office he used at a think tank in Washington. <br/>The following day, they turned what they found over to the National Archives and the FBI conducted their own search and found more. A second trove was found a few weeks later at his Delaware home. <br/>Mrs Clinton's use of a private email first came to light in March 2016 after she had quit her job as secretary of state to run for president.<br/>Her team handed over nearly 60,000 pages of emails but also deleted more than 30,000 emails they said were deemed to be personal in nature.<br/>Mr Trump and Mr Biden both have a special counsel looking deeper into what they did wrong.<br/>Under the Presidential Records Act, White House records are supposed to go to the National Archives once an administration ends. Regulations require such files to be stored securely.<br/>Jack Smith, a former war crimes prosecutor, has brought an indictment against the former president, who faces dozens of counts of unauthorised possession of classified material, obstruction of justice, concealing documents and making false statements to law enforcement<br/>A Trump-appointed prosecutor Robert Hur is looking into the Biden case, which is still ongoing.<br/>The FBI described Mrs Clinton's actions as careless but said there was no case for a \"reasonable prosecutor\" to bring.<br/>Mr Pence was told last week by the US justice department that they are not pursuing charges.<br/>According to the indictment, the documents found at Mr Trump's Florida home were highly sensitive.<br/>They include details of US nuclear weapons programmes, the potential vulnerabilities of the US and its allies, and US plans for retaliatory military attacks.<br/>They were found in boxes in various rooms in Mar-a-Lago, including a storage room, two ballrooms and a bathroom, tucked between a shower and a toilet.<br/>The documents discovered in Mr Biden's office were marked \"sensitive compartmented information\", according to CNN, indicating the material could involve intelligence-gathering methods and sources. <br/>They reportedly included information about Ukraine, Iran and the UK and dated from his time as vice-president and, before that, senator.<br/>The FBI said there were 113 Clinton emails which contained classified information but they did not reveal the nature of them.<br/>There are 31 counts against the former president of \"wilful retention of national defence information\".<br/>This means prosecutors believe he knew that what he was doing was unlawful, and they have recordings of him apparently speaking about that and the testimony of witnesses.<br/>It also alleges that he showed some of this material to people without the required security clearances.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: How much do you know about classified documents?<br/>In the Clinton case, FBI Director James Comey decided after an investigation that she had been careless in using a private server but it was not intentional.<br/>Mr Trump is also accused of obstructing the investigation. But he says Mrs Clinton destroyed evidence and points to the deleted emails. At one press conference, he even urged Russia to find them.<br/>In Mr Comey's view there was no cover-up, even though an FBI investigation found many of the deleted emails were work-related.<br/>Not enough is yet known about the investigation into President Biden to make a comparison.<br/>Mr Trump has accused the FBI and the justice department of pursuing a politically motivated investigation in an effort to prevent him from running for the White House again.<br/>Mrs Clinton testified to Congress about her email server as part of the Benghazi hearings, and it came up regularly during the 2016 election campaign.<br/>She said she fully complied with the investigation and handed over all work-related emails after her team had gone through a \"thorough process\".<br/>Mr Biden, for his part, said Mr Trump's handling was \"totally irresponsible\" after the news first emerged, opening himself up to accusations of hypocrisy weeks later.<br/>The president has said he was \"surprised\" there were sensitive documents at his former office and that he is co-operating fully with the review. <br/>Mr Pence always maintained the documents had ended up at his home \"inadvertently\" but he had taken full responsibility for the mistake.<br/>Biden 'surprised' about classified files discovery<br/>Could Donald Trump go to prison over secret files?<br/>Donald Trump took US nuclear secrets, charges say<br/>Is this indictment a threat to Trump's 2024 campaign?<br/>African leaders tour Kyiv after air raid alert<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Greece denies coastguard rope led to boat tragedy<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

He was arraigned in April in New York on charges that he falsified business records for a 2016 hush-money payment to a porn star. But that is a state-level case and much less serious than the one he is now facing.<br/>Florida officials are bracing for protests from supporters and opponents. <br/>The former president spent Monday night at the Trump National Doral, a hotel and resort in the Miami area.<br/>Accompanied by Secret Service officers, he is expected to travel in a motorcade from the hotel to the Wilkie D Ferguson court, where his arraignment is scheduled for around 15:00 local time (19:00 GMT). The court is about 11 miles (18km) from the hotel. <br/>The entire hearing is set to last about an hour, after which Trump will fly back to his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, on board his plane, Trump Force One.<br/>He is scheduled to give remarks there at 20:15 (00:15 GMT), shortly after landing.  <br/>Mr Trump will have the charges read to him, and he is expected to enter a plea of not guilty. <br/>One of his lawyers, Alina Habba - who is not representing him in this case - told Fox News the former president will \"never admit guilt\".<br/>The judge is expected to release the former president \"on his own recognizance\", meaning he will be freed without having to pay a bail bond, to return to court at a later date. <br/>Various procedural issues are likely to be addressed, although it is thought unlikely that a trial date will be set. <br/>Mr Trump will not be subjected to the humiliation of a booking photo. <br/>But fingerprints and a DNA swab are expected to be taken from him, a requirement of all defendants in the federal court system, according to the BBC's US partner CBS News. <br/>At his earlier court appearance to face state charges in New York in April, Mr Trump was only fingerprinted. <br/>The US public is unlikely to see Mr Trump during the court appearance, as cameras are not permitted in federal courts. <br/>The initial stages of this case have been assigned to Judge Aileen Cannon, whom Mr Trump appointed in 2020 while he was president.<br/>Last summer Judge Cannon granted a request by Mr Trump's legal team to grant a review of the files at the centre of this case. An appeals court later overturned her decision. <br/>The 42-year-old, who was born in Colombia and now resides in Florida, is a graduate of Duke University and The University of Michigan Law School, where she was an articles editor for the school's Journal of Law Reform publication.<br/>Dozens of his supporters gathered outside his hotel on Monday, to greet his arrival and express their support. The BBC's Nomia Iqbal, who was also there, said some carried huge flags and there were cars and motorbikes bearing Trump slogans.<br/>Security will be extremely tight in and around the court. Miami Police Chief Manuel Morales said on Monday they would deploy enough resources to handle a crowd of up to 50,000 people if necessary and ensure Miami is kept \"safe and secure\". <br/>Mr Trump is expected to enter the building through an underground tunnel, avoiding both the anticipated crowds of supporters and counter-demonstrators and the media outside.<br/>In an interview on WABC radio after the indictment, Mr Trump urged supporters to demonstrate. <br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Trump's court appearance explained in 90 seconds<br/>\"Look, our country has to protest,\" he said. \"We have plenty of protest to protest. We've lost everything.\" <br/>A number of other Trump supporters have also called for demonstrations. Former Arizona gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake vowed that prosecutors would have to \"go through me, and 75 million Americans just like me\".<br/>Miami Mayor Francis Suarez said on Monday that the city would facilitate any protests. <br/>\"But we also believe in law and order,\" he added, \"and we know that and we hope that tomorrow will be peaceful.\" <br/>Has Trump put US national security at risk?<br/>Trump arrives in Florida ahead of court appearance<br/>Trump aide indicted in classified documents case<br/>African leaders tour Kyiv after air raid alert<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Greece denies coastguard rope led to boat tragedy<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

He was released alongside Mr Trump without having to post bond and was ordered not to talk to other witnesses.<br/>According to the indictment, Mr Trump directed his aide to move boxes that were a focus of the investigation from a storage room at the Mar-a-Lago resort. He was allegedly told to conceal them from Mr Trump's attorney and the FBI.<br/>Prosecutors have said Mr Nauta can be seen on surveillance video removing the boxes from the storage room ahead of an imminent search of the Palm Beach property, and later moving some of them back - one of at least five times he moved boxes in and out of the room.<br/>They further allege that, in a May 2022 interview with the FBI, Mr Nauta lied that he did not know how the boxes had arrived on site, where they were being stored or whether Mr Trump had intentionally kept any.<br/>On his Truth Social platform on Friday, the former president defended Mr Nauta and accused officials at the US Department of Justice of \"trying to destroy his life\" and \"hoping that he will say bad things about 'Trump'\". <br/>Born in Agat, in the US territory of Guam, Waltine Torre Nauta enlisted in the US Navy in 2001.<br/>Navy records show he ascended through the ranks to become a Senior Chief Culinary Specialist, in 2021.<br/>By then, he had been serving in the military-staffed cafeteria for the Trump White House.<br/>The president later elevated him to a role as his military aide, a position similar to a personal valet and sometimes referred to as a \"body-man\".<br/>Mr Nauta retired from the Navy when Mr Trump left the White House. According to the indictment, he became an executive assistant to Mr Trump in August 2021.<br/>Unlike other aides, who sought to remain in Washington DC after Mr Trump lost the 2020 election, Mr Nauta relocated to Florida and continued to serve as an aide to the former president at Mar-a-Lago. <br/>He has been described as a low-key but constant presence in the Trump White House, and a trusted, well-liked aide in Mr Trump's post-presidential orbit.<br/>The New York Times reported that Mr Nauta is viewed as a Trump loyalist and does not appear to be playing a \"side game\" in exchange for prosecutorial leniency.<br/>When the BBC contacted some of Mr Nauta's relatives in Guam about the charges, they seemed stunned by the news. <br/>Reached by social media on Monday, his cousin, Lani Nauta, said the family had only just regained electricity after the typhoon that struck the island two weeks ago. <br/>She ended the conversation to call other members of her family and inform them of the indictment. <br/>In an interview with the Washington Post before Mr Nauta was charged, relatives in Guam described him as a \"good boy\" who moved to the United States \"to enjoy his life, not to cause problems\".  <br/>Pauline Torre, his mother, said the fact that her son had been selected to serve the president \"says it all\".  <br/>But his aunt said he did everything \"at the direction of the former president\". <br/>\"All he was instructed was to put the boxes where they were supposed to go,\" Elly Nauta told the Post.<br/>Mr Trump has pleaded not guilty in this case to all the charges against him.<br/>African leaders tour Kyiv after air raid alert<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Greece denies coastguard rope led to boat tragedy<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

And then the contacts come back and say, 'Sorry, we got that one wrong,'\" Mr Bailey said.<br/>Tesco's Mr Murphy said he believed the Bank of England had been unfair in blaming supermarkets for inflation remaining at a high level.<br/>Mr Murphy said the retailer had \"led the way\" in cutting prices on staple goods such as milk, pasta and cooking oil.<br/>He added there were several factors contributing to food inflation, but when commodity prices have come down, the \"grocery industry has been very quick to pass on those savings to consumers\".<br/>The Tesco boss said prices were \"unlikely\" to return to the levels they were prior to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, known as the bread basket of Europe, but pointed out that wages were \"materially higher than they were two years ago\".<br/>\"What's important here is the purchasing power of the family,\" he added. \"That's really where we should be focused on improving people's purchasing power so that they can continue to feed their families and live a decent life.\"<br/>UK supermarkets have previously said there is typically a three to nine-month lag to see price falls reflected in shops.<br/>Last month, Sainsbury's hit back after accusations of bolstering profits at a time when many households are struggling with higher prices.<br/>Mr Murphy's comments came as Tesco released its latest trading update, showing that in the three months to the end of May sales in the UK were up 9% from a year earlier to \u00a310.8bn.<br/>Charles Allen, a retail analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, told the BBC's Today programme that inflation was a \"huge factor\" in Tesco's latest figures.<br/>\"The top commodity prices are starting to fall but it's important to remember that lower inflation doesn't mean deflation. It doesn't mean prices dropping, it just means prices going up less fast.\"<br/>On a call with reporters, Mr Murphy also said Tesco's board had \"acted in the best interests\" of the company regarding the departure of its chairman John Allan.<br/>Mr Allan announced he was stepping down last month following allegations over his conduct.<br/>He has strongly denied three of four claims made against him. <br/>\"It was a difficult decision but at the same time, I think it coincides with the fact that the search for a new chairman was already well under way,\" Mr Murphy said.<br/>Sainsbury's and Asda told not to block rival stores<br/>Supermarkets probed over food and fuel prices<br/>Plans for supermarket price cap on basic food<br/>Food prices 'worryingly high' as sugar and milk soar<br/>Sainsbury\u2019s boss denies profiting from high prices<br/>African leaders tour Kyiv after air raid alert<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Greece denies coastguard rope led to boat tragedy<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Now it is one of the world's most powerful technology companies, with an annual revenue of $200bn (\u00a3158.2bn). <br/>It is best known for making more than half of Apple's products - from iPhones to iMacs - but it also counts Microsoft, Sony, Dell and Amazon among its clients.<br/>For decades, it has thrived on a playbook perfected by multinational corporations - they design products in the US, manufacture them in China and then sell them to the world. That is how it grew from a small component-making business to the consumer electronics giant it is today.<br/>But as global supply chains adjust to souring ties between Washington and Beijing, Foxconn finds itself in an unenviable spot - caught between the world's two biggest economies, the very nations that have powered its growth until now. <br/>The US and China are at loggerheads over many things, from trade to the war in Ukraine. But one of the biggest potential flashpoints is Taiwan, where Foxconn is headquartered.<br/>Taiwan has been a thorny issue for a long time but Chinese leader Xi Jinping's repeated pledges of \"reunification\" have upset the uneasy status quo. Meanwhile, the US, under President Joe Biden, has been more vocal in its support for Taiwan in case of an attack.<br/>Some US voices have crossed China's red line, calling for independence, although the White House has reaffirmed its position that it maintains diplomatic relations with Beijing and not Taipei.<br/>There are hopes of a thaw with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken visiting China this weekend. But there are also fears of a conflict - one US general has estimated it could happen as soon as the next few years.<br/>\"The United States and China are engaged in what we see as strategic competition,\" said Shihoko Goto, the deputy director for the Asia programme at the Wilson Center in Washington DC.<br/>\"Foxconn wants to do business with both, but there can only be one winner.\"<br/>But Mr Liu does not think it is that simple. For one, he said, Foxconn's business model, which relies on US designs and Chinese manufacturing, is far from over.<br/>\"We hire a lot of workers and most countries, including China, want to support their workers,\" Mr Liu said, adding that the Chinese government wants companies like Foxconn to keep going because of the huge number of jobs they create.<br/>Are rising tensions putting pressure on the model? \"So far? We haven't seen it,\" he told us.<br/>But the West and its allies have called for countries and companies to \"de-risk\" from China - a long-term shift to curb global reliance on China that is yet to play out.<br/>When asked if that was impacting business, Mr Liu responded cautiously. <br/>Some overseas clients had pushed to move production out of China, he said, but this was their decision to make, not Foxconn's.<br/>\"They get the push from their government about de-risking, and then they will let us know.\"<br/>Geopolitics aside, Covid-19 is another reason companies might consider \"de-risking\" from China.<br/>A mix of harsh Covid policies, a lack of space for quarantine and the infectiousness of the Omicron variant led to protests and riots at Foxconn's factory in Zhengzhou - the world's biggest iPhone plant - in late 2022. Hundreds of workers, who feared the spread of the virus, fled the campus on foot.<br/>Mr Liu said the scenes that played out for the world to see were caused by a lack of transportation due to Beijing's unyielding zero-Covid policy.<br/>But when pressed further, he admitted that he should have handled things differently.<br/>\"If the same situation occurs again, I would stop production altogether,\" he said, reiterating that he would have made that decision even at the risk of irking clients like Apple.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>WATCH: Chinese protesters clash with riot police at giant iPhone factory<br/>The company's success certainly rests on its impressive client base, but Foxconn is just as indispensable to those clients.<br/>To understand how essential it is to Apple, for instance, you just need to look at how much of the iPhone is made by Foxconn - around 60%, by some estimates. The factories in China make some of the most essential parts of the device - camera modules, connectors, even the back of the phone casing.<br/>That expertise is also what Mr Liu is hoping will fuel Foxconn's next big bet: electric cars.<br/>\"Look at this - this is a big iPhone, so we're very familiar with this,\" he said, pointing to a panel that controlled the car he had taken us for a drive in.<br/>Built for families and priced for an aspiring global middle class, the shiny white SUV is one of several models manufactured by Foxconn. <br/>\"The reason why we think this is a great opportunity for us is that with the traditional gas engine, you have engines which are mostly mechanical. But with EVs, it's batteries and motors,\" he explains. <br/>That is a familiar language for a technology company like Foxconn, he added. <br/>Foxconn's hopes to capture about 5% of the global electric vehicle market in the next few years - an ambitious target given the firm has only made a handful of models so far. But it is a gamble that Mr Liu is confident will pay off.<br/>\"It doesn't make sense for you to make [EVs] in one place, so regionalised production for cars is very natural,\" he added. Foxconn car factories will be based in Ohio in the US, in Thailand, Indonesia and perhaps even in India, he said. <br/>For now, the company will keep focusing on what it does best - making electronic products for clients. But perhaps not too far in the future, Foxconn will start selling its own cars.<br/>Either way, with the foray into electric cars, Foxconn is diversifying not just production but also supply lines - both of which, Mr Liu believes, hold the key to the company's future.<br/>iPhone maker hikes pay ahead of new model launch<br/>iPhone maker sees revenue slump as demand weakens<br/>African leaders tour Kyiv after air raid alert<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Greece denies coastguard rope led to boat tragedy<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Ryanair said staff should be able to come to work \"in a safe and secure environment\".<br/>\"We would ask all of you to respect the privacy and integrity of those brave individuals who came forward to assist us in this investigation,\" Mr Hughes added.<br/>The Financial Times reported that Mr Murray has seven days to launch an appeal against his dismissal.<br/>The BBC has attempted to contact Mr Murray for comment. <br/>The job of chief pilot is an important one. The holder is both a highly qualified airline captain and a manager, responsible for overseeing other pilots based at a hub airport. <br/>They are usually in charge of issues such as training, flight coordination and rostering as well as addressing personal issues. They can also represent the airline in disciplinary issues. <br/>As such, they have a lot of power over their fellow pilots, particularly more junior ones seeking promotions. <br/>The suggestion that someone in this position might be abusing their power - and behaving in an \"inappropriate and unacceptable\" way towards female staff - is therefore a very serious charge.<br/>It's important to note that we haven't heard the other side of the story. But it appears that whistleblowers have come forward - and have been listened to.<br/>Against that background, the dismissal should come as no surprise.<br/>A report last year by the Royal Aeronautical Society into discrimination and lack of diversity in airline pilot training found \"extremely concerning\" reports of sexism and sexual harassment by many female pilots.<br/>Although many had positive comments on their training, reports of sexism and harassment ranged from \"banter\" to \"uncomfortable advances from male trainers\".<br/>Pilot, 15, wants to inspire more women into gliding<br/>Heathrow workers call off first summer strikes<br/>African leaders tour Kyiv after air raid alert<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Greece denies coastguard rope led to boat tragedy<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

We will not allow dirty oil from an Arab country to destroy our pristine environment,\" says Manasi Bole.<br/>She is among thousands of people protesting plans to acquire an expansive laterite plateau - flanked by cliffside fishing villages, mango orchards and ancient petroglyphs - to build the world's largest petrochemical refinery in western India's ecologically fragile Konkan belt. <br/>In late April, angry protests erupted in Ratnagiri district of the western Indian state of Maharashtra when authorities began testing the soil for the mega project to be built by a consortium of Indian state-run oil majors and global giants Saudi Aramco and Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC).<br/>Thousands of villagers, led by women, braved the intense summer temperatures and lay on the roads to prevent officials from entering the site. Many others shaved their heads and went on a hunger strike to mark their dissent. <br/>Click here to watch a video about the protests<br/>When talks with the villagers proved unsuccessful, police imposed a curfew on their movement and used batons and teargas to disperse the protesters. Women protesters and anti-refinery activists were detained, some for several days. <br/>Across the region, there's now simmering discontent over what villagers allege were \"undemocratic and coercive\" tactics by authorities to saddle them with a mammoth industrial project they've vehemently opposed for nearly a decade.  <br/>Across the villages we travelled to, there was anxiety about the refinery.<br/>\"They say the plateau is a barren wasteland, but it's a source of water for our springs, a place where we go to forage for berries, and grow vegetables\" Ms Bole said. <br/>Aboard his trawler boat, fisherman Imtiaz Bhatkar said he was worried about losing his livelihood every day because of the proposed refinery.  <br/>\"We won't be allowed to fish in a 10km (6.2 mile) radius because the crude tankers will be moored at sea,\" Mr Bhatkar said. \"Nearly 30,000 to 40,000 people - local and from outside - depend on fishing in just this one village. What will they do?\" <br/>Mango growers in the region - famed for the prized Alphonso mangoes - told us the slightest air pollution and deforestation would severely damage their yields given how sensitive the Alphonso variety is to the vagaries of wind and weather patterns. <br/>Successive state governments in Maharashtra have been expedient in their stance on the refinery. They have supported it when in power and challenged it when in opposition. <br/>Initially planned as a $40bn (\u00a331.6bn) venture, the size of the 60m-tonne-per-annum project has had to be cut by a third because of the long delays in getting it off the ground. <br/>The project was first announced in 2015 to be built in Nanar village, a few kilometres away from the current site in Barsu village in Ratnagiri. The plans were scrapped after it met with stiff opposition from the residents of Nanar, its village council and environmental groups. <br/>The state's previous chief minister Uddhav Thackeray revived it last year, proposing Barsu as the new site. <br/>But out of power now, he has changed his view in support of the locals.  <br/>The present-day government - which comprises of a splintered faction of Mr Thackeray's party and the BJP - says resistance to the project is politically motivated<br/>\"This is a non-polluting green refinery. As the industries minister, it is my job to clear the misunderstandings of people who are being misled by external forces,\" Uday Samant, a state minister told the BBC. <br/>Contrary to widespread claims, there will be no damage to the petroglyphs - or rock carvings - in the region which are now part of UNESCO's tentative world heritage list, he said.<br/>Mr Samant also claimed the government has already acquired 3,000 of the 5,000 acres of land on which the refinery will be built. <br/>What the BBC saw on the ground, however, belied some of his assertions. <br/>The soil testing for the project, for instance, took place barely a few metres away from some of the 170 petroglyphs on the plateau. Letters of objection from at least six local village councils were brushed aside by authorities, saying people from these hamlets didn't own the land on which the refinery would come up. <br/>But locals say they were conned into selling land parcels at throwaway prices to investors - some of which included politicians, police officials and civil servants - without being informed that it would be given away for a refinery project. <br/>\"The government is allowing the fate of this region to be decided by 200 investors rather than by its people,\" said Satyajit Chavan, an anti-refinery activist who spent six nights in jail for social media posts urging residents of the region to join in the protests. <br/>Divisions over the refinery have been drawn on several lines in this tropical idyll, including geography, class and ideological leanings. <br/>Away from the rural interiors, in the town of Rajapur, Suraj Pednekar, a small business owner, insisted the project will vastly improve the fate of Ratnagiri district, an industrial laggard in the country's richest province. <br/>The government's own estimates suggest Maharashtra's GDP will get a 8.5% boost. <br/>\"Entire generations of young men and women have to go to Mumbai and Pune every year to make a living,\" Mr Pednekar said. \"Villages are being emptied out because there are no jobs. If we get the refinery here and it employs 50,000 people, the population will go up and it will help local businesses. Why should we resist that?\"<br/>His views are echoed by several others in the bigger towns whose traditional livelihoods will not be directly affected by the project. But they are drowned out by villagers. <br/>\"These so-called jobs will go to educated graduates, not the local fishermen. We don't need such jobs,\" said Mr Bhatkar. <br/>According to Ms Bole, even if the locals are given work, it will be lower level jobs of sweepers or watchmen.<br/>Across the state, there appears to be growing support for this people's fight. <br/>At a meeting in Pune city recently, local writers, poets, activists and resistance groups vowed to galvanise massive crowds to mount pressure on authorities to scrap the project. <br/>\"Our campaign will focus on urging people to not vote for politicians or political parties who are in favour of the refinery,\" Mr Chavan told the BBC.<br/>From Enron in the 1990s to an attempt by the French to construct a now stalled nuclear power plant here in the early 2000s to various major industrial proposals by Indian conglomerates like the Reliance Group and the Tata Group, over the years, local resistance groups have made several behemoths retreat from the Konkan. <br/>Whether or not the proposed refinery meets the same fate remains to be seen. But crowd after crowd of local villagers told us they will fight till their very last breath till it goes away. <br/>Yet again, it appears, this region has become a faultline between India's economic ambitions and the ecological sensitivities of its people. <br/>BBC News India is now on YouTube.

No, this is a projection of human nature on machines\" he said. It would be a huge mistake to keep AI research \"under lock and key\", he added.<br/>People who worried that AI might pose a risk to humans did so because they couldn't imagine how it could be made safe, Prof LeCun argued.<br/>\"It's as if you asked in 1930 to someone how are you going to make a turbo-jet safe? Turbo-jets were not invented yet in 1930, same as human level AI has not been invented yet.\"<br/>\"Turbo jets were eventually made incredibly reliable and safe,\" and the same would happen with AI he said.<br/>Meta has a large AI research programme and producing intelligent systems as capable as humans is one of its goals. As well as research, the company uses AI to help identify harmful social media posts.<br/>Prof LeCun spoke at an event for invited press, about his own work in so-called Objective Driven AI which aims to produce safe systems that can remember, reason, plan and have common sense - features popular chatbots like ChatGPT lack.<br/>He said there was \"no question\" that AI would surpass human intelligence. But researchers were still missing essential concepts to reach that level, which would take years if not decades to arrive.<br/>When people raise concerns about the human-level or above machines that might exist in the future, they are referring to artificial general intelligence (AGI). These are systems, that like humans, can solve a wide range of problems.<br/>There was a fear that when AGI existed scientists \"get to turn on a super-intelligent system that is going to take over the world within minutes\", he said. \"That's you know just preposterously ridiculous.\"<br/>In response to a question from BBC news Prof LeCun said there would be progressive advances - perhaps you might get an AI as powerful as the brain of a rat. That wasn't going take over the world, and he argued \"it's still going to run on a data centre somewhere with an off switch\". He added: \"And if you realise it's not safe you just don't built it\".<br/>It has been argued that AI has the potential to replace many jobs, and some companies have paused recruiting for certain roles as a result. <br/>Prof LeCun told the BBC: \"This is not going to put a lot of people out of work permanently\". But work would change because we have \"no idea\" what the most prominent jobs will be 20 years from now, he said.<br/>Intelligent computers would create \"a new renaissance for humanity\" the way the internet or the printing-press did, he said.<br/>Prof LeCun was speaking Tuesday ahead of a vote on Europe's AI Act which is designed to regulate artificial intelligence.<br/>He said from his conversations with AI start-ups in Europe \"they don't like it at all, they think it's too broad, maybe too restrictive\". But he said he wasn't an expert on the legislation, <br/>Prof LeCun said he was not against regulation - but in his view each application would need its own rules, for example different rules would govern AI systems in cars and those scanning medical images.<br/>Warning using AI for loans and mortgages is big risk<br/>Minister urges caution on AI 'Terminator' warnings<br/>AI 'godfather' feels 'lost' over life's work<br/>AI chatbots 'may soon be more intelligent than us'<br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Prices for many items beyond food and energy continue to rise steadily.<br/>The Fed has already lifted its benchmark rate to the highest levels since 2007 to try to rein in the increases.<br/>Further rises, after a pause, would follow a path carved out by central banks in countries such as Australia and Canada, which recently announced rate hikes following a break, citing stubborn inflation pressures. The European Central Bank is expected to raise rates at its meeting this week.  <br/>In the US, Mr Powell said officials wanted time to assess how the economy was adjusting to the shift to higher rates, as the change ripples out to the public in the form of higher costs for mortgages, business loans, credit cards and other borrowing. <br/>\"Given how far we've come, it may make sense for rates to move higher but at a more moderate pace,\" he said. <br/>In theory, higher borrowing costs should reduce demand for loans for homes, business expansions and other activity, eventually cooling the economy and easing pressures pushing up prices. <br/>But despite pockets of pain, such as a sharp slide in home sales, the economy has held up better than many expected so far.<br/>Fed policymakers now expect the economy to grow 1% this year - stronger growth than anticipated in March, according to projections that accompanied the rate announcement. The unemployment rate is also forecast to be 4.1%, lower than previously estimated.<br/>The estimates also show they see less progress controlling inflation than in March. <br/>Mr Powell said what the Fed will do at its next meeting remains a \"live\" question. He added that he saw no chance that rates would come down this year.<br/>The three major US indexes fell following the announcement, which suggested rates would end the year higher than markets had expected.<br/>\"The Fed had to do something to knock market optimism today, otherwise it risked a tougher inflation fight and deeper economic woes down the line,\" said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management. <br/>Charles Lieberman, chief investment officer at Advisors Capital Management, said the pause was a recognition of the risk that the Fed's jump in rates to more than 5% in less than 18 months could trigger an economic slowdown that would lead to millions of job losses.<br/>The bank is also trying to account for the impact of a string of recent bank failures, which could reduce lending further. <br/>\"Five percentage points is just absolutely enormous .... So this is a big impact,\" said Mr Lieberman, who previously worked at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. \"It doesn't mean they're necessarily done.\"<br/>Diane Swonk, chief economist at KPMG in the US, said the public should not expect a return to lower rates anytime soon. <br/>She said the economy generally has become \"much more inflation prone\" due to factors such as increased geo-political tensions, a move to more regional supply chains, and extreme weather events upsetting food supplies and prices more frequently.<br/>\"You're going to see a much more activist central bank policy with higher bouts of inflation and bouts of rate hikes than we saw from the world we left,\" she said. <br/>\"A pause is not an end,\" she added. \"They don't want to let their guards down yet with regard to inflation.\"<br/>How worried should I be about the US economy?<br/>US inflation at lowest since 2021 as fuel costs fall<br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Further damage came from the meltdown of several high-profile firms, including FTX, run by the so-called \"Crypto King\" Sam Bankman-Fried, whom prosecutors have accused of conducting \"one of the biggest financial frauds\" in US history.<br/>Jolted by the turmoil, US regulators stepped up their policing of the sector, which authorities say has been on notice since at least 2017 that their activity runs afoul of US financial rules intended to protect investors.<br/>The campaign has yielded a steady drumbeat of charges against crypto firms and executives, alleging violations ranging from failing to register properly with authorities and provide adequate disclosure of their activity to, in some cases, more damaging claims such as mishandling of consumer funds and fraud.<br/>Bitcoin, which represents the biggest chunk of value in a sector in which thousands of currencies have circulated, is viewed by officials as a commodity, like gold. That means it has been largely unaffected by the current regulatory debate, which hinges on the legal question of what constitutes a \"security\" - an investment like a stock or bond that is overseen by the SEC.<br/>The efforts have instead ensnared firms issuing tokens or coins to raise money - and increasingly the exchanges on which such digital assets are bought and sold, which often hold customer funds, execute trades and engage in other activity that is separated in traditional finance. <br/>The crackdown culminated this month in legal actions against two of the biggest platforms: Coinbase and Binance.<br/>Gary Gensler, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, defended the moves this month, comparing the state of affairs in the industry to the 1920s, before the US put in place many of the rules in question: \"Hucksters. Fraudsters. Scam artists. Ponzi schemes. The public left in line at the bankruptcy court.\"<br/>Will Paige, research analyst for Insider Intelligence, says sentiment has soured significantly since 2021, when the industry was worth more than $3 trillion (\u00a32.4tn) by some estimates and seemed poised for wider acceptance.<br/>\"It's very much back on the fringe of finance,\" he says. \"Trust in the system is battered and it's definitely gotten worse.\"<br/>In the wake of the lawsuits, customers yanked billions of dollars of funds. US banks limited their work with Binance, forcing it to stop accepting US dollars and Robinhood, the trading app, said it would stop listing certain assets named in the lawsuits, citing the \"cloud of uncertainty\" surrounding the tokens.<br/>Critics accuse the SEC under Mr Gensler of hostile \"regulation by enforcement\" aimed at boosting his own political profile. <br/>They say that despite repeated efforts by the industry to propose new rules, the agency has refused to acknowledge the distinctions between different types of crypto firms and the characteristics of the technology, like decentralised automated processing, that challenge existing frameworks.<br/>\"It's been a very frustrating experience,\" says Bart Stephens, managing partner of Blockchain Capital, a venture capital firm that has invested in hundreds of crypto firms, some of which he says have been struggling to find banks willing to do business with them. \"There is no doubt a regulatory attack is going on.\"<br/>Bill Hughes, senior counsel of Consensys, a Texas-based software company that uses crypto's blockchain technology, puts it even more bluntly: \"The SEC has essentially determined that on its watch crypto shouldn't exist in the United States anymore.\"<br/>Whether the SEC's moves could actually kill the industry - in which by at least one estimate one in every six Americans has invested - is another question.<br/>Crypto's wider market value remains roughly a third of what it was at its peak. Trading volumes have plunged and developer interest is falling. Trust remains low.  The failures in March of some of the few traditional banks willing to do business with it marked a further blow.<br/>Hilary Allen, a law professor at American University, thinks crypto is inherently susceptible to boom-and-boost cycles and manipulation by insiders, and thinks it should be banned. She says the SEC's actions could help re-confine crypto to the realm of tech enthusiasts, given the wider state of the industry.<br/>\"If we combine these enforcement actions with waning trust from the public, with possibly waning interest from venture capital, then maybe there isn't a future,\" she says. <br/>But Mr Stephens, who has weathered two \"crypto winters\" already, says he thinks the future remains bright - if at risk of ending up overseas, given America's current approach, which is seen as less friendly than other jurisdictions, including the UK and the EU.<br/>He points to Bitcoin's price, which is hovering around 2020 levels, but has gained significantly from the start of the year. Ether has also risen. <br/>Some indicators tracked by venture firm and crypto-investor Andreessen Horowitz, such as the number of addresses active on blockchain and the number of smart contracts being executed, are also climbing.<br/>\"We're not seeing founders stop forming new companies or protocols,\" says Mr Stephens, who says Blockchain Capital invested more money in the first three months of 2023 than in any quarter in the previous 10 years, as prices fell and rival firms backed away from the sector.<br/>Even if the sector thrives outside the US, losing the American market would severely limit its prospects, warns Gina Pieters, a crypto expert who teaches at the University of Chicago.<br/>\"It would be a mistake to think that the US\u2026 could kill the industry. It can absolutely, though, make the crypto industry smaller,\" she says.<br/>Many in crypto are hoping for a reprieve - from the courts, which could decide the SEC has overstepped its authority; from Congress, where draft legislation for the industry is under review; or from a change in the White House, which could prompt a policy reversal.<br/>However those questions get decided, the issues are finally coming to a head, says Angela Walch, a research associate at the University College of London Centre for Blockchain Technologies.<br/>\"We are at a real inflection point,\" she says. \"The showdown is here.\"<br/>Treat cryptocurrency as gambling, MPs say<br/>US sues Coinbase as crypto crackdown widens<br/>NatWest limits crypto transfers over scam fears<br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

A love of music has shaped both her life and her approach to design, she says.<br/>\"This morning I went up to my design studio and they were playing heavy rock. I looked up at the girls and said, 'Soz, I'm changing it.'\"<br/>Choosing the right music to create the right \"buzz\" for clients who come to visit her west London studio is of the utmost importance to Kelly Hoppen.<br/>Music sets the mood for them, but it also helps her get creative. \"It has to be a certain music for me to get into the zone to design,\" she explains.<br/>In fact, it's often through discussion of music that the decisive creative breakthroughs with clients are made.<br/>\"I say to them, 'If you wanted your room to sound like a piece of music, what would it be?'\" she says. \"Some don't understand the question, but others say, 'Oh, 100%, Say A Little Prayer for You by Burt Bacharach.' And I get that! <br/>\"I can't explain why, but music is design to me.\"<br/>In a career that spans five decades, Hoppen, 63, has established herself as one of the UK's best-known interior designers. She is famed for her neutral palette, Zen-like greys which are meant to create a relaxing ambience. <br/>Many of her celebrity customers have been musicians, including Victoria Beckham, Sean \"Diddy\" Combs and, most recently, Boy George.<br/>Her job is to figure out what they really want, which isn't always straightforward. Boy George visited her home and explained the decor he was after.<br/>\"I said, 'I'm absolutely convinced you don't [want that],\" recalls Hoppen.<br/>But by speaking to him she found out the deeper feelings he was looking for, which gave her clues on how to express his personality in home decor - which is very different to his flamboyant stage persona, she points out.<br/>It's the part of the job she loves, getting into a client's head like a psychologist, she says.<br/>The language of music is part of her method for \"getting the information\" she needs.<br/>Hoppen was born in South Africa, where her mother is from, but with her British father the family moved to London when she was two.<br/>They went back to visit her grandparents during holidays, and her grandmother's elegant home was another design inspiration for her.<br/>In the mid-1970s, aged 16, she decided to \"run away\" back to South Africa on her own. <br/>Her parents had divorced and she was living with her father after falling out with her mother. When her father died unexpectedly at the age of 48, the huge shock was the trigger for her to go.<br/>Back in apartheid South Africa she befriended the musical group The Pacific Express and toured with them. The group contained both black and Indian members. She was breaking apartheid laws by mixing with them, and found herself in jail on one occasion as a result.<br/>She had known the risks, but the music drew her in.<br/>The experience left her \"heartbroken and disgusted\" at what South Africa was like under apartheid so she did not go back.<br/>More CEO Secrets interviews:<br/>Instead, she channelled her passion for music into interior design, starting her company in her teens without qualifications, and growing it organically, one client at a time.<br/>Hoppen's understated look for interiors has appealed to clients who specialise in luxury environments, whether it is boutique hotels, cruise ships or airlines looking to please first-class customers. <br/>She says it's a reputation she has played along with, though she's not averse to a splash of colour. (\"But in my own home? Nope.\") <br/>Apart from her design consultancy, her business empire also includes her best-selling books, which explain some of her design secrets.<br/>The jobs that come into her studio tend to be from high net-worth clients, or companies that cater to them. Her customers have not been particularly affected by the cost of living crisis, she says.<br/>She is aware of \"the divide\" that exists between her clientele's design needs, and the day-to-day concerns of most people.<br/>But she is equally passionate about improving home design for those on smaller budgets, she says, and has built a large following on Instagram, sharing ideas about how to do it.<br/>Interior design doesn't have to involve spending money, she says. You can create impact by small things like changing cushions, or rehanging pictures.<br/>\"I'm such a geek about it, if I could go into everyone's homes and help with the changes, I would. I'd love to be that magician.\"<br/>People have come to appreciate their homes more now as \"sanctuaries\" since the pandemic and lockdowns, Hoppen believes.<br/>And one thing that music and good interior design at home have in common, she's realised, is that they both have the power to influence your mood and have a positive effect on your mental health.<br/>You can follow business reporter Dougal Shaw on LinkedIn<br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

And she sells her own Isabella Vrana label.<br/>Over her eight years in the business, Ms Vrana says she has seen huge changes in demand for second-hand clothes. <br/>\"It wasn't such a normal thing when I started so I've definitely seen an increase in people buying second hand to try and be more sustainable,\" she says.<br/>Plus there's the quality of well-made vintage clothes. \"These items are lasting decades and they're being worn as well. Take a vintage pair of jeans - I've got jeans with dry cleaning labels from the 1990s and they're still going so strong,\" she says.<br/>\"I think people are realising that you might be investing a bit more of an upfront cost, but then it is really paying off long-term.\"<br/>Adam Jay, marketplace chief executive at the clothing resell app Vinted, says the growth in demand for second-hand clothing as been \"phenomenal\".<br/>Vinted now has over eight million registered members in the UK, up from 1.2 million in 2021.<br/>There are the obvious reasons why people are attracted to second-hand clothing. <br/>Buying new clothes and footwear can be expensive at a time when many people are struggling with the cost of living. <br/>The rate at which prices are rising for clothing and shoes hit 6.5% in the year to April, according to the Office for National Statistics.   <br/>Meanwhile, the fashion industry is responsible for generating between 8-10% of global emissions, according to the United Nations, from growing cotton to using oil to create synthetic materials such as polyester.<br/>But for fashion and sustainability vlogger Rosie Okotcha \"thrifted fashion is very cool now because its my personal style, no-one else can get it\".<br/>She credits TikTok and Instagram with driving the trend for second-hand clothing, in particular with \"Gen Z\" shoppers - that's people who were born in between the mid-1990s and mid-2000s.<br/>That is reflected in the sort of styles people are buying. <br/>According to Depop, \"Y2K\" is a popular trend on its app including oversized denim, colourful crochet and vintage t-shirts. There's also demand for one-of-a-kind and customised items, as well as clothing that is handmade or reworked from existing pieces.  <br/>But while the internet might be fuelling the trend, there is vintage fashion to be found in the High Street charity shop.<br/>Ms Okotcha says that part of her mission is to try to \"break down the stigma that there is something wrong with shopping second hand because it is actually really fantastic fun and great for the planet\".<br/>While it might seem inevitable that the popularity of apps might have ended up re-routing clothing donations away from the High Street, the Charity Retail Association (CRA) says that's not the case.<br/>Charity shop sales rose by 15.1% between January and March compared with the same three months last year.  <br/>\"There is plenty of second-hand clothing to go around, so we see the growth of online selling platforms as complementary to the work of charity shops,\" says the CRA.<br/>Ms Vrana agrees that there is plenty of room for competition, and she plans to continue.  <br/>\"There's definitely money to be made,\" she says. <br/>\"You can definitely support yourself through doing this full-time, which I'm really grateful for because sometimes it doesn't even feel like a job because I enjoy it so much.\" <br/>Shein faces US calls for probe into Uyghur claims<br/>Making prom affordable during cost of living crisis<br/>The apps getting your wardrobe back under control<br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Repairs will be part of the future of circularity for brands.\" <br/>There needs to be a systematic solution if change is to happen, he says. \"It's not going to happen through the consumer.\" <br/>Currently working with five brands including Patagonia, Scotch & Soda and Decathlon, companies send garments needing to be repaired to URC, which aims to fix goods within a week. <br/>Turning around over 400 repairs a week, or roughly 20,000 a year, Mr Schweichler says the target is to reach 200,000 repairs per year by 2026.<br/>Swelled by the rise of fast fashion, the clothing industry is known to be one of the most wasteful sectors, with three-quarters of our clothing ending up burned or buried in landfill, according to the World Economic Forum.<br/>According to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, clothing production doubled from 2000 to 2015 while there was a 40% drop in the amount of time clothing was worn. <br/>While sustainability is on the agenda across many countries, in the Netherlands the government has set out bold plans to make the economy circular as quickly as possible.<br/>In 2020 the Amsterdam declared itself the first city in the world to commit to building a circular economy, focusing on food and organic waste streams, consumer goods, and the built environment.<br/>In seven years' time Amsterdam plans to have halved its use of new raw materials. By 2050, the ambition is to be fully circular - relying only on used and recycled materials.<br/>That will be a big challenge for the construction industry, which is responsible for more than 30% of the extraction of natural resources and 25% of solid waste generated in the world. <br/>One Dutch start-up, Madaster, is hoping to make a small dent in those statistics.<br/>It has created an online registry capturing the materials used in Amsterdam's buildings, as well as information about how they can be reused at the end of their life. <br/>\"The built environment uses a lot of materials and energy to create products,\" says director Pablo van den Bosch. \"Instead of waste and make, if we can instead reuse, it's good for carbon emissions and good for decreasing waste.\"<br/>He says Madaster worked together with the Amsterdam authorities to create a digital overview of the buildings across the city. \"If the city wants to redevelop an area they have insights into what materials they can save and perhaps use the materials already there instead of tearing it down.\"<br/>More technology of business:<br/>He points to the Olympic office in Amsterdam Zuid, which was completely refurbished rather than knocked down. \"Natural stone was removed from the fa\u00e7ade and used for flooring in the same building.\"<br/>Despite innovations like this, there is a long way to go. <br/>The Circular Economy Progress Report 2022 by PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency found that while \"policy efforts thus far have laid a foundation and developed a structure for a circular economy in the Netherlands\u2026 the Dutch economy still functions mainly in a linear fashion\".<br/>\"I'm afraid that the country and the city aren't meeting targets,\" says Willem van Winden, professor of urban economic innovation at Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences.<br/>\"The problem is that circular model and practices right now are costlier than linear ones. Unless the government implements stricter measures I'm afraid it will not happen. You need massive investment to make circular economy happen. A lot of businesses won't make the transition unless legislation forces them to.\" <br/>Nevertheless, Amsterdam is setting up initiatives to encourage start-ups to make a bigger splash in the circular economy sector.<br/>One initiative launched together with AMS Institute and venture capital accelerator Rockstart is Amsterdam Circular, a two-month programme designed to help 20 early-stage firms find funding. <br/>\"There was a clear need for the city to support early-stage start-ups and scale up financing,\" says Guy Vincent, programme lead at Amsterdam Circular. \"The programme is designed to support start-ups developing circular solutions in areas such as food, energy, mobilisation, construction and climate resilience.\" <br/>He says start-ups in the circular economy space face more challenges than other new firms.<br/>\"They are typically higher risk with lower profits as they can be testing new business models that are more complex and often not proven. Traditional VCs can be hesitant to invest in them. We want to try and find ideal financing models for circular companies. Co-financing is needed, i.e. private sector and a blend of public funds.\"<br/>Dutch electronics manufacturer Fairphone is one company that has managed to establish itself in the circular economy space.<br/>It encourages its customers to keep their phones as long as possible and makes the phones relatively easy to fix.<br/>\"Keeping the phone in longer use is the highest impact you can make in this product category,\" says Eva Gouwens, chief executive of Fairphone.<br/>She points out that 75% of carbon emissions happen at production. <br/>\"The average lifetime of a device is two to three years. If we can extend to at least every five years, then you only need half the materials.\" <br/>Fairphone also offers a recycling programme, encouraging customers to hand in their old phone in return for at least \u20ac50. \"We can use modules or at least components for repairing other devices. Many phones are sat in drawers or go to landfill,\" she says.<br/>Prof van Winden is encouraged by the companies developing circular models, but has this observation about the circular economy: \"For now it's mainly the upmarket segments and they're often expensive products for richer people.\"<br/>African leaders tour Kyiv after air raid alert<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Greece denies coastguard rope led to boat tragedy<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Savita Patel, a California-based independent journalist, speaks to those supporting and opposing the bill becoming a law.<br/>Sukhjinder Kaur*, a nurse at a hospital in California, works long and tiring hours serving patients. But whenever it's break time, things become oppressive. <br/>She is a Dalit (a community that is placed at the bottom of India's deeply discriminatory caste hierarchy) and says she often faces casteist insults from her South Asian colleagues.<br/>Dalit rights activists say scores of caste-oppressed Californians face housing, educational, professional, and social discrimination. <br/>In March, Senator Aisha Wahab, a lawmaker from the Democratic Party, authored and introduced the SB-403 bill -  legislation that seeks to add caste as a protected category in the state's anti-discrimination laws alongside gender, race, religion and disability.<br/>The bill was passed by the state's senate in May with a 34-1 vote. If it goes through in the state assembly, California will become the first US state to ban caste discrimination.<br/>\"Nurses from upper castes pass slurs about chamars [a pejorative term for Dalits] being dirty and polluting,\" says Ms Kaur, who is among those who are in favour of the law. <br/>In February, Seattle became the first city in the US - and outside South Asia - to outlaw caste discrimination, generating momentum for the legislation in California. It is being propelled by the same broad multi-faith, inter-caste, multi-racial coalition of over 40 American and international Dalit and human rights activists and organisations, led by California-based Equality Labs.<br/>California has a large South Asian diaspora and is home to some of the world's biggest tech companies.<br/>The state is home to more than half of the 500,000-plus Sikh population in the US and gurudwaras (Sikh temples) in California have been mobilising momentum to outlaw caste discrimination. <br/>Two of the community's largest advocacy groups - The Sikh Coalition and Sikh American Legal Defense and Education Fund - support the bill. Among Sikhs, it is the Ravidasia community - the largest Dalit community in the state with approximately 15,000-20,000 members - which is advocating for the bill at grassroots level.<br/>Renu Singh, who follows the Ravidasia tradition and is also a women's rights activist, has been urging women to speak about their own experiences of caste discrimination and those they see around them so that lawmakers understand the gravity of the issue.<br/>Data from an Equality Lab study shows that one in four caste-oppressed people from the South Asian American diaspora have faced physical and verbal violence; one in three has faced discrimination in education, and two out of three have experienced workplace discrimination.<br/>It was the first extensive study of caste distribution and its effects in the US and had over 1,500 respondents. The findings, published in 2018, say that those from \"lower castes\" fear retaliation and worry about being \"outed\" and hence \"hide their caste\".<br/>However, a significant section of the Indian diaspora rejects caste discrimination claims.<br/>Deepak Aldrin, a San Francisco-based Dalit activist is not in favour of the bill. \"I've lived here for 35 years. No Hindu has ever asked me what caste I belong to,\" he says.<br/>The bill is meeting strong opposition from many Indian-American individuals, religious and professional groups, who argue that even though it does not specifically name their religion, it will \"discriminate against Hindus, their places of worship and even make them less hiring worthy\". <br/>They say the existing laws in California are sufficient to address any discrimination and are mobilising the community to urge their lawmakers to disallow the legislation to proceed.<br/>Many businesses and Hindu temples under HinduPACT - an American Hindu grassroots advocacy initiative - have appealed to California lawmakers to reject the bill. Its convenor Ajay Shah says that the legislation is \"deeply flawed, ill-intentioned and targets children and youth from the Indian subcontinent and those who follow the Hindu dharma [Hinduism].\"<br/>Suhag Shukla, co-founder and executive director of the Hindu American Foundation, says this bill is already creating an \"undesirable\" awareness about caste. She says she has been \"hearing inappropriate queries from workers, especially in tech, who are being asked about their caste by non-South Asians\". She says if this becomes a pattern, it can be grounds for ethnicity-based harassment.<br/>The foundation has sued the state in a federal court for an \"unconstitutional definition of caste\" and has also challenged the addition of caste to its non-discrimination policy, saying that it \"singles out one community for ethnic profiling and additional policing\".<br/>Those opposing the bill say they are also perplexed as to how the state plans to identify an individual's caste since it's a very complex issue, .<br/>The bill, Ms Wahab explains, does not include details for identifying caste, similar to other protected categories.<br/>\"There is no language on how caste will be determined. This is simply an anti-discrimination bill. When somebody takes a matter up to the courts, that is usually when subject matter experts are engaged, the type of discrimination potentially that has taken place [is investigated].\"<br/>Ms Wahab says she has received \"death threats\" after proposing the bill. She now faces a recall campaign and a possible re-election. She adds that the \"visceral reaction\" to the bill is \"disheartening\" and has urged Californians to read the bill.<br/>\"Whether you're upper caste or lower caste, it does not matter, it will protect you as well,\" she says.<br/>*Some names have been changed to protect identity.<br/>BBC News India is now on YouTube.

It was made in a laboratory on an industrial estate just a few miles down the road.<br/>I'm in Huber's Butchery and Bistro in Singapore, which is the only restaurant in world to have so-called cultivated meat on the menu.<br/>Feedback from customers has been \"phenomenal\", according to the restaurant's owner.<br/>The meat's creator - California-based Eat Just - says it is ethical, clean and green - with no compromise on taste. Billions of dollars are being poured into the industry, but huge question marks hang over its viability as anything beyond a novelty.<br/>Ever since the first lab-grown burger - which cost a mere $330,000 (\u00a3263,400) to create - was unveiled in London in 2013, dozens of companies around the world have joined the race to bring affordable cultivated meat to the market.<br/>So far, only Eat Just has managed to get its product approved for public sale after regulators in Singapore - the only country in the world to allow lab-grown meat to be sold - gave its chicken the green light in December 2020.<br/>But it is still nowhere near being widely available. Cultivated chicken nuggets were briefly on the menu at a private members' club in 2021. <br/>That partnership lasted a few months and this year Huber's has started offering a chicken sandwich and a chicken pasta dish to the general public - albeit only once a week with limited dining slots available.<br/>\"Cultivated meat is real meat, but you don't have to slaughter an animal,\" says Josh Tetrick, chief executive of Eat Just, who spoke to the BBC from San Francisco. \"This way of eating makes sense for the future,\" he says.<br/>Unlike plant-based substitutes, cultivated meat is literally meat. The process involves extracting cells from an animal, which are then fed with nutrients such as proteins, sugars and fats.<br/>The cells are allowed to divide and grow, before being placed in a large steel bioreactor, which acts like a fermentation tank.<br/>After four to six weeks, the material is 'harvested' from the bioreactor. Some vegetable protein is added, then it is moulded, cooked and 3-D printed to give it the necessary shape and texture.<br/>The resulting strips of deep fried chicken on my plate of orecchiette pasta certainly tasted like the real deal, if a bit processed. Perhaps the sort of chicken you would eat in a fast-food restaurant.<br/>\"It's meat - it's perfect!\" says Caterina, an Italian student who came here especially to try the cultivated chicken. Normally, for sustainability reasons, she would not eat meat but Caterina says she would eat this.<br/>Her only quibble? Serving the chicken with pasta, which typically does not happen in Italy.<br/>Another diner from Singapore says he was surprised by how much it resembled real meat.<br/>\"It's legit\", he says. \"I wouldn't know where it came from. My only concern would be the cost.\"<br/>The chicken pasta dish I ordered was S$18.50 ($13.70; \u00a311), but that is vastly discounted relative to the current cost of producing the meat. <br/>Eat Just will not say exactly how much it spends on making its cultivated chicken, but at the moment the company's production capacity only yields 2kg (4.4lb) or 3kg per week in Singapore.<br/>When you compare that to the 4,000kg - 5,000kg of conventional chicken sold weekly - at Huber's alone - it gives you a sense of the scale of the task ahead. Put simply, they will need to increase production enormously to avoid making a loss on each piece of chicken.<br/>Eat Just says it has already achieved a 90% reduction in costs since 2018 and the company offered me a tour of its new multi-million dollar production facility in Singapore, which it hopes will open next year.<br/>The pair of shiny steel 1,320 gallon (6,000 litres) bioreactors certainly represent a sign of intent, but in reality they are a tiny fraction of the millions of tonnes of chicken that would need to be produced to match the price of slaughtered chicken.<br/>The industry is urging for patience, but many scientists have already seen enough.<br/>\"The narrative presented by these companies is very strong\", says Ricardo San Martin, co-director of the Alt: Meat Lab at the University of California, Berkeley.<br/>\"But that narrative must be contrasted with the science\", he says. \"Run the numbers, look at every scientific paper written by people who have no skin in the game, and you'll see the answer is clear.\"<br/>\"Can you do this, at scale, at a reasonable cost? No. Can you talk about saving the world with this? Again, no. These companies have to be honest - it's wishful thinking\", he says.<br/>Not only are there doubts about scaling up production, there is also uncertainty over the industry's green credentials, which have been questioned by scientists.<br/>In theory, reducing the world's reliance on land and livestock for meat production should reduce carbon emissions, but at the moment the advanced technology needed to create cultivated meat is so energy intensive that it cancels out any benefits. <br/>One study by the University of California, Davis even estimated that the process produces between 4 and 25 times as much carbon dioxide as regular beef. However, East Just has called the study \"flawed\".<br/>When asked by the BBC whether the whole project might end in failure, Josh Tetrick from Eat Just replied: \"For sure\".<br/>But he remains undeterred: \"Making meat in this way is both necessary and highly uncertain,\" he says.<br/>\"It's not straightforward. It's complicated. It's not guaranteed and it might not work out. But the other option for us is not to do anything. So we decided to take a bet and go for it.\"<br/>Plenty of investors have decided to make that same bet. As of this year, an estimated $2.8bn has been spent on developing cultivated meat.<br/>However, if cultivated meat is to become anything more than a niche alternative for the well-off in the developed world, then relying on investments from private businesses may not be enough.<br/>Governments, Mr Tetrick says, are going to need to put \"significant public money\" into cultivated meat for it to rival conventionally slaughtered meat. <br/>\"This is like the transition to renewable energy... It's a lifetime project - maybe a multiple lifetimes project,\" he says.<br/>At the moment though no country outside Singapore has authorised the sale of cultivated meat, let alone committed to serious investment.<br/>According to Ricardo San Martin from UC Berkeley, both private and public funding for cultivated meat companies will dry up if they do not \"look in the mirror\" soon and present realistic forecasts to investors.<br/>\"Unless there is a clear path to success at some point in the future, investors and governments will not want to spend money on something that is not scientifically proven\".<br/>Italy to ban lab-grown meat to protect heritage<br/>Lab-grown chicken safe to eat, say US regulators<br/>Singapore approves lab-grown 'chicken' meat<br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

He also works at Chia Network, which provides a blockchain technology. <br/>Chia Network could easily reuse storage devices that large data centres have decided they no longer need. In 2021, the company approached IT Asset Disposition (ITAD) firms, who dispose of old technology for businesses that no longer need it. The answer came back: \"Sorry, we have to shred old drives.\"<br/>\"What do you mean, you destroy them?\" says Mr Hands, relating the story. \"Just erase the data, and then sell them! They said the customers wouldn't let them do that. One ITAD provider said they were shredding five million drives for a single customer.\" <br/>Storage devices are typically sold with a five-year warranty, and large data centres retire them when the warranty expires. Drives that store less sensitive data are spared, but the CDI estimates that 90% of hard drives are destroyed when they are removed. <br/>The reason? \"The cloud service providers we spoke to said security, but what they actually meant was risk management,\" says Mr Hands. \"They have a zero-risk policy. It can't be one in a million drives, one in 10 million drives, one in 100 million drives that leaks. It has to be zero.\"<br/>The irony is that shredding devices is relatively risky today. The latest drives have 500,000 tracks of data per square inch. A sophisticated data recovery person could take a piece as small as 3mm and read the data off it, Mr Hands says.<br/>Last year, the IEEE Standards Association approved its Standard for Sanitizing Storage. It describes three methods for removing data from devices, a process known as sanitisation. <br/>The least secure method is \"clear\". All the data is deleted, but it could be recovered using specialist tools. It's good enough if you want to reuse the drive within your company. <br/>The most extreme method is to destroy the drives through melting or incineration. Data can never be recovered, and nor can the drive or its materials.<br/>Between the two sits a secure option for re-use: purging. When the drive is purged, data recovery is unfeasible using state-of-the-art tools and techniques. <br/>There are several ways a drive can be purged. Hard drives can be overwritten with new patterns of data, for example, which can then be checked to make sure the original data has gone. With today's storage capacities, it can take a day or two.<br/>By comparison a cryptographic erase takes just a couple of seconds. Many modern drives have built-in encryption, so that the data on them can only be read if you have the encryption key. If that key is deleted, all the data is scrambled. It's still there, but it's impossible to read. The drive is safe to resell.<br/>Seagate is a leading provider of data storage solutions, and a founding member of the CDI. \"If we can universally, among all of our customers, trust that that we have secure erase, then drives can be returned to use,\" says Amy Zuckerman, sustainability and transformation director at Seagate. \"That is happening, but on a very small scale.\"<br/>In its 2022 financial year, Seagate refurbished and resold 1.16 million hard drives and solid-state drives (SSDs), avoiding more than 540 tonnes of electronic waste (e-waste). That includes drives that were returned under their warranty and drives that were bought back from customers.<br/>A pilot take-back programme in Taiwan recovered three tonnes of e-waste. The challenge now, Ms Zuckerman says, is to scale the programme up. <br/>Refurbished drives are tested, recertified and sold with a five or seven-year warranty. \"We are seeing small data centres and cryptocurrency mining operations pick them up,\" she says. \"Our successes have been on a smaller scale, and I think that's probably true for others engaged in this work too.\"<br/>There are no projections for how many times each drive can be refurbished and reused. \"Right now, we are just looking at that double use,\" Ms Zuckerman says.<br/>There is huge potential for such schemes. A large proportion of the 375 million hard drives sold by all companies in 2018 are now ending their warranty.<br/>For drives that can't be reused, Seagate looks first at parts extraction and then materials recycling. In the Taiwan pilot programme, 57% of the material was recycled, made up of magnets and aluminium. Innovation is needed across the industry to help recover more of the 61 chemical elements used in the drives, Ms Zuckerman says.<br/>The principle of sanitising and reusing hardware also applies to other devices, including routers. \"Just because a company has a policy of replacing something over three years, it doesn't mean it's defunct for the entire world,\" says Tony Anscombe, the chief security evangelist at IT security company ESET. <br/>\"A large internet service provider (ISP) may well be decommissioning some enterprise grade routers that a smaller ISP would dream of having.\" <br/>More technology of business:<br/>It's important to have a decommissioning process that secures the devices, though. ESET bought some second-hand core routers, the type used in corporate networks. Only five out of 18 routers had been wiped properly. The rest contained information about the network, applications or customers that could be valuable to hackers. All had enough data to identify the original owners.<br/>One of the routers had been sent to an e-waste disposal company, who had apparently sold it on without removing the data. ESET contacted the original owner. \"They were very shocked,\" says Mr Anscombe. \"Companies should sanitise devices themselves as best as they can, even if they're using a sanitisation and e-waste company.\"<br/>Mr Anscombe recommends companies test the process of sanitising devices while they're still under support. If anything is unclear, help is available from the manufacturer then. He also suggests saving all documentation needed for the process in case the manufacturer removes it from their website. <br/>Before sanitisation, Mr Anscombe says companies should make and store a back-up of the device. If any data does leak, it's easier to understand then what has been lost. <br/>Finally, companies should make it easy for people to report security leaks.

varying in size from under 20 employees to 200 - have already signed the pledge, which is divided into five \"pillars\".<br/>They include creating a maternity leave and return to work plan for employees and helping them \"maintain an emotional connection with the workplace so they do not feel anxious about being on maternity leave and their subsequent return to work\".<br/>Susannah believes current maternity leave practices often fall short of where they should be.<br/>She says: \"Although there are laws in place, the statistics and stories show that the measures currently in place to protect jobs and provide financial support are not working as well as they could as they're not reflective of the society we live in, what mothers want and the profound experience of motherhood.<br/>\"Our aim with the Maternity Pledge is to help keep mothers in the workplace if they want to be and through that we hope to see more women in leadership roles.\"<br/>Pregnant employees of firms that sign up are also given a \"matrescence pack\", which Susannah says covers \"the parts of motherhood which tend to be glossed over in pregnancy but can affect mental health\". <br/>It addresses issues such as breastfeeding problems and the affect of matrescence on relationships with partners.<br/>Companies already signed up to the pledge seem to be fully on board with its goals.<br/>Colchester-based PR company founder Megan Dorian says she is glad to be part of the project.<br/>\"When I launched Orange PR and Marketing when my first-born daughter was just over a year, I knew a priority for the business was to create an inclusive culture that not only supported but embraced parents in their journey,\" she says. <br/>\"There is still a stigma around women taking a career 'break' - it's certainly not a break - to have a baby and then return to work, and I am a big advocate for breaking this down.\"<br/>Another supporter is London-based Jenny Jones, chief operating officer of advisory, legal and accountancy firm Dragon Argent.<br/>\"Becoming a mother was the hardest transition I've ever had to make,\" she says. <br/>\"Going from being confident in your job and your life in general to being at home looking after a very small, fragile person 24/7 was tricky to say the least.  <br/>\"Supporting all our present and future parents through the often unspoken challenges of balancing parenthood and careers matters to us, which is why we signed The Maternity Pledge.\"<br/>Susannah says everyone benefits if companies support new mothers' return to work with as much flexibility and care for their wellbeing as possible.<br/>\"Maternity leave can work better for businesses and mothers if communication, support and empathy is improved,\" she says.<br/>\"Most women want to work - and with the cost of living, nearly all women need to work - so it's really important to keep women in a workplace where they feel valued and fulfilled.\"<br/>Tory MP: I'm dismayed by abuse for maternity leave<br/>'Maternity leave is hard and lonely'<br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves -

If I have to give up being a blacksmith, then I will,\" the 39-year-old says.<br/>The craftsman is not alone. Many are facing similar financial dilemmas as they contemplate rising mortgage costs. <br/>The Bank of England has been steadily raising interest rates for the last year and a half, as it tries to tackle soaring prices. <br/>After figures last week showed inflation not coming down as quickly as expected, many now predict the central bank will continue to raise rates from their current level of 4.5% to as high as 5.5%.<br/>That in turn had an immediate impact on the mortgage market. Lenders began raising their rates. According to financial data firm Moneyfacts, the average two-year fixed-rate mortgage is now 5.49% and the average five-year fixed is currently 5.17%.<br/>And within a week hundreds of mortgage deals were removed from the market as lenders reassessed their offers.<br/>\"Carnage\" is how Craig Fish from Lodestone brokers in London described the situation. <br/>\"I'm currently on hold to NatWest - 30 minutes and counting - to discuss a possible new mortgage as they have just announced they are withdrawing rates at 10.30pm tonight. Do the lenders think the future is this uncertain?\" he said earlier this week.<br/>Jo Wilder, 28, works for Cardiff Council and pays \u00a3700 a month for a studio apartment she has been renting for the past 18 months. She now wants to buy her own home - a process that is taking longer than she hopes, as she watches rates rise. <br/>Despite having a healthy 20% deposit and a mortgage in principle, she says there are \"not really any properties on the market\".<br/>Repayments on a three-year fixed-rate deal at 4.5% would be between \u00a3500 and \u00a3600 but she is worried about interest rates going up.<br/>\"It's not ideal. I'm just going to have to wait it out and hope rates come down. It really is very stressful,\" she says.<br/>Jo had hoped getting her own place would mean a drop in monthly outgoings but with rising food prices she no longer thinks that will be the case.<br/>\"It is disheartening,\" she adds. \"The way things are going I think it is actually going to be the same price, which is pretty daunting to be honest.\"<br/>In Bedfordshire, Anthony Jones and his wife have a 14-month-old daughter - they want to upsize and have been trying to sell since last August. <br/>The couple's five-year fixed deal has ended and they are now on a tracker mortgage, leaving them \u00a3200 worse off a month, at a little over \u00a31,200.<br/>\"It's a bit of a nightmare,\" says Anthony. \"We're looking at upsizing and all of a sudden are having to question the affordability of it.\"<br/>The 33-year-old says when they first put their house on the market there had been \"a lot of interest initially, then all of a sudden we had people saying 'our mortgage offer has been pulled' and 'we can't afford it anymore'.\"<br/>The couple have reduced the asking price from \u00a3300,000 to \u00a3275,000, but say they cannot accept less because otherwise they will not have the deposit for their second home.<br/>\"Our daughter has grown so quickly, we need a garden and bigger bedrooms and more storage. The lack of space is even causing arguments between me and my partner,\" says Anthony.<br/>Read more here<br/>The upheaval for people going through the application process comes as Bank of England figures this week showed a decline in the number of mortgages being approved. <br/>The number of net mortgage approvals for house purchases fell to 48,700 in April from 51,500 in March.<br/>Mortgage broker London & Country is now seeing a trend for people fixing for one or two years, rather than the previous most popular five-year term, on the basis that interest rates will have fallen by the time they come to look for their next deal.<br/>Spokesman David Hollingworth says people who are refinancing should start searching for a new product six months before the end of their current deal.<br/>Some may want to consider taking out new mortgages over a longer term - something a lot of first-time buyers do to \"give themselves breathing space\", he says.<br/>If it is a struggle to meet payments on an existing mortgage there is also the option of extending the term, but Mr Hollingworth says this is \"not a move to be taken lightly because it will significantly increase the overall interest bill, by tens of thousands of pounds\".<br/>Are you struggling to get a mortgage or one that's affordable?

It has been such a labour of love.\" <br/>The Wall Street Journal quoted an Archewell spokeswoman as saying Meghan was \"continuing to develop more content for the Archetypes audience on another platform\".<br/>When the agreement with Spotify was first announced, it was billed as a relationship which would produce several series - but in the end, only one materialised. <br/>American media reports suggest the royal couple failed to meet the productivity benchmark required by Spotify, and therefore wouldn't be receiving the full value of the contract.<br/>Since splitting from the royal family, Harry and Meghan have looked to capitalise on their global fame in order to become financially independent.<br/>That has included a multi-million dollar content deal with Netflix, and Harry's huge contract with Penguin Books, which has already produced his autobiography Spare.<br/>It follows Spotify's announcement last week that it was cutting 200 jobs in its podcast division after a period of heavy investment in the medium, saying it was embarking on a \"strategic realignment\".<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Meghan: 'They were concerned how that would look for the institution'<br/>Is the 'have-a-go' podcaster era coming to an end?<br/>Where do Harry and Meghan get their money?<br/>Harry and Meghan dismiss South Park lawsuit rumour<br/>I want to stop hate towards Meghan, Harry tells court<br/>Harry surrounded by 'web of unlawful activity'<br/>African leaders tour Kyiv after air raid alert<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Greece denies coastguard rope led to boat tragedy<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Now it is one of the world's most powerful technology companies, with an annual revenue of $200bn (\u00a3158.2bn). <br/>It is best known for making more than half of Apple's products - from iPhones to iMacs - but it also counts Microsoft, Sony, Dell and Amazon among its clients.<br/>For decades, it has thrived on a playbook perfected by multinational corporations - they design products in the US, manufacture them in China and then sell them to the world. That is how it grew from a small component-making business to the consumer electronics giant it is today.<br/>But as global supply chains adjust to souring ties between Washington and Beijing, Foxconn finds itself in an unenviable spot - caught between the world's two biggest economies, the very nations that have powered its growth until now. <br/>The US and China are at loggerheads over many things, from trade to the war in Ukraine. But one of the biggest potential flashpoints is Taiwan, where Foxconn is headquartered.<br/>Taiwan has been a thorny issue for a long time but Chinese leader Xi Jinping's repeated pledges of \"reunification\" have upset the uneasy status quo. Meanwhile, the US, under President Joe Biden, has been more vocal in its support for Taiwan in case of an attack.<br/>Some US voices have crossed China's red line, calling for independence, although the White House has reaffirmed its position that it maintains diplomatic relations with Beijing and not Taipei.<br/>There are hopes of a thaw with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken visiting China this weekend. But there are also fears of a conflict - one US general has estimated it could happen as soon as the next few years.<br/>\"The United States and China are engaged in what we see as strategic competition,\" said Shihoko Goto, the deputy director for the Asia programme at the Wilson Center in Washington DC.<br/>\"Foxconn wants to do business with both, but there can only be one winner.\"<br/>But Mr Liu does not think it is that simple. For one, he said, Foxconn's business model, which relies on US designs and Chinese manufacturing, is far from over.<br/>\"We hire a lot of workers and most countries, including China, want to support their workers,\" Mr Liu said, adding that the Chinese government wants companies like Foxconn to keep going because of the huge number of jobs they create.<br/>Are rising tensions putting pressure on the model? \"So far? We haven't seen it,\" he told us.<br/>But the West and its allies have called for countries and companies to \"de-risk\" from China - a long-term shift to curb global reliance on China that is yet to play out.<br/>When asked if that was impacting business, Mr Liu responded cautiously. <br/>Some overseas clients had pushed to move production out of China, he said, but this was their decision to make, not Foxconn's.<br/>\"They get the push from their government about de-risking, and then they will let us know.\"<br/>Geopolitics aside, Covid-19 is another reason companies might consider \"de-risking\" from China.<br/>A mix of harsh Covid policies, a lack of space for quarantine and the infectiousness of the Omicron variant led to protests and riots at Foxconn's factory in Zhengzhou - the world's biggest iPhone plant - in late 2022. Hundreds of workers, who feared the spread of the virus, fled the campus on foot.<br/>Mr Liu said the scenes that played out for the world to see were caused by a lack of transportation due to Beijing's unyielding zero-Covid policy.<br/>But when pressed further, he admitted that he should have handled things differently.<br/>\"If the same situation occurs again, I would stop production altogether,\" he said, reiterating that he would have made that decision even at the risk of irking clients like Apple.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>WATCH: Chinese protesters clash with riot police at giant iPhone factory<br/>The company's success certainly rests on its impressive client base, but Foxconn is just as indispensable to those clients.<br/>To understand how essential it is to Apple, for instance, you just need to look at how much of the iPhone is made by Foxconn - around 60%, by some estimates. The factories in China make some of the most essential parts of the device - camera modules, connectors, even the back of the phone casing.<br/>That expertise is also what Mr Liu is hoping will fuel Foxconn's next big bet: electric cars.<br/>\"Look at this - this is a big iPhone, so we're very familiar with this,\" he said, pointing to a panel that controlled the car he had taken us for a drive in.<br/>Built for families and priced for an aspiring global middle class, the shiny white SUV is one of several models manufactured by Foxconn. <br/>\"The reason why we think this is a great opportunity for us is that with the traditional gas engine, you have engines which are mostly mechanical. But with EVs, it's batteries and motors,\" he explains. <br/>That is a familiar language for a technology company like Foxconn, he added. <br/>Foxconn's hopes to capture about 5% of the global electric vehicle market in the next few years - an ambitious target given the firm has only made a handful of models so far. But it is a gamble that Mr Liu is confident will pay off.<br/>\"It doesn't make sense for you to make [EVs] in one place, so regionalised production for cars is very natural,\" he added. Foxconn car factories will be based in Ohio in the US, in Thailand, Indonesia and perhaps even in India, he said. <br/>For now, the company will keep focusing on what it does best - making electronic products for clients. But perhaps not too far in the future, Foxconn will start selling its own cars.<br/>Either way, with the foray into electric cars, Foxconn is diversifying not just production but also supply lines - both of which, Mr Liu believes, hold the key to the company's future.<br/>iPhone maker hikes pay ahead of new model launch<br/>iPhone maker sees revenue slump as demand weakens<br/>African leaders tour Kyiv after air raid alert<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Greece denies coastguard rope led to boat tragedy<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

CGI said  it was more than 90% accurate during a test run.<br/>It's being trialled in what's known as the North Devon Biosphere Reserve, a 55-sq-mile (142-sq-km) protected area that includes important natural habitats as well as farmland and small towns. <br/>\"We'll give (the AI) the history,\" said CGI's chief sustainability officer Mattie Yeta. \"We'll give it all of the geographic information, as well as data sets from the sensors for it to learn and develop the predictive mechanisms to be able to inform where these incidents are occurring and indeed when they will take place.\"<br/>It's hoped the project could clean up the seaside resort town of Combe Martin, where the quality of bathing water has long been a concern. <br/>\"It's always been bumping along the bottom in terms of water quality,\" says Andy Bell from the North Devon Biosphere Reserve.<br/>Though the water at Combe Martin was last year rated by the Environment Agency as 'good', Mr Bell says that was mainly down to dry weather.  More typical years, he says, were 2018 and 2019 when it received a 'poor' rating, which meant a notice being posted advising people not to swim. <br/>\"There is very much a fear in the community of what would happen if the bathing water status was rescinded.\" Andy says <br/>\"It would impact on the cafes, the restaurants, the B&B's\u2026 people want to come to a clean place to enjoy themselves.\"<br/>The River Umber is the main culprit, according to Mr Bell. It reaches the sea through a corridor of lush green algae on the edge of the beach. The Umber is usually little more than a stream but it receives discharges both from a sewage treatment plant and agricultural runoff from farms. <br/>Cleaning up the Umber is seen as a first step towards improving the water quality on the beach and the key to that, according to the artificial intelligence project, is a huge amount of real-time information.  <br/>A couple of kilometres upstream from Combe Martin beach, a floating water sensor is being installed in the river. It's a square black box with solar panels on top and is moored by a cable to the bank. <br/>It automatically transmits a stream of data on six key indicators of water health including acidity (pH), ammonia, the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water and how clear the water is (turbidity).<br/>\"It's a really good overview of water quality,\" said Glyn Cotton, the chief executive of environment-focussed technology company Watr, which is supplying the \u00a32,000-a-go ($2,557) sensors to the project. <br/>\"If sewage was being discharged upstream we would see spikes in things like ammonia and pH and we can then cross-reference that with temperature and dissolved oxygen levels.\"<br/>About 50 connected sensors are being used across the catchment area, a mix of water, soil and rain gauges. Mapping company Ordnance Survey are providing the expertise to integrate that information with location specific data and satellite imagery. <br/>\"We can start training the model using data to get it understanding that when there was a pollution event - whether it was associated with a particular area?\" said Donna Lyndsay from Ordnance Survey. \"Was there for example a particular rainfall event that washed it all off?\"<br/>The hope is that the AI might, for example, advise a farmer to stop putting more fertiliser on his field, if the soil is dry and heavy rain forecast because of the likelihood of it being washed into the waterways. <br/>Preventing raw sewage being discharged by water treatment plants - a practice allowed when heavy rainfall overwhelms facilities -  is more complicated. The AI might see it coming after heavy rainfall but that doesn't mean the water company has the capacity to stopped it being released. <br/>The first phase of the AI project was a desk-based model using historic data, with CGI saying it predicted pollution events with 91.5% accuracy. Now the AI model is being unleashed 'in the wild' and the question is whether it can do the same.<br/>\"We're starting very small here (in North Devon) \u2026 but the idea is very much to scale up and roll this out to different parts of the UK.\" said CGI's Mattie Yeta. <br/>Artificial intelligence (AI) technology is developing fast, and transforming many aspects of life.

No, this is a projection of human nature on machines\" he said. It would be a huge mistake to keep AI research \"under lock and key\", he added.<br/>People who worried that AI might pose a risk to humans did so because they couldn't imagine how it could be made safe, Prof LeCun argued.<br/>\"It's as if you asked in 1930 to someone how are you going to make a turbo-jet safe? Turbo-jets were not invented yet in 1930, same as human level AI has not been invented yet.\"<br/>\"Turbo jets were eventually made incredibly reliable and safe,\" and the same would happen with AI he said.<br/>Meta has a large AI research programme and producing intelligent systems as capable as humans is one of its goals. As well as research, the company uses AI to help identify harmful social media posts.<br/>Prof LeCun spoke at an event for invited press, about his own work in so-called Objective Driven AI which aims to produce safe systems that can remember, reason, plan and have common sense - features popular chatbots like ChatGPT lack.<br/>He said there was \"no question\" that AI would surpass human intelligence. But researchers were still missing essential concepts to reach that level, which would take years if not decades to arrive.<br/>When people raise concerns about the human-level or above machines that might exist in the future, they are referring to artificial general intelligence (AGI). These are systems, that like humans, can solve a wide range of problems.<br/>There was a fear that when AGI existed scientists \"get to turn on a super-intelligent system that is going to take over the world within minutes\", he said. \"That's you know just preposterously ridiculous.\"<br/>In response to a question from BBC news Prof LeCun said there would be progressive advances - perhaps you might get an AI as powerful as the brain of a rat. That wasn't going take over the world, and he argued \"it's still going to run on a data centre somewhere with an off switch\". He added: \"And if you realise it's not safe you just don't built it\".<br/>It has been argued that AI has the potential to replace many jobs, and some companies have paused recruiting for certain roles as a result. <br/>Prof LeCun told the BBC: \"This is not going to put a lot of people out of work permanently\". But work would change because we have \"no idea\" what the most prominent jobs will be 20 years from now, he said.<br/>Intelligent computers would create \"a new renaissance for humanity\" the way the internet or the printing-press did, he said.<br/>Prof LeCun was speaking Tuesday ahead of a vote on Europe's AI Act which is designed to regulate artificial intelligence.<br/>He said from his conversations with AI start-ups in Europe \"they don't like it at all, they think it's too broad, maybe too restrictive\". But he said he wasn't an expert on the legislation, <br/>Prof LeCun said he was not against regulation - but in his view each application would need its own rules, for example different rules would govern AI systems in cars and those scanning medical images.<br/>Warning using AI for loans and mortgages is big risk<br/>Minister urges caution on AI 'Terminator' warnings<br/>AI 'godfather' feels 'lost' over life's work<br/>AI chatbots 'may soon be more intelligent than us'<br/>African leaders tour Kyiv after air raid alert<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Greece denies coastguard rope led to boat tragedy<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

This is where the focus of strict controls on the tech will be.<br/>But as AI continues to develop quickly, Ms Vestager said there was a need to be pragmatic when it comes to fine-tuning rules around this technology. <br/>\"It's better to get, let's say 80% now than 100% never, so let's get started and then return when we learn and then correct with others,\" she said.<br/>Ms Vestager said there was \"definitely a risk\" that AI could be used to influence the next elections. <br/>She said the challenge for police and intelligence services would be to be \"fully on top\" of a criminal sector where there is a risk they get ahead in the race to utilise the tech. <br/>\"If your social feed can be scanned to get a thorough profile of you, the risk of being manipulated is just enormous,\" she said, \"and if we end up in a situation where we believe nothing, then we have undermined our society completely.\"<br/>Many tech leaders and researchers signed a letter in March calling for a pause in the development of AI systems more powerful than OpenAI's GPT-4. <br/>But Ms Vestager said this was not realistic.<br/>\"No-one can enforce it.

In order for the deal to go through, Microsoft and Activision need approval from regulators in the UK, the EU and the US.<br/>The FTC has argued that the deal would give Microsoft's Xbox console exclusive access to Activision games, leaving competitors Nintendo and Sony out in the cold.<br/>Microsoft and Activision now have until 16 June to submit legal arguments to oppose the preliminary injunction and the FTC will have to reply on 20 June.<br/>Microsoft has said a takeover of Activision would benefit gaming companies and players.<br/>It has offered to sign a legally binding agreement with the FTC to provide Call of Duty games to rivals including Sony for a decade.<br/>The European Commission has approved the acquisition, saying that Microsoft's offer of 10-year free licensing deals - which promise European consumers and cloud game streaming services access to Activision's PC and console games - mean there would be fair competition in the market.<br/>But the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) blocked the deal in April, saying it was concerned the takeover would offer reduced innovation and less choice for gamers.<br/>Microsoft and Activision hit out at the CMA's decision and said they would appeal.<br/>Microsoft president Brad Smith said it marked the company's \"darkest day\" in its four decades of working in Britain.<br/>In response to the announcement by the FTC on Monday, Mr Smith said Microsoft welcomed the \"opportunity to present our case in federal court\" in its attempt to persuade US regulators to allow the deal to be completed.<br/>\"We believe accelerating the legal process in the US will ultimately bring more choice and competition to the market,\" he added.<br/>The purchase of Activision, which also makes Candy Crush, is seen to be important for Microsoft, which is trying to catch up with its main competitor Sony. <br/>However, this attempted investment from Microsoft could be seen as a play for the future of video games, with the firm betting big on its Xbox Game Pass service, which has been described as the \"Netflix of games\".<br/>Microsoft believes the future lies in players having subscriptions to libraries and streaming games through \"cloud gaming\", rather than making one-off purchases - which is the main way of accessing games at the moment.<br/>US moves to block Microsoft's Activision takeover<br/>Microsoft's big deal - what you need to know<br/>Microsoft's $69bn Activision deal approved by EU<br/>Microsoft's Activision takeover blocked in UK<br/>Xbox showcase: Is Microsoft back in the game?<br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

It lets Spotify, YouTube and BBC iPlayer suggest what you might want to play next, and helps Facebook and Twitter decide which social media posts to show users.<br/>AI lets Amazon analyse customers' buying habits to recommend future purchases - and the firm is also using the technology to crack down on fake reviews. <br/>Two powerful AI-driven applications or apps which have become very high profile in recent months are ChatGPT and Snapchat My AI. <br/>They are examples of what is called \"generative\" AI. <br/>This uses the patterns and structures it identifies in vast quantities of source data to generate new and original content which feels like it has been created by a human. <br/>The AI is coupled with a computer programme known as a chatbot, which \"talks\" to human users via text. <br/>The apps can answer questions, tell stories and write computer code. <br/>But both programmes sometimes generate incorrect answers for users, and can reproduce the bias contained in their source material, such as sexism or racism.<br/>With few rules currently in place governing how AI is used, experts have warned that its rapid growth could be dangerous. Some have even said AI research should be halted. <br/>In May, Geoffrey Hinton, widely considered to be one of the godfathers of artificial intelligence, quit his job at Google, warning that AI chatbots could soon be more intelligent than humans.<br/>Later that month, the US-based Center for AI Safety published a statement supported by dozens of leading tech specialists. <br/>They argue AI could be used to generate misinformation that could destabilise society. In the worst-case scenario, they say machines might become so intelligent that they take over, leading to the extinction of humanity.<br/>However, the EU's tech chief Margrethe Vestager told the BBC that AI's potential to amplify bias or discrimination was a more pressing concern. <br/>In particular she is concerned about the role AI could play in making decisions that affect people's livelihoods such as loan applications, adding there was \"definitely a risk\" that AI could be used to influence elections.<br/>Others, including tech pioneer Martha Lane Fox, say we shouldn't get what she calls \"too hysterical\" about AI, urging a more sensible conversation about its capabilities.<br/>Governments around the world are wrestling with how to regulate AI. <br/>Members of the European Parliament have just voted in favour of the EU's proposed Artificial Intelligence Act, which will put in place a strict legal framework for AI, which companies would need to follow. <br/>Margrethe Vestager says \"guardrails\" are needed to counter the biggest risks posed by AI. <br/>The legislation - which is expected to come into effect in 2025 - categorises applications of AI into levels of risk to consumers, with AI-enabled video games or spam filters falling into the lowest risk category.<br/>Higher-risk systems like those used to evaluate credit scores or decide access to housing would face the strictest controls. <br/>These rules will not apply in the UK, where the government set out its vision for the future of AI in March. <br/>It ruled out setting up a dedicated AI regulator, and said instead that existing bodies would be responsible for its oversight.<br/>But Ms Vestager says that AI regulation needs to be a \"global affair\", and wants to build a consensus among \"like-minded\" countries. <br/>US lawmakers have also expressed concern about whether the existing voluntary codes are up to the job.  <br/>Meanwhile, China intends to make companies notify users whenever an AI algorithm is being used.<br/>AI has the potential to revolutionise the world of work, but this raises questions about which roles it might displace. <br/>A recent report by investment bank Goldman Sachs suggested that AI could replace the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs across the globe, as certain tasks and job functions become automated. That equates to a quarter of all the work humans currently do in the US and Europe. <br/>The report highlighted a number of industries and roles that could be affected, including administrative jobs, legal work, architecture, and management.<br/>But it also identified huge potential benefits for many sectors, and predicted that AI could lead to a 7% increase in global GDP. <br/>Some areas of medicine and science are already taking advantage of AI, with doctors using the technology to help spot breast cancers, and scientists using it to develop new antibiotics. <br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Greece denies coastguard rope led to boat tragedy<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Further damage came from the meltdown of several high-profile firms, including FTX, run by the so-called \"Crypto King\" Sam Bankman-Fried, whom prosecutors have accused of conducting \"one of the biggest financial frauds\" in US history.<br/>Jolted by the turmoil, US regulators stepped up their policing of the sector, which authorities say has been on notice since at least 2017 that their activity runs afoul of US financial rules intended to protect investors.<br/>The campaign has yielded a steady drumbeat of charges against crypto firms and executives, alleging violations ranging from failing to register properly with authorities and provide adequate disclosure of their activity to, in some cases, more damaging claims such as mishandling of consumer funds and fraud.<br/>Bitcoin, which represents the biggest chunk of value in a sector in which thousands of currencies have circulated, is viewed by officials as a commodity, like gold. That means it has been largely unaffected by the current regulatory debate, which hinges on the legal question of what constitutes a \"security\" - an investment like a stock or bond that is overseen by the SEC.<br/>The efforts have instead ensnared firms issuing tokens or coins to raise money - and increasingly the exchanges on which such digital assets are bought and sold, which often hold customer funds, execute trades and engage in other activity that is separated in traditional finance. <br/>The crackdown culminated this month in legal actions against two of the biggest platforms: Coinbase and Binance.<br/>Gary Gensler, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, defended the moves this month, comparing the state of affairs in the industry to the 1920s, before the US put in place many of the rules in question: \"Hucksters. Fraudsters. Scam artists. Ponzi schemes. The public left in line at the bankruptcy court.\"<br/>Will Paige, research analyst for Insider Intelligence, says sentiment has soured significantly since 2021, when the industry was worth more than $3 trillion (\u00a32.4tn) by some estimates and seemed poised for wider acceptance.<br/>\"It's very much back on the fringe of finance,\" he says. \"Trust in the system is battered and it's definitely gotten worse.\"<br/>In the wake of the lawsuits, customers yanked billions of dollars of funds. US banks limited their work with Binance, forcing it to stop accepting US dollars and Robinhood, the trading app, said it would stop listing certain assets named in the lawsuits, citing the \"cloud of uncertainty\" surrounding the tokens.<br/>Critics accuse the SEC under Mr Gensler of hostile \"regulation by enforcement\" aimed at boosting his own political profile. <br/>They say that despite repeated efforts by the industry to propose new rules, the agency has refused to acknowledge the distinctions between different types of crypto firms and the characteristics of the technology, like decentralised automated processing, that challenge existing frameworks.<br/>\"It's been a very frustrating experience,\" says Bart Stephens, managing partner of Blockchain Capital, a venture capital firm that has invested in hundreds of crypto firms, some of which he says have been struggling to find banks willing to do business with them. \"There is no doubt a regulatory attack is going on.\"<br/>Bill Hughes, senior counsel of Consensys, a Texas-based software company that uses crypto's blockchain technology, puts it even more bluntly: \"The SEC has essentially determined that on its watch crypto shouldn't exist in the United States anymore.\"<br/>Whether the SEC's moves could actually kill the industry - in which by at least one estimate one in every six Americans has invested - is another question.<br/>Crypto's wider market value remains roughly a third of what it was at its peak. Trading volumes have plunged and developer interest is falling. Trust remains low.  The failures in March of some of the few traditional banks willing to do business with it marked a further blow.<br/>Hilary Allen, a law professor at American University, thinks crypto is inherently susceptible to boom-and-boost cycles and manipulation by insiders, and thinks it should be banned. She says the SEC's actions could help re-confine crypto to the realm of tech enthusiasts, given the wider state of the industry.<br/>\"If we combine these enforcement actions with waning trust from the public, with possibly waning interest from venture capital, then maybe there isn't a future,\" she says. <br/>But Mr Stephens, who has weathered two \"crypto winters\" already, says he thinks the future remains bright - if at risk of ending up overseas, given America's current approach, which is seen as less friendly than other jurisdictions, including the UK and the EU.<br/>He points to Bitcoin's price, which is hovering around 2020 levels, but has gained significantly from the start of the year. Ether has also risen. <br/>Some indicators tracked by venture firm and crypto-investor Andreessen Horowitz, such as the number of addresses active on blockchain and the number of smart contracts being executed, are also climbing.<br/>\"We're not seeing founders stop forming new companies or protocols,\" says Mr Stephens, who says Blockchain Capital invested more money in the first three months of 2023 than in any quarter in the previous 10 years, as prices fell and rival firms backed away from the sector.<br/>Even if the sector thrives outside the US, losing the American market would severely limit its prospects, warns Gina Pieters, a crypto expert who teaches at the University of Chicago.<br/>\"It would be a mistake to think that the US\u2026 could kill the industry. It can absolutely, though, make the crypto industry smaller,\" she says.<br/>Many in crypto are hoping for a reprieve - from the courts, which could decide the SEC has overstepped its authority; from Congress, where draft legislation for the industry is under review; or from a change in the White House, which could prompt a policy reversal.<br/>However those questions get decided, the issues are finally coming to a head, says Angela Walch, a research associate at the University College of London Centre for Blockchain Technologies.<br/>\"We are at a real inflection point,\" she says. \"The showdown is here.\"<br/>Treat cryptocurrency as gambling, MPs say<br/>US sues Coinbase as crypto crackdown widens<br/>NatWest limits crypto transfers over scam fears<br/>African leaders tour Kyiv after air raid alert<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Greece denies coastguard rope led to boat tragedy<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

And this is India, a democratic country,\" Mr Dorsey told the show's hosts Krystal Ball and Saagar Enjeti.<br/>At the height of the farmers' protests against a series of agriculture reform laws, the government had asked Twitter to remove tweets it believed that had used an incendiary hashtag, and accounts it alleged were used by Pakistan-backed Sikh separatist groups.<br/>The request came after the largely peaceful protest had been jolted by violence on 26 January 2021, which left one person dead and hundreds of policemen injured. <br/>Twitter had first blocked some 250 accounts, including those of a news magazine and activists and organisations associated with supporting the year-long protests on the outskirts of capital Delhi.<br/>But six hours later, Twitter restored the accounts, citing \"insufficient justification\" for continuing the suspension.<br/>The Indian government immediately ordered Twitter to block the accounts again and told the company's employees in India that legal action would be taken - which could be up to seven years in prison - if they did not comply. <br/>Twitter responded, saying it would not block accounts belonging to media companies, journalists, activists and politicians because that would \"violate their fundamental right to free expression under the Indian law\".<br/>Relations between Twitter and Mr Modi's government have been downhill ever since. <br/>Critics say that at the heart of this is a new internet law that puts social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook under the direct supervision of the government. The government says the rules are meant to tackle misinformation and hate speech, but experts worry it would lead to censorship.<br/>Mr Musk, who succeeded Mr Dorsey, said in April that \"rules in India for what can appear on social media are quite strict\".<br/>In Monday's interview, Mr Dorsey compared India's actions to those by governments in Turkey and Nigeria, which have briefly restricted the platform in the past.<br/>\"Turkey is very similar [to India], we had so many requests from Turkey. We fought Turkey in their courts and often won, but they threatened to shut us down constantly,\" he said. <br/>\"Nigeria is another example... The situation was such that we could not even put our employees on the ground in the country out of fear of what the government might do to them.\"<br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Instead, existing regulators will come up with new industry guidance.<br/>It marks a contrast with the European Union, which is set to ban public authorities using AI to classify citizens' behaviour, and bring in strict limits on AI-powered facial recognition for law enforcement in public spaces.<br/>The use of AI tools for border management would also be subject to new controls, such as being recorded in an EU-wide register.<br/>In their statement, the campaign groups said the UK's own blueprint had missed a \"vital opportunity\" to beef up safeguards on how government bodies use AI.<br/>In particular, the groups zeroed in on government algorithms often used to help officials make decisions by analysing large amounts of data.<br/>It is thought that some of these tools use machine learning - a widely-used form of AI that can train systems to improve their performance over time. Critics argue this can lead to discrimination if it is based on biased data.<br/>One such system, used by Department of Work and Pensions officials to help identify benefit claimants suspected of fraud, is currently the subject of a legal challenge over concerns it could discriminate against disabled people.<br/>The PLP, which has identified over 40 automated systems used by public bodies, has also launched its own legal action against a Home Office algorithm used to flag suspected sham marriages, which it says could discriminate on the basis of nationality.<br/>Public bodies using such systems have to comply with additional equality rules. But campaigners say it is difficult to know if these are being followed, because authorities fail to give enough information about how they work.<br/>The document sent to MPs called for public bodies to be legally obliged to inform people when AI is used to make decisions, and for the government's algorithm transparency register, currently voluntary, to be mandatory. <br/>It also demanded an \"adequately resourced\" specialist regulator to handle complaints from people adversely affected by decisions.<br/>It also expressed concern about the government's Data Protection Bill, currently going through Parliament, which would widen when legally significant decisions can be made without human oversight.<br/>The government argues current EU-derived rules, dating from 2018, are outdated and could stymie the development of beneficial AI tools.<br/>But Mariano delli Santi, legal and policy officer at the Open Rights Group, said the bill was \"removing or watering down\" existing safeguards, depriving regulators of the tools they need \"when AI goes wrong\".<br/>The technology department, responsible for AI regulation, said the UK's approach would promote \"fairness, explainability and accountability\" in new systems.<br/>In a statement, it added that it was taking an \"adaptable\" approach to designing new rules, which recognised the \"rapid pace of development in AI capabilities\".<br/>Home Office drops 'racist' visa decision algorithm<br/>Stay ahead in AI race, tech boss urges West<br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

And that is why this week's European Parliament debate on how the technology is regulated is so important. But how could AI be made safe? Here are five of the challenges ahead.<br/>The European Parliament has taken two years to come up with a definition of an AI system - software that can \"for a given set of human-defined objectives, generate outputs such as content, predictions, recommendations or decisions influencing the environments they interact with\". <br/>This week, it is voting on its Artificial Intelligence Act - the first legal rules of their kind on AI, which go beyond voluntary codes and require companies to comply.  <br/>Former UK Office for Artificial Intelligence head Sana Kharaghani points out the technology has no respect for borders. <br/>\"We do need to have international collaboration on this - I know it will be hard,\" she tells BBC News. \"This is not a domestic matter. These technologies don't sit within the boundaries of one country <br/>But there remains no plan for a global, United-Nations-style AI regulator - although, some have suggested it - and different territories have different ideas:<br/>\"If people trust it, then they'll use it,\" International Business Machines (IBM) Corporation EU government and regulatory affairs head Jean-Marc Leclerc says.<br/>There are enormous opportunities for AI to improve people's lives in incredible ways. It is already:<br/>But what about screening job applicants or predicting how likely someone is to commit crime?<br/>The European Parliament wants the public informed about the risks attached to each AI product. <br/>Companies that break its rules could be fined the greater of \u20ac30m or 6% of global annual turnover. <br/>But can developers predict or control how their product might be used?<br/>So far, AI has been largely self-policed.<br/>The big companies say they are on board with government regulation - \"critical\" to mitigate the potential risks, according to Sam Altman, boss of ChatGPT creator OpenAI. <br/>But will they put profits before people if they become too involved in writing the rules?<br/>You can bet they want to be as close as possible to the lawmakers tasked with setting out the regulations.<br/>And Lastminute.com founder Baroness Lane-Fox says it is important to listen not just to corporations. <br/>\"We must involve civil society, academia, people who are affected by these different models and transformations,\" she says.<br/>Microsoft, which has invested billions of dollars in ChatGPT, wants it to \"take the drudgery out of work\". <br/>It can generate human-like prose and text responses but, Mr Altman points out, is \"a tool, not a creature\".<br/>Chatbots are supposed to make workers more productive.<br/>And in some industries, AI has the capacity to create jobs and be a formidable assistant.<br/>But others have already lost them - last month, BT announced AI would replace 10,000 jobs.  <br/>ChatGPT came into public use just over six months ago.<br/>Now, it can write essays, plan people's holidays and pass professional exams. <br/>The capability of these large-scale language models is growing at a phenomenal rate.<br/>And two of the three AI \"godfathers\" - Geoffrey Hinton and Prof Yoshua Bengio - have been among those to warn the technology has huge potential for harm. <br/>The Artificial Intelligence Act will not come into force until at least 2025 -  \"way too late\", EU technology chief Margrethe Vestager says. <br/>She is drawing up an interim voluntary code for the sector, alongside the US, which could be ready within weeks.<br/>What is AI and is it dangerous?<br/>Stay ahead in AI race, tech boss urges West<br/>Minister urges caution on AI 'Terminator' warnings<br/>Powerful AI ban possible, government adviser warns<br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

That can include the author's relationship with other online accounts, their sign-in activity, review history, and any unusual behaviour.<br/>\"We use machine learning to look for suspicious accounts, to track the relationships between a purchasing account that's leaving a review and someone selling that product,\" Dharmesh Mehta, the head of Amazon's customer trust team, told the BBC.<br/>\"Through a combination of both important vetting and really advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence - that's looking at different signals or behaviours - we can stop those fake reviews before a customer ever encounters it,\" he said.<br/>Harry Kind from Which? said in the UK some estimates suggest around one in seven online consumer reviews are fake. <br/>\"Amazon has been trying all sorts of technology to crack down on fake reviews and by all accounts that's having some success.<br/>\"But as far as we're concerned, it's still nowhere near enough to solve this huge problem,\" he said.<br/>Fake reviews made consumers more than twice as likely to choose poor-quality products, the consumer group said.<br/>As a result of the new methods it had developed, Amazon said it had blocked over 200 million suspected fake reviews last year and would \"continue to build sophisticated tools that protect customers\".<br/>But the retail platform is calling for more cooperation between the private sector, consumer groups and governments to make the strategy more effective.<br/>The Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Bill that is currently going through the UK parliament is expected to strengthen the legal powers available to the regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) in this area.<br/>Which? welcomed Amazon's call for a more collaborative approach, but called for the UK legislation to go further than currently envisaged \"by explicitly making the buying, selling and hosting of fake reviews subject to criminal enforcement.\"<br/>It said fake review \"factories\" on Facebook that trade reviews for Amazon and other sites were still easy to find. <br/>The CMA said it had already taken significant action against fake and misleading reviews and those who trade them.<br/>A spokesperson for the CMA said: \"Our investigations relating to fake reviews - including the case into Amazon - are ongoing and further updates will come later this year.\"<br/>In the UK, Amazon recently took legal action against the operators of NiceRebate.com, a fake review broker aimed at British customers. <br/>Other websites run by the same operators were also shut down, with simultaneous legal action taken against them in the US.<br/>\"We are aggressively fighting review brokers,\" said Mr Mehta.<br/>Amazon had taken legal action against 94 such \"bad actors\" he said, including fraudsters in the US, China and Europe. <br/>Amazon to pay $25m over child privacy violations<br/>New rules ban subscription traps and fake reviews<br/>Amazon to cut another 9,000 jobs<br/>Amazon to axe 18,000 jobs as it cuts costs<br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

which promise European consumers and cloud game streaming services access to Activision's PC and console games - mean there would be fair competition in the market.<br/>But the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) blocked the deal in April, saying it was concerned the takeover would offer reduced innovation and less choice for gamers.<br/>Microsoft and Activision hit out at the decision and said they would appeal.<br/>Microsoft president Brad Smith said it marked the company's \"darkest day\" in its four decades of working in the country.<br/>In response to the announcement by the FTC, Mr Smith said Microsoft welcomed the \"opportunity to present our case in federal court\" in its attempt to persuade US regulators to allow the deal to be completed.<br/>\"We believe accelerating the legal process in the US will ultimately bring more choice and competition to the market,\" he added.<br/>In December last year, the FTC had asked an in-house administrative judge to block the deal on antitrust grounds, arguing it would give Microsoft's Xbox exclusive access to Activision games, leaving Nintendo consoles and Sony's PlayStation out in the cold.<br/>William Kovacic, former FTC chair and non-executive director at the UK's CMA, said the FTC had expressed concerns that Microsoft and Activision might close their deal despite UK opposition, and so asked a judge to halt it.<br/>\"The EU's decision to take a settlement was a bit of a surprise,\" he told the BBC's Wake up to Money programme<br/>Mr Kovacic said there was still a chance the takeover could be completed, but added \"the chance is diminished\".<br/>The purchase of Activision, which also makes Candy Crush, is seen to be important for Microsoft, which is trying to play catch-up with its main competitor Sony. <br/>However, this attempted investment from Microsoft could be seen as a play for the future of games, with the firm betting big on its Xbox Game Pass service, which has been described as the \"Netflix of games\".<br/>Microsoft believes the future lies in players having subscriptions to libraries and streaming games through \"cloud gaming\", rather than making one-off purchases -

What might take a human copywriter between 60 and 90 minutes to write, the AI could do in 10 minutes or less.<br/>Around four months after the AI was introduced, Mr Meadowcroft's four-strong team was laid off.<br/>Mr Meadowcroft can't be certain, but he's pretty sure the AI replaced them.<br/>\"I did laugh-off the idea of AI replacing writers, or affecting my job, until it did,\" he said.<br/>The latest wave of AI hit late last year when OpenAI launched ChatGPT.<br/>Backed by Microsoft, ChatGPT can give human-like responses to questions and can, in minutes, generate essays, speeches, even recipes.<br/>Other tech giants are scrambling to launch their own systems - Google launched Bard in March.<br/>While not perfect, such systems are trained on the ocean of data available on the internet - an amount of information impossible for even a team of humans to digest.<br/>So that's left many wondering which jobs might be at risk.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>Earlier this year, a report from Goldman Sachs said that AI could potentially replace the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs.<br/>Any job losses would not fall equally across the economy. According to the report, 46% of tasks in administrative and 44% in legal professions could be automated, but only 6% in construction and 4% in maintenance.<br/>The report also points out that the introduction of AI could boost productivity and growth and might create new jobs.<br/>There is some evidence of that already. <br/>This month IKEA said that, since 2021, it has retrained 8,500 staff who worked in its call centres as design advisers.<br/>The furniture giant says that 47% of customer calls are now handled by an AI called Billie. <br/>While IKEA does not see any job losses resulting from its use of AI, such developments are making many people worried.<br/>A recent survey by Boston Consulting Group (BCG), which polled 12,000 workers from around the world, found that a third were worried that they would be replaced at work by AI, with frontline staff more concerned than managers. <br/>Jessica Apotheker from BCG says that's partly due to fear of the unknown. <br/>\"When you look at leaders and managers, we have more than 80% of them that use AI at least on a weekly basis. When you look at frontline staff, that number drops to 20% so with the lack of familiarity with the tech comes much more anxiety and concern on the outcomes for them.\"<br/>But perhaps there is good reason to be anxious.<br/>For three months last year, Alejandro Graue had been doing voiceover work for a popular YouTube channel.<br/>It seemed to be a promising line of work, a whole YouTube channel in English had to be re-voiced in Spanish. <br/>Mr Graue went on holiday late last year confident that there would be work when he returned.<br/>\"I was expecting to have that money to live with - I have two daughters, so I need the money,\" he says.<br/>But to his surprise, before he returned to work, the YouTube channel uploaded a new video in Spanish - one he had not worked on.<br/>\"When I clicked on it, what I heard was not my voice, but an AI generated voice - a very badly synced voiceover. It was terrible. And I was like, What is this? Is this like going to be my new partner in crime like the channel? Or is this going to replace me?\" he says.<br/>A phone call to the studio he worked for confirmed the worst. The client wanted to experiment with AI because it was cheaper and faster.<br/>That experiment turned out to be a failure. Viewers complained about the quality of the voiceover and eventually the channel took down the videos that featured the AI-generated voice.<br/>But Mr Graue did not find that very comforting. He thinks the technology will only improve and wonders where that will leave voiceover artists like him.<br/>\"If this starts to happen in every job that I have, what should I do? Should I buy a farm? I don't know.  What other job could I look for that is not going to be replaced as well in the future? It's very complicated,\" he says.<br/>If AI is not coming for your job then it is likely you might have to start working with one in some way.<br/>After a few months of freelance work, former copywriter Dean Meadowcroft took a new direction.<br/>He now works for an employee assistance provider, which gives wellbeing and mental health advice to staff. Working with AI is now part of his job.<br/>\"I think that is where the future is for AI, giving quick access to human-led content, as opposed to completely eliminating that human aspect,\" he says.<br/>You can see the full interviews with Dean Meadowcroft and Alejandro Graue on Talking Business with Aaron Heslehurst on BBC News.<br/>Viewers in the UK can watch on BBC iPlayer from 11:30 on Saturday.

I asked him if it's good to be tailoring again and he gives me a big smile.<br/>Mr Zaitoun's work is a small part of Amsterdam's effort to become a circular economy.<br/>A traditional industrial economy uses raw materials to make products which are discarded when they are no longer wanted, sometimes before the end of their useful lives. <br/>The circular economy aims to break the link between economic activity and using up the earth's resources. This may involve reusing, repairing, and sharing materials and products. <br/>\"Circularity is the hottest topic in the fashion industry right now,\" says Thami Schweichler, chief executive at URC, an organisation he set up through his social enterprise Makers Unite, a creative textile platform.<br/>\"Every brand is looking at how they can be sustainable. Repairs will be part of the future of circularity for brands.\" <br/>There needs to be a systematic solution if change is to happen, he says. \"It's not going to happen through the consumer.\" <br/>Currently working with five brands including Patagonia, Scotch & Soda and Decathlon, companies send garments needing to be repaired to URC, which aims to fix goods within a week. <br/>Turning around over 400 repairs a week, or roughly 20,000 a year, Mr Schweichler says the target is to reach 200,000 repairs per year by 2026.<br/>Swelled by the rise of fast fashion, the clothing industry is known to be one of the most wasteful sectors, with three-quarters of our clothing ending up burned or buried in landfill, according to the World Economic Forum.<br/>According to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, clothing production doubled from 2000 to 2015 while there was a 40% drop in the amount of time clothing was worn. <br/>While sustainability is on the agenda across many countries, in the Netherlands the government has set out bold plans to make the economy circular as quickly as possible.<br/>In 2020 the Amsterdam declared itself the first city in the world to commit to building a circular economy, focusing on food and organic waste streams, consumer goods, and the built environment.<br/>In seven years' time Amsterdam plans to have halved its use of new raw materials. By 2050, the ambition is to be fully circular - relying only on used and recycled materials.<br/>That will be a big challenge for the construction industry, which is responsible for more than 30% of the extraction of natural resources and 25% of solid waste generated in the world. <br/>One Dutch start-up, Madaster, is hoping to make a small dent in those statistics.<br/>It has created an online registry capturing the materials used in Amsterdam's buildings, as well as information about how they can be reused at the end of their life. <br/>\"The built environment uses a lot of materials and energy to create products,\" says director Pablo van den Bosch. \"Instead of waste and make, if we can instead reuse, it's good for carbon emissions and good for decreasing waste.\"<br/>He says Madaster worked together with the Amsterdam authorities to create a digital overview of the buildings across the city. \"If the city wants to redevelop an area they have insights into what materials they can save and perhaps use the materials already there instead of tearing it down.\"<br/>More technology of business:<br/>He points to the Olympic office in Amsterdam Zuid, which was completely refurbished rather than knocked down. \"Natural stone was removed from the fa\u00e7ade and used for flooring in the same building.\"<br/>Despite innovations like this, there is a long way to go. <br/>The Circular Economy Progress Report 2022 by PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency found that while \"policy efforts thus far have laid a foundation and developed a structure for a circular economy in the Netherlands\u2026 the Dutch economy still functions mainly in a linear fashion\".<br/>\"I'm afraid that the country and the city aren't meeting targets,\" says Willem van Winden, professor of urban economic innovation at Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences.<br/>\"The problem is that circular model and practices right now are costlier than linear ones. Unless the government implements stricter measures I'm afraid it will not happen. You need massive investment to make circular economy happen. A lot of businesses won't make the transition unless legislation forces them to.\" <br/>Nevertheless, Amsterdam is setting up initiatives to encourage start-ups to make a bigger splash in the circular economy sector.<br/>One initiative launched together with AMS Institute and venture capital accelerator Rockstart is Amsterdam Circular, a two-month programme designed to help 20 early-stage firms find funding. <br/>\"There was a clear need for the city to support early-stage start-ups and scale up financing,\" says Guy Vincent, programme lead at Amsterdam Circular. \"The programme is designed to support start-ups developing circular solutions in areas such as food, energy, mobilisation, construction and climate resilience.\" <br/>He says start-ups in the circular economy space face more challenges than other new firms.<br/>\"They are typically higher risk with lower profits as they can be testing new business models that are more complex and often not proven. Traditional VCs can be hesitant to invest in them. We want to try and find ideal financing models for circular companies. Co-financing is needed, i.e. private sector and a blend of public funds.\"<br/>Dutch electronics manufacturer Fairphone is one company that has managed to establish itself in the circular economy space.<br/>It encourages its customers to keep their phones as long as possible and makes the phones relatively easy to fix.<br/>\"Keeping the phone in longer use is the highest impact you can make in this product category,\" says Eva Gouwens, chief executive of Fairphone.<br/>She points out that 75% of carbon emissions happen at production. <br/>\"The average lifetime of a device is two to three years. If we can extend to at least every five years, then you only need half the materials.\" <br/>Fairphone also offers a recycling programme, encouraging customers to hand in their old phone in return for at least \u20ac50. \"We can use modules or at least components for repairing other devices. Many phones are sat in drawers or go to landfill,\" she says.<br/>Prof van Winden is encouraged by the companies developing circular models, but has this observation about the circular economy: \"For now it's mainly the upmarket segments and they're often expensive products for richer people.\"<br/>African leaders tour Kyiv after air raid alert<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Greece denies coastguard rope led to boat tragedy<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Why aren't more wiped and reused?", "author": "By Sean McManus", "datePublished": "2023-06-05 23:01:04", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:23:47.680833", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/6FC2/production/_129801682_gettyimages-464612641.jpg", "body": "Millions of storage devices are being shredded each year, even though they could be reused. \"You don't need an engineering degree to understand that's a bad thing,\" says Jonmichael Hands.<br/>He is the secretary and treasurer of the Circular Drive Initiative (CDI), a partnership of technology companies promoting the secure reuse of storage hardware. He also works at Chia Network, which provides a blockchain technology. <br/>Chia Network could easily reuse storage devices that large data centres have decided they no longer need. In 2021, the company approached IT Asset Disposition (ITAD) firms, who dispose of old technology for businesses that no longer need it. The answer came back: \"Sorry, we have to shred old drives.\"<br/>\"What do you mean, you destroy them?\" says Mr Hands, relating the story. \"Just erase the data, and then sell them! They said the customers wouldn't let them do that. One ITAD provider said they were shredding five million drives for a single customer.\" <br/>Storage devices are typically sold with a five-year warranty, and large data centres retire them when the warranty expires. Drives that store less sensitive data are spared, but the CDI estimates that 90% of hard drives are destroyed when they are removed. <br/>The reason? \"The cloud service providers we spoke to said security, but what they actually meant was risk management,\" says Mr Hands. \"They have a zero-risk policy. It can't be one in a million drives, one in 10 million drives, one in 100 million drives that leaks. It has to be zero.\"<br/>The irony is that shredding devices is relatively risky today. The latest drives have 500,000 tracks of data per square inch. A sophisticated data recovery person could take a piece as small as 3mm and read the data off it, Mr Hands says.<br/>Last year, the IEEE Standards Association approved its Standard for Sanitizing Storage. It describes three methods for removing data from devices, a process known as sanitisation. <br/>The least secure method is \"clear\". All the data is deleted, but it could be recovered using specialist tools. It's good enough if you want to reuse the drive within your company. <br/>The most extreme method is to destroy the drives through melting or incineration. Data can never be recovered, and nor can the drive or its materials.<br/>Between the two sits a secure option for re-use: purging. When the drive is purged, data recovery is unfeasible using state-of-the-art tools and techniques. <br/>There are several ways a drive can be purged. Hard drives can be overwritten with new patterns of data, for example, which can then be checked to make sure the original data has gone. With today's storage capacities, it can take a day or two.<br/>By comparison a cryptographic erase takes just a couple of seconds. Many modern drives have built-in encryption, so that the data on them can only be read if you have the encryption key. If that key is deleted, all the data is scrambled. It's still there, but it's impossible to read. The drive is safe to resell.<br/>Seagate is a leading provider of data storage solutions, and a founding member of the CDI. \"If we can universally, among all of our customers, trust that that we have secure erase, then drives can be returned to use,\" says Amy Zuckerman, sustainability and transformation director at Seagate. \"That is happening, but on a very small scale.\"<br/>In its 2022 financial year, Seagate refurbished and resold 1.16 million hard drives and solid-state drives (SSDs), avoiding more than 540 tonnes of electronic waste (e-waste). That includes drives that were returned under their warranty and drives that were bought back from customers.<br/>A pilot take-back programme in Taiwan recovered three tonnes of e-waste. The challenge now, Ms Zuckerman says, is to scale the programme up. <br/>Refurbished drives are tested, recertified and sold with a five or seven-year warranty. \"We are seeing small data centres and cryptocurrency mining operations pick them up,\" she says. \"Our successes have been on a smaller scale, and I think that's probably true for others engaged in this work too.\"<br/>There are no projections for how many times each drive can be refurbished and reused. \"Right now, we are just looking at that double use,\" Ms Zuckerman says.<br/>There is huge potential for such schemes. A large proportion of the 375 million hard drives sold by all companies in 2018 are now ending their warranty.<br/>For drives that can't be reused, Seagate looks first at parts extraction and then materials recycling. In the Taiwan pilot programme, 57% of the material was recycled, made up of magnets and aluminium. Innovation is needed across the industry to help recover more of the 61 chemical elements used in the drives, Ms Zuckerman says.<br/>The principle of sanitising and reusing hardware also applies to other devices, including routers. \"Just because a company has a policy of replacing something over three years, it doesn't mean it's defunct for the entire world,\" says Tony Anscombe, the chief security evangelist at IT security company ESET. <br/>\"A large internet service provider (ISP) may well be decommissioning some enterprise grade routers that a smaller ISP would dream of having.\" <br/>More technology of business:<br/>It's important to have a decommissioning process that secures the devices, though. ESET bought some second-hand core routers, the type used in corporate networks. Only five out of 18 routers had been wiped properly. The rest contained information about the network, applications or customers that could be valuable to hackers. All had enough data to identify the original owners.<br/>One of the routers had been sent to an e-waste disposal company, who had apparently sold it on without removing the data. ESET contacted the original owner. \"They were very shocked,\" says Mr Anscombe. \"Companies should sanitise devices themselves as best as they can, even if they're using a sanitisation and e-waste company.\"<br/>Mr Anscombe recommends companies test the process of sanitising devices while they're still under support. If anything is unclear, help is available from the manufacturer then. He also suggests saving all documentation needed for the process in case the manufacturer removes it from their website. <br/>Before sanitisation, Mr Anscombe says companies should make and store a back-up of the device. If any data does leak, it's easier to understand then what has been lost. <br/>Finally, companies should make it easy for people to report security leaks. Mr Anscombe says it was hard to notify companies of what they had found on their old routers.<br/>How can companies be sure the data has gone from a device? \"Give it to a security researcher and ask them what they can find,\" says Mr Anscombe. \"A lot of cyber-security teams will have someone who understands how to take the lid off and see if the device was fully sanitised.\"<br/>By knowing how to clean the data from devices, companies can send them for reuse or recycling with confidence. \"The days of the 'take-make-waste' linear economy need to be over,\" says Seagate's Ms Zuckerman.<br/>African leaders tour Kyiv after air raid alert<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Greece denies coastguard rope led to boat tragedy<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

People who would kill him.<br/>\"This is the only game I've ever seen that actually confuses my brain into thinking it's real,\" reads the top comment below the YouTube video of gameplay from Unrecord, an upcoming title by French indie game studio Drama.<br/>The video chalked up millions of views in just a few weeks and caused a sensation in the games industry. Some commentators on social media questioned if it really was a game and, if so, whether it was actually a little too real - too raw - an experience.<br/>Drama declined an interview with the BBC, saying: \"We are currently busy with investors and publishers.\"<br/>But graphics in many different games have been getting noticeably more sophisticated, arguably approaching what's known as \"photorealism\" - indistinguishable from photos or videos of the real world.<br/>The Unrecord demo looks so lifelike partly thanks to some clever techniques, says Piers Harding-Rolls, head of games research at Ampere Analytics.<br/>Mr Harding-Rolls points to the shaky camera, which imitates actual crime scene footage. The dull lighting, grittiness and urban bustle audible in the background all help, too.<br/>But could it make some people uncomfortable?<br/>\"That setting for it is quite reminiscent of some of the more horrendous footage you get out of real life,\" notes Mr Harding-Rolls. <br/>In a statement posted on Twitter, Drama said the game is not inspired by specific real-life events.<br/>Also, look closely at still images from the video and it's possible to see some objects and textures that don't look realistic at all. This might not matter - but it does undermine the idea that the game is photorealistic.<br/>Mr Harding-Rolls points out that, in general, advances in graphics matter for the games industry: \"Consumers definitely want that. They love looking at things and thinking, 'Wow, this looks amazing'.\"<br/>Rachel McDonnell, professor in creative technologies, Trinity College Dublin agrees that the Unrecord video is impressive, though she notes that certain character animations are a little clunky.<br/>They call to mind the movement of characters in other games falling over and dying in pre-programmed sequences.<br/>\"Animation hasn't caught up with the rendering at all in games yet,\" she says, adding that crowds are particularly tricky to make lifelike.<br/>\"You'll still see them doing very strange behaviour, running around in circles and getting stuck - that instantly breaks you from your presence in the game.\"<br/>Experiments she and her colleagues have conducted suggest that, for players' immersion in games, how an on-screen character looks is much less important than how they move.<br/>Marc Whitten, president of Create Solutions at game software firm Unity notes that today's most realistic content relies on highly-detailed 3D modelling of objects.<br/>Last year, Unity showed off a computer generated clip of a lion and its cub featuring two million individually rendered strands of fur.<br/>\"If you don't do that, it does not come across as photorealism,\" argues Mr Whitten. The firm has also developed highly lifelike models of humans, where digital puppetry controls their subtle facial expressions.<br/>There's still room for improvement, he adds. There are many other difficult-to-simulate materials, such as clothing, which are still a long way from looking photorealistic in games.<br/>One important emerging technology for game graphics is neural radiance fields, or NeRFs. California-based Luma AI specialises in this and says it already has customers using the tech to make games.<br/>A NeRF is an artificial intelligence (AI) system that can represent objects or scenery captured in photographs or video footage in the real world. <br/>\"When you show it these images from different sides, the network learns how light is bouncing off of everything,\" explains Luma AI co-founder Amit Jain. \"It measures light and it learns from light.\"<br/>The way light reflects off a motorbike's leather seat versus a headlamp, for example, is completely different and simulating that in a game is very challenging. Nerfs could help to automate the process.<br/>Some of the best game graphics today use what's known as ray-tracing - accurate simulations of the way light bounces off surfaces or creates glowing effects around neon signs and so on. <br/>AI is making it possible to produce these effects in games despite only modest improvements in chip performance, says Bryan Catanzaro, vice president of applied deep learning research, Nvidia.<br/>\"We have to be smarter in how we construct the world and how we render it,\" he explains.<br/>A new mode for Cyberpunk 2077, an action-adventure game, called Ray Tracing: Overdrive, demonstrates the difference this can make.<br/>Nvidia says its Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) technology allows developers to create high resolution, high frame-rate graphics featuring ray-tracing with the help of AI.<br/>\"The model's trained to know what things in the real-world look like,\" explains Mr Catanzaro.<br/>Games are increasingly difficult to tell apart from real life at times, says Nick Penwarden, vice president of engineering, Epic Games.<br/>However he says it is still very hard to render certain materials convincingly - such as an iridescent layer of oil on a puddle of water.<br/>\"Those are aspects that we don't yet have the power to simulate in real time,\" he says.<br/>And doing that on games consoles or home PCs is what matters. For movies featuring computer generated imagery, it's possible to use huge computers and take many minutes or more to render individual frames.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>The most popular games of the future might not need to be photorealistic. Consider Minecraft or Epic's own Fortnite - both enormously successful, both very far from photoreal. <br/>Improved lighting effects and material simulations help artists working on all kinds of games, though, argues Mr Penwarden. It can give stylised or cartoonish environments more depth and complexity, too.<br/>\"One of the great benefits about having the ability to do photoreal images is the tech can start to do a lot of the work for you,\" he says.<br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

But victims of her crimes should not get their hopes up about recouping their cash.<br/>They say restitution in the US has become largely symbolic, meaning Holmes' investors - and many less wealthy victims of fraud - are unlikely to get most of the money they are owed. <br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: The rise and fall of Elizabeth Holmes<br/>\"There are very few people - the Bernie Madoffs of the world and everyone else - that can pay the full amount of criminal restitution,\" says Ryan O'Neill, a former federal prosecutor. \"It's sort of a fake number.\"<br/>Holmes will still be expected to try to pay these people and others she defrauded, she adds. Prosecutors have probably already begun to seize her assets, including money in the bank and properties. They will compare their own accounts of how much money she has to what she claims she possesses, which could lead to disputes, Ms O'Neill said. <br/>The Theranos founder's debts won't pause when she sets foot behind bars. <br/>A judge has recommended Holmes report to Federal Prison Camp in Bryan, Texas, where all inmates are obligated to work and make between 12 cents and $1.15 an hour. <br/>Half of the small sum she earns - usually around $25 every four months - will go to her victims, said Randy Zelin, a professor at Cornell Law School. <br/>Once her time in prison is finished, she will still not be able to purchase any large assets, including a home, without intervention from the federal government. The government can't, however, seize assets owned solely by her husband, hotel heir William Evans. <br/>Holmes has acknowledged her dismal financial fate, telling the New York Times this month she will \"have to work for the rest of my life\" just to pay millions of dollars in legal fees. <br/>But there are a number of reasons why her victims and many others are unlikely to get the money back. <br/>Criminal defendants don't have an incentive to \"make it rich\" again, said Ms O'Neill. \"They know where the money is going to go.\" <br/>Others may attempt to hide assets. University of Michigan Law School professor John Pottow says some try to put money in trusts to avoid asset seizures. \"The richer you get, the easier it is to construct legal devices that hide your wealth.\" <br/>Experts pointed to the case of conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who has been ordered to pay nearly $1.5bn to families of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting for spreading lies about the massacre, which they said has led to harassment. <br/>Mr Jones - who has declared both personal and business bankruptcy - has been accused of funnelling money to friends and family in an attempt to hide his assets. <br/>Ms O'Neill said that although prosecutors will be tracking Mr Jones' moves, the Sandy Hook families - who are not as wealthy as the victims of Holmes - are unlikely to receive much money from the right-wing InfoWars host, whom she said will be paying most of his funds to his lawyers. <br/>In lower profile cases, the US government does not have the resources or the time to investigate every defendant's assets, sometimes putting the onus on victims to track their financial moves, Mr Zelin said. <br/>But the headline-making nature of Holmes' fraud - as well as her recent financial choices, including living in a $13,000 a month Silicon Valley estate - means former Theranos investors are more likely to keep watch over her and push prosecutors to get them their money back, experts said. <br/>\"They're not going to stop looking,\" Ms O'Neill said. \"She's not going to be able to put a dollar in her bank account\u2026 without the government seizing it.\"<br/>Inside the routine at Elizabeth Holmes' prison<br/>Elizabeth Holmes to begin jail sentence this month<br/>The prison experience Holmes is desperate to avoid<br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

And it would take less time than Kenneth Branagh's film version of Hamlet.<br/>\"We can do this in less than four hours,\" explains Raymond Decorvet, who works in business development at MAN ES. \"Or we could freeze the whole thing in about 11 hours.\"<br/>Theirs is among the largest heat pump units in the world. Heat pumps work by compressing gently warmed refrigerants to raise the temperature of these fluids. That heat can then be passed on to homes or industrial machinery.<br/>Heat pumps require electricity to work but can produce around three or four kilowatt hours of heat for every kilowatt hour of power they consume.<br/>Heat pumps are increasingly popular with some home owners but domestic devices are relatively small and tend to have outputs of several kilowatts or so. MAN ES's biggest commercial heat pump is thousands of times more powerful - with a total heating capacity of 48 megawatts (MW). <br/>It can produce temperatures of up to 150C and heat thousands of homes, not just one. The company recently installed two of these machines in the port city of Esbjerg, in Denmark.<br/>In this installation, the heat pumps' CO2 refrigerant will absorb a small amount of heat from seawater. Compressors boost the temperature of the CO2 and the system can then transfer this heat, providing water of up to 90C to a district heating system serving 27,000 households.<br/>\"The demand for district heating is exploding,\" says Mr Decorvet. An urgency to move away from fossil fuels is leading to a rush - particularly in Europe - for bigger and beefier heat pump systems that can power entire towns. But who has the biggest, megawatts-wise?<br/>It might seem like a relatively straightforward question but it is actually quite tricky to answer definitively. Not least because heat pumps don't tend to work at maximum capacity all the time. In Esbjerg, MAN ES's heat pumps will run at about half their potential output, for instance.<br/>And trying to compare the world's largest heat pump systems is difficult because, often, they are made up of multiple smaller heat pumps chained together. Take the district heating system in Stockholm, Sweden, often referred to as the largest heat pump set-up in the world.<br/>This is probably true, it has a maximum capacity of 215MW - but that total is the sum of seven heat pumps, two 40MW and five 27MW devices, a spokesman for energy provider Stockholm Exergi explains.<br/>Elsewhere in Sweden, Gothenburg has a 160MW heat pump system that consists of four units. Two of them are actually bigger than those in Stockholm, with capacities of 50MW each.<br/>They have been in operation since 1986 and probably hold the title of the most powerful individual heat pumps currently in use, though they are clearly rivalled by newer devices such as those made by MAN ES. <br/>Last year, German chemicals firm BASF and MAN ES announced their intention to build a 120MW heat pump that would, reports suggested, be the world's largest. <br/>It would have provided heat for industrial uses at a site in Ludwigshafen. However, it was not to be. \"BASF has decided not to proceed with the project,\" a spokesman told the BBC. The firm is exploring other potential heat sources instead, which it hopes will be more economically attractive.<br/>Size isn't necessarily everything, notes Dave Pearson, group sustainable development director at Star Refrigeration. Efficiency matters and he argues that ammonia - his firm's choice of refrigerant - helps to make heat pumps particularly efficient. <br/>Veronika Wilk at the Austrian Institute of Technology and colleagues have studied the use of heat pumps for industrial applications, to provide heat in pharmaceutical, food or paper factories, for example. <br/>So long as they don't require very high temperatures beyond 200C, companies are increasingly turning to heat pumps, Dr Wilk argues, because it allows them to move away from natural gas, which has become extremely expensive following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.<br/>But industrial heat pumps tend to be merely several MW in capacity or so. You are more likely to spot truly giant heat pumps in a district heating system, such as those mentioned above, says Dr Wilk.<br/>\"The beauty of district heating is that you can decarbonise a lot of households at once,\" she adds.<br/>There are many other examples of heat pump-powered district heating systems springing up. In Vienna, a 55MW system using three heat pumps is due to go live this autumn.<br/>The machines will harvest heat, around 6C, from treated wastewater, explains Linda Kirchberger, division manager asset decarbonisation and new technologies at Wien Energie. <br/>The treated water used to go straight into a river. \"Now it does a detour and we take it through the heat pump system,\" she says.<br/>The system will lift temperatures from 6C to 90C and the heat will go on to supply 56,000 households. In 2027, Wien Energie plans to double the system's capacity with three more heat pumps, reaching 110MW in total.<br/>While still impressive, and weighing more than 200 tonnes each, these individual units have a capacity of less than 20MW. The manufacturer, Johnson Controls, confirmed to the BBC that its largest heat pumps have a maximum output of 28MW.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>A similar system, also using heat from wastewater, is planned in Hamburg, according to reports. It will have a capacity of 60MW, though this too will rely on multiple heat pumps linked together, a spokeswoman for Hamburg Wasser, the water company involved in the project, says.<br/>But keep an eye on the future. In the Finnish capital Helsinki, a plan is afoot to construct a gargantuan heat pump system with a total capacity of 500MW. <br/>This will likely be comprised of multiple units, as in Stockholm, Gothenburg and Esbjerg, but Helen, the energy company behind the scheme, has not yet revealed how it will all come together.<br/>MAN ES is one firm bidding for the contract. A spokesman declined to explain exactly what configuration of heat pumps would allow the company to provide 500MW of heat. Mr Decorvet says, simply, \"I hope we are going to win.\"<br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

These range from paralysis and blindness to depression and schizophrenia. <br/>The procedure would involve implanting a tiny hermetically sealed chip directly into a patient's brain. <br/>The chip is connected to 1,024 tiny electrodes, no thicker than a human hair and is powered by a battery that can be recharged wirelessly. It would create an interface with an external computer, allowing it to both send and receive signals.<br/>There are three elements to this: short term physical risks; long term medical concerns; and ethical safety. <br/>Any surgery involving the brain carries inherent danger, both of physical harm and rejection by the host. There has been extensive (and controversial) testing of the chips on animals. <br/>A complaint filed in February to the US Department of Agriculture alleged cruel treatment of macaque monkeys who are being used to test the technology. <br/>The fact that the FDA has approved the start of human testing, however, implies the company has overcome some of the challenges. <br/>Maybe the more serious concerns come around the long-term consequences of having a device like this operating within the human brain, a vastly complex organ we are only beginning to understand. <br/>Understandably there is no data as to what the potential harms may be. That will change with testing on humans and will be key to the development of similar products. <br/>The final element, ethical safety, is more subjective. Technology like this is riven with concerns about data protection, potential uses and the possibility of human enhancement. <br/>This means augmenting or enhancing the capabilities of the human brain beyond what we are currently capable of doing. For example, improving human cognition, sensory perception, or physical abilities. This always stirs strong emotions and raises ethical questions so there will be calls for close regulation of the sector.<br/>The firm was founded in California by Elon Musk and a team of seven scientists and engineers in 2016.  But of last year, of the eight cofounders, only two remained at the company.<br/>Elon Musk brings an entrepreneurial approach to tackling an issue which many see as fundamentally scientific. He also inevitably brings something else - publicity. He is one of the most recognisable and controversial people on the planet. <br/>When he speaks, generally people listen and react. His involvement in Neuralink is one of the reasons people are talking about it today. <br/>Yes, quite a few are, with some said to be further on in their research than Neuralink. Black Rock Neuro Tech are working on a similar product, also implanting chips into the human brain. <br/>There's lots of different work being done, however, not all of it so invasive. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, are thought to be working on wearable tech that would allow people to type with their minds. <br/>Last week news emerged of a paralysed man helped to walk again by Swiss scientists. In short, this is a rapidly expanding field with many players. <br/>Elon Musk's involvement guarantees that Neuralink will often win the race for publicity, but that will not ultimately decide which firms succeed. <br/>That will come down to which technology works best and who can prove to regulators and markets that it is safe. <br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

The company said it was raising production of chips to meet \"surging demand\".<br/>Nvidia has come to dominate the market for chips used in artificial intelligence (AI) systems.<br/>Interest in that sector reached frenzied levels after ChatGPT went public last November, which sent a jolt well beyond the technology industry.<br/>From helping with speeches, to computer coding and cooking, ChatGPT has proved to be a wildly popular application of AI.<br/>But all that would not be possible without powerful computer hardware - in particular computer chips from California-based Nvidia.<br/>Originally known for making the type of computer chips that process graphics, particularly for computer games, Nvidia hardware underpins most AI applications today.<br/>\"It is the leading technology player enabling this new thing called artificial intelligence,\" says Alan Priestley, a semiconductor industry analyst at Gartner.<br/>\"What Nvidia is to AI is almost like what Intel was to PCs,\" adds Dan Hutcheson, an analyst at TechInsights.<br/>ChatGPT was trained using 10,000 of Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) clustered together in a supercomputer belonging to Microsoft.<br/>\"It is one of many supercomputers - some known publicly, some not - that have been built with Nvidia GPUs for a variety of scientific as well as AI use cases,\" says Ian Buck, general manager and vice president of accelerated computing at Nvidia.<br/>Nvidia has about 95% of the GPU market for machine learning, noted a recent report from CB Insights. <br/>Its AI chips, which it also sells in systems designed for data centres, cost roughly $10,000 (\u00a38,000) each, though its latest and most powerful version sells for far more.<br/>So how did Nvidia become such a central player in the AI revolution? <br/>In short, a bold bet on its own technology plus some good timing.<br/>Jensen Huang, now the chief executive of Nvidia, was one of its founders back in 1993. Then, Nvidia was focused on making graphics better for gaming and other applications.<br/>In 1999 it developed GPUs to enhance image display for computers.<br/>GPUs excel at processing many small tasks simultaneously (for example handling millions of pixels on a screen) - a procedure known as parallel processing.<br/>In 2006, researchers at Stanford University discovered GPUs had another use - they could accelerate maths operations, in a way that regular processing chips could not.<br/>It was at that moment that Mr Huang took a decision crucial to the development of AI as we know it.<br/>He invested Nvidia's resources in creating a tool to make GPUs programmable, thereby opening up their parallel processing capabilities for uses beyond graphics.<br/>That tool was added to Nvida's computer chips. For computer games players it was a capability they didn't need, and probably weren't even aware of, but for researchers it was a new way of doing high performance computing on consumer hardware.<br/>It was that capability that helped sparked early breakthroughs in modern AI.<br/>In 2012 Alexnet was unveiled - an AI that could classify images. Alexnet was trained using just two of Nvidia's programmable GPUs.<br/>The training process took only a few days, rather than the months it could have taken on a much larger number of regular processing chips.<br/>The discovery - that GPUs could massively accelerate neural network processing - began to spread among computer scientists, who started buying them to run this new type of workload.<br/>\"AI found us,\" says Mr Buck. <br/>Nvidia pressed its advantage by investing in developing new kinds of GPUs more suited to AI, as well as more software to make it easy to use the technology.<br/>A decade, and billions of dollars later, ChatGPT emerged - an AI that can give eerily human responses to questions. <br/>AI start-up Metaphysic creates photorealistic videos of celebrities and others using AI techniques. Its Tom Cruise deep fakes created a stir in 2021.<br/>To both train and then run its models it uses hundreds of Nvidia GPUs, some purchased from Nvidia and others accessed through a cloud computing service. <br/>\"There are no alternatives to Nvidia for doing what we do,\" says Tom Graham, its co-founder and chief executive. \"It is so far ahead of the curve.\"<br/>Yet while Nvidia's dominance looks assured for now, the longer term is harder to predict. \"Nvidia is the one with the target on its back that everybody is trying to take down,\" notes Kevin Krewell, another industry analyst at TIRIAS Research.  <br/>Other big semiconductor companies provide some competition. AMD and Intel are both better known for making central processing units (CPUs), but they also make dedicated GPUs for AI applications (Intel only recently joined the fray).<br/>Google has its tensor processing units (TPUs), used not only for search results but also for certain machine-learning tasks, while Amazon has a custom-built chip for training AI models.<br/>Microsoft is also reportedly developing an AI chip, and Meta has its own AI chip project.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>In addition, for the first time in decades, there are also computer chip start-ups emerging, including Cerebras, SambaNova Systems and Habana (bought by Intel). They are intent on making better alternatives to GPUs for AI by starting from a clean slate. <br/>UK-based Graphcore makes general purpose AI chips it calls intelligence processing units (IPUs), which it says have more computational power and are cheaper than GPUs.<br/>Founded in 2016, Graphcore has received almost $700m (\u00a3560m) in funding.<br/>Its customers include four US Department of Energy national labs and it has been pressing the UK government to use its chips in a new supercomputer project. <br/>\"[Graphcore] has built a processor to do AI as it exists today and as it will evolve over time,\" says Nigel Toon, the company's co-founder and chief executive.<br/>He acknowledges going up against a giant like Nvidia is challenging. While Graphcore too has software to make its technology accessible, it is hard to orchestrate a switch when the world has built its AI products to run on Nvidia GPUs. <br/>Mr Toon hopes that over time, as AI moves away from cutting-edge experimentation to commercial deployment, cost-efficient computation will start to become more important.<br/>Back at Nvidia, Ian Buck is not overly concerned about the competition. <br/>\"Everyone has the need for AI now,\" he says. \"It is up to others to work out where they are going to make a contribution.\"<br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Greece denies coastguard rope led to boat tragedy<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

And there is already the possibility that current restrictions on semiconductor exports to China could hamper Beijing's technological progress.<br/>But China could catch up, according to analysts, as AI solutions take years to be perfected. Chinese internet companies \"are arguably more advanced than US internet companies, depending on how you're measuring advancement,\" Kendra Schaefer, head of tech policy research at Trivium China tells the BBC.<br/>However, she says China's \"ability to manufacture high-end equipment and components is an estimated 10 to 15 years behind global leaders.\"<br/>The US' biggest advantage is Silicon Valley, arguably the world's supreme entrepreneurial hotspot. It is the birthplace of technology giants such as Google, Apple and Intel that have helped shape modern life.<br/>Innovators in the country have been helped by its unique research culture, says Pascale Fung, director of the Center for Artificial Intelligence Research at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.<br/>Researchers often spend years working to improve a technology without a product in mind, Ms Fung says.<br/>OpenAI, for example, operated as a non-profit company for years as it researched the Transformers machine learning model, which eventually powered ChatGPT.<br/>\"This environment never existed in most Chinese companies. They would build deep learning systems or large language models only after they saw the popularity,\" she adds. \"This is a fundamental challenge to Chinese AI.\"<br/>US investors have also been supportive of the country's research push. In 2019, Microsoft said it would put $1bn (\u00a3810,000) in to OpenAI.<br/>\"AI is one of the most transformative technologies of our time and has the potential to help solve many of our world's most pressing challenges,\" Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella said.<br/>China, meanwhile, benefits from a larger consumer base. It is the world's second-most populous country, home to roughly 1.4 billion people.<br/>It also has a thriving internet sector, says Edith Yeung, a partner at the Race Capital investment firm.<br/>Nearly everyone in the country uses the super app WeChat, for example. It is used for almost everything from sending text messages, to booking doctor's appointments and filing taxes.<br/>As a result, there's a wealth of information that can be used to improve products. \"The AI model is going to be only as good as the data that is available for it to learn from,\" Ms Yeung says.<br/>\"For good or bad, China has a lot less rules around privacy, and a lot more data [compared to the US]. There's CCTV facial recognition everywhere, for example,\" she adds. \"Imagine how useful that would be for AI-generated images.\"<br/>While China's tech community may appear to be lagging behind the US, its developers have an edge, according to Lee Kai-Fu, who makes the argument in his book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order.<br/>\"They live in a world where speed is essential, copying is an accepted practice, and competitors will stop at nothing to win a new market,\" wrote Mr Lee, a prominent figure in Beijing's internet sector and the former head of Google China.<br/>\"This rough-and-tumble environment makes a strong contrast to Silicon Valley, where copying is stigmatised and many companies are allowed to coast on the basis of one original idea or lucky break.\"<br/>China's copycat era has its problems, including serious issues around intellectual property. Mr Lee writes that it has led to a generation of hardy and nimble entrepreneurs ready to compete.<br/>Since the 1980s, China has been expanding its economy, which used to be based mainly on manufacturing, to one that is technology-based, Ms Fung says.<br/>\"In the last decade, we have seen more innovation from Chinese consumer-driven internet companies and high-end Chinese designs,\" she adds.<br/>While Chinese tech companies certainly have unique advantages, the full impact of Beijing's authoritarianism is still unclear.<br/>There are questions, for instance, about whether censorship would affect development of Chinese AI chatbots. Will they be able to answer sensitive questions about President Xi Jinping?<br/>\"I don't think anyone in China will ask controversial questions on Baidu or Ernie in the first place. They know it's censored,\" Ms Yeung says. \"Sensitive topics are a very small part of the usage [of chatbots]. They just get more media attention,\" Ms Fung adds.<br/>The bigger concern is that US attempts to restrict China's access to specialised tech can stymie the latter's AI industry.<br/>High-performing computer chips, or semiconductors, are now the source of much tension between Washington and Beijing. They are used in everyday products including laptops and smartphones, and could have military applications. They are also crucial to the hardware required for AI learning.<br/>US companies like Nvidia currently have the lead in developing AI chips and \"few [Chinese] companies can compete against ChatGPT\" given export restrictions, Ms Fung says.<br/>While this will hit China's high-tech industries like cutting edge AI, it won't affect the production of consumer technology, such as mobiles and laptops. This is because \"the export controls are designed to prevent China from developing advanced AI for military purposes,\" Ms Schaefer says.<br/>To overcome this, China needs its own Silicon Valley - a research culture that attracts talent from diverse backgrounds, Ms Fung says.<br/>\"So far it has relied on both domestic talent and those from overseas with Chinese heritage. There is a limit to homogeneous cultural thinking,\" she adds.<br/>Beijing has been trying to close the gap through its \"Big Fund\", which offers massive incentives to chip companies.<br/>But it has also tightened its grip on the sector. In March, Zhao Weiguo became the latest technology tycoon to be accused of corruption by authorities.<br/>Beijing's focus on certain industries can bring financial incentives and loosen red tape, but it may also mean greater scrutiny, and more fear and uncertainty.<br/>\"Zhao's arrest is a message for other state-owned firms: don't mess around with state money, particularly in the chip space,\" Ms Schaefer says. \"Now it's time to get on with the job.\"<br/>How that message will affect the future of China's AI industry remains to be seen.<br/>China bans major US chip maker from key projects<br/>China tech giant Alibaba to roll out ChatGPT rival<br/>OpenAI announces ChatGPT successor GPT-4<br/>Students warned against using AI for assignments<br/>'Google killer' ChatGPT sparks AI chatbot race<br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Huge arrays of angled solar panels sit atop jet black steel supports, soaking up the sun and shading the vehicles beneath. <br/>Outside the offices of a major car manufacturer in the south of England, there are now more than 2,000 panels in total with a peak capacity of just under 1 megawatt (MW).<br/>That's enough to power hundreds of homes.<br/>\"They are looking stunning,\" declares Guy Chilvers, business development manager at SIG, the firm that supplied the solar canopies.<br/>These structures make car parks more visually appealing, he insists, while admitting, \"I would say that\".<br/>Solar car parks or car ports enable electricity production in open spaces that tend to be positioned conveniently near to energy-guzzling facilities such as hospitals, shopping centres or offices. The canopies have additional benefits in that they protect cars from rain and snow, or hot sun in the summer.<br/>In a drive to boost clean energy production, the French Senate recently approved legislation that makes it mandatory for all existing and new car parks with 80 spaces or more to be covered by solar panels. <br/>While there is no equivalent requirement in the UK, solar car parks have been around for years and there are signs that they are beginning to boom here. With electricity prices currently still elevated, many businesses are turning to on-site renewables to try to keep costs down in the long run. <br/>There is a huge opportunity to turn more British car parks into solar farms, according to a new report published by the countryside charity CPRE and the UCL Energy Institute.<br/>\"We think the total potential in the built environment is about 117GW,\" says Prof Mark Barrett of UCL. \"And of that, 11GW, we think, is car parks.\"<br/>For context, the UK currently has around 15GW of solar capacity in total and requires 40GW by 2030 in order to meet net zero targets, according to Solar Energy UK.<br/>Prof Barrett notes that the figure of 11GW is conservative and is based on an estimate of 130 sq km of available car parks in the UK - lower than the 200 sq km estimated by estate agents Knight Frank. The CPRE and UCL report also assumed that 50% of each individual car park would be covered by a canopy rather than 100%.<br/>Whichever way you look at it, there's plenty of space out there in car parks for solar panels and people are beginning to realise this. <br/>\"It's absolutely gone crazy,\" says Mr Chilvers, referring to his inbox. Lately, he's quoted for hotels, hospitals and leisure centres. Mr Chilvers and his colleagues design and build the steel structures for solar canopies while the panels are supplied separately.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>Rival companies that spoke to the BBC also described high demand for solar car park canopies.<br/>Praxia Energy, based in Spain, supplies about 3MW of car park solar installations in the UK each year and says it expects this to grow tenfold by 2028. <br/>A spokeswoman for Veolia says the company recently installed a 1.1MW solar canopy system in the car park of Eastbourne Hospital and the firm has registered increased demand for solar infrastructure in the UK lately. <br/>Solarsense, a company in Clevedon, says it has also received rising enquiries in recent months.<br/>Tim Evans, chief executive of 3ti, argues that, in the past, the UK has been slow to pursue this technology in comparison with countries on the continent. \"We are quite some way behind the curve,\" he says.<br/>There are some flagship examples already in place, though. The largest solar car park installed to date in the UK is the one at the Bentley car factory in Crewe, which has a peak capacity of 2.7MW. <br/>Mr Evans says he is currently exploring four new potential projects with clients that could exceed 5MW peak capacity.<br/>Solar panels in car parks can also power electric vehicle (EV) charging. This works especially well at offices, where employees' cars are parked outside for many hours. Shopping centres, football stadiums, leisure centres and cinemas are also suitable venues, since cars tend to be parked for two hours or more to allow sufficient charging, says Mr Evans. <br/>But the steel supports required for many solar canopies do add to the cost. It is often cheaper to simply put solar panels on the roof of large buildings, such as supermarkets. Mr Evans estimates that rooftop solar yields electricity at about 9p per kWh currently, versus 14p or 15p per kWh from panels in car parks.<br/>There aren't many other obvious downsides to the canopies, though, says Richard Watkins at the University of Kent. He notes that installers might want to fit them with efficient under-canopy lighting so that they don't result in dark, potentially dangerous spaces at night.<br/>One hiccup facing many renewable energy projects at the moment is a lack of grid connections, since surplus energy generated by solar panels, for example, must be handled by the grid. Billions of pounds worth of renewable installations are effectively on hold because of this issue, according to BBC research.<br/>\"I've just had a megawatt car park, beautiful car park, for a factory turned down because it can't get a grid connection,\" says Mr Chilvers. <br/>A spokesman for Solar Energy UK also highlights this problem, saying that solar car parks becoming a common sight will remain a \"distant prospect\" until it is resolved.<br/>The energy industry regulator Ofgem is looking at ways to speed up connections and National Grid also has a plan to improve the process.<br/>There are lots of other locations around the UK, besides car parks, that could also accommodate solar installations and help us ditch fossil fuels, notes Prof Sara Walker at Newcastle University. Cycle paths and railways, for instance, or reservoirs that can be covered with floating solar panels. These also help reduce the evaporative loss of water from reservoirs.<br/>\"Where we can co-locate solar photovoltaics alongside infrastructure that would be there anyway, like a car park, it enables us to get double use out of the land surface,\" she says.<br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

On inspection, the gel has been pushed around a bit but, amazingly, is still intact.<br/>What's important is that the metal plate behind the gel is not damaged. Without the gel the basalt would have torn a chunk out of the plate.<br/>Talin can absorb force thanks to unique mechanical properties. Its structure includes spirals of amino acids - the building blocks of proteins - which form bundles. When pulled the bundles unfurl, increasing the length of the protein by a factor of 10.<br/>When the stress is released the bundles snap back into their original position, kind of like a spring.<br/>Prof Ben Goult worked out the structure of talin and how it responds to forces and, with his colleague Prof Jennifer Hiscock, they came up with the idea of making talin into a shock-absorbing material.<br/>\"I literally wandered into Ben's office and he was talking about his wonderful protein. And I said we have to make a bulletproof vest - this is what we have to do,\" she says.<br/>Starting in 2016 their team developed a way to join the talin proteins together into a lattice - like a net with an almost cartoon-like ability to stretch and rebound.<br/>It's been a long haul for Prof Goult who has been involved with working out the mechanical properties of talin and its structure since 2005.<br/>\"It wasn't easy. It took a team of six of us over four years to work out the protein structure of talin, and another four years to work out how talin responded to force\" he says.<br/>Proteins are complicated molecules to decipher. They are made up of a chain of amino acids, a bit like beads on a string. There are 20 different naturally occurring amino acids - or beads - so there are a bewildering number of ways they can combine. <br/>Traditionally working out those structures was done using electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography, a process which could take years.<br/>But in recent years artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionised the process, predicting the structures of hundreds of millions of proteins.<br/>A key event came in November 2020, when AlphaFold performed best at CASP 14, an assessment every two years where different computer programs predict the structure of proteins. <br/>Not only did AlphaFold outperform rival systems, it predicted the structure of the proteins with a level of accuracy way beyond its rivals.<br/>\"That was pretty crazy,\" says Kathryn Tunyasuvunakool, who helped develop AlphaFold, along with others at London-based DeepMind, the AI division of Alphabet, the parent company of Google.<br/>\"We knew that we had pretty good results internally going into that CASP. But it wasn't at all clear whether other people would have similar results. It was, I guess, a bit of a surprise to us to see just how large the margin was compared to other groups,\" says Ms Tunyasuvunakool.<br/>That version of AlphaFold - AlphaFold2 - was so good, that in the next competition all the best performing teams used versions of it. <br/>Thanks to AlphaFold and its offspring the database of protein structures has gone from a few hundred thousand to hundreds of millions.<br/>For scientists and researchers, particularly in drug development, this is a bonanza. Proteins with structures that look promising for certain uses, like binding to a cancer cell, can be identified more quickly than ever before - the pace of research has been accelerated.<br/>But even AlphaFold has its limitations. Proteins often work by interacting with other molecules and at the moment AlphaFold can only predict the protein part.<br/>And as Prof Goult discovered with talin, proteins are dynamic molecules that change form. AlphaFold can gives researchers a static picture, but can't model those changes.<br/>Also, scientists might also want to design proteins from scratch, to do specific tasks. That's the focus of Prof David Baker, head of the Institute for Protein Design at the University of Washington, just outside Seattle.<br/>His team has developed an artificial intelligence based on DALL-E, an AI which generates original images.<br/>Called RF Diffusion, it was trained by breaking down known proteins and then reassembling them in steps. <br/>Scientists using RF Diffusion decide on a particular characteristic they want from a new protein - perhaps a catalyst for a certain kind of chemical reaction, or a protein that can bind to a particular target.<br/>They can feed their requirements into RF Diffusion and it will come up with a suitable protein structure.<br/>\"I think RF diffusion is a step change compared to what we had before,\" says Prof Baker.<br/>\"The potential of designing proteins that solve so many different problems is really great,\" he adds.<br/>Allow Twitter content?<br/>This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Industry might benefit from catalysts which can speed up reactions or make them more efficient.<br/>Plus, according to Prof Baker, whole new materials could emerge. For him, the possibilities make protein research a compelling place to work. <br/>\"It's an extremely exciting area right now. For young scientists just starting out on a career, it's probably one of the most exciting areas in science today,\" he says.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>Back in Kent, Professors Goult and Hiscock are working on scaling up production of their protein talin, with investment coming from the Ministry of Defence.<br/>The idea is to make enough of their shock-absorbing gel for a much bigger test. The Kent scientists think that one day their gel might be able to reduce the amount of heavy ceramic used in today's bulletproof plates. <br/>For now, Prof Hiscock still marvels at how their protein gel comes together.<br/>\"It's a beautiful process, the spontaneity of it, and the fact that all those molecules can come together to form those fibrous networks.\" <br/>African leaders tour Kyiv after air raid alert<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Greece denies coastguard rope led to boat tragedy<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Real Housewives of Salt Lake City Star Jen Shah is serving a six-and-a-half year prison sentence there for wire fraud.<br/>The celebrity entrepreneur might have roommates in prison. Inmates are typically housed in dormitory-style two-person bunk beds, and four to eight person cubicles, according to Pink Lady Prison Consultants, a prison consulting group led by formerly incarcerated people. <br/>Life at the federal facility is centred around work and extracurricular programmes, the prison handbook says. <br/>All inmates are expected to work, and earn between 12 cents and $1.15 (\u00a30.90) an hour for their jobs. Many are involved in food service and factory work. <br/>Outside of their work, female inmates can take classes on business skills and foreign languages, watch television, play sports and go to religious services, according to the handbook.<br/>Holmes would be allotted an hour for each meal at the facility, which offers a standard Federal Bureau of Prisons menu, consisting of foods like chicken, hamburgers, hotdogs, tacos and macaroni. <br/>As per the prison handbook, she could speak to her family via video calls. Inmates are also allowed visitors during weekends and holidays, but like other inmates, Holmes would be allowed limited physical contact with her partner and young children.<br/>Rules at the female-only facility are also strict, the handbook says, adding that inmates are \"treated in a mature and responsible manner\" and are \"expected to act accordingly\". <br/>Inmates can face disciplinary measures for a number of actions, including not keeping their cell or room neat, sleeping past the early designated wake-up hour, sharing their phone account with other inmates, and leaving an area during an official inmate rollcall, which happens five times a day. <br/>Holmes' time behind bars will stand in stark contrast to her past life. Once lauded as the \"next Steve Jobs\", the start-up founder was said to be the world's youngest self-made billionaire, making the cover of Forbes and other prominent magazines. <br/>She started Theranos shortly after dropping out of Stanford University.

So his grandparents gave him $200 (\u00a3159) Apple credit for Christmas.<br/>\"To my shock, he spent all of it in a matter of days,\" says Ms Ward. \"After that, I gave him no more than $10 worth of robux per month. He quickly became frustrated and bored with the game.\" <br/>Leif moved on to World of Tanks, which also requires players to upgrade their weaponry using PlayStation credit. <br/>\"However, this game has the option to watch ads to gain credit,\" says Ms Ward. \"He would do that out of desperation when he had used up his monthly gaming allowance.\"<br/>Ms Ward says her younger son has yet to learn self-control or money-sense. <br/>\"It's something that I have to police constantly.\"<br/>Rather than profiting from the initial sale of a video game, many of today's gaming companies rely on revenue generated by in-game purchases, or microtransactions.<br/>The content purchased can be purely aesthetic - dance moves, skins or clothing. <br/>Alternatively, in-game purchases can provide a tactical advantage to the gameplay - extra lives, character upgrades or weapons - providing a lead over players who did not purchase the additional content.<br/>The global online microtransaction market is forecast to grow from $67.94bn in 2022 to $76.66bn in 2023.<br/>However, there are signs of a backlash from experts and consumers alike. Also, some companies are promising new releases that are in-game purchase-free.<br/>Gaming companies use behavioural psychology to manipulate users into spending, says Prof Sarah Mills, and the link between gaming and gambling is becoming \"increasingly blurred\", she explains.<br/>Ms Mills is professor of human geography at Loughborough University. Her research found gambling techniques make gamers play for longer and spend more money, and drive repeat buying.<br/>Vicki Shotbolt, chief executive of Parent Zone, an organisation which helps parents navigate the digital world for their children, is more specific about how games incentivise players to part with their money.<br/>By spending players can \"avoid the grind\" - where making an in-game purchase means you avoid hours of monotonous gaming to progress to another level.<br/>\"Fun pain\" is where you risk losing something important if you don't make a purchase.<br/>Meanwhile, \"obfuscation techniques\", like in-game currencies, make it hard to see how much you're really spending.<br/>Another tactic is the use of \"loot boxes\". Players buy a box without knowing what's inside. It could contain a game-changing item - but more often than not the prize is nothing more than a mediocre customisation. <br/>\"Young people recalled senses of shame when they reflected on the amount they spent trying to gain a rare item, even if they were successful,\" says Prof Mills.<br/>And - despite many children saying they dislike in-game purchasing - spending money on microtransactions has become an expectation.<br/>While spending on games has risen, some argue that playing games can benefit young people and fears are exaggerated.<br/>Gaming as a form of play has been found to relieve stress, help develop cognitive skills and combat loneliness.<br/>As a teenager Zhenghua Yang, from Colorado, spent two years in hospital.<br/>\"I played a lot of video games. The single-player games made me feel like a hero. The multiplayer games connected me to other people. I made life-long friends all over the world.\"<br/>In 2014, Mr Yang founded Serenity Forge, a gaming company on a mission to help others. To date, more than 20 million people have played the firm's games.<br/>\"We are in the business of expanding people's horizons,\" says Mr Yang.<br/>Serenity Forge does not use microtransactions but, says Mr Yang, that could change in the future if they found them to contribute to \"meaningful, emotionally impactful games that challenge the way you think\".<br/>The impact of microtransactions, says Mr Yang, depends on the vulnerability of the user.<br/>\"Like a credit card can be dangerous for someone in an inappropriate context, so too can microtransactions. However, credit cards can also serve an important function and in-game purchases can be important to a gamer engaging with their favourite game.\"<br/>Sarah Loya's son Andrew, 14, spends almost all his pocket money on gaming but, she says, that isn't a problem and gaming makes him happy.<br/>\"He plays daily, after school and on the weekends. I don't really see much of a negative. He's a smart kid and knows the difference between reality and fantasy.\"<br/>Ms Loya lives in Texas with Andrew, and his brother Rex, 6.<br/>\"My bank account is linked to Andrew's subscription, so I would see if he purchased something without permission,\" says the 43-year-old, \"but he always asks me before making a purchase.\"<br/>More technology of business:<br/>While it can be difficult for parents to keep track of registered emails, passwords and payment cards across various platforms and devices - there are ways that you can protect your teen and your bank account.<br/>Child accounts and parental controls can be used to disable purchases or set a spending limit. Parents can set up email notifications to flag purchases, and use gift cards rather than credit cards.<br/>Perhaps most importantly, adds Mr Yang, talk to your child.<br/>\"In my experience, friction stems from a lack of parental presence,\" he says. \"I now have two kids and, instead of using games as a babysitting tool, I make sure I'm present in their lives as they consume media.\"<br/>Back in Barbados, Ms Ward has set up screen time limits and passcodes to keep Leif gaming safely. <br/>\"My password is needed to make any purchases and if he wants money added to his account he has to ask me.

In a bid to encourage homeowners to decarbonise their heating, Germany introduced a rebate scheme in January 2023 that offers up to 40% back on the cost of buying and installing a heat pump. <br/>Heat pumps use energy taken from the air, water or ground to provide both heating and cooling. They have been proven to work even in extreme temperatures and can drastically reduce energy bills once installed.<br/>The scheme is just one of a host of heat pump subsidies in place across Europe and part of a broader push to reduce carbon emissions. From 2024, every new heating system installed in Germany must run on 65% renewable energy.<br/>Bastian Distler, a product manager in Ketsch in south-west Germany, was considering upgrading to a heat pump anyway for environmental reasons, but admits that he wouldn't have been able to without the subsidy. Purchase and installation can cost anywhere from \u20ac10,000 to \u20ac30,000 (\u00a38,700 to \u00a326,000; $11,000 to $33,000) compared to around \u20ac7,000 for a new gas boiler.<br/>\"I have two little children which makes you question some behaviours and you feel better if you do something good for the environment. But to be very honest, if it had been very, very expensive and it didn't pay off, I probably would not have done it,\" says Mr Distler.<br/>While the scheme is certainly making it easier for Germans to invest in heating system upgrades, heat pump sales were already on the increase. <br/>\"We had a market growth of 53% last year,\" says Martin Sabel, managing director of the German Heat Pump Association. \"The year before it was around 30% and the year before that around 40%. So we've had a good growth rate for several years now.\"<br/>The dramatic uptick in demand caught many manufacturers off guard, leaving some homeowners waiting up to 10 months before their new heat pumps could be supplied and installed by trained technicians, who are also in short supply.<br/>Manufacturers like Viessmann are scaling up production to solve the shortfall, as well as pouring huge investment into training installers, providing educational materials for would-be buyers, and helping customers navigate often complex subsidy applications.<br/>G\u00fcnther Schlachter, vice president of residential electric solutions at Viessmann, believes that supporting and training installers is key to decarbonising home heating. <br/>\"Our installer... can consult with their customers [and advise against] the cheapest gas or oil option to make use of the subsidies that are now in place for a future-proof solution,\" says Mr Schlachter.<br/>J\u00fcrgen Fischer, president of climate solutions at Danfoss agrees. \"Typically, installers focus on gas. For a heat pump, they need to also understand electrics and refrigeration. So educating the end user is important, but it's more important to educate the person selling the system because 80% of the decision-making process happens with the installer.\"<br/>Most European countries currently face the same issues with supply, installer training and cost, but geography and culture also heavily influence what we expect and demand from our heating systems.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>So perhaps it is not surprising that Europe's coldest countries, with the best insulation, have the highest heat pump penetration. According to the International Energy Agency, 60% of Norway's buildings are fitted with a heat pump, followed closely by Sweden at 43% and Finland at 41%. <br/>In Germany the figure is a little over 4% and in the UK just 1%.<br/>\"Scandinavia is much more advanced because they have higher insulation standards and moved from direct electric heating to heat pumps early because it's saved them from day one,\" says Thomas Nowak, secretary general of the European Heat Pump Association.<br/>Central Europeans also tend to have high expectations of heating and insulation whereas people in the UK have long accepted the need for draught excluders and chunky indoor jumpers.<br/>Southern countries tend to eschew heating in favour of cooling and use instantaneous gas boilers to heat water, whereas Eastern Europeans often rely on solid fuel stoves. <br/>Regardless of where you live or how old your building is, there's an easy way to find out if your home is suitable for a heat pump. <br/>If you can feel comfortable at home when the flow temperature on your boiler is reduced to 55C, then you can install a heat pump straight away without retrofits or insulation upgrades. <br/>Of course, not everyone can choose how their home is heated. Germany has one of the lowest home ownership rates in Europe, which means the onus is on landlords and housing management companies to upgrade heating to serve the country's approximately 40 million tenants. <br/>The German Heat Pump Association has seen housing providers begin to understand that decarbonisation will soon begin to affect their bottom line. <br/>\"They have the goal of decarbonising their building stock because they realise that if they don't, in 10 or 20 years, they won't be able to rent these flats anymore,\" says Martin Sabel. <br/>Tenants who would prefer to take matters into their own hands may soon be able to access smaller-scale heat pump solutions for heating and cooling individual rooms.<br/>US start-up Gradient hopes to enter the European market in 2023 and is working on producing small, affordable, self-install heat pumps that fit over window sills and can replace existing air conditioning units. <br/>For Viessmann, the long-term vision is to build a holistic low-carbon, low-cost energy system where heat pumps, high-quality insulation, solar energy, rerouted waste heat, other renewables, and smart technology work in tandem to provide a circular system of heating and cooling, charging cars, and meeting other energy needs for homeowners and their wider community. <br/>Germany may still be a long way from that, but heat pumps are a good step on that road. When asked what message homeowners should take home about heat pumps, Thomas Nowak has a simple answer. <br/>\"They work. That's all. Don't trust anybody who tells you they don't.\"<br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

But that is changing. <br/>Operators are increasingly adopting turbines designed to withstand tropical cyclones. One of the latest examples is a \"typhoon-resistant\" floating wind turbine, which will soon help to power an offshore oil platform in China. <br/>According to the manufacturer, MingYang Smart Energy, this 7.25 megawatt (MW) turbine can survive wind speeds of up to 134mph for 10 minutes. It has been installed at a facility 136km off the coast of the island province of Hainan.<br/>MingYang did not respond to a BBC request for comment but theirs is not the first turbine designed to face down such an onslaught. In 2021, US firm GE received typhoon-certification for its mammoth Haliade-X turbine. It is fixed, not floating, and has a capacity of up to 13MW.<br/>The blistering growth of the wind energy industry is pushing turbines to their limits and some question whether the pace of the rollout is wise.<br/>While components such as turbine blades are remarkably strong, they are not indestructible. And the forces of nature, especially out at sea, are notoriously unpredictable, meaning the pressure is on to prove that wind turbines really are hurricane-ready.<br/>Tropical cyclones - often called typhoons or hurricanes depending on location - are a familiar threat in certain parts of the world, including in the Gulf of Mexico or around much of Southeast Asia.<br/>Such storms can produce wind speeds well in excess of 100mph. The strongest one-minute sustained winds on record, of 215mph, were created by Hurricane Patricia in the Eastern Pacific in 2015. <br/>Despite the meteorological challenges in such regions, the expansion of wind energy is expected there in the coming years and decades.<br/>Today's turbines already put up with some powerful gales. Those positioned off the northeast coast of the UK in the North Sea operate in wind speeds of up to 50mph or so, after which point they are switched off, notes Simon Hogg at Durham University, who holds the \u00d8rsted chair at the university, which is funded by energy firm \u00d8rsted. <br/>Technically, such turbines are designed to survive even higher wind speeds.<br/>Leon Mishnaevsky of the Technical University of Denmark suggests that wind turbine blades are generally quite reliable. These days, they are made from strong but lightweight carbon fibre composites and automated manufacturing processes help to ensure the uniform placement of the fibres, which is important for the blades' robustness, he notes.<br/>Wind turbine makers also perform a range of stress tests on blades to ensure that they are up to scratch.<br/>This can include attaching large \"exciters\" to the blades, which bounce up and down, simulating the repeated stresses of winds on the structure. Giant blades are also sometimes bent to the point of breaking, says Prof Hogg, which helps to confirm the maximum loads they can bear.<br/>But the fallibility of turbines, especially the biggest ones, is becoming more apparent as time goes by. Insurer GCube notes in a recent report that offshore wind losses rose from \u00a31m in 2012 to more than \u00a37m in 2021.<br/>Plus, machines with capacities larger than 8MW can suffer component failures within just two years of installation, the firm says, more than twice as fast as 4-8MW devices.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>Some of the most dangerous forces to trouble turbine blades are torsion, or twisting, loads, says Find M\u00f8lholt Jensen, chief executive of Bladena, a firm that specialises in diagnosing and repairing large turbine blades around 60m in length, or longer. <br/>Repeated twisting of blades can induce difficult-to-spot fractures, he says: \"The damage cannot be seen from the outside.\"<br/>The longer the blade, the greater the risk, comments a spokesman for Bladena.<br/>Current testing and industry standards are not sufficient to prove that the largest turbine blades can withstand these stresses, argues Dr Jensen.<br/>New designs could help, though. In Japan, Challenergy has been working on a turbine with tall, vertical blades that spin around a central tower.<br/>While currently much smaller and less powerful than the biggest traditional, three-bladed turbines in operation today, Challenergy's device is intended to cope with very high winds. <br/>When a powerful typhoon called Hin Nam No struck the Philippines and Japan last August, it passed over two of the company's turbines. One of the devices, at Ishigaki City in Okinawa, recorded wind speeds of around 64mph. The turbine continued to operate without any problems, according to Challenergy.<br/>In the US, a research team has taken a cue from nature in their design of an alternative hurricane-resistant turbine. <br/>\"We were inspired by palm trees,\" explains Lucy Pao at the University of Colorado Boulder. \"In high winds they kind of go with the flow, they bend with the wind.\"<br/>She and her colleagues designed a prototype two-bladed wind turbine design with flexible blades. Plus, the rotor faces downwind rather than into the wind, as is common in traditional configurations, helping it to absorb the impact of strong gales.<br/>During tests at an onshore site in Colorado, the blade tips were observed deflecting by up to 600mm, more than half a metre. \"None of them snapped,\" says Prof Pao.<br/>Wind speeds in the area can reach 100mph in the wintertime, she adds.<br/>However, the wind energy industry has almost universally adopted the upwind, three-bladed design so selling a new concept is difficult, Prof Pao explains. Currently, her research in this area is on hold, pending further funding.<br/>She shares the concerns of other observers who question whether wind turbines are really ready for some of the strongest winds nature can hurl at them.<br/>\"The novel materials, they are stronger, they are pretty amazing, but I don't know that they've been tested out as thoroughly as maybe they should be,\" she says.<br/>Then there are the tricky economics of siting turbines in places where winds are especially variable. James Martin is chief executive at Gulf Wind Technology, a company exploring the deployment of turbines in the Gulf of Mexico. <br/>In this area, low wind speeds are common for most of the year - with the occasional hurricane blasting its way through. <br/>\"If you design that turbine to be strong enough to withstand the peak wind event, then you'll be carrying a lot of extra cost for the times that you've got light wind,\" notes Mr Martin. He declines to share details of the turbines or technologies his firm is considering.<br/>In the coming years, you can expect to see more and more turbines arriving in regions affected by cyclones, though.<br/>\"We need [turbines] there as much as we need them in any other area of the globe,\" argues Prof Hogg. \"I don't think we should shy away from it.\"<br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

We each have our own stick and box, and are meant to strike the box with the stick in sync with a light pattern. But of course I'm also watching the robot - and I'm aware that it's watching me.<br/>This drumming experiment has been designed to test how the presence of a robot doing the same task affects a human's behaviour.<br/>It's one of many experiments of human-robot interaction being carried out by the research group CONTACT (Cognitive Architecture for Collaborative Technologies) at the Italian Institute of Technology in Genoa.<br/>Though I'm aware of the lights and the other people in the room, my gaze keeps being drawn to the iCub's heavy white eyelids.<br/>For one thing, there's a noticeable noise when the robot blinks every few seconds. And, because this childlike robot has expressive, oversized eyes, its gaze is compelling. <br/>This matters because with blinking, as with other aspects of eye gaze, there's more than strictly meets the eye.<br/>\"While it is often assumed that blinking is just a reflexive physiological function associated with protective functions and ocular lubrication, it also serves an important role in reciprocal interaction,\" comments Helena Kiilavuori, a psychology researcher at the University of Tampere in Finland.<br/>Human blinking conveys attention and emotion. As a means of non-verbal communication, it expresses a number of things we aren't consciously aware of, such as who should take a turn in a conversation.<br/>Thus, it's just one of many social signals humans exchange constantly without being aware of them, yet while deriving a great deal of information and comfort from them.<br/>So social roboticists have been studying both the physical and psychological properties of human blinking to understand why it might be useful to match it in robots.<br/>\"Due to the many important functions of blinking in human behaviour, it could be assumed that having robots blinking their eyes could significantly enhance their perceived human-likeness. This could, in turn, facilitate human-robot interaction,\" says Ms Kiilavuori.<br/>Put another way, \"When the robot's blinking well,\u202fpeople feel for your character,\" says David Hanson, who leads Hanson Robotics.<br/>Indeed, CONTACT research with 13-year-olds and adults in Italy shows that both groups simply like blinking robots more. An unblinking robot can give a person the unpleasant impression of being stared at, points out Alessandra Sciutti, who leads the CONTACT unit.<br/>Humans also perceive robots that blink more naturally as more intelligent. And intelligence matters in situations where humans depend on robots to provide information, such as in train stations.<br/>Despite the benefits of natural-looking blinking, integrating it into robots (apart from avatars and robots with screen displays for faces) is technically challenging.<br/>\"Blinks are one of the subtlest of human movements, so designing mechanisms that can mimic these movements require advanced technology, such as high-precision motors,\" Ms Kiilavuori explains. The roboticists at Engineered Arts, for example, use expensive, aerospace-grade motors as well as designing their own control electronics.  <br/>Specifically, says Mr Hanson of Hanson Robotics, \"The speed of the motors moving skin material when blinking is really challenging and making the shape of the eye look natural while blinking is happening is also challenging. As well as reducing friction between artificial eyelids and the eye surface itself.\"<br/>Another issue here is a trade-off between the speed and sound of motorised blinking. Francesco Rea, a senior technician at the CONTACT unit, says that in the iCub robot a quieter motor could dampen the sound of a blink. But the slower movement then makes the robot look sleepy or catlike. <br/>Very slow blinks also risk a loss of visual information, as the iCub's camera is located behind the eyes. \"In vision, missing two frames is not that big an issue,\" says Mr Rea. \"Missing ten frames starts to be an issue.\"<br/>Ms Kiilavuori adds, \"Another challenge is the correct timing and duration of blinks.\" The different functions that blinking performs - such as how a person changes blinking speed while telling a lie - involve different eyelid dynamics as well as different emotional states.<br/>\"Any deviation from the natural and appropriate blinking times and duration, in a given context, can make the robot appear odd and disturbing,\" she says.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>The CONTACT team use a software program that partially randomises the intervals between single and double blinking. After all, blinking fixedly wouldn't look very natural either. <br/>Over at Disney Research, roboticists have joined forces with character animators to develop a research prototype for realistic robotic gaze. The aim is to design an expressive system of eye gaze that is easy for animators to control in order to convey subtle emotion.<br/>With elements like motion curves of eyelids, \"we can kind of isolate these individual behaviours, which makes it much easier to really concentrate on getting small aspects and small details correct,\" says James Kennedy, a research scientist at Disney Research.<br/>They've patented their system of robotic sensing and control of eye gaze. This includes software for processing images taken by a camera in the robot's chest, and generating control signals for movements like opening and closing the eyelids. <br/>Mr Kennedy says that the research remains more experimental, and isn't yet being applied in Disney's theme parks. \"The goal here was to really select a single social cue that we were interested in and push it as far as we could in making lifelike believable motion and behaviour\u202fthat we felt would provide a platform for engagement with people.\" <br/>The technology would need to be refined in order, for instance, for the eye gaze system to remain believable in longer close-up interactions with humans.<br/>Another general challenge would be getting humanoid robots to begin syncing their blinking patterns to those of humans, as humans do in conversation. <br/>These types of challenges remain compelling to some roboticists. And, contrary to exaggerated pop culture depictions of androids that are indistinguishable from humans, blinking is one tiny example of the many complexities that still keep robotic interactions from seeming completely natural.  <br/>When trying to replicate a mechanism as tiny and sometimes underappreciated as blinking, \"actually you reveal how complex this mechanism is, and then how much subtle movement there is,\" notes Mr Kennedy. \"And that's where we have this really great opportunity for exploration and invention.\"\u202f <br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Or was it?<br/>Coral, who is based in Malaysia, heard of a website called TimeRepublik, which describes itself as \"a timebank for the internet era\".<br/>Time banking is in essence a more sophisticated form of bartering. You don't pay someone in money for a job that they do for you. Instead you give that person time credits that they can then use to get a service without financial payment from someone else.<br/>Via the TimeRepublik website, Coral was able to connect with Cherish Cullison, a New York-based professional wardrobe stylist and costume designer.<br/>Over Zoom, Cherish was able to help Coral find the modern clothing that best suited her.<br/>\"She styled me very well,\" says Coral. \"No money can pay for such a transaction, it is priceless, it is based on trust.\"<br/>The two have stayed in touch after they first met on TimeRepublik a few years ago. This has included Coral returning the favour of assistance, and giving Cherish some meditation lessons.<br/>Cherish says it is good that \"the expectation of money is out of the way\". <br/>\"Instead you really get to the core of things and you discover something, I think, that's greater and sort of priceless.\"<br/>TimeRepublik is the brainchild of Swiss co-founders Gabriele Donati and Karim Varini. They launched the first version in Switzerland back in 2012, but international expansion has come in the past couple of years.<br/>The website is free to use for members of the public. Users offering a service earn a \"TimeCoin\" credit. This amounts to 15 minutes no matter what job you provide, be it cutting the lawn of a neighbour, or maths tuition via a video call.<br/>You simply advertise what you are offering and how long it would take in TimeCoins. <br/>\"We wanted to distance ourselves from financial transactions and find something that could create relationships between people,\" says Mr Donati. \"Because we truly believe that only through our relationships, you can gain the trust of another person.\"<br/>TimeRepublik is today based in both Lugano, Switzerland and New York, and says it has more than 100,000 users around the world. It makes money by selling the service to companies who then offer it to their staff via their internal websites. <br/>The concept of time banking has been around since the 19th Century. Mr Donati says that he wanted to bring it to a younger, and more digitally-savvy audience.<br/>New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.<br/>Another organisation helping to take time banking online is charity Timebanking UK. This offers assistance and software to help communities and organisations across the UK set up their own time-banking schemes.<br/>The platforms allow users to post offers and requests, log hours and leave feedback.<br/>Timebanking UK's chief executive Sarah Bird highlights the built-in safeguarding features, such as users being able to flag any problems. \"So if something goes wrong with the local time bank, we can just jump in there and see if we can fix things,\" she says.<br/>Ms Bird also explains that while time banking does not replace professional services or government programmes, it can underpin them, and engage people who would not usually do traditional volunteering.<br/>She adds that the Department for Work and Pensions allows jobseekers to claim time-banking hours towards their time spent looking for paid employment.<br/>\"Time banking might be the first step that someone will take from long-term unemployment before they go on to maybe volunteer or on a training course, because it's a method of making that person feel more confident about themselves,\" says Ms Bird.<br/>Timebanking UK has also set up similar schemes overseas, in countries including China, Russia, India, South Korea and Thailand.<br/>At Cardiff-based Tempo Time Credits, its time-sharing model is a bit different. Instead of participants earning credits that they can redeem from someone else doing a job for them, they get credits that they can redeem at affiliated businesses, such as local gyms, cinemas, food shops and tourist attractions.<br/>Rachel Gegeshidze, chief executive of Tempo Time Credits, says its online-based system is a way of attracting and rewarding volunteers. It is used by local authorities across the UK to help develop projects aimed at key community improvements, such as addressing loneliness or tackling poverty.<br/>\"It really supports people to do new things and try new experiences... but also, we have programmes to engage tenants in their communities and to improve health and wellbeing,\" she says.<br/>The charity's 2022 Impact Report showed that there were 10,731 active participants and about 1,100 involved organisations. The study also found that 84% of people taking part felt more positive about their future.<br/>Back at TimeRepublik, it says it doesn't wish to be seen as a replacement for cash economies, and that instead it was \"built to coexist\" with them.<br/>Cherish Cullison says that from her experience \"everyone has been very happy about the exchanges and I've met some really interesting people\".<br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Now they are experimenting with nets that can protect against insects.<br/>The mesh size of insect-proof nets is determined by the local conditions, including the nature of the insects.<br/>Of course that could shut out the insects that farmers really do want - pollinators like bees. <br/>One option is to apply the nets after the pollination period. Another is to open the nets during the day, while bringing in beehives.<br/>Tree nets are particularly well established in French and Italian apple orchards, where nets draped over rows of apple trees limit the movements and egg laying of codling moths. This has helped farmers to get rid of persistent pests and reduce their use of costly and environmentally damaging chemical pesticides. <br/>There are benefits to fruit lovers as well. \"When you know that you have less pesticide residues from crops that are under exclusion nets, it's good news for consumers,\" says Prof Aoun.<br/>Nets are also seen as a way of tackling the effects of climate change. Warmer conditions have seen the resurgence of some types of insects and diseases. <br/>Some regions are seeing more intense periods of drought and heavy rain and nets can help with that.<br/>For instance, depending on the location, the type of net, and the way it is used, a netting system can shield against the solar radiation that leads to heat stress and inhibits trees' photosynthesis. <br/>But the introduction of a net could mean a more humid environment around the tree - not helpful for crops prone to fungal diseases in wetter climates like the northeastern US and Canada.<br/>But some researchers are working on hydrophobic nets, where a treatment using a botanical pesticide essentially makes the nets water repellent.<br/>Photoselective (coloured) nets can also affect the penetration of light. Dark, opaque nets reduce light intensity but not light quality.<br/>Pearl-coloured nets can scatter light better so that it reaches more parts of the vegetation. Meanwhile, blue, red and yellow nets filter certain solar wavelengths and thus can stimulate specific responses in plants related to fruit quality.<br/>Fine-tuning the net usage often leads to an increase in high-calibre fruit, according to Prof Aoun. As her research in the Mediterranean has shown, trees covered by coloured shade nets can produce larger and more vividly coloured fruit.<br/>Nets are not always the answer. They may not be appropriate for smaller, more varied orchards. Nor are they necessary for all climate conditions. <br/>Also, the nets used for fruit trees are typically made of polyethylene, which isn't ideal for a world attempting to move away from plastic dependence. <br/>More technology of business:<br/>One of the companies working on non-plastic nets is Texinov, a French technical textiles firm. Texinov is researching various types of biodegradable nets, such as ones made from flax. <br/>It has already introduced a biodegradable net made out of polylactic acid (PLA), which is produced from fermented corn. Industrial composting is needed to break down this type of net, which sales manager Adrien Etienne says is about 10% more expensive than a conventional net.<br/>Mr Etienne says that the biodegradable nets are currently more popular in Europe than in North America. This may be linked to European policies intended to reduce insecticide use. \"The nets, I think, will become more and more popular because insecticides are less popular,\" Mr Etienne says, for instance among French cherry farmers. <br/>The upfront cost has been a barrier for some farmers. \"Nets are of course a little bit expensive compared to insecticides,\" Mr Etienne acknowledges. <br/>Texinov's cheapest net sells for around \u20ac0.50 (44p) per square metre for private use in France, according to Mr Etienne. This type of net lasts for only one or two seasons, although the heavy climate protection nets can last much longer. Durability depends on factors like solar exposure. \"The nets are more and more fragile because of the sun,\" says Mr Etienne.<br/>Overall, Prof Aoun says that prices are dropping as products become more varied and accessible. \"In general the positive impact of the net is overwhelming the negative side,\" she summarises.<br/>Jean-Marc Rochon heads the apple tree nursery P\u00e9pini\u00e8re Rochon in Quebec and is keeping an eye on advances in netting.<br/>\"In my eyes, this technology is more in the development and improvement phase rather than in large-scale application,\" he says. <br/>For Mr Rochon to begin using nets on his apple trees, the cost of the netting wouldn't be the only factor. \"I see it more as a way of rethinking our ways of doing things,\" he explains. <br/>To be viable for his nursery, the netting would have to be reliable and not create a work overload. It would also need to be useable on large orchard sections.<br/>Clearly, technological refinements and communication will be necessary to convince more fruit growers that netting would be useful. <br/>But Prof Aoun believes, \"As we move toward more climatic challenges and unpredictable weather, protective cultivation using nets is the way forward.\"<br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

They typically allow the user to monitor his or her heartbeat, and make a contactless payment.<br/>It's a fast-growing tech sector, reported to be seeing global sales rise by 21% a year.<br/>Jiri and Ondrej's smart rings are, however, designed to be more romantic than most - they allow them to see and feel each other's heartbeat. <br/>Each ring is connected by Bluetooth to an app on the wearer's smartphone. And via the app two rings can be linked together.<br/>So every time Jiri presses his wedding ring, it both physically pulses with Ondrej's heartbeat, and displays the heartbeat as a moving red line. And the same in reverse for Ondrej.<br/>As long as their mobile phones are both connected to the internet, they get a real time heartbeat. If either is offline, they get the last recorded one.<br/>\"We were never into gold and diamonds,\" says Jiri. \"We wanted something different, so we liked the idea that this was something new. We feel like pioneers in this.\"<br/>The rechargeable ring, called the HB Ring, is made by Czech firm The Touch. Although the first iteration went on limited sale back in 2016, the company is now seeing an increase in global interest thanks to the wider surge in the smart ring sector.<br/>In addition, the business has this year launched a new parallel product - The Touch Locket. To be worn on a necklace, this has the same technology as the smart rings.<br/>Its target customers include engaged couples who might like the idea of being able to feel their loved one's heartbeat, but don't want to forgo having traditional wedding rings.<br/>Jiri and Ondrej are among the many couples now increasingly using tech in their wedding celebrations. From drones for wedding photography, to digital tools to help with wedding planning tasks, such as managing the budget and seating arrangements, tech has infiltrated many important aspects of the wedding day.<br/>The wedding tech trend is growing as a result of people conducting so much of their lives on their smartphones, says Zoe Burke, the lead editor for UK wedding planning website Hitched.co.uk.<br/>\"I think people just take it for granted now that you'll be able to plan your wedding through your phone. You probably met your partner through your phone,\" she says.<br/>A third of couples in the UK are now said to use WhatsApp to invite guests to their wedding, and 60% announce their engagement on social media.<br/>New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.<br/>Some people are even now using artificial intelligence (AI) software to write their wedding vows or speeches. US-based wedding planning website Joy recently launched an AI tool that can do all this for you.<br/>Called \"Wedding Writer's Block Assistant\", it is based on ChatGPT, the chatbot founded by the San Francisco-based tech firm OpenAI.<br/>Vishal Joshi, co-founder and chief executive at Joy, says that rather than killing off the romance involved in writing vows or speeches, the aim of the AI tool is to make life easier for people who have difficulty putting their feelings into words.<br/>\"We did a survey, and found 89% of respondents find it overwhelming to start writing their wedding material,\" says Mr Joshi. \"The AI tool is not supposed to replace human emotions, but for many people it's helpful.\"<br/>The global coronavirus pandemic helped pave the way for tech-based weddings, with couples that didn't postpone their nuptials getting married over Zoom or livestreaming their ceremony to guests at home.<br/>But virtual weddings now suffer from their association with Covid-19 restrictions, according to Ms Burke. \"People have moved away from livestreaming weddings. They don't want to be reminded of that time,\" she says.<br/>For couples dealing with spiralling costs brought about by higher inflation, utilising tech can save money, such as sending out e-invitations instead of posting out paper ones. This also has an environmental benefit.<br/>Rohita Pabla, a wedding planner based in London, says: \"It's about cost saving and being environmentally conscious. More and more couples are thinking about the environment.\" <br/>Making an impact on social media during the big day is also, perhaps unsurprisingly, now a huge focus for many, with couples and guests posting videos on TikTok or Instagram during the wedding and the following reception. <br/>One new development in this direction is the growing trend of hiring \"gif booths\" for the reception. These are photobooths that take short bursts of photos to create gifs, or moving images. The user then simply enters his or her mobile number, and the gif is immediately sent to their phone.<br/>\"Some [couples] want the pictures to get picked up and shared over multiple different platforms,\" adds Ms Pabla. \"They want to be the Instagram couple.\" <br/>But couples also need to cater for their less tech savvy wedding guests, or those who prefer to get their invitations the traditional way. Ms Pabla, who specialises in planning South Asian weddings, says that many couples she works with ensure they observe certain traditions alongside using tech-based solutions.<br/>For example, in traditional Indian weddings, it's customary for the bride and groom to give family members and older guests a physical wedding invitation in person.<br/>\"So the couple will get a few copies of invitations made and those will be for parents and grandparents,\" says Ms Pabla. \"But for their peers the same age they'll just send them a digital invite.\"<br/>Mr Joshi adds that wedding tech can be used to \"make everything easier and much more interesting\". Yet he cautions that at the same time you need to avoid the risk \"of losing the charm and the romance of what real weddings are about, which is essentially bringing friends and family close together\".<br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Age is the highest risk factor for disease, whether it's cancer, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, or dementia, so if ageing as a whole could be delayed, then so could the risk of onset of these conditions. For him though, it's a sport.<br/>In Mr Johnson's luxurious Venice Beach home, a bedroom has been converted into a clinic where he spends many hours.<br/>He wakes at 5am, eating his first meal an hour later, followed by a second, and final one at 11am. This, combined with a forensically selected 54 pills, a mix of supplements and off-label medication, are all planned based on readings from a catalogue of tests.<br/>His days consist of a torturous exercise regime, monitoring and numerous treatments.<br/>He told me the all-over skin laser treatment he's been having has reduced his skin age by 22 years, the greatest age reduction in any part of his body.<br/>The aesthetics are just a small part of it all though, as he reminds me \"our skin is our biggest organ\". <br/>Mr Johnson was warm, logical and likeable. I left his house wanting to be (a bit) like him. Maybe I am already - I run 5km a day, try to avoid sugar, and test extreme tracking devices for fun.<br/>My colleagues considered Mr Johnson's existence joyless, so his life is clearly not for everyone.<br/>While his routine might seem extreme, every conversation I had still came back to lifestyle.<br/>\"Lifestyle is responsible for about 93% of your longevity - only about 7% is genetics,\" says Eric Verdin, chief executive of The Buck Institute for Ageing Research.<br/>\"Based on the data [if we live healthily], I would predict that most people could live to 95 in good health. So there's 15 to 17 [extra] years of healthy life that is up for grabs for all of us,\" he told me.<br/>The big question, which Mr Verdin and others are investigating, is what does a healthy lifestyle mean? Take exercise for example - should that be a daily stroll, or a HIIT class? <br/>The same goes for healthy eating. Is fasting as important as avoiding sugar? And what about a good night's sleep?<br/>You can't underestimate the obsession with sleep I came across. I met many people setting their alarms not to wake up in the morning, but to remind them to go to bed on time for a full eight hours.<br/>Well, we all set the bar at different levels.<br/>Mr Verdin practises what he preaches, his regime consisting of \"a whole lot of exercise, some fasting, good sleep, lots of social connections, very little alcohol\".<br/>His suggestion for others? \"Try to spend at least 14 hours of your 24 hours without ingesting any calories as this has a profound effect on your metabolism.\"<br/>The jury is out on how healthy this is for some women though.<br/>Keeping better track of our bodies as they age might help. Health risks could be flagged in advance and any new drugs could be applied just at the right time. <br/>Make it personalised, make it pre-emptive, make it better is the mantra.<br/>It was interesting to see that pretty much all of those working in longevity science wear more than one tracker themselves - commonly a smartwatch and a smart ring (way more convenient for sleep I can tell you - and these people are obsessed with prioritising sleep).<br/>More technology of business:<br/>For my part I've found health tracking illuminating. I am not diabetic, but have been fascinated by the findings of a continuous glucose monitor I wore for a while. <br/>The assumption is progress on longevity will come, albeit in a less sensational form than some may be hoping for.<br/>Experts suggest that a drug might emerge that will initially make a year or two's difference, then a few years more with the next generation, and so on.<br/>But along with such progress will come practical and ethical dilemmas.<br/>One fundamental question is whether ageing can be defined as a disease. This might simplify the approval of drugs by regulators, but risks labelling people over a certain age \"diseased\".<br/>The cost of such treatments may or may not (for developed medical systems anyway) be an issue, depending on what it turns out to be.<br/>Meanwhile, a healthier life is likely to lead to a few extra years of existence, so we may need to work longer.<br/>On my longevity learning mission, my expectations were upturned.<br/>I'd seen the sensationalist headlines, suggesting tech billionaires lounging on their yachts, deliberating over whether they fancied saving the world, going to space, or \"curing\" ageing.<br/>This wasn't the reality I saw. The wealthy have been giving money to medical research for years. This is just a new generation of wealth, and a potential new specialism of medicine. <br/>Plus it's really interesting, and affects us all.<br/>But right now, extending your healthspan involves hard work.

or whether to abstain.<br/>The motion - which would see Mr Johnson stripped of his right to a parliament pass - is likely to pass comfortably.<br/>The committee's main recommendation is that Mr Johnson should be suspended from Parliament for 90 days, but he has already stood down as an MP. <br/>The report, which was published on Thursday morning, said the former PM had deliberately misled Parliament over lockdown parties and had committed repeated offences with his denials. <br/>Prime Minister Rishi Sunak - who was Mr Johnson's chancellor - has not said whether he will vote on the report.<br/>Johnson loyalists - including former ministers Sir Simon Clarke, Nadine Dorries and Sir Jake Berry - have said they will vote against the report's findings.<br/>It is likely that many more Conservative MPs could abstain, or simply not turn up to the vote, while Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the SNP are all expected to support the committee's findings.<br/>But Conservative MPs still face a dilemma over Monday's vote.<br/>Voting against the recommendations risks alienating local party activists who want Mr Johnson gone, voting for it risks angering his fans, who believe he has been hounded out of Parliament.<br/>Allies of Mr Johnson warned Tory MPs they could face battles with their local parties to remain as candidates at the next election if they back the motion.<br/>Senior Conservative MP Damian Green told the BBC that \"deliberately abstaining is not really rising to the importance of the occasion\".<br/>The former cabinet minister under Theresa May said he intended to vote to approve the report with a \"heavy heart\".<br/>Sir Jake - an ally of Mr Johnson - said he was \"almost certain that Parliament will vote in favour\" of the report on Monday.<br/>But Sir Jake said he would \"certainly be one of those in the no lobby opposing this report, whose conclusions he called \"wrong\".<br/>So far, 15 Conservatives have publicly criticised the committee:<br/>Liberal Democrats say the report \"speaks for itself\" and should be approved without a debate.<br/>Sir Ed Davey criticised the amount of time the government is spending debating Mr Johnson's conduct, and said the Conservative party is operating \"in absolute chaos\".<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Key moments from Boris Johnson's Partygate grilling<br/>Following a year-long investigation, the seven-person Privileges Committee found Mr Johnson had had \"personal knowledge\" of Covid-rule breaches in Downing Street but had repeatedly failed to \"pro-actively investigate\" the facts. <br/>The committee said officials had not advised Mr Johnson that social distancing guidelines were followed at all times, contrary to what he said in the House of Commons at the time. <br/>In key evidence, Martin Reynolds - one of Mr Johnson's most senior officials - said he had advised the PM against making the claim, questioning whether it was \"realistic\".<br/>Mr Johnson announced last Friday that he was standing down as an MP with immediate effect after being shown a draft of the report.<br/>A by-election will be held on 20 July in his Uxbridge and South Ruislip constituency.<br/>In an eviscerating statement he branded the committee a \"kangaroo court\" and its findings \"deranged\", accusing Harriet Harman, the Labour chairwoman of the committee, of bias.<br/>The committee said the initial proposed sanction was increased \"in light of Mr Johnson's conduct\" in recent days - including breaching confidentiality rules and \"being complicit in the campaign of abuse and attempted intimidation of the committee\".<br/>Mr Johnson's statement was \"completely unacceptable\", they said.<br/>Responding to the report, Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said Mr Johnson had \"disgraced himself\", and the Liberal Democrats' Daisy Cooper said he had treated Parliament with \"total disdain\".

The Speaker of the House of Commons then issues a warrant to the clerk of the crown, who then sends the writ to the returning officer in the constituency.<br/>A by-election would then be triggered in the rural constituency, which includes the small towns of Ampthill, Flitwick, Shefford and Woburn. <br/>Mid Beds has been a Conservative seat since 1931, with Ms Dorries doubling her majority in the four elections she's fought and won since first being elected in 2005.<br/>Campaigning has already started, even though at this point it could be regarded as a phoney war, with some of the big guns from the main three parties already visiting.<br/>The Conservatives have sent Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden to Flitwick, and party co-chairman Greg Hands was in Mid Beds the day after her announcement.<br/>Despite the lack of formal resignation from the sitting MP, the party has named its new candidate as Festus Akinbusoye, who has been the Bedfordshire Police and Crime Commissioner since his election in 2021.<br/>Allow Twitter content?<br/>This article contains content provided by Twitter.

This ended in March 2023.<br/>A separate Energy Bill Relief Scheme was targeted at businesses. <br/>The PAC said the schemes were introduced quickly, but the lack of understanding of customers' circumstances meant it took too long to get help to some of those most in need. <br/>Some 900,000 customers without a direct relationship to a domestic energy supplier, such as those in park homes or living on boats, had to wait until 27 February 2023 to be able to apply for the EBSS.<br/>And 836,000 households in Northern Ireland only began receiving support with their energy bills from the EBSS in January 2023, three months later than in the rest of the United Kingdom. <br/>The PAC said people were left waiting months for help due to the government's \"lack of bandwidth\" to ensure all groups, including vulnerable people, received support at the same time.<br/>The committee also highlighted \"unacceptable practices\" of suppliers forcing entry into vulnerable customers' homes to install prepayment meters.<br/>This has been banned by Ofgem for British Gas but only suspended in voluntary arrangements with other energy suppliers.<br/>The cross-party group said it had \"serious concerns\" about the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero's (DESNZ) \"lack of urgency in addressing the energy market failures that are leading to high energy bills for consumers\".<br/>The largest schemes resulted in the department providing support to some homes and businesses that did not necessarily need it.<br/>A DESNZ spokesman said the committee's report failed to recognise \"the complexities of delivering support to households without a direct relationship with a supplier\".<br/>\"It's right we made sure there was a robust system to help protect people against fraud before rolling it out,\" he added.<br/>The department said it had delivered nearly \u00a340bn in support, with 83% of energy bill support vouchers now redeemed, including people in Northern Ireland.<br/>The committee said a quarter of vouchers for two million households on prepayment meters had not been redeemed by February, the most recent figures available.<br/>Labour MP, Dame Meg Hillier, who chairs the PAC, said: \"The surge in energy prices has caused serious difficulties and hardship for households across the UK. <br/>\"It is of course welcome to see government moving quickly to put in place support for both households and businesses to keep the lights on. <br/>\"But many of those who most needed help were kept waiting longest for it. For some households, every day left without support presented impossible choices.<br/>\"We need to see better understanding from government on vulnerable customers' circumstances so that help can be prioritised for those who need it most, and to deliver value for money in these extremely expensive schemes. <br/>\"Almost halfway through the year we have not yet seen plans to ensure energy affordability for the coming winter.\" <br/>African leaders tour Kyiv after air raid alert<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Greece denies coastguard rope led to boat tragedy<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

However, the army is still waiting for testing is to be completed.   <br/>The vehicles are being assembled mainly by General Dynamics in Merthyr Tydfil, south Wales. The project is managed by Defence Equipment and Support, part of the MoD, based in Bristol. <br/>Responding to the report in a Commons statement, Mr Cartlidge said the project had \"turned the corner\" with training taking place in a range of Ajax vehicles on Salisbury Plain this week.<br/>Whether the MoD or its contractors were to blame for issues was not within the scope of the review carried out by senior lawyer Clive Sheldon KC.<br/>He found that \"optimism bias infected some of the thinking of senior individuals working on the programme. The failures that I identified were systemic and institutional.\"<br/>The report said there was a \"reticence\" to escalate concerns about the noise and vibration issues, and \"it took a considerable amount of time before anyone looked at the matter strategically and asked what was really going on\". <br/>This led to senior personnel and ministers \"being surprised to discover in late 2020 and early 2021 that the programme was at much greater risk than they had appreciated\".<br/>Conservative former defence minister Mark Francois told MPs the programme had been an \"absolute debacle\", adding that the report had revealed \"just how massively bureaucratic and broken the MoD's procurement really is\". <br/>He called for \"root-and-branch reform of how we buy military equipment\".<br/>Conservative chairman of the Commons Defence Committee Tobias Ellwood said \"something very, very serious has gone wrong\" and \"Ajax is now a case study... [of] how not to do procurement\".<br/>Labour spokesman Chris Evans described Ajax as the \"biggest procurement failure for a decade\", calling the findings \"beyond damning\" and \"embarrassing\" for the government. <br/>Ajax had become \"a byword for waste and incompetence\", he said.  <br/>Mr Cartlidge said the review would improve the MoD's understanding of the governance, culture and leadership of major programmes.<br/>But he conceded it \"makes for difficult reading\", identifying \"fragmented relationships\" and \"conflicting priorities\". <br/>\"Now, we accept these findings and most of Mr Sheldon's 24 formal recommendations, with 15 accepted and nine accepted in principle.<br/>\"Crucially, the review did not find that either ministers or Parliament were misled,\" he said. <br/>Mr Cartlidge said many of the behaviours highlighted in the report had been addressed, both in the armoured cavalry programme and across the MoD, while transparency had improved including detailed updates on the Ajax project. <br/>Armoured vehicle project back on track - Wallace<br/>Delays to armoured vehicles 'risk UK security'<br/>Payments resume for armoured vehicle project<br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Greece denies coastguard rope led to boat tragedy<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

but were outvoted.<br/>Expulsion is extremely rare in Parliament's history, having occurred only three times in the last hundred years or so.<br/>But suspending him is no longer an option, given that he's already stood down as an MP in his blistering resignation statement last week.<br/>However, the report says that now, given what he's said about the committee, they would have recommended a ban of 90 days - an extremely long ban by the standards of recent years. <br/>And it says he should not get a parliamentary pass, which former MPs would normally be able to apply for. <br/>Perhaps the greatest punishment in the report, ultimately, will be the damage it does to his reputation among Conservative MPs -

It has recommended he should face a 90-day suspension if he was still an MP.<br/>Yet in spite of the damning report, many residents in Mr Johnson's former constituency of Uxbridge and South Ruislip are standing by him.<br/>Laura Cooper, a local resident who owns a shop on the high street, says she is \"absolutely furious that he has been hounded out of Parliament\".<br/>\"I am appalled at what the Conservatives are doing to their own former prime minister.<br/>\"It's like a witch hunt,\" she adds.<br/>Fellow resident Lesley Thompson believes Mr Johnson has \"been a very good MP\" and as a patron of the charity shop she works in, he's \"been very involved and supportive\".<br/>Asked about her thoughts on the report, she says: \"It doesn't surprise me but I can imagine it was a difficult time. Lots of people in government made mistakes then - it's not right just to target him.\"<br/>Mr Johnson has called the committee's findings \"deranged\" and even some who did not vote for him as their local MP express sympathy.<br/>Patricia Toole echoes the former PM's own words when asked about her thoughts on the Privileges Committee report.<br/>\"Maybe he did do all those things he's been accused of, but it could also be a kangaroo court,\" she says.<br/>\"I hate to think he's being picked on and it seems like people are determined to get rid of the man.\"<br/>Speaking to some residents, particularly younger ones, the feeling of apathy is strong. <br/>Many say they are fed up with the constant drama surrounding the former prime minister and are looking forward to a by-election, set for 20 July. <br/>\"There's been such a fuss. We know he did wrong and we all probably knew he lied about it,\" says Vicky Atkins.<br/>\"He's resigned and now let's move on. I am sick of hearing about it to be honest.\"<br/>Mirza Beig, a student in Uxbridge, agrees with Vicky's sentiment, saying he just \"does not care about it anymore\".<br/>\"He's misled people and he's not reliable,\" he adds. \"We need someone who will focus on helping constituents with real problems.\"<br/>Certainly, there are some who are glad that Boris Johnson has stepped down.<br/>Nick Johnson almost shakes with anger as he reels off all the problems in the constituency that he says Mr Johnson did not acknowledge during his time as MP. <br/>\"I'm very upset with the way he has treated Uxbridge,\" he says.<br/>\"The Privileges Committee report is entirely true and if he had not jumped he would have been pushed.<br/>\"It's a load of rubbish to say he works hard for this constituency.\"<br/>Having spent half a day speaking to residents in Uxbridge, it's clear that everyone has an opinion about their former MP.<br/>Whether Mr Johnson will return to politics in the future is unknown, but most residents are keen to look ahead to the upcoming by-election.<br/>Whether the Conservatives can maintain their 7,000 vote majority, only time will tell.<br/>Follow BBC London on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

To meet its objective, Mr Lodge said the government needs to process 2,200 claims a week.<br/>But if claims are refused quickly, other teams \"will have to increase their capacity\" and shoulder the costs and increase their staffing levels. <br/>He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"The backlog pushes costs to the wider asylum system if it isn't done intelligently.\"<br/>A Home Office spokesman said it was working \"non-stop\" to reduce the backlog and had already doubled the number of caseworkers and cut the \"legacy backlog\" by 20% - the pile of more than 100,000 unresolved asylum applications made before 28 June 2022.<br/>\"We know more must be done to bring the asylum system back into balance,\" he said.<br/>\"The Illegal Migration Bill will stop the boats by detaining those who come to the UK illegally, and swiftly returning them to their home country or a safe third country.\"<br/>The National Audit Office's report said only half of case workers are taking decisions, falling short of the Home office's target of 62%. Cuts in the \"legacy backlog\" had been achieved by slowing down decision-making on newer claims, it found, meaning a new backlog was growing there. <br/>Labour shadow immigration minister Stephen Kinnock said the Conservatives had \"lost control\" of the backlog. <br/>\"The prime minister has admitted that the asylum system is broken,\" he said. <br/>African leaders tour Kyiv after air raid alert<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Greece denies coastguard rope led to boat tragedy<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Parliament over lockdown parties.<br/>The top lawyers defending Mr Johnson were paid for with taxpayer funds.<br/>Labour says Prime Minister Rishi Sunak should demand Mr Johnson \"pays back every penny\" of public money used to fund his legal defence.<br/>The government has sought to justify the decision by claiming there is a precedent for supporting former ministers with legal representation.<br/>But the government has not been able to name a single example of a former minister receiving taxpayer-funded legal support for a parliamentary inquiry.<br/>Labour's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, said Conservative ministers had \"utterly failed\" to produce evidence to back up their assertion that funding Mr Johnson's legal defence followed convention.<br/>\"This murky arrangement that has seen the public left to pick up the tab for Boris Johnson's Partygate legal bills is not only without precedent but without justification,\" Ms Rayner said.<br/>The Liberal Democrats have urged Mr Sunak to \"do the decent thing and force Johnson to pay the bill himself\".<br/>\"It's frankly unbelievable that hardworking taxpayers are being left to foot the bill for Boris Johnson's shameful antics,\" the party's Cabinet Office spokesperson, Christine Jardine, said.<br/>The SNP's leader in Westminster, Stephen Flynn, said: \"The legal costs, which the public have paid for, need to be recouped from Mr Johnson.\"<br/>Mr Johnson's spokesperson referred to the government's response, explaining there is a long-standing position on legal support, justified by precedent.<br/>The inquiry by the Privileges Committee was launched last April, after opposition parties accused Mr Johnson of misleading MPs about gatherings in government buildings during Covid-19 lockdowns.<br/>In an unprecedented decision, the committee found Mr Johnson had committed repeated contempts of Parliament with his Partygate denials.<br/>In its conclusions, the committee said criticisms of the inquiry in opinions submitted by Mr Johnson's legal advisers were \"without merit\".<br/>Mr Johnson said the inquiry amounted to a \"political assassination\", and branded the committee's findings \"deranged\".<br/>The Cabinet Office made the decision to cover Mr Johnson's legal costs for the inquiry last year, when he was still prime minister.<br/>The BBC has spoken to two former ministers who were investigated by MPs for misleading Parliament and were not given legal support.<br/>The former Labour MP and transport secretary, Stephen Byers, was not offered legal support when he faced a four-month inquiry in 2005.<br/>Nor was the former Labour MP and paymaster general, Geoffrey Robinson, who was found to have \"inadvertently\" misled MPs in 2001.<br/>In a response to a parliamentary question this week, Cabinet Office minister Jeremy Quin defended the decision to pay Mr Johnson's legal costs.<br/>He said the principle \"can also be applied to parliamentary inquiries, where it relates to one's conduct as minister of the Crown\".<br/>But Mr Quin provided no examples of former ministers having their legal bills covered for parliamentary inquiries.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Key moments from Boris Johnson's Partygate grilling<br/>The MP who submitted the question, Labour's Karl Turner, said that the Cabinet Office had \"created a precedent\" with the decision to fund Mr Johnson's legal defence.<br/>This meant there was now a two-tier system whereby ministers and former ministers receive legal support to fight parliamentary inquiries, and backbench MPs do not, he added.<br/>\"We cannot have a system that unfairly advantages one member as against another member, in terms of having their excessively large legal bills covered by the taxpayer,\" Mr Turner said.<br/>\"Mr Johnson is a multi-millionaire if he wants to instruct the country's leading public lawyers and solicitors then let him pay for it.\"<br/>Last month, the contract to hire Mr Johnson's legal team was extended for the third time and increased in value, from \u00a3222,000 to \u00a3245,000.<br/>The Treasury did not sign off the decision to use public money to pay the bill, but has insisted its approval was not required for all spending decisions.<br/>The National Audit Office (NAO), which scrutinises government spending, has been examining

who helped the Conservative Party win a landslide election victory under his leadership only three years ago - is the first former prime minister to have been found to have deliberately misled Parliament.<br/>It has been confirmed a by-election to replace him in his Uxbridge and South Ruislip constituency will take place on 20 July. <br/>On the same day, voters will also elect a replacement for Johnson ally Nigel Adams, who also stood down as MP for Selby and Ainsty in the wake of the former PM's resignation.<br/>The seven-person committee, chaired by Labour's Harriet Harman but with a Tory majority, has been considering whether Mr Johnson misled MPs about Covid breaches in Downing Street during the pandemic.<br/>When giving evidence to the committee in March, Mr Johnson staunchly denied misleading Parliament on purpose, in a stormy session.<br/>But in its lengthy report, which runs to 106 pages, the committee concluded that Mr Johnson's \"personal knowledge of breaches\", combined with \"his repeated failures pro-actively to investigate\" them, amounted to \"a deliberate closing of his mind\" to the facts.<br/>The committee focused on six gatherings between May 2020 and January 2021, and statements Mr Johnson made to Parliament about them.<br/>The committee concluded that officials did not advise Mr Johnson that social-distancing guidelines had been followed at all times, despite him making the claim in the House of Commons.<br/>In key evidence, one of Mr Johnson's most senior officials, Martin Reynolds, said he advised the former prime minister against making the claim, questioning whether it was \"realistic\".<br/>Some of Mr Johnson's denials, the committee added, were \"so disingenuous that they were by their very nature deliberate attempts to mislead\".<br/>They amounted to a \"contempt\" of Parliament, the MPs added, because they stopped Parliament carrying out its \"essential task\" of holding him to account.<br/>Explaining their recommendation for a 90-day suspension, they found that he had also committed a repeated contempts by:<br/>The committee has also recommended that Mr Johnson should be stripped of the pass given to former MPs allowing them access to Parliament.<br/>Two of the committee's MPs, the SNP's Allan Dorans and Labour's Yvonne Fovargue, wanted to go further and expel him from the Commons - but were outvoted by the committee's four Tory MPs.<br/>The report will be debated by MPs, with a vote held on whether to approve the findings on Monday.<br/>MPs are expected to approve the report, after Commons leader Penny Mordaunt said Tory MPs would not be ordered to vote against it.<br/>So far, only a handful of Conservative MPs have openly criticised the report, including Johnson loyalist and former culture secretary, Nadine Dorries.<br/>In a tweet, Ms Dorries claimed the report had \"overreached\" and said any Tory MP who voted to approve it was \"fundamentally not a Conservative\".<br/>Other Tory MPs supportive of Mr Johnson hit out at the findings, with Jacob Rees Mogg saying the committee looked \"foolish\" and Simon Clarke adding the report was \"absolutely extraordinary to the point of sheer vindictiveness\".<br/>But Labour's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, said the committee had \"gone off the evidence\" to reach \"a very damning conclusion\".<br/>She said Mr Johnson was a \"disgraced prime minister\" who \"shouldn't be anywhere near Parliament\".<br/>The Liberal Democrats have called for Mr Johnson to be stripped of the \u00a3115,000 annual allowance available to former prime ministers to run their office.<br/>\"This damning report should be the final nail in the coffin for Boris Johnson's political career,\" the party's deputy leader, Daisy Cooper, said.<br/>A campaign group representing families bereaved by Covid said he should \"never be allowed to stand for any form of public office again\".<br/>The committee's report was met with disdain by Mr Johnson, who repeated his defence at length in a bitter parting shot.<br/>He said he had been warned the committee was driven by \"the sole political objective of finding me guilty and expelling me from Parliament\".<br/>He echoed many of the assertions he made in front of the committee in March, including his claim that he believed all of the events he attended were \"lawful\" and \"required by my job\".<br/>On the charge he deliberately misled Parliament, Mr Johnson said this was \"rubbish\" and based on \"a series of things that are patently absurd\".<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Key moments from Boris Johnson's Partygate grilling<br/>He compared the committee to late TV astrologer Mystic Meg for concluding he was \"unlikely to have been unaware\" of a gathering attended by dozens of staff in No 10 Downing Street's press office in December 2020.<br/>\"How do they know what I saw?\" Mr Johnson said. \"What retinal impressions have they somehow discovered, that are completely unavailable to me?\"<br/>The lockdown parties at the heart of the committee's report first came to public attention in newspaper reports at the end of 2021.<br/>The reports exploded into a long-running scandal that dogged Mr Johnson's premiership and stoked discontent among his ministers, who forced him to resign as prime minister last year.<br/>An internal inquiry into the parties was led by senior civil servant Sue Gray, and a Metropolitan Police investigation resulted in multiples fines for breaches of Covid rules.<br/>Mr Johnson was fined by police for breaking Covid rules in 2020 -

Following their recent reunion, he said: \"It was as wonderful an experience this time as it was 50 years ago. I shall miss her.\"<br/>Other tributes were paid from across the worlds of the arts and politics.<br/>Labour MP Tulip Siddiq, who now sits in Jackson's former seat, tweeted: \"Devastated to hear that my predecessor Glenda Jackson has died.<br/>\"A formidable politician, an amazing actress and a very supportive mentor to me. Hampstead and Kilburn will miss you Glenda.\"<br/>Shadow culture secretary Lucy Powell, who worked for Jackson before becoming an MP herself, recalled the \"incredibly kind\" politician's \"cutting humour\" and \"general disdain at most things\".<br/>\"She was the definition of an icon, successfully spanning the world of acting and politics with great aplomb,\" Powell wrote.<br/>Broadcaster and former Conservative MP Gyles Brandreth said she was \"a wonderful actress, a committed politician [and] a remarkable human being\".<br/>\"We became MPs on the same day in 1992 & I treasure our unlikely friendship,\" he wrote. \"She was such a gifted, caring & special person who came into the world to make a difference - and did.\"<br/>A spokesman for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said it was \"extremely sad news\", adding: \"His thoughts will be with her friends and family at this time.\"<br/>TV presenter Carol Vorderman said: \"To see this unique woman turn into a firebrand in politics was deeply impressive for young girls like me. May she rest in peace.\"<br/>Jackson began acting after joining an amateur dramatics group as a teen while working in Boots near her tome town of Birkenhead in Merseyside.<br/>She won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts (Rada) in London, and joined the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) in 1963.<br/>After making her name on stage, she won her first Oscar for playing a headstrong artist in director Ken Russell's film of DH Lawrence's novel Women in Love.<br/>Her second Academy Award came three years later for A Touch of Class, a romantic comedy in which she played a fashion designer caught up in a catastrophic love affair with a US businessman. <br/>She did not attend either ceremony, though, saying she was busy.<br/>\"All awards are very nice to have,\" she told BBC Radio 4's This Cultural Life last year. \"But they don't make you any better.\"<br/>The role in A Touch of Class came about after she famously showed off her comedy skills in a guest appearance as Cleopatra on Eric Morecambe and Ernie Wise's hit Saturday night TV show.<br/>\"I've always said, and I mean it, they were the apotheosis of my career, working with them,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs.<br/>She also played the Egyptian queen - more seriously - on stage in Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra for the RSC.<br/>Sir Jonathan, who was also in that production, told BBC Radio Wales: \"Everyone will talk about her tremendous strength and courage and intelligence, [and] her wit.<br/>\"I worked with her twice in the 70s, and she was always direct, always honest. And, like the greatest art, her work was simple and uncluttered.\"<br/>In its tribute, the RSC described her as \"a tour de force in acting and politics, dedicating her life to both\".<br/>The company added: \"We're proud her extraordinary talent was seen on RSC stages early in her career in ground-breaking productions.\"<br/>Jackson played Elizabeth I in BBC drama Elizabeth R - another role she famously revisited - winning Emmys for both Elizabeth R and also playing the queen opposite Dame Vanessa Redgrave in 1971 film Mary, Queen of Scots.<br/>Further Oscar nominations came her way for portraying a frustrated office worker in a love triangle in 1971's Sunday Bloody Sunday, and for taking the title role in 1975's Hedda, adapted from Henrik Ibsen's Hedda Gabler.<br/>Labour MP Chris Bryant, who wrote a biography of Jackson in 1999, told BBC Radio 4's The World At One: \"She had such versatility.<br/>\"It's the quality of the work, and the variety. Her voice could go to gravel to caramel in three seconds.\"<br/>Former Labour MP Baroness Hoey told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"When she came into Parliament, she was so modest. She never wanted to be reminded that she was an actress.\"<br/>Other credits included playing English poet Stevie Smith in Stevie, and as Hollywood icon Patricia Neal in The Patricia Neal Story.<br/>A staunch Labour supporter, she was approached to stand for Parliament - and said she agreed because she disliked former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and the \"destruction that her policies has had on human beings\".<br/>There was a link between acting and politics, she said.<br/>\"The best theatre is about trying to find and tell the truth,\" she told Desert Island Discs. \"It's not about covering up. It's not about playing games. It's not about hiding. It's not about pretending you're something you're not.<br/>\"It's trying to find what it is to be a human being and why we behave towards each other in the ways that we do.

She was made a dame.<br/>Former director of communications Jack Doyle and press adviser Rosie Bate-Williams, who issued some of Mr Johnson's denials about Covid rule-breaking, were given CBEs.<br/>Mr Johnson has accused Mr Sunak of blocking some of his other nominations, including a peerage for close ally Nadine Dorries, something firmly denied by Downing Street.<br/>Mr Sunak said last week that he was not prepared to do what Mr Johnson wanted over peerages, adding: \"If people don't like that, then tough.\"<br/>At Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir - who was knighted in 2014 for his past role as director of public prosecutions - asked why \"for all his tough talk\" Mr Sunak had signed off on Mr Johnson's list.<br/>He repeated his call for an immediate general election, accusing the Conservatives of getting their priorities wrong.<br/>\"All across the country, people are worried about their bills, the price of the weekly shop and the spiralling mortgage rates,\" said the Labour leader.<br/>\"So why has the Tory party spent this last week arguing over which of them gets a peerage?\"<br/>Mr Sunak denied interfering in Mr Johnson's nominations for honours, in line with what he said was a \"long-held convention\" that had been followed by prime ministers of both main parties.<br/>\"My predecessors may not have agreed with Labour's choices of Tom Watson or Shami Chakrabarti, but the same precedent stood then as it does now. And I'd expect a knight like him to understand that,\" said the prime minister.<br/>Sir Keir responded: \"Honours should be for public service not Tory cronies.\"<br/>He accused the PM of ensuring \"those who spent their time helping cover up Johnson's lawbreaking are rewarded by becoming lawmakers for the rest of their lives\".<br/>Mr Sunak asked why the Labour leader had put former MP Tom Watson, \"who spread vicious conspiracy theories that were totally and utterly untrue\", forward for a seat in the Lords. <br/>He was referring to the now Lord Watson's previous support for fantasist Carl Beech, who wrongly accused several high-profile politicians and military officers of murder and child sex abuse in 2014. <br/>Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle intervened to warn Mr Sunak about his comments.<br/>\"Can I just say to the prime minister, you shouldn't criticise other members,\" he told the PM.<br/>\"Also, you're not responsible for the other parties.

Consequently, they will buy fewer things which should slow the rate of rising prices.<br/>An increase in interest rates means higher monthly mortgage, credit card and loan payments for some people. But higher rates should benefit savers - if banks pass them on to their customers. <br/>Asked if he was following former chancellor John Major's dictum in 1989 that \"if it isn't hurting, it isn't working\", Mr Hunt said: \"In the end there is no alternative to bringing down inflation, if we want to see consumers spending, if we want to see businesses investing, if we want to see long-term growth and prosperity.\"<br/>The government has no say over interest rates since the Bank of England was granted independence in 1997.<br/>The UK economy expanded in April after shrinking by 0.3% in the previous month. For the three months to April, it grew marginally by 0.1%. <br/>The ONS said strong trade in bars and pubs boosted growth, but added the construction sector had faltered as rising interest rates and mortgage costs made house buyers more cautious.<br/>As interest rates have risen and more people are coming to the end of fixed-rate mortgage deals, some lenders have been withdrawing certain mortgages from the market. <br/>First-time buyers are being met with higher rates, leaving some priced out, and renters are also facing higher costs due to landlords selling up.<br/>On Wednesday afternoon, HSBC, a major UK mortgage lender, temporarily withdrew new residential mortgages supplied through brokers.<br/>\"Over recent days cost of funds has increased and, like other banks, we have had to reflect that in our mortgage rates,\" an HSBC spokesperson said.<br/>Hiking rates is meant to persuade consumers to spend less - as their cost of borrowing rises or rates on savings accounts increase - giving businesses less scope to raise prices. <br/>But that mechanism may have become less effective over time.<br/>Take mortgages. In the early 2000s, more than seven out of 10 residential mortgages were on variable or tracker rates, immediately impacted by rate hikes. Today, it's 15% of homeowners. Even adding in the 1.8 million who are re-mortgaging this year, means it's still, contrary to a couple of decades ago, the minority of mortgage holders who will be affected. <br/>The impact of rate hikes is less widespread and may be taking longer to filter through.<br/>Equally, banks and building societies have been particularly reluctant to pass on rate hikes to savers this time, as the Bank of England and outraged customers have noted. This may in part reflect savings institutions rebuilding margins after a period of ultra-low interest rates - but gives customers less of an incentive to stash spare cash. <br/>Higher interest rates also should mean businesses have less scope to give workers inflation-matching pay rises than in the past - but a shortage of workers makes this less likely this time. <br/>Even if, as some economists fear, interest rate rises are less effective this time, they remain the main tool for fighting inflation.<br/>Ian Burns, who runs Cameron Homes, a housebuilder in Staffordshire, said people were being \"very cautious\" and were \"taking longer to make decisions\".<br/>\"Over the past three or four weeks, we've seen a slowdown in reservations,\" he told the BBC's Wake up to Money.<br/>\"We can't just continue to build houses if we don't have customers for them.\"<br/>Stronger-than-expected wage growth for workers in the three months to April has raised the prospect that the Bank could raise rates close to 6% by the end of the year in its bid to reduce inflation.<br/>On Monday, two-year government borrowing costs rose to levels higher than during the aftermath of last September's mini-budget. <br/>When asked if this showed his plan was not working, Mr Hunt said: \"We are in a very different situation to where we were last autumn. The IMF, the international commentators, think the British economy is on the right track.\"<br/>But the New Economics Foundation, a think tank promoting social and economic justice, said the Bank should hold off on raising rates further and wait to see the impact of its previous increases.<br/>Its economist Lukasz Krebel said that while UK wages were rising, they were still not keeping up with inflation, meaning people were poorer in real terms. <br/>He added that rising prices were mainly due to supply side issues, such as worker shortages and Russia's invasion of Ukraine sending energy prices soaring.<br/>\"The UK government and the Bank should look to address underlying weaknesses that expose the UK to such inflation shocks - notably by supporting investment in clean energy and building retrofits to reduce our reliance on volatile fossil gas,\" he said.<br/>Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said the figures represented \"another day in the dismal low growth record book of this Conservative government\".<br/>\"The facts remain that families are feeling worse off, facing a soaring Tory mortgage penalty and we're lagging behind on the global stage.\"<br/>Additional reporting by Raphael Sheridan<br/>How worried should we be about rising mortgage rates?<br/>Warning rising mortgage costs to hit renters<br/>Warning prices to be higher for longer as rates rise<br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

However that's to overlook we will have our full cohort of decision makers later this year. They will be trained up and fully proficient.\"<br/>At the start of May, there were 1,280 Home Office staff working on asylum decision making, a big increase on a year previously, although a slight fall from the number employed at the start of 2023. <br/>The committee also heard from a senior Home Office official, Dan Hobbs, who confirmed that the proportion of asylum decision makers who leave their jobs each year stood at 28%.<br/>The government has also introduced a streamlined process for asylum claims from nationals of five countries with the highest asylum acceptance rates.<br/>Questioned by MPs, Ms Braverman also conceded conceded that women trafficked into the UK for sexual exploitation could be deported under new measures to tackle illegal migration.<br/>The home secretary said women could receive protection if there was \"compelling evidence for their reasonable grounds\" or if \"they are part of a police investigation\".<br/>She was also asked by the SNP's Alison Thewliss about the disappearance of 154 asylum seeker children from temporary hotel accommodation. <br/>Ms Braverman said missing persons cases were a matter for the police, but confirmed there were no longer any unaccompanied child asylum seekers in hotels. <br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

or module - will examine how well prepared the UK was for Covid up to January 2020. <br/>Mr Keith said: \"Even at this stage, before hearing the evidence, it is apparent that we might not have been very well prepared at all.\"<br/>What is the UK Covid inquiry and how long will it take?<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Bereaved families express their loss in a film shown to the inquiry<br/>Chair Baroness Hallett pledged that the inquiry into the handling of the coronavirus pandemic would be the \"thorough investigation\" that the public deserves.<br/>The former High Court judge paid tribute to a \"dignified vigil\" of bereaved family members holding a silent protest outside of the building. <br/>Lady Hallett said there were three key questions to be answered for the \"millions of people who have suffered and continue to suffer\": <br/>This first part of the inquiry will hear from key politicians, civil servants, scientists, unions, health and care organisations, groups representing victims and their relatives and more. <br/>The Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group has criticised the inquiry's timetable and says people have been \"excluded from sharing key evidence\".<br/>They branded the inquiry's Every Story Matters project - where members of the public can share their experience with the inquiry through a website - an \"inadequate\" process because stories will be anonymised and summarised and possibly \"open to bias and interpretation by third parties\".<br/>Addressing critics of the inquiry, Lady Hallett said she hoped they would understand the difficult balance she has had to strike.<br/>\"I am listening to them, their loss will be recognised, they will be able to contribute to the inquiry.\"<br/>Mr Keith, counsel to the inquiry, said UK was \"taken by surprise\" over \"significant aspects\" of the pandemic, including lockdowns. <br/>\"Extraordinary though it may seem, given that it's a word that's forever seared in the nation's consciousness, there was very little debate pre-pandemic of whether a lockdown might prove to be necessary in the event of a runaway virus, let alone how a lockdown could be avoided.<br/>\"Very little thought was given to how, if it proved to be necessary, how something as complex, difficult and damaging as a national lockdown could be put in place at all.<br/>\"Equally, there appears to have been a failure to think through the potentially massive impact on education and on the economy.\"<br/>He said the UK had been preparing for an outbreak more similar to flu, and questioned how well placed and funded the NHS was to cope.<br/>\"No amount of foresight or planning can guarantee that a country will not make mistakes when a disease strikes, but that does not mean that we should not strive to be as ready as we sensibly can be,\" Mr Keith said.<br/>\"No country can be perfectly prepared, but it can certainly be underprepared.\"<br/>Mr Keith highlighted \"shocking\" data showing that Covid mortality was two-and-a-half times higher in some of the most deprived parts of the UK than the richest, with people in some ethnic minority groups or with a disability far more likely to be infected or die of the disease.<br/>To what extent those outcomes could and should have been foreseen and mitigated would be a \"big question\" in module one, he said. <br/>The wider political environment will also be considered including the possible impact of Brexit on emergency planning.<br/>\"Did the attention paid to the risks of a no-deal Brexit - Operation Yellowhammer as it was known - drain resources and capacity that should have been continuing the fight against the next pandemic?\" Mr Keith asked.<br/>\"Or did that generic and operational planning, in fact, lead to people being better trained and well-marshalled, and in fact better prepared to deal with Covid?<br/>\"On the evidence so far... we very much fear that it was the former.\"<br/>The inquiry will also examine if the collapse of the power-sharing agreement in Northern Ireland damaged the ability of authorities to plan and respond to the pandemic. <br/>Mr Keith said it was unlikely we will ever know how Covid started - whether it emerged from a lab leak or from farmed wild animals that were sold in Wuhan. Nor when the first human infection happened, he said. <br/>\"For this inquiry's purposes, this knowledge does not matter.\" <br/>In his opening remarks, Pete Weatherby KC, counsel for the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group, said the \"closest to an overall plan\" to deal with Covid in 2020 was a 2011 document drawn up to protect the UK from an outbreak of influenza. <br/>\"With a pandemic, time is of the essence and lost time is measured in lives,\" he said. <br/>\"The families expect the evidence will show\u2026 little or no ministerial leadership and the chaos of committees which led to poor planning and ultimately a reactive rather than a proactive response to the virus.\" <br/>In response to the Brexit claims, a spokesperson for the prime minister said the government would not be responding to every issue raised in the inquiry.<br/>He added that it would be up to the government to respond at the appropriate stage.  <br/>Lady Hallett has asked to see ex-prime minister Boris Johnson's unredacted WhatsApp messages between him and around 40 politicians and officials, but this is being challenged by his successor, Rishi Sunak.<br/>The Cabinet Office launched a legal challenge against the request, arguing some of the messages were irrelevant. This is thought to be the first time a government has taken legal action against its own public inquiry.<br/>Mr Johnson said he was \"perfectly content\" for the inquiry to have WhatsApp messages sent after May 2021. Earlier messages are not available because his mobile phone was involved in a security breach and has not been used since.<br/>Former Health Secretary Matt Hancock also said he was happy to share his messages, although many of these have already been leaked by the journalist Isabel Oakeshott, who helped Mr Hancock write his book, Pandemic Diaries.<br/>In a statement about the back-and-forth over the messages, Rishi Sunak's spokesperson said it \"is still ongoing\" and will \"obviously... be resolved through the normal process\".<br/>\"Broadly, we continue to provide tens of thousands of pieces of information to the inquiry, 55,000 documents over the past 11 months and we will do so in the spirit of transparency and candour.\"<br/>The UK saw one of the worst first waves of Covid in Europe in spring 2020. <br/>In April and May that year, about 160,000 deaths were registered: 60,000 more than you'd expect based on the years just before the pandemic. <br/>But by that winter the UK had been overtaken by many countries in eastern Europe who had seemed to escape the first wave. <br/>The UK's Office for National Statistics has continued to analyse these figures for Europe and, as of July last year, put the UK  in the middle of the pack. <br/>According to Department of Health figures, 227,321 people died across the UK with Covid recorded on their death certificate.<br/>Covid vaccines have prevented many deaths and serious illness from the virus - more than 151m doses have been given in the UK. <br/>The questions we want the Covid inquiry to answer<br/>What is the UK Covid inquiry and how long will it take?<br/>UK Covid-19 Inquiry<br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Paigon is slang for enemy. The song is explicit and listener discretion is advised.<br/>In the past, HMRC has closed its telephone line when it could not cope with demand, a public accounts committee report has said. <br/>In the past five years the number of customer service staff has reduced from 25,500 to 19,500 as HMRC has moved more customers to digital systems. <br/>A HMRC spokesperson said: \"Our online services, including the HMRC app, are quick and easy to use and have been significantly improved.\"<br/>While the helpline is closed, taxpayers will be redirected to a digital assistant and online guidance. HMRC have said this change will free up 350 advisers to take urgent calls on other lines and answer customer correspondence. <br/>Jonathan Eida, of the Taxpayers Alliance, said: \"Taxpayers will be furious to learn that HMRC's self-assessment phone will be off the hook for months this year. <br/>\"Workers trying to do the right thing require assistance all year around, and for many people going online presents a number of challenges. <br/>\"HMRC should reverse this decision and pick up the phone this summer.\"   <br/>You must fill in a self-assessment tax return if in the last tax year you were self-employed as a \"sole trader\" and earned more than \u00a31,000, if you in a business partnership or if you earned \u00a3100,000 or more. <br/>Conservative MP Harriett Baldwin, chair of the Treasury committee, said: \"Given the potentially significant impact closing the self-assessment helpline may have on taxpayers, we're looking for clarification that HMRC has fully considered the costs and benefits of this decision. <br/>\"There are also concerns around the short notice with which this was announced. HMRC must be open, upfront and transparent when making decisions which could impact so many individuals.\" <br/>Ms Baldwin has written to HMRC to ask about the impact the closure will have on taxpayers and whether an analysis and consultation has taken place. <br/>She also wants to know if the helpline will be reopened earlier than planned if the negative impact on taxpayers is greater than expected. <br/>Ms Baldwin also asks if the closure of the helpline is related to HMRC's homeworking policy or staffing issues, as well as for information on the procedures in place to assist vulnerable taxpayers and those unable to use digital services. <br/>A HMRC spokesperson said: \"We continually review our services and a seasonal [self-assessment] helpline will make more of our expert advisers available to respond to the most urgent queries over the summer.\"<br/>The self-assessment helpline receives far fewer calls over the summer, with calls around 50% higher between January and April compared with June to August according to HMRC.<br/>HMRC also previously announced a decision to close its VAT registration helpline from Monday 22 May. <br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

You are showing your poor upbringing by bullying'.\" <br/>But, the commissioner found, Ms Joshi had \"also publicly made potentially damaging allegations about Lord Ranger\".<br/>\"Both Lord Ranger and Ms Joshi sought to undermine one another by issuing inflammatory tweets and sought to involve their family members in their dispute,\" the report said.<br/>\"Ms Joshi claimed that her social media activity was intended to hold Lord Ranger 'to account' but there were occasions where it appeared that her tweets were intended to insult or ridicule him.\"<br/>The commissioner rejected Ms Joshi's complaint that Lord Ranger had also broken the rules relating to the use of Lords facilities by charging uninvited guests at the Diwali event up to \u00a320 to cover costs.<br/>In conclusion, Mr Khan said there had been \"fault on both sides\" in this case. <br/>He said Lord Ranger would normally have been facing a short suspension from the Lords over his conduct, but in light of the \"significant provocation by Ms Joshi\" a public apology and behaviour training \"constituted an appropriate outcome\".<br/>In a statement, Lord Ranger said: \"The commissioner has found my behaviour fell short of the high standards I expect of myself, and which others expect of me as a sitting member of the House of Lords. I have expressed my remorse and I apologise to Ms Joshi.<br/>\"The investigation process and reading and reflecting on the report has had a profound and lasting effect on me. I will continue to self-reflect and learn from this experience.\"  <br/>In a statement on Twitter, Ms Joshi said: \"I truly hope that he will learn from this and treat everyone with the respect and dignity that they deserve.<br/>\"Onwards and upwards from here implementing the lessons I have learnt along the way...\" <br/>Lord Ranger launched legal action against Ms Joshi over her social media messages but the pair reached an out-of-court settlement. <br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

In response, Mr Johnson accused Mr Sunak of \"talking rubbish\".<br/>The resignation honours list is a tradition that gives outgoing prime ministers the opportunity to nominate people for honours.<br/>The House of Lords Appointments Commission (HOLAC) said it rejected eight of Mr Johnson's nominations. However, there has been no confirmation of who the nominees were and why they were not included on the list.<br/>A Cabinet Office spokesperson said HOLAC did not support the peerage nominations of the MPs put forward by Mr Johnson.<br/>The spokesperson added: \"It is unprecedented for a sitting prime minister to invite HOLAC to reconsider the vetting of individual nominees on a former prime minister's resignation list.\"<br/>But Ms Dorries said Mr Sunak's team \"had made sure that certain names would not be on\" the list sent to HOLAC. Ms Dorries added she understands this \"to be true despite denials from those concerned\".<br/>Ms Dorries used her article to argue for her place in the House of Lords, writing: \"I was born into poverty and clawed my way out of it to build a new life for me and my family, and then carved out a role in public service.<br/>\"A seat in the Lords was recognition of that - and a means of continuing to give back to society.\"<br/>The prime minister's press secretary has denied Ms Dorries' version of events, saying: \"No-one in No10 amended or edited any list.\"<br/>\"As is convention, on receiving the former prime minister's resignation honours list the prime minister forwarded the peerage list unaltered to HOLAC,\" the press secretary said.<br/>Ms Dorries said Mr Johnson had told her in autumn last year she had been put on his resignation honours list.<br/>The former culture secretary said she had been vetted for the peerage, but because six months had passed, her checks had expired.<br/>She also said Mr Sunak and Mr Johnson had a meeting last week to discuss his honours list.<br/>Ms Dorries accused the prime minister of using \"weasel words\" at that meeting to give Mr Johnson the impression Mr Sunak would ask HOLAC to restart the vetting process.<br/>According to Ms Dorries, these \"duplicitous machinations\" were to avoid a by-election caused when an MP steps down to take a seat in the House of Lords.<br/>Why did Boris Johnson resign?<br/>Johnson and Sunak escalate feud over honours list<br/>The ghost of Boris Johnson haunts Rishi Sunak<br/>Country doesn't miss Johnson drama, says Shapps<br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

It makes a case for Parliament to start looking at this issue in detail.\"<br/>Labour MP Stella Creasy also called for urgent reform, telling BBC Two's Newsnight programme: \"I don't understand in whose interests this case was.\"<br/>Madeline Page, director of the Alliance of Pro-Life Students, described the case as a \"sad situation\" and said she would welcome a parliamentary debate.<br/>The Society for the Protection of Unborn Children, which opposes abortion, criticised providers for \"pushing for dangerous home abortions,\" and said women such as Foster were \"left to self-administer these drugs alone with no medical supervision or support.\"<br/>But providers say the most common side-effects of at-home abortions are \"usually easy to treat\", and \"rarely have any long-term health effects\". <br/>The British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) is one of 30 campaign and health groups calling for the law to be repealed to decriminalise women seeking to end their own pregnancies.<br/>BPAS chief executive Clare Murphy told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"We are now seeing a mother-of-three prosecuted under laws that do not exist in the same way in any other country.\"<br/>She said \"a growing number of women\" were coming under police investigation over suspected illegal abortions, with another woman facing trial later this year. <br/>A spokesperson for the Crown Prosecution Service said cases such as that of Carla Foster were \"exceptionally rare... complex and traumatic\".<br/>They added: \"Our prosecutors have a duty to ensure that laws set by Parliament are properly considered and applied when making difficult charging decisions.\"<br/>Downing Street said it recognised that abortion was \"a highly emotive issue and there is a strength of feeling on all sides,\" but \"the law is clearly set out.\"<br/>\"It's up to the police and the judiciary to enforce it,\" the spokesperson added. <br/>Dame Diana Johnson, chair of the home affairs select committee, called for the government to decriminalise abortion.<br/>She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"Removing the criminal law is a very sensible, reasonable step, but it's not to deregulate abortion care and who can provide it.\"<br/>The CPS argued in court that Foster had been aware of abortion limits and had provided false information during a remote medical consultation. <br/>Her defence said lockdown and minimising face-to-face appointments had changed access to healthcare, adding: \"This will haunt her forever.\" <br/>Foster went into labour on 11 May 2020 and the baby was confirmed dead 45 minutes later. <br/>The 44-year-old from Staffordshire had moved back in with her estranged partner at the start of lockdown while carrying another man's baby, the court heard.<br/>Sentencing, judge Mr Justice Edward Pepperall accepted she had been \"in emotional turmoil\" as she sought to hide the pregnancy.<br/>He said she was a good mother to her three sons, one of whom has special needs, and that a suspended sentence might have been possible if there had been an earlier guilty plea.<br/>But he rejected appeals from women's health organisations to pass a non-custodial sentence, saying it was the court's duty to \"apply the law as provided by Parliament\".<br/>Ahead of Monday's hearing, a letter co-signed by a number of women's health organisations was sent to the court calling for a non-custodial sentence.<br/>The judge told the defendant the letter's authors were \"concerned that your imprisonment might deter other women from accessing telemedical abortion services and other late-gestation women from seeking medical care or from being open and honest with medical professionals\".<br/>But he said it also \"has the capacity to be seen as special pleading by those who favour wider access to abortions and is, in my judgment, just as inappropriate as it would be for a judge to receive a letter from one of the groups campaigning for more restrictive laws\".<br/>Mother jailed for taking abortion pills too late<br/>Abortion rise 'may be driven by cost of living'<br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Instead, existing regulators will come up with new industry guidance.<br/>It marks a contrast with the European Union, which is set to ban public authorities using AI to classify citizens' behaviour, and bring in strict limits on AI-powered facial recognition for law enforcement in public spaces.<br/>The use of AI tools for border management would also be subject to new controls, such as being recorded in an EU-wide register.<br/>In their statement, the campaign groups said the UK's own blueprint had missed a \"vital opportunity\" to beef up safeguards on how government bodies use AI.<br/>In particular, the groups zeroed in on government algorithms often used to help officials make decisions by analysing large amounts of data.<br/>It is thought that some of these tools use machine learning - a widely-used form of AI that can train systems to improve their performance over time. Critics argue this can lead to discrimination if it is based on biased data.<br/>One such system, used by Department of Work and Pensions officials to help identify benefit claimants suspected of fraud, is currently the subject of a legal challenge over concerns it could discriminate against disabled people.<br/>The PLP, which has identified over 40 automated systems used by public bodies, has also launched its own legal action against a Home Office algorithm used to flag suspected sham marriages, which it says could discriminate on the basis of nationality.<br/>Public bodies using such systems have to comply with additional equality rules. But campaigners say it is difficult to know if these are being followed, because authorities fail to give enough information about how they work.<br/>The document sent to MPs called for public bodies to be legally obliged to inform people when AI is used to make decisions, and for the government's algorithm transparency register, currently voluntary, to be mandatory. <br/>It also demanded an \"adequately resourced\" specialist regulator to handle complaints from people adversely affected by decisions.<br/>It also expressed concern about the government's Data Protection Bill, currently going through Parliament, which would widen when legally significant decisions can be made without human oversight.<br/>The government argues current EU-derived rules, dating from 2018, are outdated and could stymie the development of beneficial AI tools.<br/>But Mariano delli Santi, legal and policy officer at the Open Rights Group, said the bill was \"removing or watering down\" existing safeguards, depriving regulators of the tools they need \"when AI goes wrong\".<br/>The technology department, responsible for AI regulation, said the UK's approach would promote \"fairness, explainability and accountability\" in new systems.<br/>In a statement, it added that it was taking an \"adaptable\" approach to designing new rules, which recognised the \"rapid pace of development in AI capabilities\".<br/>Home Office drops 'racist' visa decision algorithm<br/>Stay ahead in AI race, tech boss urges West<br/>African leaders tour Kyiv after air raid alert<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Greece denies coastguard rope led to boat tragedy<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

This by convention is something peers virtually never do. <br/>She said she had thought long and hard before putting her motion, but she said: \"We threw this out and they're bringing it back in a sneaky way - and quite honestly it's breaking all the rules.\" <br/>Lord Jackson retorted that the Lords would be in danger of \"legislative over-reach\" if it believed it knew better than the elected Commons - their role was to revise legislation, not strike it down. <br/>For the opposition parties to defeat the government in the Lords, they need Labour on board, and Baroness Jones hopes they will allow their peers at least a free vote. <br/>But Labour shadow Home Office minister Lord Coaker says his party is not prepared to break the normal conventions of the Lords to defeat the changes.<br/>\"We certainly aren't going to vote to kill it. Our position is very clear.

In evidence given in March, Mr Johnson admitted misleading Parliament, but denied doing it on purpose.<br/>The committee met on Monday and are likely to meet again on Tuesday to finalise the report. <br/>The committee had been preparing to recommend suspending Mr Johnson as an MP for 10 days or more, the BBC was told, a threshold which would have resulted in a recall petition among his constituents and a potential by-election.<br/>After receiving an advanced copy of the report on Friday, Mr Johnson shocked Westminster by announcing his resignation as the MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip.<br/>In his resignation letter, he vehemently attacked MPs on the committee, accusing them of trying to \"drive him out of Parliament\". <br/>He said most members of the committee, including Labour's Harriet Harman who took over from Mr Bryant as chair of the inquiry \"had already expressed deeply prejudicial remarks about my guilt before they had even seen the evidence\".<br/>On Sunday, Mr Johnson's close ally Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg said the committee's report was \"clearly partisan\" and \"biased\".<br/>However, Mr Bryant issued a strong defence of the MPs telling the BBC: \"This was a committee set up by whole House of Commons, it had a Conservative majority on it and it is now being judged on the basis of a report that no one has even seen yet - absolutely appalling and preposterous.\"<br/>\"We have enough nastiness in politics without people stirring this up. People like Jacob Rees-Mogg should be utterly ashamed of themselves.\" <br/>Asked about the criticism, Rishi Sunak's spokesman said the committee was \"properly set up\" and that the government would \"in no way criticise the work of the committee who are carrying out what Parliament has asked them to do\". <br/>\"People are entitled to express opinions. What we wouldn't want to see is people unfairly traducing the work of a legitimate committee.\" <br/>Members of the Privileges Committee have been offered additional security, the BBC's Chris Mason says.<br/>Our political editor says there is widespread anger among the MPs' colleagues - from many political parties - that the tenor, tone and language of some of the criticisms of the committee, from Mr Johnson and others, has contributed to an atmosphere where committee members feel vulnerable. <br/>He says there is additional irritation that, some believe, the integrity of committee members has been impugned without them being able to respond to it publicly. <br/>In addition to reaching a conclusion on Mr Johnson, it is also expected that the report will reflect on the conduct of others in Parliament in how they have described the committee during its work, but without naming them. <br/>Mr Johnson stood down from Parliament just hours after Downing Street published his resignation honours list without the names of key supporters, including Nadine Dorries, Sir Alok Sharma and Nigel Adams.<br/>All three had been expecting to be appointed to the House of Lords.<br/>Competing claims about how and why the names were removed are now at the heart of a rift within the Tory party following the former PM's resignation.<br/>The House of Lords Appointments Commission (HOLAC) - the official body for checking and vetting new peers - has confirmed it rejected eight of Mr Johnson's nominations on the grounds of propriety.<br/>On Monday, Mr Gove defended the decision to pass Mr Johnson's honours list to the King before the Privileges Committee report was published, insisting this was a \"separate procedure\".<br/>Within 24 hours of the list being published, both Ms Dorries and Mr Adams resigned as MPs - triggering by-elections in their constituencies, both of which are considered safe seats for the Conservatives.<br/>Mr Johnson's resignation also triggers a by-election in his marginal constituency of Uxbridge and South Ruislip.<br/>Headlines about ex-leaders make governing tougher<br/>Country doesn't miss Johnson drama, says Shapps<br/>I've been forced out over Partygate report - Johnson<br/>Why did Boris Johnson resign?<br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

But using an external agency to resolve workplace issues is not difficult. <br/>\"Neither Parliament nor the whips' offices are equipped to do it. This is highly specialised stuff.\" <br/>She said whips could remove the whip from MPs, but \"that's a political party decision\".<br/>\"The whips shouldn't be enacting sanctions as part of the complaints process. It may be considered prudent by a political party to withdraw the whip pending an investigation.\" <br/>Current MPs have also raised concerns about a lack of \"HR professionals\" to deal with cases like this. <br/>One Conservative MP said: \"Where does the buck stop? The whips, the police, the Speaker, there's also the parties. I don't see that there is any formal coming together of those.\" <br/>Parties often \"live in fear of someone saying: 'why didn't you take action?' That's where the judgement comes,\" they added.   <br/>This MP said that, while they still wanted a say in who their staff were, \"I do think there's a benefit in more HR support for MPs - I'm not an HR expert.\" <br/>They compared MPs employing their own staff with Parliament \"dealing in effect with 650 small businesses\".  <br/>Another former chief whip the BBC spoke to echoed the argument for \"external supervision\", saying the role of the whips was to \"look after their flock, not to sit in judgement of them\", and to persuade them to vote with their party the \"right\" way. <br/>On Monday, MPs will debate proposals to bar some MPs under criminal investigation for violent or sexual offences from setting foot in Parliament. <br/>The proposals have been drawn up by the House of Commons Commission, a body of senior MPs which oversees the working of the Commons, following a consultation.<br/>If approved, the plans could allow MPs or peers to be barred from the Houses of Parliament if they are deemed to pose a risk.<br/>The exclusion would apply to the parliamentary estate in Westminster and any parliamentary-funded travel.<br/>MPs are being asked to have their say on the plans, but a formal vote has yet to be arranged. <br/>The Commission has proposed that if the parliamentary authorities were presented with credible allegations of a sexual or violent offence by the police at any point in the criminal justice process, a staff panel would assess the claims.<br/>If the panel undertook a full risk assessment on the basis of information provided by the police, it would consider the nature of the alleged misconduct and whether there were any safeguarding concerns.<br/>If this led to exclusion being recommended, this would be put to an adjudication panel for a decision.<br/>Under the proposals, excluded members would get a proxy vote so their constituents were not disadvantaged.<br/>The BBC has been told there is some disagreement on the plans - with a number of MPs arguing members should not be excluded unless they are charged by police, and others arguing that the threshold for exclusion should be lower. <br/>One former chief whip said excluding people who had not been charged flew \"against natural justice\".<br/>\"Allegations can be made against members of parliament that may be false, and they may be made in a vexatious way.\" <br/>Ms Milton said she believed Parliament should be able to vote on excluding MPs from the Commons, because it was \"quite a serious issue democratically\". <br/>\"Their [MPs'] job is to hold the government to account.

legislation designed to protect people from harmful content while preserving principles of freedom of speech.<br/>Mr Scully said: \"I'd like to extend my deepest gratitude to Team Scully, the many volunteers, activists, councillors, AMs and MPs across London who supported my campaign. <br/>\"Your dedication and scale of support has been incredible.\"<br/>Mr Khan added: \"You've got a Conservative party who have stopped the Minister for London from standing to be the Conservative mayoral candidate, because they're clearly running scared of standing on the Conservative record.<br/>\"I'm going to be standing on my record next May and I'll be pointing out the Conservative record over the last 14 years.\" <br/>Ms Hall was, until last month, leader of the Conservative group on the London Assembly where she has demonstrated a combative style in scrutinising and criticising the current Labour mayor.<br/>She said that made her \"ideally placed\" to challenge Mr Khan next May.<br/>The former Harrow councillor has vowed to restore confidence in the police on issues like burglary, theft and women's safety.<br/>Ms Hall is part of a nine-strong Tory opposition group at City Hall that has been raising questions over the ultra-low emission zone (ULEZ) and pressurising the mayor to scrap its planned expansion to outer London from 29 August.<br/>Mr Korski was deputy head of policy at 10 Downing Street and a special adviser to David Cameron.<br/>He campaigned for the UK to stay in the EU and left frontline politics after the Brexit vote in 2016.<br/>He founded a technology company that provides advice on digital strategy to clients including government departments and public bodies.<br/>Finding better ways to use technology to improve the capital's public services is at the heart of his bid.<br/>He claims the ULEZ expansion is unnecessary, and it would be possible to move more quickly than the current mayor is saying to a more sophisticated road-user charging scheme - where drivers pay according to what journeys they do and at what time. <br/>The inclusion of Mr Hossain will be a surprise to many because it did not appear widely known that he had applied.<br/>He is a leading barrister and King's Counsel and has been described by the Court of Appeal as an advocate of \"great eloquence\". <br/>Mr Hossain was born in Barisal, Bangladesh, and came to the UK in 1995.<br/>In 2019, he became the first Bangladeshi-born criminal barrister to be appointed Queen's Counsel.<br/>Mr Khan's Conservative opponent in the last mayoral election in 2021, Shaun Bailey, has meanwhile been offered a peerage by former prime minister and ex-London mayor, Boris Johnson. <br/>Commenting on the news, Mr Khan joked about the 2024 election: \"What I'd say to the three candidates is, obviously I'm hoping that I win and I'm chosen, but the good news for them is anyone who loses gets a job in the House of Lords.\"<br/>In a statement on Sunday, issued as the shortlist of candidates was published, Conservative Party chairman Greg Hands MP said: \"All three of these individuals have shown great commitment to fighting Sadiq Khan and to bettering London with the Conservatives.<br/>\"I thank all of the candidates that put their name forward for this process and look forward to the hustings to come.\"<br/>Follow BBC London on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

And maybe Lord Speakers past and present will weigh in. <br/>Many peers have identified patronage in appointments to the Lords as the main reputational threat to their chamber. <br/>All this will be superimposed on an otherwise low-key parliamentary agenda - it's been getting embarrassing; last week saw the Lords sit until 04:16 on Thursday morning debating the Illegal Migration Bill, while the Commons ran out of steam on Tuesday at 14:20. <br/>Peers are debating late into the night; MPs are home in time for Hollyoaks. There may be efforts to avoid the unbearable lightness of last week's Commons business in the week ahead, but the causes remain the same - a surfeit of detailed legislation inching through the Upper House, while MPs twiddle their thumbs on the green benches of the Commons.<br/>On the committee corridor, watch out for the Home Secretary, Suella Braverman's appearance before Home Affairs on Wednesday - but as has been the recent trend, the real action is in the Lords, where peers have continued to defeat the government on a variety of issues and continue to battle the Commons over the Retained EU Law Bill.<br/>But while they regularly push back on the content of bills, Labour inhibitions about voting down secondary legislation make it highly unlikely that Green Party peer Jenny Jones's attempt to strike down an order which would give the police greater power to control or ban protest marches will have the numbers to succeed.<br/>Commons (14:30): Education Questions, with any urgent questions or government statements following.<br/>Main debate: Motion to approve a statutory instrument, the Public Order Act 1986 (Serious Disruption to the Life of the Community) Regulations 2023. This is a highly controversial measure to rewrite what constitutes serious disruption, with the aim of giving clearer legal underpinning for the police to ban or restrict protests.<br/>That's followed by a general debate on proposed new rules for risk-based exclusion of MPs who have been accused of sexual misconduct or violent offences. This is a tough issue where the constitutional rights of MPs to attend Parliament are balanced against the safeguarding concerns of the thousands of people who work on the parliamentary estate, and many MPs are worried that the new system would make excluding them from parliament the option of first resort, as soon as there was a live accusation.<br/>The expectation had been that there would be a vote to approve proposals from the House of Commons Commission, the Commons administrative arm, but, tellingly, there will not now be a vote. The Commons Leader, Penny Morduant has, however, said she expects their will be a vote before the Summer recess. Watch out for pressure to rewrite the proposals.<br/>MPs also respond to the latest Lords amendments to the Retained EU Law Bill. This bill is now bouncing between the two Houses, and peers have pinged back new clauses requiring that EU regulations rewritten by ministers must be put before Parliament, with the possibility of debate and amendment in both Houses, and that such regulations must not reduce environmental protections and must not conflict with the UK's international agreements. Expect a few rounds more of ping pong between the Commons and the Lords.<br/>Westminster Hall: Petitions Committee debate (16:30) on two petitions taking opposite views on the legal definition of sex - the first, e-petition 623243 calls on the government to update the Equality Act to make clear the characteristic \"sex\" is biological sex and not \"sex as modified by a Gender Recognition Certificate\". This petition attracted 109,463 signatures.<br/>The second, e-petition 627984 says the government should commit to NOT amending the Equality Act's definition of sex, arguing that ministers had previously committed to not remove legal protections for trans people, an already marginalised group, but this change would do so. The petition attracted 138,886 signatures<br/>Committees: Foreign Affairs (16:00) questions Foreign Secretary James Cleverly on UK relations in the Indo-Pacific region. There will be more general questions, too.<br/>Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (16:00) holds the first evidence session of its inquiry into the finances and sustainability of the social housing sector in England, with evidence from the National Housing Federation and housing associations, plus academic experts.<br/>Lords (14:30): It's day four of committee scrutiny on the Illegal Migration Bill , with another late night in prospect. Remember, this is the preliminary phase of detailed debate - attempts to amend the bill follow at the later report stage, in July.<br/>Commons (11:30): Foreign Office Questions, followed by a Ten Minute Rule Bill in which Conservative Richard Graham proposes a measure against spiking drinks with alcohol or drugs.<br/>Main debate: MPs polish off the Procurement Bill - watch out for a joint amendment proposed by former anti-corruption Czar John Penrose and Public Accounts Committee Chair, Dame Meg Hillier, to require all government contracts to specify the policy objective they seek to meet, so future contracts can be judged by results.<br/>Westminster Hall: Conservative Richard Fuller leads a debate (14:30) on the proposed Bedford to Cambridge rail link - one facet of the wider development controversies between Oxford and Cambridge. Could be lively.<br/>Committees: Business and Trade (10:00) hear from CBI chief Rain Newton-Smith on the aftershocks of its recent scandals.   <br/>Culture Media and Sport (10:00) quiz BBC Director General Tim Davie on issues including overall performance, impartiality, commercial activities, equal pay, safeguarding and the licence fee. MPs will also discuss the internal review of former Chair Richard Sharp and the appointment process for a new chair.<br/>Education (10:00) holds a one-off session with Ofsted's Chief Inspector Amanda Spielman covering children's social care and safeguarding.<br/>Lords (14:30): Day three of report consideration of the Financial Services and Markets Bill - watch out for amendments financial products which link to deforestation, and on reviewing pension funds potential to fuel economic growth - a policy option flagged up by Labour.<br/>Then there's the ultra-contentious Draft Public Order Act 1986 (Serious Disruption to the Life of the Community) Regulations 2023 - new regulations, which will give the police clearer powers to stop slow-walking protest marches blocking roads and bringing cities to a halt.<br/>Labour have a regret motion from Lord Coaker complaining about both the content and the process - while the Greens' Baroness Jones will propose a rare \"fatal motion\" which would kill the order. She looks unlikely to succeed, given that Labour will not support her, and without the biggest Opposition Party, the numbers don't stack up.<br/>Commons (11:30): Science Innovation and Technology questions, followed, at noon, by Prime Minister's Question Time.<br/>Ten Minute Rule Bill: Labour's Emma Lewell Buck wants to ensure families eligible for the Healthy Start Scheme, which provides help to buy food and milk for low income parents, are registered to receive it.<br/>Main debate: A half day debate on an SNP motion to be announced (they usually come up with some cunning device to ensure that the government has to actually vote against their motion, rather than ignore it). That's followed by a general debate on defence policy - including Ukraine and Nato.<br/>Westminster Hall: Labour's Rebecca Long-Baily leads a debate on insolvency law and director disqualifications (14:30).<br/>Committees: Home Affairs (09:45) questions Home Secretary Suella Braverman on issues including asylum and immigration, policing, Windrush, violence against women and girls, fraud strategy and the Passport Office. <br/>Culture Media and Sport (10:00) plunges into the Phillip Schofield controversy with ITV chief executive Dame Carolyn McCall facing questions on the broadcaster's approach to safeguarding and complaint handling.<br/>Lords (15:00): Another long committee stage day on the Illegal Migration Bill beckons; this is supposed to be the final one. Bring a toothbrush.<br/>Commons (09:30): Culture, Media and Sport questions, followed mini question times for the MPs who represent the Church Commissioners, the House of Commons Commission, the Public Accounts Commission, the Parliamentary Restoration and Renewal Client Board, and the Electoral Commission.<br/>Finally, there's the weekly update on the forthcoming Commons agenda, from the Leader of the House.<br/>Main debate: Dame Angela Eagle and Elliot Colburn lead a backbench debate on Pride Month - this is now an annual event and will cover such subjects as conversion therapy, and the lack of a bill to ban it; hate crime and the government's review into relationship and sex education.<br/>That's followed by another backbench debate, on government policies on migration - led by Dan Carden, Sir Peter Bottomley and Tim Loughton, who say a broad debate is urgently needed to address numerous outstanding issues on migration policy.<br/>Westminster Hall: Debates on the Scottish Affairs Committee report on public broadcasting in Scotland, led by Committee Chair Pete Wishart (13:30), and then on VAT on audiobooks - Conservative Sir Mike Penning wants VAT removed on audiobooks, to bring them into line with the zero-rating of paper books. He argues that charging VAT penalises blind and partially sighted people.<br/>Committees: Public Accounts (10:00) question senior officials on the effort to get to net zero by 2050.<br/>Lords (11:00): Debate on the performance of the NHS and health service innovation; on support for freelancers in the arts and creative industries and on local government in England.<br/>The Commons is not sitting.<br/>Lords (10:00): Peers will whiz through the third reading rubber-stamping of a series of private members' bills (laws proposed by individual MPs) sent over from the Commons - the Shark Fins Bill, the Co-operatives, Mutuals and Friendly Societies Bill , the Child Support Collection (Domestic Abuse) Bill, the Offenders (Day of Release from Detention) Bill, and the Supported Housing (Regulatory Oversight) Bill.<br/>This is their final parliamentary stage and they will shortly become law.<br/>Also up for third reading - the Ofcom (Duty Regarding Prevention of Serious Self-harm and Suicide) Bill and the Coroners (Determination of Suicide) Bill. Although they will clear their Lords process, they will not be debated in the Commons.<br/>Then it's back to more private members' bills from MPs - with second reading (initial) debates on the Hunting Trophies (Import Prohibition) Bill, the Powers of Attorney Bill, the Workers (Predictable Terms and Conditions) Bill and the Protection from Sex-based Harassment in Public Bill.<br/>Also up for debate, but again with no real chance of becoming law, the Public Advocate Bill (from Labour's Lord Wills).<br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

In the five months to the end of May, Albanian small boat arrivals are down 90% on last year and we have returned 1,800 illegal migrants and foreign criminals back to Albania.

that is his own decision.\"<br/>\"People don't miss the drama\" of Mr Johnson's time in office, Mr Shapps added. <br/>Mr Johnson announced he was leaving parliament a day after seeing advance a report of the findings of the Commons Privileges Committee investigating into whether he misled the Commons over Partygate. <br/>In an explosive and lengthy statement, he called the committee a \"kangaroo court\" whose purpose \"has been to find me guilty, regardless of the facts\".<br/>In a written statement, Mr Johnson said the draft report from the committee was \"riddled with inaccuracies and reeks of prejudice\".<br/>He said the committee was \"determined to use the proceedings against me to drive me out of Parliament\".<br/>Asked about Mr Johnson's comments, Mr Shapps said: \"I haven't seen what they've written, but I have no particular reason to think that is the case.\"<br/>Labour's shadow foreign secretary David Lammy said the fallout from Mr Johnson's resignation shows \"there should be a general election\".<br/>Speaking on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Lammy said: \"We have a former prime minister crafting a letter undermining the sitting prime minister.  <br/>\"And we've got three by-elections brought about, not in the usual way because an MP has passed away, or there has been wrongdoing, but simply because these MPs want to put pressure on the current government.<br/>\"I don't say this with any glee, I say it because I genuinely believe, in the interests of this country, we need certainty.\"<br/>I've been forced out over Partygate report -

There is no anchor to any discernible truth or sense of integrity.\"<br/>He adds that Mr Johnson will leave Parliament and \"have little to do with the reality of the mess he left behind\".<br/>Elsewhere in the Sunday Mirror, Sir Keir accused Mr Sunak of failing to stand up to Mr Johnson and agreeing \"to hand gongs to a cast list of cronies\".<br/>\"Rishi Sunak must finally find a backbone, call an election, and let the public have their say on 13 years of Tory failure,\" he added.<br/>A government source rejected that and said Mr Sunak was focussed on delivering \"what the British people want.\"<br/>I've been forced out over Partygate report - Johnson<br/>Third by-election for Tories as Johnson ally quits<br/>Boris Johnson - facts, farce, four tragedies and the future<br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Why have we junked measures to help people into housing or to scrap EU directives or to promote animal welfare?\"<br/>It was a direct aim at Prime Minister Rishi Sunak - hours after he stepped off a plane from Washington where Mr Sunak was not talking about a free trade agreement with the US. <br/>And Mr Johnson's statement was an attempt to rally Brexiteers in his party, suggesting his demise was driven by a motivation to \"reverse the 2016 referendum result\".<br/>The statement contained further criticism of former senior civil servant Sue Gray, who investigated lockdown gatherings at Number 10. <br/>\"I am afraid I no longer believe that it is any coincidence\" that she will soon become \"chief of staff designate\" of the Labour leader Sir Kier Starmer, Mr Johnson wrote.<br/>Ending his 1,000-word letter, Mr Johnson said he was \"very sad to be leaving Parliament\" before adding - \"at least for now\" - for anyone thinking he is about to retreat into obscurity. <br/>Mr Johnson's exit will trigger a by-election in his west London seat, which he held with a 7,000 vote majority in the 2019 election. <br/>The Conservatives will also have to defend the Mid Bedfordshire seat of Nadine Dorries - a close ally of Mr Johnson - after she stepped down as an MP earlier on Friday.<br/>Mr Johnson's dramatic move came after he was given the committee's findings, including details of criticisms it intended to make and evidence to support its conclusion. <br/>He had faced a potential by-election if MPs recommended a suspension from the Commons as a punishment for misleading Parliament. <br/>Responding to his statement, a Privileges Committee spokesperson said: \"The committee has followed the procedures and the mandate of the House at all times and will continue to do so.<br/>\"Mr Johnson has departed from the processes of the House and has impugned the integrity of the House by his statement. The committee will meet on Monday to conclude the inquiry and to publish its report promptly.\"<br/>Elsewhere, Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner condemned what she called a \"never-ending Tory soap opera\".<br/>For the Liberal Democrats, deputy leader Daisy Cooper said: \"Good riddance.\"<br/>And SNP deputy Westminster leader Mhairi Black said Mr Johnson \"jumped before he was pushed\", adding \"no-one in Scotland will be sorry to see the back of him\". <br/>However, former home secretary Priti Patel, who was made a Dame in his resignations honours list also announced on Friday, praised Mr Johnson for his work as prime minister on the issues of Ukraine and Brexit, describing him as \"a political titan\". <br/>Boris Johnson's local Conservative association chairman, Richard Mills, said the former PM \"has delivered on his promises to local residents\".<br/>Another sitting MP announced in the resignation honours list, Sir Michael Fabricant, criticised the Privileges Committee for what he called its \"disgraceful treatment\" of the former prime minister. <br/>Mr Johnson was prime minister from July 2019 until September 2022, and has been an MP since 2001 - although not continuously, having served as mayor of London between 2008 and 2016. <br/>The ghost of Boris Johnson haunts Rishi Sunak<br/>Boris Johnson: Resignation statement in full<br/>Patel and Rees-Mogg rewarded in Johnson honours list<br/>I misled MPs but not intentionally, says Johnson<br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

I take my responsibilities seriously. I did not lie, and I believe that in their hearts, the Committee know it.\u00a0But they have wilfully chosen to ignore the truth, because from the outset, their purpose has not been to discover the truth, or genuinely to understand what was in my mind when I spoke in the Commons.\u00a0<br/>Their purpose from the beginning has been to find me guilty, regardless of the facts.\u00a0This is the very definition of a kangaroo court.\u00a0<br/>Most members of the Committee - especially the chair - had already expressed deeply prejudicial remarks about my guilt before they had even seen the evidence. They should have recused themselves.\u00a0<br/>In retrospect, it was na\u00efve and trusting of me to think that these proceedings could be remotely useful or fair. But I was determined to believe in the system, and in justice, and to vindicate what I knew to be the truth. <br/>It was the same faith in the impartiality of our systems that led me to commission Sue Gray. It is clear that my faith has been misplaced.\u00a0Of course, it suits the Labour Party, the Liberal Democrats and the SNP to do whatever they can to remove me from Parliament.\u00a0 <br/>Sadly, as we saw in July last year, there are currently some Tory MPs who share that view.\u00a0I am not alone in thinking that there is a witch hunt under way, to take revenge for Brexit and ultimately to reverse the 2016 referendum result.\u00a0<br/>My removal is the necessary first step, and I believe there has been a concerted attempt to bring it about.\u00a0I am afraid I no longer believe that it is any coincidence that Sue Gray - who investigated gatherings in Number 10 - is now the chief of staff designate of the Labour leader.\u00a0<br/>Nor do I believe that it is any coincidence that her supposedly impartial chief counsel, Daniel Stilitz KC, turned out to be a strong Labour supporter who repeatedly tweeted personal\u00a0attacks on me and the government.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>When I left office last year, the government was only a handful of points behind in the polls.\u00a0That gap has now massively widened.\u00a0<br/>Just a few years after winning the biggest majority in almost half a century, that majority is now clearly at risk.\u00a0<br/>Our party needs urgently to recapture its sense of momentum and its belief in what this country can do.\u00a0<br/>We need to show how we are making the most of Brexit and we need in the next months to be setting out a pro-growth and pro-investment agenda. We need to cut business and personal taxes - and not just as pre-election gimmicks - rather than endlessly putting them up.\u00a0<br/>We must not be afraid to be a properly Conservative government.\u00a0<br/>Why have we so passively abandoned the prospect of a Free Trade Deal with the US? Why have we junked measures to help people into housing or to scrap EU directives or to promote animal welfare?\u00a0<br/>We need to deliver on the 2019 manifesto, which was endorsed by 14 million people.\u00a0We should remember that more than 17 million voted for Brexit.\u00a0<br/>I am now being forced out of Parliament by a tiny handful of people, with no evidence to back up their assertions, and without the approval even of Conservative party members, let alone the wider electorate. <br/>I believe that a dangerous and unsettling precedent is being set.\u00a0<br/>The Conservative Party\u00a0has the time to recover its mojo and its ambition and to win the next election.\u00a0I had looked forward to providing enthusiastic support as a backbench MP.

But there will now be one in Mr Johnson's own constituency of Uxbridge and South Ruislip.<br/>Former Conservative minister Nadine Dorries was not put forward for the House of Lords, despite speculation she would be on the published list.<br/>Ms Dorries - who served as culture secretary under Mr Johnson - stood down as an MP \"with immediate effect\" just over an hour before the honours list was released.<br/>The resignation honours list is a tradition that gives outgoing prime ministers the opportunity to nominate people for honours. <br/>The long-awaited list, approved nine months after Mr Johnson resigned as prime minister, included 38 honours and seven peerages. <br/>Kulveer Singh Ranger, a former director of transport while Mr Johnson was London mayor, and former Downing Street chief of staff Dan Rosenfield are also among those who will enter the Lords.<br/>Charlotte Owen, a former adviser to Mr Johnson, will become one of the youngest peers, as will fellow advisers Ben Gascoigne and Ross Kempsell.<br/>Honours were handed out to some of Mr Johnson's closest advisers during his premiership, including former directors of communications Jack Doyle and Guto Harri, who were both made CBEs.<br/>Also among recipients were aides who served with Mr Johnson during the scandal over lockdown parties in Downing Street during the Covid-19 pandemic.<br/>Martin Reynolds, Mr Johnson's former principal private secretary, was awarded the Order of Bath.<br/>In May 2020, Mr Reynolds sent an invite to a \"bring your own booze\" party to Downing Street staff when the nation was under lockdown.<br/>Ben Elliot, the former co-chair of the Conservative Party, has also been awarded a knighthood, as have Tory MPs Michael Fabricant and Conor Burns, two Mr Johnson loyalists.<br/>The first name on the list was Tory MP and long-standing Brexit backer Bill Cash, who has become a companion of honour. <br/>Membership is a special award granted to those \"who have made a major contribution to the arts, science, medicine, or government\" and it is only held by up to 65 people at any one time.<br/>Rishi Sunak has approved Mr Johnson's resignation honours list and \"forwarded it unamended\" to King Charles, the prime minister's press secretary said.<br/>\"He had no involvement or input into the approved list,\" the press secretary said.<br/>By convention, a former prime minister's resignation list of new peers is forwarded to the House of Lords Appointments Commission (HOLAC), which vets appointments.<br/>Another Tory MP who did not feature on the list, despite being widely tipped for a peerage, was Alok Sharma, who was president of the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow. <br/>Usually when sitting MPs are given peerages, they resign their seats, triggering by-elections.<br/>Following the Partygate scandal and the political turbulence of Mr Johnson's premiership, the former PM's honours list was always expected to be controversial and to provoke fierce criticism.<br/>Some of the reaction to the names published on Friday has met those expectations.<br/>A formerly loyal aide to Mr Johnson branded the honours list \"an utter disgrace\", telling the BBC it was \"rewards for failure all round\".<br/>They said: \"Boris has slammed the door shut on the prospect of any return to the frontline of British politics and trashed what remained of his legacy.\"<br/>Labour's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, said it was \"shameful\" that Mr Sunak had \"failed to stand up to his former boss's outrageous demands and agreed to hand out prizes to this carousel of cronies\". <br/>\"He promised integrity, but this weak prime minister is once again showing his appalling judgement by doing Boris Johnson's bidding,\" Ms Rayner said.<br/>And Liberal Democrat Deputy Leader Daisy Cooper said: \"Boris Johnson has been allowed to hand out gongs to his Partygate pals, and Rishi Sunak has just waved it through.\"<br/>The seven new peers on Mr Johnson's honours list will enter a House of Lords that already has more than 800 members.<br/>The Electoral Reform Society campaign group said Mr Johnson's resignation list \"demonstrates just how discredited and partisan the honours system has become\".<br/>\"It's time to end this rotten system of patronage and replace the unelected Lords with a smaller elected chamber, where the people of this country - not former prime ministers - choose who shape the laws we all live under,\" its chief executive Darren Hughes said.<br/>Boris Johnson is loyal to those who are loyal to him. And his resignation honours list underlines this - until the ink runs out.<br/>Almost all of the 45 names know him personally. Many worked for him either at No 10 or when he was London mayor.<br/>Even his current spokesman has been transformed into a legislator, with a seat in the House of Lords.<br/>And for anyone who assumed that meritocracy might play a part in the honours system, a long-standing parliamentary hairdresser, Kelly Dodge, gets a gong for doing... Mr Johnson's hair.<br/>Yes, you read that correctly. Mr Johnson's mop.<br/>But just as Mr Johnson rewards loyalty, he has more subtly made clear disloyalty comes at a price.<br/>He must know that a list strewn with reminders of the Partygate era will make the current PM uncomfortable.<br/>The list is crammed with dames and knighthoods for some of Mr Johnson's defenders in the parliamentary party.<br/>But there are plenty of Conservative detractors, those who describe the list as \"ghastly\" or full of \"sycophants\".<br/>For them, the list has damaged their party specifically and trust in politics more generally.<br/>But it also allows the opposition to portray Rishi Sunak as weak for not blocking the list.<br/>Convention suggests prime ministers don't veto their predecessors' honours.<br/>But Mr Johnson was a very unconventional occupant of No 10.<br/>Ex-minister Nadine Dorries stands down as Tory MP<br/>Boris Johnson has Partygate inquiry findings<br/>The inside story of Boris Johnson's downfall<br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

But we've got to do that in a responsible way.\"<br/>However, pressed on how much investment there would be in the first year of a Labour government, Ms Reeves would not commit to a figure, arguing the economic backdrop would not be clear until closer to the time.<br/>Announcing the party's Green Prosperity Plan in 2021, Ms Reeves said the \u00a328bn would come from borrowing and would be spent on projects like offshore wind farms and developing batteries for electric vehicles. <br/>Since then the economic picture has changed considerably, with interest rates and borrowing costs soaring. <br/>Labour wants to be seen as economically credible and privately there had been concerns raised about whether the \u00a328bn of investment was affordable in the current context. <br/>There have also been complaints about how the policy has landed, with some worried the \u00a328bn figure was better known than what the money would be spent on. <br/>The Conservatives have also used the alleged dangers of the policy - that extra borrowing could increase interest rates and mortgage costs - as an attack line. <br/>However, the change in tack could make it more difficult to deliver Labour's aim of generating all electricity without using fossil fuels by 2030. <br/>Conservative Party chairman Greg Hands said Labour's main economic policy was \"in tatters\" after they realised \"it would lead to disaster\". <br/>\"It doesn't matter if they try and pretend otherwise, Labour's plan remains to stick \u00a328bn of borrowing on the government credit card which will lead to higher inflation and higher interest rates,\" he said.<br/>The SNP's Westminster leader Stephen Flynn said the move was \"the latest in a long line of broken promises\" from Labour, which \"could have very real and damaging consequences for Scotland's green energy potential\". <br/>Green Party co-leader Adrian Ramsay said Labour had offered a policy which \"does not go far enough\" and then \"row[ing] back at the first sign of any difficulty\". <br/>Ms Reeves was also critical of the deal Prime Minister Rishi Sunak secured with the US on his visit to Washington this week. <br/>Plans for a full free trade agreement have been abandoned but the new proposals include allowing UK electric car firms access to US green tax credits and subsidies. <br/>Ms Reeves, who visited the US herself last month, said she was \"staggered\" that Mr Sunak had returned with \"no industrial plan for Britain\". <br/>She has said Labour is taking inspiration from US President Joe Biden's plan to tackle inflation and create jobs, which includes a huge package of subsidies and tax breaks for green industries. <br/>But she said her \"secureonomics\" strategy would be \"built on the rock of financial stability and economic security\", with strict limits on borrowing.<br/>Labour has also promised to create a publicly owned renewable energy company to create jobs and improve the country's energy security. <br/>Last week the party pledged to ban new licences for oil and gas production in the UK, despite concerns from unions this could cost jobs.<br/>Starmer vows to prevent oil communities withering<br/>Labour unveils Biden-inspired economic strategy<br/>Labour plans publicly owned renewable energy giant<br/>Labour pledges \u00a328bn a year to make economy greener<br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

On the plane ride over to Washington Mr Sunak said: \"For a while now, that has not been a priority for either the US or UK.\"<br/>However, Labour's shadow foreign secretary David Lammy criticised Mr Sunak, saying the government has left \"Britain's cupboards bare\" by not securing a trade deal. <br/>\"This statement shows the government has failed to deliver the comprehensive trade deal they promised in the 2019 manifesto, or to secure the ally status under the Inflation Reduction Act that is so important for the automotive sector and for the green transition,\" Mr Lammy said. <br/>Mr Biden said the special relationship with the UK was in \"real good shape\", referring to their co-operation on Ukraine.<br/>\"Together we are providing economic and humanitarian aid and security systems to Ukraine in their fight against a brutal invasion from Russia,\" he said.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Joe Biden calls Rishi Sunak \"president\" by mistake<br/>The Atlantic Declaration includes plans to mitigate some of the impact of the US flagship Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)  on the UK economy, with proposals to remove barriers which affected trade in electric vehicle batteries.<br/>Under current policy, the IRA provides tax credit worth $3,750 (\u00a33,000) for each electric vehicle (EV) manufactured in the US, or which use components mined, processed or manufactured in the country. <br/>The UK is already a net exporter of raw materials for EV batteries to the US.

If not, the tax will  remain in place until March 2028.<br/>The level has been set at $71.40 per barrel for oil and \u00a30.54 per therm for gas. <br/>Brent crude oil was trading at $75 per barrel on Friday morning, with gas prices at around \u00a30.62.<br/>Energy firms have been urging ministers to reduce the windfall tax, warning that it was causing companies to pull back investment.<br/>In April, the UK's largest oil and gas producer Harbour said it would shed 350 UK onshore jobs as a result of the windfall tax. French oil giant TotalEnergies also said it would cut its planned 2023 North Sea investment by a quarter - \u00a3100m - because of the extension to the windfall tax.<br/>The Treasury said its decision had reflected those concerns.<br/>It said any fall in investment \"puts the long-term future of the UK's domestic supply at risk, meaning we would be forced to import more from abroad at a time when reliable and affordable energy is a focus for families and businesses\".<br/>A Labour spokesperson said: \"We need a proper windfall tax on the enormous profits of oil and gas giants to help with ease the cost of living crisis.   \"We will look at the detail of this change. Of course if the windfalls of war disappear then we'll look at what the right long-term tax position should be for the North Sea.\"<br/>Prime Minister Rishi Sunak introduced the Energy Profits Levy in May last year when he was chancellor, with the rate set at 25%.<br/>In the autumn, current Chancellor Jeremy Hunt announced it would increase to 35% from January 2023.<br/>The levy applies to profits made from extracting UK oil and gas, but not from other activities - such as refining oil and selling petrol and diesel on forecourts.<br/>Oil and gas firms operating in the North Sea already pay 30% corporation tax on their profits and a supplementary 10% rate on top of that.<br/>So with the windfall tax, that takes the overall tax rate faced by oil and gas companies to 75%.<br/>If it is eliminated, the overall tax rate on energy firms would return to 40%.<br/>Trade body Offshore Energies UK welcomed the announcement, but warned the industry still faced challenges.<br/>Its chief executive David Whitehouse said: \"This is a step in the right direction, but many more will need to be taken to restore confidence to our sector.<br/>\"We will now work closely with government and lenders to understand the detail of the measure and its effectiveness at unlocking investment.\"<br/>Oil and gas giant Shell also welcomed the announcement. A spokesperson said it \"should help to improve investor confidence in the UK North Sea, which will remain crucial to maintaining Britain's energy security in the coming years\".<br/>However, the change to the windfall tax was criticised by the Green Party.<br/>\"The government seems happy to allow these huge corporations to not only wreck the climate but to profit off the back of the cost-of-living crisis which they themselves have contributed to,\" said Green co-leader Adrian Ramsay.<br/>\"Instead, the government should be tightening the tax, closing the loopholes and ensuring the money raised helps people through the cost-of-living crisis and funds the sustainable green energy jobs in the renewable sector we urgently need.\"<br/>Greenpeace UK's climate campaigner, Georgia Whitaker, said: \"Irrespective of what happens to the price of oil and gas, the tax these companies pay should be higher, permanently.<br/>\"This cash should be used to help insulate homes and transition the UK to cheap, clean energy, not fill the bank balances of already wealthy shareholders.\"<br/>How much windfall tax are oil giants paying?<br/>What is the energy cap and what's happening to bills?<br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

an increase of about two thirds on the same period last year.<br/>The Conservatives have reclaimed the top spot for donations, overtaking Labour, which raised the most money in the final quarter of 2022.<br/>The party has reversed a dip in donations since Rishi Sunak became Tory leader and prime minister in October last year.<br/>A Tory source said last year was \"very difficult for donations\" in the wake of Boris Johnson's premiership, but insisted the latest Electoral Commission figures showed \"a big recovery\".<br/>The source said the increase in donations was important \"because we're hiring lots of campaign managers to target the marginal seats\" ahead of the next general election.<br/>A large chunk of the \u00a312.1m in donations the party raised between January to March this year came from Mr Mansour, who was appointed Tory treasurer by Mr Sunak last year.<br/>Writing in the Telegraph newspaper, Mr Mansour said he felt reassured by Mr Sunak's leadership and revealed he had donated \u00a35m to the party's \"election fighting fund\".<br/>The Egyptian-born business tycoon, who has British citizenship, said the country had \"a very capable prime minister\" who \"understands how growth is generated in the modern economy\".<br/>\"I look at what he has achieved in his first months in office and think what he could do in five years,\" Mr Mansour wrote.<br/>Mr Mansour himself was once a politician in Egypt, where he served as a transport minister from 2006 to 2009 under Hosni Mubarak, the late Egyptian president who stood down in 2011 during the Arab Spring.<br/>Outside politics, Mr Mansour is a prominent businessman, with a fortune Forbes estimates to be $3.6bn.<br/>He is the chairman of the Mansour Group, which employs 60,000 people, and founded the London-based investment firm Man Capital.<br/>A Tory source said Mr Mansour's function as a treasurer was to \"open up networks\" and introduce the party to new contacts in the business world.<br/>Mr Mansour's \u00a35m gift was second only to Lord Sainsbury's in 2019, when he gave the Liberal Democrats \u00a38m - the biggest individual donation ever.<br/>The Conservatives received two more big donations, both valued at \u00a32m - one from Amit Lohia, a wealthy Indian industrialist, and Graham Edwards, another Conservative Party treasurer.<br/>The largest individual donations to Labour totalled \u00a3500,000 from Gary Lubner, the former chief executive of the company that owns Autoglass.<br/>Mr Lubner is expected to donate \u00a35m to the party before the next election and told the Financial Times he wanted to give Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer financial help to put the party in power \"for a long time\".<br/>Labour also received \u00a32.3m from its trade union backers, including \u00a31.1m from Unite and \u00a3359,168 from Unison.<br/>The Liberal Democrats' largest donation was \u00a3200,000, from a company called Peak Scientific Instruments, a nitrogen generator manufacturer.<br/>Tim Bale, a professor of politics and author of The Conservative Party after Brexit, said the money raised by parties ahead of general elections was important because \"it can actually make a difference to what a party can do in the campaign itself\".<br/>He said it is difficult to tell if the latest donations \"represent a vote of confidence in the current [Conservative] leadership or instead smack of panic and desperation\".<br/>The professor said there may be a \"growing fear\" of a Labour government among those who \"worry they'll lose out if that happens\".<br/>Professor Bale said, as far as some donors are concerned, the Conservative Party \"ultimately exists as an insurance policy against a social democratic government they believe will take the country in the wrong direction and, in so doing, damage their wealth\".<br/>Louise Edwards, of the Electoral Commission, said publishing the figures was vital to ensure transparency but called on the government to do more to raise confidence in the system.<br/>She said: \"We know transparency of party and campaigner finance is important for people, but our research tells us that only 24% of people believe party funding is transparent.<br/>\"It's clear that publishing this information is not enough.

The recent clampdown on protest, the new section 12 which the police used today to finally end the march\u2026 all of these are undemocratic.<br/>\"To go even further and say a walking protest is illegal - I think that's incredible. I think you have to ask yourself, where do we live right now, are we living in Russia or are we living in Britain?\"<br/>The Labour party has pledged to block all new domestic oil and gas developments and has promised to invest in renewables if it wins power. <br/>After unions raised concerns over potential job losses, Sir Keir said that existing North Sea projects would be able to continue until 2050, meaning \"oil and gas will be part our energy mix for years to come\". <br/>Mr Sunak accused the Labour party of \"putting ideology ahead of jobs, ahead of investment, and ahead of our energy security\". <br/>Mr Vince said he wouldn't stop funding Labour if Keir Starmer were to backtrack on his commitment over North Sea Oil. <br/>Asked if he had become more of a problem than an asset to Labour, Mr Vince said: \"I hope what I'm doing here [is] speaking out for Just Stop Oil and the millions of people that share their frustration...I hope that's not harming Labour, it's so vital Labour win the next election.\"<br/>A spokeswoman for the Labour leader's office said: \"Keir has been outspoken in his condemnation of Just Stop Oil who he believes have put lives and livelihoods at risk.<br/>\"The idea that they have influenced our policy is for the birds.\"<br/>Eco-zealots writing Labour energy policy - Sunak<br/>Labour defends donations from Just Stop Oil backer<br/>Starmer ambition to get off fossil fuels by 2030<br/>Oil and gas ban would be mistake, union boss says<br/>High UK energy bills blamed on decades of mistakes<br/>Starmer vows to prevent oil communities withering<br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

It is an absolute disgrace.\"<br/>On Thursday, responding to complaints from peers, the Conservative chief whip, Baroness Williams of Trafford, said that the House \"detained itself\" by repeating arguments during the debate, making it go on longer.<br/>The longest single sitting of the Lords was set back in 2005, when peers sat from 11am on March 10 to 7:31pm the following day, more than 32 hours, as they considered amendments to the Prevention of Terrorism Bill. <br/>Follow proceedings in the House of Lords with BBC Parliament coverage here and here.<br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

the nature and climate emergencies\".<br/>She thanked her supporters, who she said had \"put the politics of hope above the politics of fear\".<br/>She was elected for Brighton Pavilion in 2010, becoming the first Green MP.<br/>Ms Lucas, who had two stints as Green leader, has increased her majority at every election since, winning by a margin of almost 20,000 votes in 2019.<br/>The MP's decision comes a month after her party lost control of Brighton and Hove council, despite making record gains in May's local elections in England.<br/>In an open letter, Ms Lucas said it had been the \"privilege of my life to serve this extraordinary constituency and community\".<br/>She said: \"I have always been a different kind of politician - as those who witnessed my arrest, court case and acquittal over peaceful protest at the fracking site in Balcombe nearly 10 years ago will recall.<br/>\"And the truth is, as these threats to our precious planet become ever more urgent, I have struggled to spend the time I want on these accelerating crises.<br/>\"I have therefore decided not to stand again as your MP at the next election.\"<br/>The Green Party's co-leader, Carla Denyer described Ms Lucas as a \"force of nature\" and said the party was \"so proud of her achievements\".<br/>Ms Denyer - her party's candidate for the Bristol West constituency - said Ms Lucas's record \"demonstrates how essential it is to have Green voices in UK politics\".<br/>The party's joint leader, Adrian Ramsay, said the Greens would be \"striving to get more Green MPs elected at the next general election so that we can build on Caroline's achievements\".<br/>The party won its highest ever vote share of 3.8% in 2015's general election but Ms Lucas was the only Green candidate to win a seat.<br/>Although Ms Lucas remains the only Green MP, the party has enjoyed success in recent local elections.<br/>In England's local elections in May, the Green Party won more than 240 seats and made history in Mid-Suffolk, taking control of the council for the first time.<br/>The Greens have traditionally performed best in urban areas, such as Brighton and Bristol, but the party concentrated its campaigning firepower on rural, traditional Tory areas.<br/>Labour is now expected to focus efforts on trying to win the seat after taking control of Brighton and Hove Council from the Greens in May. <br/>Labour sources point to the Greens facing anger locally over their management of the council and to their gains at the expense of the Greens in wards that map onto the parliamentary constituency.<br/>One local party source said: \"In May's local elections residents in Brighton delivered a damning and decisive verdict on the Green Party - with Labour winning nearly twice as many councillors as the Greens in Caroline Lucas' seat.<br/>\"Labour will continue to make the case to voters in Brighton Pavilion that we are the only party with the answers to the serious challenges facing the country.\"<br/>Ms Lucas's first period as Green leader was between 2008 and 2012, before her second as co-leader with Jonathan Bartley for two years from September 2016.<br/>The Brighton Pavilion MP said she came into politics \"to change things\".<br/>She said she had put a universal basic income on the political agenda, secured the first parliamentary debate in a generation on drug law reform, and been involved in the addition of a natural history GCSE to the syllabus.<br/>She told the BBC she was \"definitely not quitting\" politics, or \"retiring with my knitting\".<br/>\"I think right now, the Greens are at such as exciting stage,\" she said. \"Working to get more Greens elected is my priority.\"<br/>Ms Lucas is the latest senior MP to announce her departure from Parliament at the next election, which is expected to be held in 2024.<br/>Dozens of MPs have stated their intention leave the Commons, including former health secretary Matt Hancock, the former deputy prime minister, Dominic Raab, and former SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford.<br/>Best ever local election results for Greens<br/>How UK Greens are learning from overseas allies<br/>Too late to save planet, says Green Party founder<br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves -

<br/>The government will be keen to pass any legislation before Westminster breaks for the summer recess on 20 July.<br/>But don't expect a quick decision from the DUP. <br/>The party may want assurances around a financial package to help plug Stormont's \u00a31.1bn black hole. <br/>They may also decide to reserve judgement until the new arrangements agreed in Windsor Framework are put into operation in October. <br/>Ulster Unionist Party leader Doug Beattie said the pace towards the return of a Stormont executive is being \"ramped up\". <br/>He said the all-party talks with the head of the civil service were positive. <br/>Mr Beattie said those around the table talked about \"when\" the Executive is restored.<br/>He said talks focused on the financial ask of the treasury to plug the \u00a31.1bn black hole in Stormont's finances.<br/>Alliance MP Stephen Farry said that the talks and the progress being made should not be seen as a barrier to getting the Executive back up and running again. <br/>But he added the talks on Thursday were a positive sign and that \"serious work\" was being done to put together a plan from the parties for the UK government on moving forward. <br/>Mr Farry said: \"There is some degree of momentum building in this process but it's still early days.\" <br/>Sir Jeffrey also criticised Sinn F\u00e9in MP John Finucane over his planned attendance at an IRA commemoration at the weekend in Armagh. <br/>He said his \"attendance was wrong on so many levels\". <br/>He added they were \"building a fun day around celebrating volunteers who were one of the most feared killing machines in Northern Ireland during the troubles\"<br/>He urged Sinn F\u00e9in to think again about its involvement this weekend and to think of the impact on the victims families who still carry the hurt and pain.<br/>Sinn F\u00e9in has previously said that \"everyone has the right to remember their dead\".<br/>Stormont parties called to talks over power sharing<br/>A simple guide to the Northern Ireland Brexit deal<br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

But, there would be greater public oversight and higher standards. <br/>The report recognises that providers would need to be better funded - arguing that more than \u00a37bn has been spent by councils on care homes which are inadequate.<br/>While the case for more funding is set out, the report is rather shy when it comes to specific numbers.<br/>It says Labour should make a promise to increase real terms funding by a \"significant percentage each year\".<br/>\"Significant increases for adult social care are essential and inevitable,\" the report said.<br/>Insiders say that, with Labour under fire from opponents for specific spending commitments on green policies, there is a reluctance to set out specific sums in other areas well before an election.<br/>But critics are more concerned that the report has largely ducked the question of the lifetime cost of care for individuals.<br/>In a 2011 report, for the then Conservative-Lib Dem coalition, the economist Sir Andrew Dilnot recommended a cap on social care costs of between \u00a325,000-\u00a335,000.<br/>This was never implemented. But Boris Johnson's government did commit to capping lifetime care costs at \u00a386,000.<br/>However the current chancellor Jeremy Hunt delayed implementation until 2025 - pushing it until after the next general election. <br/>Labour have denounced this as \"another broken Tory promise\".<br/>But the Fabian Society report suggests a care cap should simply be \"considered\" as an option by Labour, with reform of means-testing as another possibility. <br/>It is perhaps unsurprising that some of those with knowledge of the care system are now accusing Labour of ducking the issue.<br/>Charles Tallack from the independent charity the Health Foundation said the report \"fudged crucial questions about social care costs\".<br/>\"Options for reform are well known - including building on a cap on care costs - but the missing ingredient is political will,\" he added.<br/>Streeting: I won't pretend NHS is envy of world<br/>Face-to-face GP appointments promised by Labour<br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Moscow has denied responsibility, instead blaming Ukrainian shelling.<br/>Mr Sunak also said the UK should \"have confidence\" in its ability to act as a global leader in regulating artificial intelligence (AI), a topic he is set to discuss with President Biden at a White House meeting on Thursday.<br/>The prime minister is hoping to put post-Brexit UK in the driving seat of efforts to set new global rules for the emerging technology.<br/>Some experts have questioned the extent to which the UK will be able to shape new global rules outside the European Union, with the UK now shut out of key gatherings between European and American regulators such as the Tech and Trade Council.<br/>But Mr Sunak said the level of AI investment in the UK, and the quality of British research, meant it could \"shape the conversation\" on future rules.<br/>\"Other than the US, there's no other democratic country that has that strength in AI,\" he argued.<br/>Chris Mason: What Sunak is trying to achieve in the US<br/>Johnson to bypass government on Covid WhatsApps<br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

The history and the hallowed halls of democracy, it was very inspiring.\" <br/>Mr Paisley described Simmons as \"a real knowledgeable guy\" about the history of Parliament.<br/>\"He's got a genuine interest both in the history and the theology behind all this stuff, and he's had a private tour and he's been able to visit Deputy Prime Minister's question time,\" the North Antrim MP told the PA news agency.<br/>\"It's great to have him here, an honour to have guests here and it's great when they're passionate and interested and they can tell the world about the importance of this building and democracy and what it means for people here.\"<br/>Mr Paisley joked his guest, whose Kiss hits include Rock and Roll All Nite and Crazy Crazy Nights, would be performing a private concert for a DUP fundraiser, before adding: \"That's a lie!\".<br/>In an interview from his hotel on Wednesday evening, Gene Simmons said he had previously visited the Irish Parliament and had wanted to meet the taoiseach (Irish prime minister), but \"didn't quite get there\".<br/>\"We did tour the facility,\" he said, \"We, I mean yours truly, a few years back. <br/>\"I think it's really important for people to actually see where the people's business is being done.\"<br/>A former sixth grade teacher in New York before Kiss was formed, Simmons said he remembered teaching his pupils about Parliament and Guy Fawkes. <br/>He told Good Morning Ulster he was impressed by the \"lesson in civility\" on show in Parliament between opposing politicians, comparing it favourably to US politics.<br/>\"It's important when the occasion calls, [to] visit Parliament. I'm sure you'll be able to get in there and see some of it.\"<br/>Wednesday's visit is the second time this year that a DUP MP has celebrated a famous singer at Parliament.<br/>In March, Strangford representative Jim Shannon submitted an early day motion to mark the 50th anniversary of Dolly Parton's song 'I will always love you'. <br/>He said he noted the sentiment behind the song \"and what it means to so many\", including Mr Shannon's wife.<br/>Simmons said what politicians do \"is far more important\" than music.<br/>\"We're a diversion,\" he said. \"Our job is to make you forget about your troubles, just for those few hours that you're with us.\"<br/>Asked if he could be tempted to enter politics, Simmons said he could joke \"they don't pay enough\".<br/>\"I can literally make more in one evening doing a concert than I can being a politician for the entire year, as shocking as that may sound,\" he continued.<br/>However, he added democracy is \"our only hope\". <br/>\"If I was called to serve, sure, I would do it, but I would not accept a salary, I would do it for one dollar, tax-free of course.\"<br/>You can listen to Good Morning Ulster's interview with Gene Simmons in full here.<br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

the MP for Kingston upon Hull East - has written back to Mr Tierney asking for specific examples. <br/>The Labour MP told the BBC he had looked into this and believed \"there is no example the government can rely on\".<br/>He said Cabinet Office officials \"either have to give me an example when a former minister or a serving minister has been provided with legal support for a parliamentary inquiry, or they have to accept that they've set a new precedent with Boris Johnson\".<br/>Mr Turner said the government had seemingly established a two-tier system whereby ministers and former ministers \"get the protection of the taxpayer to cover their legal fees\", and backbench MPs do not.<br/>The last former minister to be investigated by a parliamentary committee for misleading Parliament was former Labour MP and transport secretary Stephen Byers in 2005.<br/>The BBC has been told Mr Byers was not offered taxpayer-funded legal representation.<br/>Last month, the contract to hire Mr Johnson's legal team was extended for the third time and increased in value, from \u00a3222,000 to \u00a3245,000.<br/>The Treasury did not sign off the decision to use public money to pay the bill, but has insisted its approval was not required for all spending decisions.<br/>The National Audit Office (NAO), which scrutinises government spending, has been examining the decision to cover Mr Johnson's legal costs during the inquiry.<br/>Mr Johnson has faced calls to pay the legal costs himself, with opposition parties highlighting he has earned millions since standing down as prime minister.<br/>The former prime minister was joined by his lawyers when he appeared in front of the Privileges Committee in March.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Key moments from Boris Johnson's Partygate grilling<br/>He denied knowingly or deliberately misleading Parliament over Covid rule-breaking parties in Downing Street during the pandemic.<br/>Mr Johnson has submitted answers to the committee about a number of events at Chequers and Downing Street during the pandemic.<br/>Privileges Committee sources say they are hoping to wrap up the inquiry before Parliament's summer recess in July.<br/>If the committee finds Mr Johnson in contempt of Parliament, he faces suspension as an MP, which could trigger a by-election in his Uxbridge and South Ruislip constituency.<br/>Separate to the Privileges Committee inquiry, Mr Johnson is being provided with taxpayer-funded legal support for the public inquiry into the government's handling of the pandemic.<br/>Last month, Mr Johnson severed ties with the government-appointed lawyers who were set to represent him in the Covid inquiry.<br/>In a letter, reported by the Sunday Times, the Cabinet Office warned Mr Johnson that public funding for his legal representation could be withdrawn if he tried to \"undermine\" the government.<br/>A Cabinet Office spokesperson said the letter \"simply reiterates that taxpayer-funded lawyers must be used to aid the Covid Inquiry and for no other purpose\".<br/>\"This letter was intended to protect public funds.

He began a data protection action in 2021, then started a defamation claim.<br/>Ms Leslie, MP for Bristol North West from 2010-17, is the former managing director of the Conservative Middle East Council, which promotes links between MPs and the Middle East.<br/>Mr Justice Nicklin said there were \"several aspects of the conduct of the claimant\", Mr Amersi, which gave \"real cause for concern\" as to the purpose of his actions. <br/>He questioned whether Mr Amersi genuinely sought \"vindication\", which is the aim of such litigation. He also said Mr Amersi had adopted \"an exorbitant approach\" to the litigation, bringing an unnecessarily complex case.<br/>Ms Leslie said the judgment \"spoke for itself\" and she was \"delighted to have this vindication after two-and-a-half years of legal action against me\".<br/>Mr Amersi said he was \"bitterly disappointed\" and was considering an appeal. He added that he had been \"denied justice\". <br/>In a statement he said the judge's interpretation of the law \"provides effective immunity to those who publish serious falsehoods to small but influential groups of people\".<br/>David Davis MP told the House of Commons on Wednesday that the result was a \"victory for free speech\".

He had just been elected mayor of London, a job that would launch him on the path to Downing Street.<br/>Now he is heading for the exit with all guns blazing, with a scathing attack on the MPs who sought to punish him for misleading Parliament over Covid rule-breaking.<br/>His reaction to the Privileges Committee report is vintage Johnson - colourful, amusing in parts - the references to \"Mystic Meg\" and nudist colonies - but with an unfamiliar edge of bitterness and anger. <br/>Whether it turns out to be the final raging testament of a man destined for the political wilderness remains to be seen.<br/>He has bounced back from many, mainly self-inflicted, disasters before.<br/>And he is clearly in no mood to settle for comfortable semi-retirement. <br/>He has already earned more than \u00a35m for giving speeches around the world since he quit as prime minister.<br/>He is also about to become a father again, at 58, with wife Carrie expecting their third child. The family have just moved into a \u00a33.8m Grade II listed manor house in Oxfordshire, complete with its own moat.<br/>There are books to write - his memoir of his time in Downing Street is well under way apparently, and talk of business opportunities.<br/>But this may be thin gruel for someone with Boris Johnson's outsize personality.<br/>From his earliest childhood days, when he famously declared he wanted to be \"world king\", Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson has had his eyes on life's big prizes.<br/>He came into the world in 1964 in the Upper East Side of Manhattan, in New York, where his father, Stanley, was studying economics. <br/>One of four children, he spent his early years on the family farm in Somerset, before moving to north London and then Brussels, where Stanley was working for the European Commission.<br/>The Johnson siblings were close and highly competitive with one another. Young Boris, or Al, as he was known to the family, was largely brought up by his artist mother Charlotte, helped by au pairs.<br/>He won a scholarship to Eton College, England's most prestigious private school, where he made a lasting impression on his teachers and classmates.<br/>In a widely quoted excerpt from a school report, teacher Martin Hammond said of the 17-year-old Johnson: \"Boris sometimes seems affronted when criticised for what amounts to a gross failure of responsibility. <br/>\"I think he honestly believes it is churlish of us not to regard him as an exception, one who should be free of the network of obligation which binds everyone else.\"<br/>Simon Veksner, a school friend of Johnson, told author Simon Kuper in his recent book Chums: \"Boris's charisma even then was off the charts, so funny, warm, charming, self-deprecating,\" <br/>At Oxford University, he was elected president of the union - a debating society dating back to 1823. He also joined the infamously rowdy and exclusive Bullingdon Club, alongside future prime minister David Cameron.<br/>After Oxford, he was taken on as a trainee reporter at the Times newspaper, but was sacked after falsifying a quote. <br/>It proved to be a minor setback however, and in 1988 he was given a job on the Daily Telegraph by then-editor Max Hastings.<br/>As the Telegraph's Brussels correspondent, Johnson specialized in ridiculing regulations passed by the European Commission - although many of his fellow reporters in Brussels felt his stories were exaggerated and in some cases simply untrue. <br/>In 1999, he became editor of influential right-wing magazine the Spectator, and two years later finally achieved his ambition to enter Parliament, as the Tory MP for Henley, in Oxfordshire.<br/>Things did not go smoothly.<br/>He insisted on continuing to edit the Spectator, even when he was promoted to the Tory frontbench by then leader Michael Howard.<br/>He came unstuck in 2004 when the magazine published an article blaming the Hillsborough disaster on the behaviour of Liverpool football fans. <br/>An incensed Howard ordered Johnson to Liverpool to apologise to the entire city.<br/>He survived \"Operation Scouse Grovel\", as he dubbed it, only to be sacked by Howard a month later for lying about claims he had had an affair with journalist Petronella Wyatt.<br/>Johnson's colourful private life has long been a source of fascination for fellow journalists - in particular, the question of how many children he has fathered.<br/>He has declined to confirm a number when asked, but it is thought be seven, with another on the way.<br/>He has four children from his second marriage, to barrister Marina Wheeler, which ended in divorce, and another from an affair with art consultant Helen Macintyre.<br/>In May 2020, Johnson married Carrie Symonds, a former Tory aide, at a private ceremony at Westminster Cathedral. The couple had their first son together, Wilfred, in April 2020. Their second child, daughter Romy, was born in December 2021.<br/>It was Johnson's two terms as London mayor - starting in 2008 - that transformed his political career. <br/>Up until then, he had been stuck in the slow lane, better known as a TV celebrity and comedy turn than a serious politician.<br/>His ability to harvest votes from Labour supporters - and project an upbeat, positive vision of Conservativism - made him a powerful electoral asset for his party.<br/>His popularity reached its peak during the 2012 London Olympics, despite, or perhaps because of, being pictured dangling from a zip wire gamely waving a pair of union flags. <br/>In 2015, he returned to Parliament as MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip, with his sights set on the top job, and a major dilemma. David Cameron's decision to hold an EU referendum was a defining moment for the country, but also for the old friends and rivals.<br/>Johnson's decision - after much agonising - to join forces with the pro-Brexit campaign came as a severe blow to Cameron's hopes of keeping the UK in the EU. But it was seen as a game-changing moment by the pro-Brexit campaign, run by tough-talking strategist Dominic Cummings, a man Cameron had once dismissed as a \"career psychopath\".<br/>When his side emerged victorious, Johnson threw his hat into the ring to replace Cameron as Conservative leader and prime minister. <br/>However, his campaign was dramatically undermined when colleague and close friend Michael Gove withdrew support and decided to run for the leadership himself, saying he did not think Johnson was up to the job of prime minister. <br/>Not for the first time, he was contemplating the end of his political career. Yet in a surprise move Theresa May, the eventual winner, appointed Johnson as foreign secretary.<br/>He quit May's cabinet in 2018, in protest at her Brexit deal, which he claimed would lead Britain into \"the status of a colony\". <br/>When she was forced to resign as Tory leader the following year, he finally got his hands on the top job.<br/>He was immediately plunged into turmoil, as he battled to govern with the non-existent majority inherited from May.<br/>In an audacious and highly controversial move, later ruled unlawful by the Supreme Court, he attempted to prorogue, or suspend, Parliament, after his attempts to push through a Brexit deal faltered ahead of his own deadline of 31 October 2019.<br/>After two failed attempts to get MPs to vote for a general election, he finally went to the country in December 2019, promising to \"Get Brexit Done\", a slogan dreamed up by Dominic Cummings, who was now his closest aide.<br/>The gamble paid off, and he was returned to power with the biggest Conservative majority since Margaret Thatcher's 1980s heyday. Crucially, he had won seats in former Labour strongholds across the North of England, what came to be known as the Red Wall.<br/>His Brexit deal was approved and on 31 January 2020 the UK left the EU. <br/>It looked as though negotiating a trade deal with the EU would be his government's first key task - and Brexit his abiding legacy. But, within weeks, he was engulfed by an all-consuming crisis that few - least of all Mr Johnson - had seen coming: the coronavirus pandemic.<br/>In April 2020, he tested positive for Covid himself and spent three nights in intensive care. Downing Street played down the seriousness of his condition but when he was discharged, the PM admitted \"it could have gone either way\".<br/>As the UK emerged from the pandemic, Mr Johnson's government was under fire from all sides for its handling of the pandemic.<br/>He hailed the success of the UK's vaccine roll-out, which was the fastest in the developed world.<br/>But his political problems were mounting up.<br/>In November 2020, he lost Dominic Cummings and other senior aides after a bout of bitter infighting in Downing Street.<br/>Worse was to come in November 2021, when the Daily Mirror accused Johnson of breaking Covid rules by attending parties in Downing Street when indoor mixing was banned. There was a further bombshell just over a week later when video footage emerged of Downing Street staff laughing and joking about holding a Christmas party. <br/>Then the Daily Telegraph revealed that Downing Street staff had held booze-fuelled parties the night before the Duke of Edinburgh's funeral. Johnson later apologised to the Queen.<br/>Johnson, his then-Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Carrie Johnson were among those fined by police, while a damning report by senior civil servant Sue Gray laid bare a Downing Street culture of drunkenness and contempt for the rules.<br/>Johnson did his best to sound contrite in public, telling MPs he had learned lessons and had launched a shake-up of backroom staff, but he continued to insist that he had not broken Covid rules on purpose.<br/>The cabinet rallied round the prime minister, but a steadily growing band of backbench Conservatives, from different wings of the party, had come to the conclusion that he had to go, amid rising public anger. <br/>He survived a confidence motion in June 2022, despite nearly half of his MPs voting against him. But a string of by-election defeats led MPs to fear he had become an electoral liability. The old magic, it seemed, was no longer working.<br/>The final straw for many MPs was when ministers were sent out to defend the prime minister in a row over an MP facing allegations of sexual misconduct, armed with misleading information from Downing Street.<br/>A mass walkout by ministers, including Chancellor Rishi Sunak, followed and after 48 hours of defiance, in which he repeatedly vowed to \"get on with the job\" of governing, he was finally forced to face up to reality.<br/>He did not go quietly. And within a few short months he would get an unexpected chance to make another comeback, following the spectacular implosion of Liz Truss's premiership.<br/>He flew back from a Caribbean holiday in October 2022 to launch a bid to replace Truss, who had won the contest to replace him. <br/>But despite managing to scrape together just enough nominations from Tory MPs to get on the ballot, Johnson pulled out of the contest, paving the way for the coronation of Rishi Sunak, who had far more support in the Parliamentary party.<br/>He insisted he would remain an MP, fuelling rumours that another comeback might be on the cards.<br/>But questions about his conduct during the Covid pandemic refused to go away, with the committee of MPs investigating whether he had lied to Parliament eventually delivering their damning verdict.<br/>Only a fool would write Boris Johnson off entirely - and he retains a band of loyal supporters, who point to his leadership over the war in Ukraine and his espousal of traditional Tory free market values as reasons for his return - not to mention his formidable campaigning skills.<br/>But the road back looks like a long and steep one.<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

This does not apply for \"personal\" actions against them, for example if they are sued for libel.<br/>As a former minister, he would normally be expected to receive taxpayer-funded legal help for his evidence to the ongoing Covid inquiry.<br/>Documents submitted to the inquiry show that he was receiving support from the government's in-house legal department, but he cut ties with them in May after being referred to police for potential rule breaches during the pandemic.<br/>Shortly afterwards, he said he was \"instructing new solicitors\" but this was dependent on funding being agreed with the Cabinet Office.<br/>The department, however, has since said he won't get funding if he tries to \"undermine\" the government's position in relation to the inquiry, amid a row over the submission of his unredacted WhatsApps.<br/>All former prime ministers since John Major have been entitled to a yearly \u00a3115,000 allowance to support their \"special position in public life\".<br/>They can claim from it to fund things like running an office, paying for staff, and travel to events where they are appearing as an ex-PM. The money can't be used to support private or parliamentary duties.<br/>It is not yet known whether Mr Johnson has claimed it since leaving No 10, as the most recent annual figures are yet to be published.<br/>Former premiers have not always claimed the full amount. It is not paid automatically, and they have to provide receipts.<br/>In addition, they can claim up to 10% of the yearly allowance to put towards the pensions of their staff.<br/>Ex-MPs are entitled to a parliamentary pass, the so-called former member's pass, which was known as an \"X\" pass.<br/>It gives access to certain parts of Parliament and some of the catering facilities.<br/>Former MPs are not allowed to use the pass to help with \"lobbying\" - or trying to influence - government ministers.<br/>But the committee has recommended that Mr Johnson shouldn't be given one.

This was when he said he had corrected the record (referring to his statement of 8 December 2021).<br/>\"When I said - I came to this house and said in all sincerity that the rules and guidance had been followed at all times - it was what I believed to be true. It was certainly the case when I was present at gatherings to wish staff farewell\", he said. <br/>Committee chair Harriet Harman asked him if he still believed that to be the case in March 2023 and he replied: \"My view remains that the guidance allowed social distancing not to be carried out with rigid, drill sergeant precision.\"<br/>We know that at least two of the events that he attended (13 November and 14 January) led to police fines but we can't tell whether the rule breaches happened when he was there.<br/>When it comes to the guidance, the photos of the Lee Cain event apparently show people closer than 1m together, and thus not following the guidance, while Mr Johnson was in the room and looking on. <br/>The initial report from the Privileges Committee said it had received evidence that Mr Johnson had said at the 27 November 2020 event that it was \"probably the most unsocially distanced gathering in the UK right now\".<br/>Mr Johnson said he did not remember saying that, but pointed out that the official who had provided that quote went on to say of the former prime minister: \"he had a glass of water in his hand, made a short speech and then went up to his flat. He was the most sensible person there to be honest.\"<br/>What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

These include immunity from legal prosecution for anything said in Parliament, to allow MPs to speak freely.<br/>The committee was established in its current form in 2013 in the House of Commons. Similar work was previously done by a larger committee called the Standards and Privileges Committee. <br/>Ahead of the release of its report, Boris Johnson accused members of the committee of having a bias against him. He said: \"Their purpose from the beginning has been to find me guilty, regardless of the facts.\"<br/>However, four of the seven members of the committee are Conservative MPs (Sir Bernard Jenkin, Sir Charles Walker, Andy Carter and Alberto Costa).<br/>Two members are Labour MPs (Harriet Harman and Yvonne Fovargue) and one represents the SNP (Allan Dorans).<br/>The rules state the chair has to be a member of the official opposition - ie from the Labour party. Harriet Harman was unanimously elected to the post in June 2022.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: What is the hearing all about? Harriet Harman explains<br/>The committee has said that if Mr Johnson had not already resigned as an MP, it would have recommended a 90-day suspension, which is an unusually long period.<br/>A suspension of more than two weeks can trigger something called a recall petition, which in turn could lead to a by-election.<br/>Two MPs on the committee - the SNP's Allan Dorans and Labour's Yvonne Fovargue - wanted Mr Johnson expelled from the House of Commons - a far more serious sanction.<br/>In addition to the suspension, the committee also recommended that he should not be given a parliamentary pass, as is common for former MPs.<br/>Commons leader Penny Mordaunt has confirmed that MPs will be able to debate \"an amendable motion\" related to the report in Parliament on Monday. <br/>The debate will be followed by a free vote, which means political parties will not tell MPs what to do. <br/>Boris Johnson was widely criticised for describing the committee as \"a kangaroo court\" in his resignation statement.<br/>The phrase generally refers to a group acting without legal authority which hastily reaches a verdict without considering evidence.<br/>Mr Johnson's conduct was referred to the committee after a vote in the House of Commons in April 2022. It did not call for evidence until June 2022, once the police investigation into Partygate had finished.<br/>At his evidence hearing, Mr Johnson criticised committee chair Harriet Harman for having \"said some things about this matter before reading the evidence\". <br/>He was referring to comments she made on Twitter in April 2022, when she said that if Boris Johnson and then Chancellor Rishi Sunak accepted a fine for a lockdown breaking party, \"they are also admitting that they misled the House of Commons\".<br/>Ms Harman replaced the previous chair Sir Chris Bryant, who decided he should not lead the investigation because of his previous criticism of Mr Johnson's rule-breaking. <br/>No - it can also decide if non-MPs have been in contempt of Parliament.<br/>In 2019, the Privileges Committee examined the refusal of Boris Johnson's former adviser Dominic Cummings to give evidence to another parliamentary committee.<br/>It found that Mr Cummings was in contempt of Parliament and recommended that the House of Commons should pass a resolution criticising him. <br/>African leaders tour Kyiv after air raid alert<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Greece denies coastguard rope led to boat tragedy<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Like all prime ministerial trips abroad, it wasn't exactly typical.<br/>Here are four things that make travelling with the prime minister a unique experience.<br/>For years the debate raged. Was it legitimate for the prime minister to have a plane they could call their own?<br/>The issue made headlines during Tony Blair's premiership - when, inevitably, the prospect of such a thing was called Blair Force One. In 2006, a plan was announced. But in 2008, when Gordon Brown was prime minister, it was scrapped.<br/>Is a private jet ostentatious? Does it help with the practicalities of being a frequently flying leader? Does it project an image of the UK abroad that you wouldn't get turning up on a chartered plane? <br/>For now at least, the debate is over: the prime minister does have access to his own plane. And I type these words sitting on it, somewhere over the Atlantic.<br/>It is an Airbus A321, with a union flag on the tail fin, and \"United Kingdom\" written down the side. <br/>When you fly on this thing, it is rather different from rolling up at the airport to go on holiday. We leave from a private terminal, we often don't get a boarding pass and usually we take all of our baggage on with us - for a reason I'll get to shortly.<br/>But meanwhile\u2026<br/>You might imagine, in a private jet, the entertainment system would be something else. <br/>There is WiFi, so the prime minister and his team can stay connected and work efficiently, which is something they value. And it helps us reporters too.<br/>On the plane, there are none of those little screens you get in the back of the seat in front of you on some flights, packed with films and playlists and maps showing precisely where you are over the ocean. Instead, we often have what is called a \"huddle\".<br/>A huddle involves the prime minister coming to the back of the plane, where reporters crowd around him, and each ask him a question.<br/>This is how it works: all the reporters get together beforehand, in the airport, to work out what we are going to ask, in what order, to ensure we cover a range of topics. <br/>The conversation is \"on the record\" - to use the jargon - meaning we can quote the words and attribute them to the prime minister. But the huddle is not recorded for television or radio. <br/>A round of on-camera interviews with the prime minister tends to happen later in the trip. Each broadcaster is assigned a strictly agreed amount of time - often seven minutes - to attempt to find things out, hold the government to account and test its arguments. <br/>Interviewing any prime minister is a huge privilege and responsibility: working on your behalf, trying to ask the questions you want asking. I will always ask the brilliant producer I am working with to stand just out of shot counting down the minutes I have left on their fingers. <br/>Journalistically, there is a tension on these trips: we are close to the prime minister and his team throughout. This is useful, in understanding what they are doing and what motivates their decisions. But instinctively reporters want to be detached, independent and disinterested, and being in what can feel like a bubble feels odd in that context.<br/>Oh, and if we are going somewhere on a long-haul flight - for example Indonesia, Japan or the west coast of America, as we've have recently - we end up having to stop to refuel. <br/>And so those trips involved landing in Dubai, Muscat, Almaty and Washington, hanging around for an hour or so, and then taking off again. <br/>There aren't huge queues to check in. Or any queues at all. <br/>There are comfy settees to sit on, there is loads of natural light and a free coffee machine. To say it feels different from when you head off on a family holiday with the kids is to put it gently. Mind you, I don't take laptops, a tripod, and no end of other broadcasting kit with me on holiday either. <br/>Recently, we flew back into Luton Airport in the middle of the night and pulled up at a private terminal. Past the entrance to what was described as the \"VVIP lounge\" (I couldn't see in, I'm afraid) was a glass cabinet proffering stuff from Harrods, including a collection of pink teddies complete with \"recycled polyester filling\". <br/>A large rectangular steel clock hung on the wall. \"We commissioned this clock from Beaumont flying art,\" read the inscription. Also on the wall, a colossal screen, pitching the merits of executive private jets, the kind that only carry a handful of passengers. \"15 hours of peaceful luxury!\" is how they describe the flight on offer.<br/>When the prime minister's plane lands abroad, a diplomatic ritual begins. As the plane pulls up, a smiling delegation greets us. <br/>One of the first people off the plane is the camera journalist assigned to film the prime minister's arrival on behalf of all the broadcasters. There might be a red carpet. There are almost always flags.<br/>The UK ambassador to wherever we are will be there at the bottom of the plane steps. Maybe even some sort of performance will be offered by the hosts - at Bali's Ngurah Rai Airport last autumn, it was a troupe of traditional dancers.<br/>And while the prime minister is getting off via the front set of steps, the rest of us are piling off at the back and getting into a seemingly never-ending line of minibuses waiting on the tarmac.<br/>There's no time to wait for a bag in the hold. That's why we take them onto the plane with us.<br/>In next to no time, the motorcade is moving - and moving fast. Police outriders swarm all around us, and junctions are closed, so we can race through.<br/>On the motorway, the fast lane is (temporarily) closed so we can zip by. Passers by can be lining the streets, sometimes, to grab pictures. <br/>On a recent trip to Japan, the press minibus wasn't the nippiest, its engine squealing to keep up with the slick Mercedes of the prime minister a dozen or so vehicles ahead.<br/>What Sunak\u2019s Atlantic Declaration is \u2013 and isn\u2019t<br/>Sunak and Biden announce green funding agreement<br/>Sunak to raise trade issues in US talks with Biden<br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

They can also ask for more guidance from COPFS.<br/>If a suspect is charged with a crime, they generally cannot be questioned again by the police although they can make a statement. <br/>Ultimately, the detectives will send what is called a standard prosecution report to COPFS.<br/>Prosecutors will then consider whether there is sufficient evidence to suggest a crime was committed and the suspect was responsible.<br/>They will take the public interest into account. That can be influenced by the particular circumstances of the case - for example, whether the person involved was in a position of trust or authority.<br/>If they feel the evidence meets the necessary tests, the case will go to court.<br/>Alternatively, COPFS can instruct the police to carry out further inquiries if they decide there is insufficient evidence.<br/>If they are still not satisfied there is enough to justify a prosecution, the case would go no further.<br/>The law officers at the top of the Crown Office will not be involved in this lengthy process.<br/>The Lord Advocate Dorothy Bain KC and Solicitor General Ruth Charteris KC have dual roles as public prosecutors and principal legal advisors to the Scottish government, which has been run by the SNP since 2007.<br/>For that reason, they will not be consulted when a decision is made about what should happen to Ms Sturgeon, Mr Murrell or Mr Beattie, with that task falling to others. <br/>And for anyone wondering why the inquiry is called Operation Branchform, the titles for Police Scotland investigations are picked at random and the name does not actually mean anything.<br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Established and funded by government, they are led by an independent chair.<br/>An inquiry has the power to make people appear as witnesses and can demand evidence. <br/>No one is found guilty or innocent, but conclusions about lessons learned are published. Inquiries can make recommendations although these do not have to be adopted by ministers. <br/>The Covid inquiry, launched by Boris Johnson in May 2021, covers decision-making during the pandemic in both Westminster and the devolved administrations.<br/>At the time, Mr Johnson said all aspects of the UK's response would be \"under the microscope\". <br/>It is being chaired by Baroness Heather Hallett, a retired judge and crossbench peer.<br/>She previously led the inquests into the 7/7 London bombings.<br/>The inquiry has no formal deadline but is due to hold public hearings across the UK until at least 2025.<br/>At the first public hearing in London, Baroness Hallett said she planned to publish updates and reports \"as we go along\" on the inquiry's website. <br/>Public hearings are streamed on the inquiry's YouTube channel, and witness transcripts will be published on its website.<br/>Members of the public can apply to attend public hearings in person. <br/>The inquiry is split into different parts.<br/>Work in four areas has already begun:<br/>Future strands - with hearings due in 2024 and 2025 - will look at:<br/>Scotland is also holding a separate inquiry.<br/>Baroness Hallett's team is expected to focus on the biggest and most controversial aspects of the government's response, including:<br/>The inquiry is also expected to consider whether too many restrictions were imposed as the pandemic progressed. <br/>Over the course of 80 days in autumn 2020, for example, England went from the so-called \"rule of six\" to a tiered system of regulations, then into a national lockdown and then back to tiers.<br/>The government's policy towards schools is also likely to be on the agenda. Schools closed to most pupils in March 2020 and then again in January 2021.  <br/>The first public hearings have taken evidence from independent experts, including infectious-diseases specialist Prof David Heymann, and some government officials. <br/>Former Prime Minister David Cameron and former Chancellor George Osborne will appear before the committee in the second week of hearings, as will the current Deputy Prime Minister, Oliver Dowden, and Chancellor (and former Health Secretary) Jeremy Hunt. <br/>Sir Chris Whitty, the UK government's chief medical adviser during the pandemic, and Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser will also give evidence. <br/>Members of the public have been invited to share their experiences through the inquiry's Every Story Matters project.<br/>The Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice campaign group - which has been critical of the government's handling of the pandemic - has urged the inquiry to ensure these voices are heard.<br/>The inquiry asked to see unredacted WhatsApp messages between Boris Johnson and 40 people. <br/>They include former No 10 adviser Dominic Cummings, Cabinet Secretary Simon Case and former chancellor and current Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. <br/>What is the UK Covid inquiry and how long will it take?<br/>The Cabinet Office launched a legal challenge against the request, arguing some of the messages were irrelevant. This is thought to be the first time a government has taken legal action against its own public inquiry.<br/>Baroness Hallett said it was her job to decide if material was relevant.<br/>However Mr Johnson said he was \"perfectly content\" for the inquiry to have WhatsApp messages sent after May 2021.

And it was prominent.<br/>At Labour's 2021 conference, shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves announced her ambition to be the UK's first \"green\" chancellor.<br/>To stress her bona fides, she pledged to invest \u00a328bn a year, every year to 2030 to \"green\" the economy.<br/>Labour's Green Prosperity Plan was one of its defining policies. It gave the party a clear dividing line with government.<br/>Ms Reeves said there would be \"no dither, and no delay\" in tackling the climate crisis.<br/>It was also an answer to the government's \"levelling up\" pledge.<br/>The borrowed cash would underpin well-paid jobs in every corner of the UK in the energy sector.<br/>So why has Ms Reeves kicked the pledge into the second half of the next Parliament, if Labour wins?<br/>The first reason is obvious. <br/>Ms Reeves now says she was \"green\" - in a different sense of the word - in 2021, in that she hadn't foreseen what then-Prime Minister Liz Truss would do to the economy.<br/>With interest rates up, the cost of borrowing rises too, making the \u00a328bn pledge more expensive to deliver.<br/>And Ms Reeves wants to emphasise that if any spending commitments clash with her fiscal rules, the rules would win every time.<br/>But did the \u00a328bn green pledge really clash with her rules?<br/>In their own detailed briefing on their fiscal rules, Labour said: \"It is essential that for our future prosperity that we retain the ability to borrow for investing in capital projects which over time will pay for themselves.<br/>\"And that is why our target for eliminating the deficit excludes investment.\"<br/>So borrowing to invest in the future technology and jobs shouldn't fall foul of that fiscal rule.<br/>But there is another rule which Ms Reeves cited this morning - to have debt falling as a percentage of GDP or Gross Domestic Product, a measure of economic activity. <br/>Meeting that rule may have contributed to putting the \u00a328bn on the backburner - though I remember at the 2021 conference some senior Labour figures questioning the wisdom of borrowing the equivalent of half the defence budget every year even then.<br/>And some senior figures in Labour are far less convinced that \u00a328bn would necessarily bust the debt rule - economic forecasts can change by far greater margins.<br/>One of the other justifications for the change of position is that \u00a328bn shouldn't be poured in to the economy straight away. <br/>That's because it will take time to train workers, to create and bolster supply chains. Hence \"ramping up\" to \u00a328bn. <br/>One shadow minister said that while today's announcement felt like a bit of a handbrake turn, it was nonetheless inevitable and sensible.<br/>The scale of the ambition remained the same, but pragmatically the shadow chancellor was simply not committing to spending which would be difficult to deliver.<br/>But all this must have been known in 2021, too.<br/>So why announce the U-turn today?<br/>The change of position was discussed within Labour's Treasury team for some time.<br/>Engagement with investors convinced them the government itself may not need to pump in a huge amount of cash straight away - the private sector would provide green jobs without state help. <br/>And while Ms Reeves has ditched the \u00a328bn pledge in the first half of the Parliament, this doesn't mean that a Labour government would spend nothing on its Green Prosperity Plan.<br/>I understand cash will be prioritised for projects where the private sector would not commit without state assistance - nuclear and hydrogen for example.<br/>But it seems clear that politics and not just economics played a role in today's announcement. <br/>There have been grumbles and growls over how the policy has landed over the past two years within Labour's ranks and internal criticism has increased, not receded.<br/>One concern was that the amount to be borrowed - the \u00a328bn - was better known than what the money would buy - from home insulation and heat pumps to new carbon capture technology.<br/>But it was crystal clear this week that the Conservatives felt that they had seen a vulnerability that could be exploited.<br/>The front page of the Daily Mail blared this week about the alleged dangers of the policy - the extra borrowing would put up interest and therefore mortgage costs.<br/>The independent Institute for Fiscal Studies was also being cited by Conservative ministers. <br/>Its director Paul Johnson had warned that while additional borrowing would pump money in to the economy, it also drives up interest rates.<br/>As Labour has been attacking the Conservatives for their handling of the economy, and the \"mortgage premium\" they claim the government has caused, it was understandable that they did not want the same attack to be aimed at them, and Ms Reeves this morning sought to eliminate a potential negative.<br/>As one Labour shadow minister put it: \"They [the Conservatives] will be pulling their hair out that one of their attack lines has failed.\"<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Rachel Reeves says Labour will now \"ramp up\" its plan to spend \u00a328bn a year on green industries<br/>Some in Labour's ranks, though, believe the party should have insulated (no pun intended) itself from attack by making the case more stridently that borrowing to invest is different from borrowing to meet day-to-day spending.<br/>Labour's opinion poll lead is wide but pessimists in their ranks fear it is shallow. <br/>Establishing economic credibility is seen as key.<br/>But while it may have been the lesser of two evils, today's change of tack isn't cost-free.<br/>The party has committed to achieve a net-zero power system by 2030. <br/>But with potentially significantly less investment, is this target in danger too?<br/>And unlike many of the left-wing commitments that have been ditched - where the leadership don't really mind the backlash - this was the shadow chancellor watering down her own highest-profile pledge.<br/>That in itself has allowed the Conservatives to shout about Labour's economic plans being \"in tatters\". <br/>As Labour is still committed to its Green Prosperity Plan - just not the original timescale - they will still claim they have clear dividing lines with the government.<br/>But one of their key arguments has been this: With the US pouring subsidies in to domestic green industries, the UK will get left behind if it doesn't follow suit. And fast.<br/>A delay doesn't destroy - but it does potentially weaken - the Labour case.<br/>But there is another concern amongst those who are most certainly not on the Corbyn left.<br/>Emphasising competence and fiscal credibility over climate change commitments could leave some target voters cold.<br/>Labour waters down \u00a328bn green projects pledge<br/>Labour unveils Biden-inspired economic strategy<br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

That committee is made up mainly of Tory MPs. The former PM has faced the same procedure as other MPs that get into trouble. And while Mr Johnson claims he has been \"forced out\", remember he has chosen to quit before we even see the black and white of their verdict. <br/>It is also a fact there are some Conservatives who begrudge him his success. It is also true that during his last few months in No 10 there were internal enemies trying to force him out. <br/>But to dress that up as a grand conspiracy is, candidly, a stretch. One of those who knows him best told me his resignation announcement was \"1,000 words that tell you everything about Johnson's mindset - it's your fault not mine\".<br/>Rather than confront what has happened or try to defend himself from the judgement that is coming, Boris Johnson made a political choice this week not to stay and fight. <br/>As ever, the line between farce and tragedy is skinny. While most of the headlines screamed of the shock, the former prime minister's exit from Parliament is entirely on brand. <br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Boris Johnson's political career... in 72 seconds<br/>The timing on a Friday was unexpected, but no surprise. He never much liked Parliament anyway, even though he managed to find a gong for the Commons' hairdresser. <br/>The idea he would savour being a humble backbencher asking questions about cash for the local hospital or appearing at school fetes was for the birds. And if the Privileges Committee's findings are as savage as expected he would have faced a by-election. <br/>Clues from his track record tell us there is little chance he would have fought if he hadn't been sure he could win. He pulled out of the Tory leadership race in 2016 when Michael Gove's move blew up his status as front-runner. <br/>He didn't run in 2022 despite a dash back from the Caribbean and fevered claims that he had enough support. One former cabinet ally says he is \"more calculating than people think and this will have been a calculation -  if he thought he would win the by-election he would stay\". To win and lose does not match brand Boris. To leave like this absolutely does.<br/>The power of his personality - frankly his fame - means he leaves behind some devastated colleagues and a strand of the public who believe he has been hard done by. <br/>One former cabinet minister says: \"The party wounded itself when it defenestrated Boris and continues to bleed.\"<br/>Some of his hard-core supporters left on the backbenches say his exit is a sad day for democracy and - with some justification believe his leadership is what secured their seats, particularly in parts of the country where the Tories could never have dreamt of doing well before. <br/>Some of his loyal backers do feel like he is the great hero in a tragedy, cast aside unfairly in an epic drama, undone by those who envy his talents. <br/>His exit is arguably a tragedy for those who genuinely believed in and adored him. And there is a political tragedy for the Conservative Party, which many MPs privately believe squandered a once in a generation majority. <br/>2019 gave it one of those rare chances to make radical changes to the country, and while many believe it was thrown away by mismanagement and mistakes, there was of course the unexpected horror of the Covid pandemic too. <br/>For those who deplore Boris Johnson, there is a different kind of tragedy, the damage they believe he did to the UK's reputation. And several of those who have been close to him over the years identify a fourth element of the mess - the fact they believe it was never going to end well. <br/>In the Greek tragedies so beloved of Mr Johnson himself, fate, and inevitability plays an important role. One of them says: \"Boris is a genuine tragedy. This was all inevitable. We knew how it would play out, but we are still surprised and shocked about how dreadful it is. All our hard work pissed away.\" <br/>So what happens next? Some MPs are actually cock-a-hoop despite the colossal mess. One tells me: \"The man-baby has gone - so pleased!\"<br/>But allies talk up his chances of running for another seat some time. One former senior minister tells me \"the question is does he plan to get another seat or even Mid-Beds?\" - the constituency his close ally and former Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries has just left. <br/>Another former cabinet minister says: \"It would be very unwise for him to run again. He has a vociferous 20% in the party who like him but 80% don't. If he ran in a by-election the Lib Dems would murder him.\"<br/>Would party HQ even let that happen? Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has changed the personnel in charge there. One senior figure pours a bucket of freezing water over the idea telling me: \"Boris died today.\"<br/>What is not clear yet is whether as that MP suggests the manner of his departure could \"generate so much unrest I fear there will be an election much sooner than thought\".<br/>Mr Johnson has thrown grenades at No 10 - not just the committee that has judged him - suggesting Mr Sunak is not running a \"proper Conservative\" government. <br/>One former ally says the ex-PM has \"gone full circle, returning to his political home - a hut across the water where he can now lob rocks without any sense of responsibility or accountability - and that is ultimately very dangerous for his party and Sunak\". <br/>But if Boris Johnson is unlikely to run for Parliament again, and is happy to dangle the prospect of a return, what else might he do with his time?<br/>You'll find plenty of people in Westminster chattering that he'll return to his first love - writing - but might there be something bigger? <br/>By chance his old newspaper the Telegraph has just come up for sale and - by chance - its former editor Will Lewis has just been made a knight by Mr Johnson. Is there, by chance, the possibility they might be part of a bid to take it over? <br/>It's been suggested to me that is in fact something that has been discussed. It's no secret that Mr Lewis - now Sir Will - would be keen to take it on. <br/>He advised Mr Johnson in No 10 sometimes and the two men worked together at the Telegraph when the former PM was its star columnist who attracted extra subscribers each week. <br/>Going back as a columnist would be one thing for Mr Johnson and not all that surprising. But for him to take a bigger role - as one source whispers, the editor - might be the Conservatives' worst nightmare. <br/>I'm told that conversations are only at the stage of ideas being scribbled down on paper. A formal sale process, let alone any decisions about actual bids, is a long way off.  <br/>But I can't help wondering, what would the consequences be for Downing Street and the Conservatives if their most loyal backer in the press gave a major role to Mr Sunak's bitter rival? Could the next twist in the Boris Johnson story be even wilder than the last? Perhaps. <br/>Some of those who have worked alongside him believe it is more likely to be \"terminal Boris\". A former ally says \"he was obviously once someone with exceptional skills, who came so far, and did so much in the face of incredible opposition\".<br/>But they say, perhaps in sorrow and in anger: \"His career ends with him alone, a victim of his utter inability to tell the truth to anyone, including himself.\"<br/>Maybe he will fade into obscurity. Perhaps he'll be back in Parliament one day. He might make millions speaking and writing or become Rishi Sunak's most powerful opposition. <br/>But his name is now on the list of those unprovable political \"what ifs' so furiously and perpetually debated by political nerds. <br/>What if Mrs Thatcher hadn't been forced out? What if Tony Blair hadn't invaded Iraq? What if Boris Johnson had given a different answer in the Commons when he was first asked what happened under his roof during the Covid lockdowns? <br/>We will never know. But what we do know this weekend is that one era is over. We know Boris Johnson had huge potential to create, but also to destroy - his extraordinary majority, his reputation, and the party he led too. <br/>He must now decide what to do with the power that he still retains. And his old party must decide how much attention it wants to pay. <br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Councils are required by law to balance their budgets and provide \"best value\" to their constituents. <br/>Woking is the latest council to be put under intervention, with minister Lee Rowley appointing commissioners last week because of the authority's \u00a31.9bn in debt.<br/>Local elections are always in part seen as a test of the public mood nationally - and the message from May's polls is that voters are turning away from the Conservatives.<br/>But it is not always easy to say how much impact local issues have on the way people vote.<br/>\"Generally, people aren't voting on specific local issues\" says Prof Paula Surridge of Bristol University, who researches voting behaviour, \"but when things are particularly bad, that really raises the profile\".<br/>She says voters often don't know much about councils, but \"when your council has been labelled as failing, even if you don't know exactly what they do, you're going to know they're not doing it right\".<br/>Local elections also often see lower turnout levels than national polls. But are voters aware enough to take action when their council's been labelled as failing?<br/>Slough saw a dramatic shift. The sitting Labour administration lost 18 seats, with 16 of them going to the Tories and a few to the Liberal Democrats.<br/>What's so notable about Slough is it heavily defied the national trend. Instead votes flew in the opposite direction, leading to a Labour collapse. <br/>\"Slough is clear, simple and straightforward - an 18 point swing from Labour to Tory. It's so out of line [with the national picture],\" says Prof Sir John Curtice, polling expert at the University of Strathclyde.<br/>Dexter Smith, leader of Slough Conservatives, who now run the town in partnership with the Lib Dems, says the council's failings \"definitely\" had an impact on the results.<br/>He said voters would talk about the council's bankruptcy on the doorstep, but also \"lots of missed bin collections, rather poor performance in a variety of services\".<br/>Max Caller, the former commissioner sent in by the government to Slough, agrees that \"people had an understanding of how bad things were\", with the local press covering the problems extensively.<br/>Slough issued its section 114 notice in July 2021, but Mr Smith claims it didn't have much of an impact on the results in the election most recently after that - May 2022 - because voters hadn't felt the effects of the bankruptcy yet. <br/>But since then, the council selling off \u00a3200m of assets, a new fee for garden waste collection - and the killer, a nearly 10% council tax rise, has made voters take notice, he says.<br/>Because of the dire state of the authority's finances, Slough was given permission by the government to implement the council tax rise without a local referendum. <br/>Most of England had their council tax increased by nearly 5%. Slough Labour planned to raise council tax by nearly 10% again next year.<br/>The Conservatives committed not to doing this, says Mr Smith, and treated the election \"more like a referendum\" on the rise. <br/>Slough Labour did not respond to attempts to contact them for this article.<br/>Mr Smith blames Slough's problems on the \"tax and spend approach by Labour\". But it's not only Labour councils that get into trouble.<br/>Thurrock Council saw the incumbent Conservative administration lose two seats to Labour, who also gained three from independents. It left the Tories with a majority of one. Labour's vote share was up significantly compared to the last time these seats were elected.<br/>Thurrock Council has debts of more than \u00a31bn.<br/>Labour group leader John Kent says \"there's a growing awareness [of the council's problems], it kind of comes in waves\". <br/>These waves peaked when the government intervened and when the council went bankrupt, he says. <br/>\"In my ward we knocked on doors, and people I know are Tories said we're voting for you because of what they've done, they've bankrupted the council,\" he says.<br/>The most recent wave was the council tax increase. <br/>Like Slough, Thurrock put its council tax up by nearly 10%. And again like in Slough, Mr Kent identifies this rise, coupled with the failure to deliver local services, as the reason voters took action.<br/>\"It was the inability of the council to empty the bins \u2026 people in their own minds ally that with the council tax.\"<br/>Thurrock Conservatives declined to be interviewed for this article.<br/>The Essex authority is a less clear-cut case on whether voters punished a failing council, as it still followed the national trend of Conservatives losing seats, although Prof Curtice says it \"probably\" had an impact. <br/>\"The vote figures were down so sharply this could reasonably be that the Tories were being punished. They escaped retribution in terms of seats because of a bad baseline\".<br/>The last time these seats were contested - the baseline Prof Curtice is talking about - was 2019, when the Conservatives were hit by infighting over Theresa May's Brexit deal.<br/>The impact was also \"masked\", Prof Curtice adds, by the fact that Thurrock is among those English councils that only elect a third of their seats three out of every four years, instead of all their seats every four years. <br/>By contrast, Slough moved to all-out elections this year for the first time.<br/>If Thurrock had elected all its councillors in May, both Prof Curtice and Mr Kent agree that Labour would have unseated the Tories as the largest party on the council.<br/>Sandwell and Liverpool councils both saw the incumbent parties lose support, but on a smaller scale.<br/>Prof Curtice does not think voters punished Labour in Sandwell, but says it's more difficult to tell in Liverpool. Labour lost nine seats in the city, but their vote share held up.<br/>Liverpool continues to be dominated by Labour, although the party's share dropped in 2021, the first elections after corruption allegations emerged around former mayor Joe Anderson. He denies any wrongdoing.<br/>Croydon, in south London, is another council with huge debts that has had commissioners sent in during recent years. Last year, voters elected a Conservative mayor - even though the council itself is Labour.<br/>Commissioners have reported good progress at Sandwell and are \"optimistic\" about Liverpool - both areas where the incumbent party's vote has held up.<br/>Progress at Slough on the other hand has \"been very slow\", according to the commissioners, while Thurrock had another commissioner appointed in March after the government said it was \"continuing to fail in its best value duty\".<br/>So perhaps we can conclude that voters do pay attention to local issues - and are prepared to punish failed administrations at the ballot box.<br/>The people paying the price for a bankrupt council<br/>Commissioners will oversee troubled council<br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Let me explain. <br/>The inquiry's chair Baroness Hallett is demanding unredacted WhatsApp messages and notebooks from Boris Johnson.<br/>They cover the period of the pandemic when he was prime minister and making key decisions.<br/>She is adamant that it is her job to decide what is and isn't relevant to her inquiry.<br/>The government disagrees - and speaking to people close to the process, I don't think they're going to back down. <br/>They argue that they need to protect the privacy of ministers and others. They say they will not send information that is \"unambiguously irrelevant\" to the inquiry.<br/>Insiders have told the BBC they will send relevant messages - for example, WhatsApp conversations that led to a policy decision. They would not send messages involving personal conversations. <br/>But they think that decision is for the government - and its lawyers - to make.<br/>So who is going to win?<br/>The more likely answer seems to be the Covid inquiry.<br/>It has legal powers to compel people to produce documents. It also had a pretty broad remit under the terms established by the government. <br/>And some senior Conservatives are now urging the Cabinet Office to back down. <br/>William Wragg is the chair of the Commons public administration and constitutional affairs committee.

We aim to have 80% of UK trade covered by free trade agreements within the next three years, starting with the USA.\" <br/>In truth the likelihood of such a full fat agreement, on that timeframe in particular, was probably pretty small, and it's been very small for as long as President Joe Biden has been in the White House - a reality acknowledged by Boris Johnson and Liz Truss as well as Rishi Sunak. <br/>And three years on from 2019 was 2022, last year - and there is no such deal.<br/>This is why I asked the prime minister and the president about it: given they are unveiling something of an alternative - the Atlantic Declaration - it is important to scrutinise and highlight the gap between what was in the prospectus for government that gives Mr Sunak his mandate to govern, and what he is now talking up.<br/>Not least because trade deals have been done with others, possible once the UK was outside the European Union.<br/>From Mr Sunak's perspective, the politics of this is straightforward: attempting a free trade agreement, even if President Biden wanted to deliver one and could deliver one, would take longer than either man has between now and facing their electorates in the next 18 months.<br/>So better to work up an arrangement now, even if chunks of it require further negotiation before they happen. <br/>Downing Street argues, in explaining why there has been no such deal with the US, that the world has changed since 2019. And it has. <br/>It is worth exploring how it has changed, how that is remoulding international relations and the consequences for the UK.<br/>Covid, the threat posed by China, and the war in Ukraine have been catalysts for a collective fretting from many of the relatively rich democracies over economic security.<br/>Translated: how to get hold of components or energy without relying on now hostile states. <br/>This Declaration, at least partially, attempts to address this. <br/>There is concern about military security too, which prompted the  AUKUS pact between the UK, the US and Australia.<br/>But the economic elephant in the diplomatic corridors is America's Inflation Reduction Act - a massive stimulus to address economic security and base green industries of the future in previously left behind American areas. <br/>It is so big it has turned heads in boardrooms globally. <br/>The Biden Administration's motivation is this: the economy needs to adapt given climate change, China and Russia - so let's make America less dependent on others and ensure those jobs of the future are in America.<br/>Labour say they'd do something similar. The Conservatives won't - but No10 point to elements in this deal that mitigate against some of its downsides to British businesses.<br/>Downing Street are upbeat about how the last few days have panned out. <br/>Rishi Sunak and his delegation stayed at Blair House, the President's official guesthouse. <br/>Talk to those who have been there and it's a reminder the accommodation on these trips is part of the diplomacy.<br/>The political history at every turn. The portraits on the walls. The giant strawberry dipped in chocolate left in a guest's room.<br/>Oh, and it turns out the chef in Blair House is from Warrington. <br/>He keeps fish and chips on the menu as a nod to his British heritage.

It is about promises, people and places.<br/>Who and how many should the country welcome, from where and for how long?<br/>I have been talking to people in Great Yarmouth in Norfolk about it.<br/>The east of England is highly dependent on immigration - and Great Yarmouth overwhelmingly backed Brexit too.<br/>The promises of three successive Conservative prime ministers were washed away by reality.<br/>\"Net migration will be in the order of tens of thousands each year, no ifs, no buts,\" claimed David Cameron.<br/>There were lots of ifs and even more buts - he never got close.<br/>\"We believe sustainable numbers are the tens of thousands,\" repeated Theresa May.

No ifs. No buts.\"<br/>It's a promise that came back to haunt the Conservatives - as the target receded further and further into the distance.<br/>As Thursday's Office for National Statistics data show, net migration is nowhere near that figure. In fact, migration added 606,000 to the UK's population in 2022, the highest number on record and sharply up on recent levels.<br/>There are a range of factors behind that rise, as we report here, and a lively debate over the benefits and disadvantages of immigration.<br/>But for some years now, the focus has not been on immigration per se, but on \"net migration\" - the difference between those entering and leaving the UK.<br/>It was David Cameron, who when he became prime minister in 2010, introduced the concept to the wider public. <br/>\"Net migration was not really a metric that people thought about or used in the run up to 2010,\" says Rob McNeil, deputy director of the University of Oxford's Migration Observatory.<br/>\"It created the idea that management of migration was a technocratic process. The reality is, it's much more complicated than that.\"<br/>Mr Cameron was keen to curb immigration but, he argued, what voters really cared about was not the numbers coming from overseas but the overall growth in the size of the UK's population. <br/>In a 2007 speech, he stressed the \"positive impact on our economy\" of immigration but added that it was \"time for change\".<br/>\"We need policy to reduce the level of net immigration,\" he declared.<br/>Unfortunately for Mr Cameron, his chosen measure was already on an upward trajectory.<br/>And there were question marks about how much control any government could exert over the number of people emigrating from the UK - a key component of net migration.<br/>There was a time when that number was very high, as Britons left for pastures new. As a result, UK net migration was routinely below zero before the 1990s. <br/>But since 1994, immigration to the UK has exceeded emigration every year to date.<br/>The figures show that immigration started to rise more sharply under Tony Blair's New Labour government.<br/>Net migration rose above 200,000 for the first time in 2004, after Mr Blair's government opened up the UK to workers from new EU member states in eastern Europe.<br/>\"Suddenly from being a steady trickle, immigration turned into a flood,\" said Damian Green, the former immigration minister and Conservative MP. \"It became a huge political issue.\"<br/>Analysis by the Migration Observatory in 2011, found government policies were not on track to reduce net migration to the tens of thousands.<br/>And yet Mr Green - who was the immigration minister at the time - continued to insist the government was on course to meet its target.<br/>\"It was doable,\" said Mr Green.<br/>\"I remember once seeing a projection in the Home Office that showed if everything stayed the same, by the 2015 election, we'd have net migration down to 116,000. It wasn't completely unrealistic.\"<br/>The promise of net migration in the tens of thousands appeared again in the Conservative Party's 2015 manifesto.<br/>Alongside that manifesto promise was one of a referendum on the UK's membership of the EU. With the Eurosceptic party UKIP rising in the polls, Mr Cameron was looking exposed on immigration.<br/>A migrant crisis, partly triggered by conflicts in the Middle East, was deepening in Europe, while UKIP was gaining political momentum and a bigger audience for its opposition to \"mass immigration\" ahead of the 2015 general election.<br/>Having won a majority at that election, Mr Cameron announced the Brexit referendum in 2016 and struck a deal to redraw the terms of the UK's EU membership.<br/>Concessions on immigration, including restrictions on benefits to EU migrants, formed the backbone of Mr Cameron's deal, but it wasn't enough to convince enough voters to back Remain.<br/>Instead, the Leave campaign - with its contentious warnings of an influx of migrants from the EU - proved more compelling to the 52% who voted for Brexit.<br/>Richard Tice, a prominent Eurosceptic and leader of Reform UK, said the Conservative MPs who backed Brexit promised they would take control of migration following the referendum.<br/>\"And we believed their promises,\" Mr Tice said. \"The data has shown that actually, they've abandoned those promises.<br/>\"We're brought up to trust what politicians say. But when they continually fail to do it, that trust evaporates.\"<br/>The promise remained unkept under former prime minister Theresa May, who held the line of \"net migration down to the tens of thousands\" in the Conservative Party's 2017 manifesto.<br/>Only in its 2019 manifesto, when Boris Johnson succeeded her as Tory leader, did the party ditch the under-100,000 pledge.<br/>Instead, the Conservatives - rather more vaguely - said \"the overall numbers will come down\" and \"we will ensure that the British people are always in control\".<br/>Liz Truss's tenure as prime minister was so short - just 49 days - and she didn't have a chance to set out her stall on migration.<br/>Migration has slipped down the political agenda, with YouGov polling showing immigration and asylum ranking behind the economy and housing as the most important issues facing the country.<br/>So far, the current prime minister, Rishi Sunak, has mostly focused on curbing illegal immigration and stopping small boats crossing the English Channel.<br/>Unlike his predecessors, Mr Sunak has so far shied away from putting a figure on what net migration should be, only calling the current level \"too high\".<br/>Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has similarly refused to set a target for net migration.<br/>\"I'm not putting a specific number on it,\" he said this week. \"The only thing we know about those targets is that they're routinely missed.\"<br/>As Mr Cameron found out the hard way, making commitments on something as difficult to control as the movement of people can create hostages to fortune, and leave promises unfulfilled.<br/>Sunak denies he's lost control of rising migration<br/>Legal migration is too high, says Rishi Sunak<br/>Who is allowed to come to live in the UK?<br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

He has advised that on this occasion further investigation is not necessary and I have accepted that advice. On the basis of your letter and our discussion, my decision is that these matters do not amount to a breach of the Ministerial Code.<br/>As you have recognised, a better course of action could have been taken to avoid giving rise to the perception of impropriety.<br/>Nevertheless, I am reassured you take these matters seriously. You have provided a thorough account, apologised and expressed regret.<br/>It is vital that all those in Government maintain the high standards the public rightly expects. I know you share this view, just as we are committed to delivering on the issues that matter to the British people - from making our streets safer and reducing net migration to stopping the boats.<br/>Yours ever<br/>Rishi Sunak<br/>Dear Prime Minister,<br/>I am writing to provide further information in relation to my receipt and handling of a speeding ticket, which has been the subject of recent media interest.<br/>Around June 2022, while Attorney General, I was found to be speeding. I received notification that I could take a group speed awareness course or receive a fine and three points on my licence, which was clean at the time. I opted to take the course and booked a date in Autumn.<br/>After arriving at the Home Office in September as Home Secretary, I informed officials in my Home Office Private Office (PO) about the course and asked whether it was appropriate given my new role. <br/>This reflected my lack of familiarity with protocol relating to my newly acquired official status as a 'protected person', which means I am required to have a close protection security team overseeing my movements, and with me always in public. <br/>This involves close protection having knowledge of and involvement in many areas of what would otherwise be considered my 'private life', not related to my work as a Minister or Member of Parliament.<br/>In discussions with my Principal Private Secretary (PPS) I was advised that the Cabinet Office's Propriety and Ethics Team (PET) would be the best source of advice on whether it was appropriate to seek to do the course in a way that protected my privacy, security, and was least disruptive to the course participants and provider. <br/>I readily agreed to this suggestion. Consequently, on 28 September 2022 my PPS discussed this with the Permanent Secretary's Office. <br/>The Permanent Secretary's Office, at the request of the Permanent Secretary, then asked PET for guidance (noting that their own initial view was that this was not a matter for civil servant involvement) and asked if they were aware of any precedents and for any advice. <br/>PET advised it was not an appropriate matter for civil servants to take forward. <br/>My PPS also rightly pointed out that I needed to be mindful to ensure that I did not ask a company to change their rules due to my position, which neither I, nor to the best of my knowledge anyone acting on my behalf, ever sought to do. <br/>My PPS confirmed that I could continue discussing the matter with Special Advisers, and asked them to pick up with me. I made no further requests of officials.<br/>I therefore later engaged with Special Advisers about how we would enable my participation in a way that would maintain my security and privacy. <br/>This was to determine whether there were other options possible within the overall framework and rules of the provider.<br/>My preference at this point, following consultation with my Special Advisers, was to attend a group course in person rather than online due to privacy concerns. <br/>Participation in a speed awareness course is supposed to be private, and Special Advisers raised concerns about the risk of me being covertly recorded while participating online, and the political ramifications of this. PO and the Permanent Secretary's officials also had previously advised that participating online risked generating media interest.<br/>However, Special Advisers raised concerns about the difficulties of ensuring the appropriate security arrangements for an in-person course. <br/>Their concerns included that my protective Security team might need to join me in the room or be unable to undertake appropriate vetting of other course participants owing to third party privacy concerns.<br/>Special Advisers then contacted the course provider to better understand the range of appropriate options that might be available - and consistent with the course provider's rules, policies and practices. <br/>Based on this further information, I concluded that none of these could satisfactorily address the aforementioned security, privacy and political concerns. I therefore opted to take the points and pay the fine, which I did in November.<br/>I accept that I was speeding and regret doing so. At no point did I try to avoid sanction. My actions were always directed toward finding an appropriate way to participate in the speed awareness course, taking into account my new role as Home Secretary and the necessary security and privacy issues that this raised. <br/>My interactions with officials intended to provide appropriate clarification of the options available to me in my role as Home Secretary. Whenever I was informed that a possible option was not available, I accepted that. At no point did I instruct officials to behave contrary to the advice that was provided.<br/>I considered the involvement of my Special Advisers appropriate, given the logistical, security, privacy, media, and therefore political considerations involved. I regret that my attempt to find a way to participate in the course in a manner that would have satisfied these concerns has enabled some to construe a potential conflict of interest. <br/>With hindsight, I acknowledge that the better course of action would have been to take the points and fine upfront.<br/>The Ministerial Code sets out that Ministers must provide a list of all interests which might be thought to give rise to a conflict. It does not define what should be included, but it does specify the different types of interests. <br/>These are all framed around the responsibility for avoiding a conflict of interest between Ministers' public duties and their private interests, and tend to relate to ongoing circumstances or relationships. Recognising the importance of integrity and transparency, I approach my declarations with great care and consideration.<br/>The purpose of the form is to declare anything which might interfere, or be perceived to interfere, with a Minister's integrity when making decisions in the public interest. I did not consider that a speeding infringement or attending a speed awareness course, needed to be disclosed. <br/>It is not an ongoing situation with the potential to influence my decisions. In general, minor driving offences tend to be excluded from official forms. For example, barristers are not required to inform the regulator of minor speeding infractions; similarly, these are excluded if you are asked about any criminal history when you apply for a visa to the UK, or in the annual security questions asked of civil servants in the Home Office with heightened security clearance. <br/>I note that PET has, since November 2022, introduced references to fixed penalty notices in their introductory discussions with new ministers, recognising that the position was unclear given these are not currently explicitly covered by Ministerial interest forms. I am grateful for this clarity, and in the future would declare any similar speeding course or fine.<br/>As I outlined, I informed my officials of the speeding and driving course, and the Permanent Secretary's office was involved in the conversations as described above, determining whether it was appropriate for civil servants to engage with the security and logistics of me attending this course. It was never suggested by anyone in my PO or the Permanent Secretary's Office that I needed to disclose the situation on an updated form. <br/>I also understand that, despite being aware of events at the time, at no point did the Permanent Secretary or Cabinet Office suggest that my actions resulted in a conflict of interest or merited any investigation.<br/>I am deeply committed to all the Nolan Principles of Public Life, including honesty, integrity and openness, and I regret that these events have led some to question my commitment. <br/>I have at all times been truthful and transparent, and taken decisions guided by what I believed was right and appropriate given my office, not by any personal motivation. Another principle, of course, is leadership: Ministers must hold themselves \u2014 and be seen to hold themselves \u2014 to the highest standards. I have always strived, and will continue to strive, to do this.<br/>As I say, in hindsight, or if faced with a similar situation again, I would have chosen a different course of action. I sought to explore whether bespoke arrangements were possible, given my personal circumstances as a security-protected Minister. <br/>I recognise how some people have construed this as me seeking to avoid sanction \u2014 at no point was that the intention or outcome. Nonetheless, given the fundamental importance of integrity in public life, I deeply regret that my actions may have given rise to that perception, and I apologise for the distraction this has caused.<br/>I hope this clearly sets out my involvement in this matter and provides you with all relevant information. Should you require any further information, I will of course be happy to provide it.<br/>Yours sincerely,<br/>Suella Braverman<br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

In 2017 and 2019 elections, as well as the EU referendum in 2016, age became the most prominent dividing line in British politics.<br/>A report by the Onward think tank, from 2019, said 83% of Conservative voters were over 45, while 4% were under 24.<br/>At the last election, the tipping point - the age at which people are more likely to vote Conservative than Labour - was 39, according to YouGov.<br/>But recent data analysis suggests younger generations are upending one of the stickiest assumptions in politics.<br/>In research this year, two political scientists from King's College London showed how millennials and Gen Z-ers are not becoming more Conservative as they age.<br/>In analysis of Conservative support by age, the research showed a 40% gap between oldest and youngest in 2020, compared with 10% in the early 1990s.<br/>One important factor is how the life chances of a generation have been shaped by events, such as the financial crash in 2008, Brexit and the Covid-19 pandemic.<br/>Bobby Duffy, professor of public policy at King's, says decisions by recent Conservative governments have not supported young people, while the increasing focus on culture-war issues has polarised the generations.<br/>\"This generational divide looks like terrible news for future support for the Conservatives, as clearly older generations are dying out and being replaced by these younger generations,\" the professor says.<br/>Still, there are reasons to view predictions of Conservative extinction through a sceptical lens.<br/>\"The Conservatives do face a real challenge, but it may be as much to do with the current offer from this version of conservatism than the underlying principles and values,\" Prof Duffy says. \"Decline is not inevitable for the Tories, but to avoid it, they do need to change.\"<br/>The Conservative Party did not wish to comment.<br/>Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary, told the BBC it was important \"not to think about the country in terms of young or old\" and insisted the Tories had \"great young talent\", who appealed to voters of all ages.<br/>While the Tories wait to test that proposition in a general election, their party is being pulled in different political directions after 13 years in power.<br/>Meanwhile, Mr Hancock, apparently joking, turns to his pink tie for inspiration.<br/>\"I occasionally wear a tie,\" he says. \"Today was the first time I put on a suit in two weeks, because I'm a normal person, now. I'm not a Conservative MP. It's just like, be normal, like the people who we represent. That's what we need to do.\"<br/>Hancock to stand down at next election<br/>Matt Hancock closes down app after five years<br/>Hancock: It\u2019s a pleasure to be back\u2026 and well-fed<br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

<br/>The Commons standards committee recommended in March that the MP - who was elected for the SNP but had been sitting as an independent - should be suspended for 30 days.<br/>Ms Ferrier appealed the judgement, but it was later upheld when MPs voted by 185 to 40 in favour of the suspension on 6 June. <br/>Any MP suspended for more than 10 days will face a recall petition.<br/>If the petition is signed by more than 10% of eligible voters in the constituency within six weeks, the MP is removed from their seat and a by-election called.<br/>South Lanarkshire Council has confirmed the Margaret Ferrier recall petition will be open from 09:00 on Tuesday 20 June to 17:00 on Monday 31 July 2023.<br/>Constituents can sign the document at seven council sites across the area.<br/>Applications to participate by post or by proxy can be organised by contacting the Electoral Registration Office.<br/>The council has also confirmed that the number of Rutherglen and Hamilton West constituents entitled to sign the petition is 81,124 - so 8,113 people would have to sign to remove Ms Ferrier.<br/>If this is successful, it is likely a by-election will not happen until the autumn.<br/>Labour had already selected a candidate for a by-election before the Commons had even voted to suspend her, with the party quietly confident of winning the seat and adding momentum to its campaign ahead of next year's general election. <br/>The recall procedure for MPs was introduced in 2015 in response to the MPs' expenses scandal in the run up to the 2010 general election.<br/>MPs can be recalled under three circumstances:<br/>A petition officer then arranges for the petition to be open for six weeks. <br/>According to House of Commons Library, electors can sign it in person at a signing station or by post or proxy.<br/>If the 10% threshold is reached the petition officer informs the Speaker of the House of Commons - the seat becomes vacant when this notice is given.<br/>Two MPs have been recalled through this process both in 2019 - Labour's Fiona Onasanya of Peterborough and Conservative Chris Davies of Brecon and Radnorshire.<br/>Ms Onasanya, who lied to police over a speeding ticket, had been jailed for three months for perverting the course of justice.<br/>Meanwhile, Mr Davies had pleaded guilty to two charges of making a false expenses claim.<br/>A recall petition was held in North Antrim in September 2018 over the DUP's Ian Paisley, but failed to get enough signatures.<br/>The Commons had voted to suspend him for failing to declare two holidays paid for by the Sri Lankan government and lobbying on its behalf.<br/>This will be the first recall petition held in Scotland.<br/>People can campaign for or against recall petitions and the Electoral Commission has rules in place for spending and donations on such campaigns.<br/>Voters who want to sign the recall petition will need voter ID because of new rules introduced by the UK government.<br/>It had been suggested that some Conservative MPs might vote against the motion to ban Ms Ferrier as they are concerned about the precedent it would set in the case of Boris Johnson.<br/>The former PM's behaviour is being looked at by Westminster's Privileges Committee over whether he misled parliament.<br/>Of the 40 MPs who ultimately opposed her suspension, 32 were Conservatives, two were DUP, two were Alba - Neale Hanvey and Kenny MacAskill - and one was Reclaim.<br/>The Conservatives who backed her included former ministers David Davis and Jacob Rees-Mogg, and party grandees Sir Bill Cash and Sir Edward Leigh.<br/>Ferrier was accompanied in the Commons for the vote by Conservative former minister Andrew Selous and SNP MP Carol Monaghan. <br/>At one point, Conservative MP Daniel Kawczynski was seen walking to the opposition benches to shake her hand.<br/>Many of her former SNP colleagues had been calling for her to quit as an MP since her lockdown breach first came to light. <br/>Covid train trip MP loses appeal over Commons ban<br/>Figures show voters turned away due to no photo ID<br/>Who is Margaret Ferrier?<br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

For example, workers pay income tax, everyone pays VAT on certain goods and companies pay tax on their profits.<br/>It could, in theory, cover all of its spending from taxes, and in some years that happens.<br/>But if it can't, it needs to either raise taxes, cut spending or borrow. <br/>Higher taxes mean people have less money to spend, so businesses make less profit, which can be bad for jobs and wages. Lower profits also mean companies pay less tax.<br/>So, governments often borrow to boost the economy. They also borrow to pay for big projects - such as new railways and roads - which it also hopes will help the economy.<br/>The government borrows money by selling financial products called bonds.<br/>A bond is a promise to pay money in the future. Most require the borrower to make regular interest payments over the bond's lifetime. <br/>UK government bonds - known as \"gilts\" - are normally considered very safe, with little risk the money will not be repaid.<br/>Gilts are mainly bought by financial institutions in the UK and abroad, such as pension funds, investment funds, banks and insurance companies. <br/>The Bank of England has also bought hundreds of billions of pounds' worth of government bonds in the past to support the economy, through a process called \"quantitative easing\".<br/>The amount the government borrows varies from month to month. <br/>When people submit tax returns In January, often paying a large chunk of their annual tax bill in one go, the government sees a jump in the amount of money it takes in. <br/>So it is more helpful to look at the whole year, or the year-to-date.<br/>In the 2022-23 financial year, the government borrowed \u00a3137.1bn. That was up by about 13% from the previous year.<br/>In April, the government borrowed \u00a325.6bn, which was the second-highest borrowing figure for April since records began in 1993.<br/>The total amount the government owes is called the national debt. It is currently just over \u00a32.5 trillion. <br/>That is roughly the same as the value of all the goods and services produced in the UK in a year, known as the gross domestic product, or GDP.<br/>That current level is more than double what was seen from the 1980s through to the financial crisis of 2008. <br/>The combination of the financial crash and the Covid pandemic pushed the UK's debt up from those historic lows to its current level.<br/>But in relation to the size of the economy, today's debt is still low compared with much of the last century, as shown above, and also compared with many leading advanced economies. <br/>The larger the national debt gets, the more interest the government has to pay. <br/>That extra cost was not as big when the interest rates due were low through the 2010s. But it is more noticeable now that interest rates have risen. <br/>Two months in 2022 saw record levels of money set aside for debt interest: \u00a320bn in June and \u00a318bn in December. The third largest amount came in April 2023, hitting \u00a39.8bn.<br/>During the last financial year, the government put aside \u00a3106.7bn on debt interest - more than it spends on education. <br/>Some economists fear the government is borrowing too much, at too great a cost.  <br/>Others argue extra borrowing helps the economy grow faster - generating more tax revenue in the long run.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>What does a billion pounds look like... and what can it buy?<br/>Most economists and politicians agree that debt cannot keep growing compared to the size of the economy forever, because at some point it becomes impossible to pay the interest.<br/>But there is debate about whether or how fast to cut borrowing. <br/>Growing the economy is another way to bring down the main measure of the total national debt: its size compared to GDP. <br/>Governments often increase borrowing when they face unusually difficult situations, such as the coronavirus pandemic, or the current cost-of-living crisis. <br/>Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has blamed the \"twin global emergencies of a pandemic and Putin's war in Ukraine\" for driving up government costs.<br/>He has said it is \"vital [that] we stick to our plan to reduce debt over the medium term\".<br/>Prime Minister Rishi Sunak also made reducing the national debt one of his five key promises.<br/>The deficit is the gap between the government's income and the amount it spends.<br/>When a government spends less than its income, it has what is known as a surplus. <br/>Debt is the total amount of money owed by the government that has built up over years. <br/>It rises when there is a deficit, and falls in those years when there is a surplus.  <br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

CGI said  it was more than 90% accurate during a test run.<br/>It's being trialled in what's known as the North Devon Biosphere Reserve, a 55-sq-mile (142-sq-km) protected area that includes important natural habitats as well as farmland and small towns. <br/>\"We'll give (the AI) the history,\" said CGI's chief sustainability officer Mattie Yeta. \"We'll give it all of the geographic information, as well as data sets from the sensors for it to learn and develop the predictive mechanisms to be able to inform where these incidents are occurring and indeed when they will take place.\"<br/>It's hoped the project could clean up the seaside resort town of Combe Martin, where the quality of bathing water has long been a concern. <br/>\"It's always been bumping along the bottom in terms of water quality,\" says Andy Bell from the North Devon Biosphere Reserve.<br/>Though the water at Combe Martin was last year rated by the Environment Agency as 'good', Mr Bell says that was mainly down to dry weather.  More typical years, he says, were 2018 and 2019 when it received a 'poor' rating, which meant a notice being posted advising people not to swim. <br/>\"There is very much a fear in the community of what would happen if the bathing water status was rescinded.\" Andy says <br/>\"It would impact on the cafes, the restaurants, the B&B's\u2026 people want to come to a clean place to enjoy themselves.\"<br/>The River Umber is the main culprit, according to Mr Bell. It reaches the sea through a corridor of lush green algae on the edge of the beach. The Umber is usually little more than a stream but it receives discharges both from a sewage treatment plant and agricultural runoff from farms. <br/>Cleaning up the Umber is seen as a first step towards improving the water quality on the beach and the key to that, according to the artificial intelligence project, is a huge amount of real-time information.  <br/>A couple of kilometres upstream from Combe Martin beach, a floating water sensor is being installed in the river. It's a square black box with solar panels on top and is moored by a cable to the bank. <br/>It automatically transmits a stream of data on six key indicators of water health including acidity (pH), ammonia, the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water and how clear the water is (turbidity).<br/>\"It's a really good overview of water quality,\" said Glyn Cotton, the chief executive of environment-focussed technology company Watr, which is supplying the \u00a32,000-a-go ($2,557) sensors to the project. <br/>\"If sewage was being discharged upstream we would see spikes in things like ammonia and pH and we can then cross-reference that with temperature and dissolved oxygen levels.\"<br/>About 50 connected sensors are being used across the catchment area, a mix of water, soil and rain gauges. Mapping company Ordnance Survey are providing the expertise to integrate that information with location specific data and satellite imagery. <br/>\"We can start training the model using data to get it understanding that when there was a pollution event - whether it was associated with a particular area?\" said Donna Lyndsay from Ordnance Survey. \"Was there for example a particular rainfall event that washed it all off?\"<br/>The hope is that the AI might, for example, advise a farmer to stop putting more fertiliser on his field, if the soil is dry and heavy rain forecast because of the likelihood of it being washed into the waterways. <br/>Preventing raw sewage being discharged by water treatment plants - a practice allowed when heavy rainfall overwhelms facilities -  is more complicated. The AI might see it coming after heavy rainfall but that doesn't mean the water company has the capacity to stopped it being released. <br/>The first phase of the AI project was a desk-based model using historic data, with CGI saying it predicted pollution events with 91.5% accuracy. Now the AI model is being unleashed 'in the wild' and the question is whether it can do the same.<br/>\"We're starting very small here (in North Devon) \u2026 but the idea is very much to scale up and roll this out to different parts of the UK.\" said CGI's Mattie Yeta. <br/>Artificial intelligence (AI) technology is developing fast, and transforming many aspects of life.

Europe, the Middle East, and the South Atlantic also saw significant increases in turbulence.<br/>Prof Williams said the increased turbulence was due to greater wind shear - or differences in wind speed - in the jet stream, a strong wind system blowing from west to east, about five to seven miles above the Earth's surface. It exists largely due to a difference in temperature between the world's equator and poles. <br/>While satellites can't see the turbulence, they can see the structure and the shape of the jet stream, allowing it to be analysed.<br/>Radar can pick up turbulence from storms, but clear-air turbulence is almost invisible and hard to detect. <br/>Turbulent flights are not only uncomfortable, but can also cause injuries for those on the flight. Severe turbulence is very rare, but clear-air turbulence can come out of the blue, when passengers are not belted in.<br/>\"Nobody should stop flying because they're afraid of turbulence, but it is sensible to keep your seat belt fastened all the time, unless you're moving around, which is what the pilots do,\" said Prof Williams. \"That is almost a guarantee that you will be safe even in the worst turbulence.\"<br/>There are also financial consequences. The aviation industry loses between $150m (\u00a3120m) and $500m (\u00a3400m) in the US alone annually due to effects of turbulence, including wear-and-tear on aircraft, said the researchers.

It takes years, if not decades, for that to come back again,\" explained trustee Howard Inns.  <br/>For countryside ranger Darren Hill, who supported firefighters tackling the blaze here, seeing the aftermath, and knowing more wildfires could be on their way, is hard to take.  <br/>\"To come back and see a site like this, and know I found this species over here and we had smooth snakes over there, it does take its toll,\" he said.<br/>Meanwhile, using a drone with thermal imaging to survey the site for hidden subterranean burns is Matt Oakley, a fire investigations officer for Surrey Fire and Rescue.<br/>He is one of the UK's national wildfire tactical advisors - a group of specialist officers who already have the skills learnt abroad and who will be training units.<br/>He says the kind of techniques he's seen used in hotspots as far-flung as France and South Africa will be vital in the UK in the years to come. <br/>\"Our climate is changing - it's changing beyond recognition,\" he explained. \"What used to be a nine to 12-year cycle, this is every year now. <br/>\"We are heading towards a northern Mediterranean climate in the southeast of England within the next decade and this will be business as usual day in, day out.\"<br/>Many of the wildfire-fighting methods being rolled out across the UK rely on a 'toolbox' of skills, from creating natural firebreaks and reducing the 'fuel-load' of vegetation to setting controlled burns deliberately around wildfires to stop their spread. <br/>Together they would reduce the need for huge amounts of water in a drought and reduce the number of appliances needed on site.<br/>But the Fire Brigades Union says new training and techniques are not enough to tackle the rising challenges of climate change. It says more crews are needed after years of cuts that have seen the loss of thousands of firefighters since 2010.<br/>Matt Wrack, the Fire Brigades Union's general secretary, called for more funding from the government, saying: \"Rising temperatures and the systematic underfunding of the fire and rescue service are a recipe for destruction.\"<br/>The government said it was giving fire and rescue authorities around \u00a32.6bn this year, and each authority was able to decide what it spent it on.<br/>A spokesperson said: \"The Home Office works closely with the National Fire Chiefs Council and England and Wales Wildfire Forum to continue to improve our response to wildfires and mitigate them.\"<br/>Warning of 'very high' wildfire risk for Scotland<br/>Caution urged over countryside fire risks<br/>Fire service warning over disposable barbecues<br/>Highland wildfire could be largest ever in UK<br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Experts say it will likely make 2024 the world's hottest year. <br/>They fear it will help push the world past a key 1.5C warming milestone.<br/>It will also affect world weather, potentially bringing drought to Australia, more rain to the southern US, and weakening India's monsoon.<br/>The event will likely last until next spring, after which its impacts will recede.<br/>For months, researchers have been increasingly confident that an El Ni\u00f1o event was set to emerge in the Pacific Ocean. <br/>\"It's ramping up now, there have been signs in our predictions for several months, but it's really looking like it will peak at the end of this year in terms of its intensity,\" said Adam Scaife, head of long-range predictions at the UK Met Office.<br/>\"A new record for global temperature next year is definitely plausible. It depends how big the El Ni\u00f1o turns out to be - a big El Ni\u00f1o at the end of this year, gives a high chance that we will have a new record, global temperature in 2024.\"<br/>This natural phenomenon is the most powerful fluctuation in the climate system anywhere on Earth.<br/>The El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation, or ENSO, as it is properly called, has three different phases: Hot, cold or neutral. <br/>The hot phase, called El Ni\u00f1o, occurs every two to seven years and sees warm waters come to the surface off the coast of South America and spread across the ocean pushing significant amounts of heat up into the atmosphere.<br/>Record warm years, including 2016, the world's hottest on record, usually happen the year after a powerful El Ni\u00f1o event.<br/>Weather agencies around the world use different criteria to decide when this hot phase is upon us. <br/>For scientists in the US, their definition requires the ocean to be 0.5C hotter than normal for a month, the atmosphere must be seen to be responding to this heat and there must be evidence the event is persisting.<br/>These conditions were met in the month of May. In a statement, US National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said that \"El Ni\u00f1o conditions are present\".<br/>\"This is a very weak signal. But we believe that we're starting to see these conditions and that they will continue to intensify,\" said Michelle L'Heureux, a scientist with NOAA.<br/>\"Our weekly value is actually 0.8C this past week, which is even stronger.\"<br/>The researchers believe this event has an 84% chance of exceeding moderate strength by the end of this year. <br/>They also say there's a one in four chance of this event exceeding 2C at its peak, which is getting into the territory of a \"super El Ni\u00f1o\".<br/>The impacts of the onset of El Ni\u00f1o will likely lag behind by a few months but will be felt all over the world. <br/>Researchers expect these will include drier weather conditions in Australia and parts of Asia, with potential weakening of the monsoon in India. Southern US states will likely be wetter in the coming winter. El Ni\u00f1o normally strengthens drought conditions in Africa.<br/>If experience is anything to go by, there will be a large human and economic cost to this oncoming weather event. <br/>The strong El Ni\u00f1o in 1997-98 cost over $5 trillion with around 23,000 deaths from storms and floods.<br/>There's also a strong likelihood that this year's version will push 2024 past 2016 as the world's hottest year.<br/>Global temperatures are currently hovering around 1.1C above the average in the period from 1850-1900.<br/>But an El Ni\u00f1o event could add up to 0.2C to that figure, pushing the world into uncharted temperature territory, and close to breaking the symbolic 1.5C guard rail, a key element of the Paris climate agreement.  <br/>Researchers recently said that breaking this limit temporarily was more likely than not in the next few years.<br/>\"We're actually likely to see global mean temperatures that might become more of a regular thing in five to ten year's time, so it does give us that sort of portal on the future.\" said Michelle L'Heureux.<br/>\"And I think that's why it's alarming to some people, because these are our new thresholds.

The science is complicated and human factors like how we manage land and forests also contribute.<br/>But scientists say that climate change is making weather conditions like heat and drought that lead to wildfires more likely.<br/>Robert Scheller, professor of forestry at North Carolina State University, says: \"The climate signal is very strong. We are seeing both a larger area burned, and more severe fires.\"<br/>Spring in Canada has been much warmer and drier than usual, creating a tinder-dry environment for these vast fires. <br/>In Halifax, in the eastern province of Nova Scotia, temperatures last week reached 33C, around 10 degrees higher than normal for the time of year.<br/>Parts of the country, including Alberta and Saskatchewan, have been in drought since 2020.<br/>\"The vegetation in the forests is exceptionally dry,\" says climate scientist Daniel Swain at UCLA, which has meant that a higher fraction of lightning strikes has resulted in forest fires. <br/>Experts link the high temperatures to record-breaking spring heat seen in other parts of the northern hemisphere, including Spain, Portugal, Morocco, Algeria and Siberia.<br/>Last year scientists concluded that high temperatures exacerbated by climate change made drought in the northern hemisphere more likely.<br/>Wildfires also contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, those gases that warm our atmosphere. <br/>Emissions from the Canada wildfires in May reached 54.8 million tonnes, which is more than double the past records for that month since estimates began in 2003, according to the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service.<br/>A storm system and swirling low-pressure weather has been pushing hazy, smoggy air into parts of Canada and the US, hundreds of miles away from fires.<br/>Those weather conditions may ease in the next few days, meaning the skies could begin to clear, but for areas closer to the fires, the smoke is likely to continue.<br/>The Canadian government says the risk of wildfires is expected to recede in Quebec and Ontario in July, but the potential is expected to expand next month into the Yukon in north-western Canada.<br/>And the heat and dry weather are projected to last throughout the summer, meaning the risk of fire is unlikely to decrease soon.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: BBC's weather team breaks down smoke from Canada wildfires<br/>Scientists predict wildfires will become more frequent and intense in future because of the combined effects of land use and climate change.<br/>But Prof Scheller says \"there will always be year-to-year variation\". <br/>While wildfire frequency varies from region to region, the number of acres burned by these conflagrations has risen notably in recent decades in North America.<br/>That trend is expected to continue for decades as climate change worsens, causing higher temperatures and drier conditions, says Prof Scheller.<br/>African leaders tour Kyiv after air raid alert<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Greece denies coastguard rope led to boat tragedy<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

The foetus inside was fully formed but stillborn and so did not hatch.<br/>The crocodile who laid the egg was obtained when she was two years old and was kept apart from other crocodiles for its entire life. Because of this, the park's scientific team contacted Belfast-born Dr Warren Booth, now working at Virginia Tech in the US.  He has been studying virgin births, known scientifically as parthenogenesis, for 11 years.<br/>Dr Booth analysed the foetus and found that it was more than 99.9 % genetically identical to its mother - confirming that it had no father.<br/>He told BBC News that he wasn't surprised by the discovery.<br/>''We see it in in sharks, birds, snakes and lizards and it is remarkably common and widespread''.<br/>He speculated that the reason that parthenogenesis has not been seen in crocodiles is because people have not been looking for instances of them.<br/>''There was a big increase in reports of parthenogenesis when people started keeping pet snakes. But your average reptile keeper doesn't keep a crocodile,\" he said.<br/>One theory is that it happens in species capable of parthenogenesis when numbers dwindle, and they are on the verge of extinction. And Dr Booth told BBC news that this may have happened to some species of dinosaurs when their numbers dwindled due to environmental changes.<br/>''The fact that the mechanism of parthenogenesis is the same in so many different species suggests that it is a very ancient trait that has been inherited throughout the ages.

Aimee's blood sugar levels also worsened and her blood fat levels - lipids - went up.<br/>This was a short-term study on just one set of twins, but the results highlight growing fears among some scientists about the possible impact of so-called ultra-processed foods on our health, which BBC Panorama has been investigating.<br/>Prof Tim Spector, is a professor of epidemiology at King's College London, who studies trends in disease and oversaw the test. <br/>He told BBC Panorama: \"In the last decade, the evidence has been slowly growing that ultra-processed food is harmful for us in ways we hadn't thought. <br/>\"We're talking about a whole variety of cancers, heart disease, strokes, dementia.\" <br/>The term ultra-processed foods - or UPF - was only coined 15 years ago but it makes up about half the things we now eat in the UK. <br/>From sliced brown bread to ready meals and ice cream, it is a group of foods made with varying - but often substantial - levels of industrial processing. Ingredients used, such as preservatives, artificial sweeteners and emulsifiers, do not typically feature in home cooking. <br/>\"Ultra-processed foods are among the most profitable foods companies can make,\" says Prof Marion Nestle, a food politics expert and professor of nutrition at New York University.<br/>As our consumption of ultra-processed foods go up - the UK is one of the biggest consumers per head in Europe - so have rates of diabetes and cancer.<br/>Some academics think the link is not coincidental. <br/>Ultra-Processed Food: A Recipe For Ill-Health?<br/>Ultra-processed convenience foods contain chemicals that UK regulators say are safe, but Panorama investigates emerging scientific evidence of a link between some of these chemicals and cancer, diabetes and strokes.<br/>Watch on BBC iPlayer now, or on BBC One at 20:00 BST on Monday 5 June (20:30 in Northern Ireland and 23:10 in Wales) <br/>In January, one of the most comprehensive studies on ultra-processed food - by Imperial College's School of Public Health - was published in The Lancet medical journal.  <br/>The study of 200,000 UK adults found that higher consumption of ultra-processed foods may be linked to an increased risk of developing cancer overall, and specifically ovarian and brain cancers. <br/>And, as of last month, the World Health Organization (WHO) is now cautioning against the long-term use of artificial sweeteners - citing potential health risks. <br/>It follows dozens of studies linking increasing consumption of UPF to increased risk of developing serious illnesses.<br/>But proving that specific ingredients cause human harm can be challenging - there are a range of other factors in our lifestyles that can cause these diseases. For example: lack of exercise, smoking or sugary diets.<br/>Common ultra-processed foods:<br/>The first investigations into mortality and consumption of ultra-processed food started in France at the University Sorbonne Paris Nord, as part of the ongoing study into the eating habits of 174,000 people.<br/>\"We have 24-hour dietary records during which they tell us all the foods, the beverages and so on, that they are eating,\" explains Dr Mathilde Touvier who heads up the study.<br/>The ongoing research has already published results showing UPF may drive an increased burden of cancer.<br/>More recently, they have been looking into the impact of one specific ingredient - emulsifiers - which act as a glue in ultra-processed foods to hold everything together.<br/>Emulsifiers are the Holy Grail for the food industry - they improve the appearance and texture of food, and help to extend the shelf life far beyond that of less-processed food.<br/>They're everywhere, in mayonnaise, chocolate, peanut butter, meat products. If you eat, you're likely to be consuming emulsifiers as part of your diet. <br/>BBC's Panorama was given exclusive access to Dr Touvier's early results.<br/>They are yet to be peer reviewed - a crucial verification step for scientific studies - but she said they are still concerning. <br/>\"We observed significant associations between emulsifier intake and increased risk of cancer overall - and breast cancer notably - but also with cardiovascular diseases,\" she says.<br/>This means that a pattern has been observed between consuming ultra-processed food and disease risk, but further research is needed.<br/>Despite the growing body of evidence, the UK's Food Standards Agency (FSA) - which regulates the food industry in England, Wales and Northern Ireland - has yet to issue any regulation restricting emulsifiers.<br/>When Panorama asked the FSA about the growing body of evidence that these additives could cause harm it said: \"We have not been presented with any evidence - by this programme or otherwise - of any specific emulsifiers which are believed to pose a risk to health.\"<br/>But the FSA said it planned to hold a public consultation. <br/>Could the food industry itself be playing a role in pushing back on regulation?<br/>The BBC Panorama team spent the past eight months investigating.<br/>\"Food companies are not public health agencies... their job is to sell products,\" food politics expert Prof Nestle told the BBC. <br/>She said the food industry has been known to fund research, sponsor experts and disparage existing studies to prevent regulation.<br/>The International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) is a body that receives funding from some of the world's largest food companies.<br/>It says its mission is to \"provide science that improves human health\" - but it has previously published studies globally undermining regulation and public guidance on healthy diets. In 2012, the European Food Safety Agency was so worried about potential conflicts of interest, it insisted anyone associated with ILSI either had to resign from the institute or leave the agency.  <br/>Prof Alan Boobis, emeritus professor at Imperial College London, is an unpaid director of ILSI Europe and a former vice president of its board of directors. But he also heads up a group of UK scientists, known as the Committee on Toxicity which provides advice on the risk of chemicals in food to the FSA.  <br/>More than half the members of the committee have recent links to the food or chemicals industries. And over the past 10 years, the committee hasn't supported a single restriction on the use of any chemical additive in our food. <br/>Prof Boobis told Panorama his advice wasn't slanted to favour industry, and he had always been \"totally committed to conducting and identifying the very best scientific research... whoever is funding it.\" <br/>The Food Standards Agency said it had a \"clear code of conduct\u2026 for declarations of interest\" and that it had \"no evidence\" bias has affected its decisions.<br/>ILSI said: \"[We] operate within a framework of the highest principles of scientific integrity.\" <br/>One of the most controversial additives in UPF is the sweetener aspartame. <br/>Two-hundred times sweeter than sugar, it has been heralded as a great low-calorie alternative - turning once unhealthy sugary drinks, ice cream and mousses into products marketed as \"healthy\".<br/>There have been questions about its potential harm over the past two decades.  <br/>Then, last month, the World Health Organization said, although the evidence is not conclusive, it was concerned that long-term use of sweeteners like aspartame may increase the risk of \"type 2 diabetes, heart diseases, and mortality\".   <br/>In 2013, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) decided - after looking at all the available evidence - that aspartame was safe. The UK's Food Standards Agency accepted this position. <br/>The Committee on Toxicity looked at a study into aspartame in 2013 and concluded that the results \"did not indicate any need for action to protect the health of the public\". <br/>Six years later, Prof Erik Millstone, emeritus professor of science policy at the University of Sussex, decided to review the same evidence considered by EFSA - to see who had funded the different studies.<br/>He discovered that 90% of the studies defending the sweetener were funded by large chemical corporations that manufacture and sell aspartame. <br/>And that all the studies suggesting that aspartame may cause harm were funded by non-commercial, independent sources.  <br/>A spokesperson for the Food and Drink Federation, a membership body for manufacturers, told the BBC that companies took \"the health of consumers, and safety of the food they produce, seriously - and adhere to the strict regulations\".<br/>A spokesperson for the International Sweeteners Association said: \"Low/no calorie sweeteners are safe to use, are amongst the most thoroughly researched ingredients in the world and have been approved by all major food safety bodies, including the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\"<br/>The FSA says it will look into WHO's ongoing assessment of aspartame. And the government says it is aware of the growing concerns around UPF and has ordered a review into the evidence on ultra-processed foods. <br/>Watch Panorama - Ultra-Processed Food: A Recipe For Ill-Health? - on BBC iPlayer and listen to 5Live listeners have their say with Nicky Campbell, Is ultra processed food okay?<br/>Ultra-processed food linked to early death<br/>African leaders tour Kyiv after air raid alert<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Greece denies coastguard rope led to boat tragedy<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Ordinary solar panels have a capacity of about 400W, so if you count both rooftops and solar farms, there could be as many as 2.5 billion solar panels.,\" says Dr Rong Deng, an expert in solar panel recycling at the University of New South Wales in Australia.<br/>According to the British government, there are tens of millions of solar panels in the UK. But the specialist infrastructure to scrap and recycle them is lacking.<br/>Energy experts are calling for urgent government action to prevent a looming global environmental disaster.<br/>\"It's going to be a waste mountain by 2050, unless we get recycling chains going now,\" says Ute Collier, deputy director of the International Renewable Energy Agency. <br/>\"We're producing more and more solar panels - which is great - but how are we going to deal with the waste?\" she asks.<br/>It is hoped a major step will be taken at the end of June, when the world's first factory dedicated to fully recycling solar panels officially opens in France. <br/>ROSI, the specialist solar recycling company which owns the facility, in the Alpine city of Grenoble, hopes eventually to be able to extract and re-use 99% of a unit's components. <br/>As well as recycling the glass fronts and aluminium frames, the new factory can recover nearly all of the precious materials contained within the panels, such as silver and copper, which are typically some of the hardest materials to extract. <br/>These rare materials can subsequently be recycled and reused to make new, more powerful, solar units.<br/>Conventional methods of recycling solar panels recover most of the aluminium and glass - but ROSI says the glass, in particular, is of relatively low-quality. <br/>The glass recovered using those methods can be used to create tiles, or in sandblasting - it can also be mixed with other materials to make asphalt - but it cannot be used in applications where high-grade glass is required, such as the production of new solar panels.  <br/>The new ROSI plant will open during a boom period for solar panel installations. <br/>The world's solar energy generation capacity grew by 22% in 2021. Around 13,000 photovoltaic (PV) solar panels are fitted in the UK every month - most of them on the roofs of private houses. <br/>In many cases, solar units become relatively uneconomical before they reach the end of their expected lifespan. New, more efficient designs evolve at regular intervals, meaning it can prove cheaper to replace solar panels that are only 10 or 15 years old with updated versions. <br/>If current growth trends are sustained, Ms Collier says, the volume of scrap solar panels could be huge.<br/>\"By 2030, we think we're going to have four million tonnes [of scrap] - which is still manageable - but by 2050, we could end up with more than 200 million tonnes globally.\"<br/>To put that into perspective, the world currently produces a total of 400 million tonnes of plastic every year. <br/>The reason there are so few facilities for recycling solar panels is because there has not been much waste to process and reuse until recently. <br/>The first generation of domestic solar panels is only now coming to the end of its usable life. With those units now approaching retirement, experts say urgent action is needed.<br/>\"Now is the time to think about this,\" says Ms Collier. <br/>France is already a leader among European nations when it comes to processing photovoltaic waste, says Nicolas Defrenne. His organisation, Soren, partners with ROSI and other firms, co-ordinating the decommissioning of solar panels all over France.<br/>\"The biggest one [we decommissioned] took three months,\" Mr Defrenne recalls. <br/>His team at Soren has been experimenting with different ways of recycling what they collect: \"We're throwing everything at the wall and seeing what sticks.\"<br/>At ROSI's high-tech plant in Grenoble, the solar panels are painstakingly taken apart to recover the precious materials inside - such as copper, silicon and silver.<br/>Each solar panel contains only tiny fragments of these precious materials and those fragments are so intertwined with other components that, until now, it has not been economically viable to separate them. <br/>But because they are so valuable, extracting those precious materials efficiently could be a game-changer, says Mr Defrenne. <br/>\"Over 60% of the value is contained in 3% of the weight of the solar panels,\" he says.<br/>The team at Soren are hopeful that, in the future, nearly three-quarters of the materials needed to make new solar panels - including silver - can be recovered from retired PV units and recycled - to help speed up production of new panels. <br/>Currently there is not enough silver available to build the millions of solar panels which will be required in the the transition from fossil fuels, says Mr Defrenne: \"You can see where you have a production bottleneck, it's silver.\" <br/>Meanwhile British scientists have been trying to develop similar technology to ROSI. <br/>Last year, researchers at the University of Leicester announced they had worked out how to extract silver from PV units using a form of saline. <br/>But so far, ROSI is the only company in its field to have scaled up its operation to industrial levels.<br/>Moreover, the technology is expensive. In Europe, importers or producers of solar panels are responsible for disposing of them when they become expendable.

It's a hard volcanic rock that is neither rare nor particularly remarkable. <br/>But through a process known as 'enhanced rock weathering' it could help to cool our overheating planet.<br/>UN scientists are now clear that reducing greenhouse gas emissions alone won't be enough to stop dangerous levels of warming. They say there will need to be some carbon dioxide removal - actively taking it out of the atmosphere. <br/>Planting trees is the most natural way of doing this but has its limitations; the CO2 that's captured is released when the wood rots or burns and there are limits to how widely trees can be planted. <br/>Direct Air Capture (DAC), meanwhile, mechanically sucks CO2 out of the atmosphere and stores it underground; it's permanent - but does it make sense to build such an energy intensive process when we're trying to wean ourselves off fossil fuels? <br/>Enhanced rock weathering lies somewhere in between the natural and the man-made. It takes the naturally occurring but very gradual weathering process and turbo-charges it to remove the carbon faster. <br/>I've come to a quarry just across the Firth of Forth from Edinburgh to see Jim, whose enhanced rock weathering company UNDO has just secured \u00a312m of new investment and is looking to scale up operations. <br/>Around us the black hillside is being steadily eaten away, scraped by enormous diggers to make concrete and asphalt for roads. The vibe is more post-nuclear apocalypse than saving the planet.<br/>But the tiny pieces of basalt rock that are left over are prized by Jim's company. They have a useful property - when they weather in the rain they remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.<br/>For millennia volcanic rocks and cliffs have been removing carbon slowly while weathering in the rain. Enhanced rock weathering uses tiny pieces to increase the amount of contact between the rain and rock and hence the amount of weathering and carbon removal. <br/>As a cliff, or piled up in the quarry, the basalt weathers very slowly. To maximise the carbon removal it needs to be spread across a greater area.<br/>And that's where local farmers come in, helping the planet while getting free fertilizer in return. As well as locking away carbon, the basalt has been shown in trials to improve both crop yields and the quality of grazing. <br/>Half an hour's drive from the quarry I watch it being scattered on a field. <br/>It requires no specialist equipment. A trailer is loaded with 20 tonnes of basalt before a tractor drags it up and down, a rotating wheel at the back scattering the tiny rocks. <br/>\"It's free of charge which is quite important to a farmer,\" John Logan tells me with a chuckle as the basalt is put on his field. He'd seen UNDO's trials on a neighbouring farm. <br/>\"It looks like it's going to make the grass better, so that can only be good for the cattle because they're eating better grass.\"<br/>Some experts worry that carbon removal techniques like this might distract people from the more urgent priority of cutting emissions and even be used as justification to continue living our carbon intensive lives.<br/>\"CO2 reduction has to come first,\" Jim tells me as we watch the tractor move up and down guided by GPS, \"but we also need to be developing these technologies that can do removal at scale. And the nice thing about what we're doing with enhanced rock weathering is it's permanent.\"<br/>The maths, it must be said, are daunting. UNDO's scientists calculate that four tonnes of basalt rocks are needed to capture one tonne of CO2. <br/>With a typical Brit's CO2 emissions estimated at about 7 tonnes a year that means each of us needs about thirty tonnes, or one and half trailer loads of basalt to be scattered annually just to break even. <br/>UNDO has plans to rapidly scale up over the next few years and has attracted some serious supporters. Microsoft has agreed to pay for 25,000 tonnes of basalt to be scattered on UK fields. As part of the deal Microsoft will also help audit the project and verify that it is working as intended. <br/>\"The essential chemistry of it makes sense,\" Dr Steve Smith, an expert in carbon removal from Oxford University, told me.   <br/>\"Measuring how much CO2 would be taken out and where that ultimately goes, is one of the key challenges, and there's no standardized system at the moment.\"<br/>Ultimately Dr Smith thinks the idea could end up just a standard part of the way land is farmed. <br/>\"It's something that can be folded into the way we use land at the moment and deliver a carbon removal benefit alongside other benefits in terms of the way we use land for food and crops,\" he says.  <br/>There are still many questions about just how scaleable it is. UNDO's projects uses by-product from the local quarry - but if this is massively expanded the energy and emissions it takes both to grind up the basalt and then transport and scatter it will need to be factored in.  <br/>\"At this point in time, there's no downside, It's a win win for everybody involved.\" Jim Mann tells me. <br/>This year UNDO is planning to spread 185,000 tonnes of basalt and hopes by 2025 to have removed a million tonnes of CO2. It's still a drop in the ocean compared to emissions. In 2022 its thought the world discharged about 37 billion  tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere. <br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Countries agreed to \"pursue efforts\" to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C under the 2015 Paris agreement.<br/>Going over 1.5C every year for a decade or two would see far greater impacts of warming, such as longer heatwaves, more intense storms and wildfires. <br/>But passing the level in one of the next few years would not mean that the Paris limit had been broken. Scientists say there is still time to restrict global warming by cutting emissions sharply.<br/>Since 2020 the World Meteorological Organisation has been giving an estimate of the chances of the world breaking the 1.5C threshold in any one year. <br/>Back then they predicted there was less than a 20% chance of breaking 1.5C in the five years ahead. <br/>By last year this had increased to 50%, and now it's jumped to 66%, which the scientists say means it's \"more likely than not.\"<br/>The figure is not a direct measure of the world's temperature but an indicator of how much or how little the Earth has warmed or cooled compared to the long term global average. <br/>Scientists use average temperature data from the period between 1850-1900 as a measure of how hot the world was before our modern reliance on coal, oil and gas. <br/>For decades they believed that if the world warmed by around 2C that would be the threshold of dangerous impacts - but in 2018 they significantly revised this estimate, showing that going past 1.5C would be calamitous for the world. <br/>Over the past few decades our overheating world has nudged the mercury up so that in 2016, the warmest on record, global temperatures were 1.28C above the pre-industrial figure. <br/>Now researchers say that figure is set to be smashed - they are 98% certain the high mark will be broken before 2027.<br/>And in the years between now and then they believe there's a very solid chance the 1.5C limit will be surpassed for the first time. <br/>\"We really are now within reach of a temporary exceedance of 1.5C for the annual mean temperature, and that's the first time in human history we've been that close,\" said Prof Adam Scaife, head of long range forecasts at the Met Office, who compile the data from weather and climate agencies around the world.<br/>\"I think that's perhaps the most stark and obvious and simplest statistic that we've got in the report,\" he told a news conference. <br/>The researchers stress that temperatures would have to stay at or above 1.5C for 20 years to be able to say the Paris agreement threshold had been passed. <br/>\"This report does not mean that we will permanently exceed the 1.5C level specified in the Paris Agreement which refers to long-term warming over many years,\" said WMO Secretary-General Prof. Petteri Taalas<br/>\"However, WMO is sounding the alarm that we will breach the 1.5C level on a temporary basis with increasing frequency,\" he said.<br/>There are two key elements - the first is the continuing high levels of carbon emissions from human activities that despite a fall during the pandemic are still going up. <br/>The second, critical part is the likely appearance of El Ni\u00f1o, a weather phenomenon with global implications. <br/>For the last three years the world has been experiencing a La Ni\u00f1a event which has dampened climate warming to some extent. <br/>This video can not be played<br/>El Ni\u00f1o: How does it affect global weather?<br/>But the extra heat that El Ni\u00f1o will bring to the surface of the Pacific will likely push the global temperature to a new high next year.<br/>However there is still uncertainty around the onset and scale of the event.<br/>\"It's worth noting that a lot of our forecasts that are being made now for the El Ni\u00f1o that we think is developing this winter, are showing pretty big amplitude,\" Prof Scaife told reporters. <br/>\"But to actually predict the magnitude, or a subsequent event within the five-year period, we can't give the exact dates of that beyond this one year ahead, so it could be in three or four years from now we get to two and a half degree El Ni\u00f1o and that might be the one that does it. \"<br/>The Arctic will experience warming at a greater level than many regions, with the temperature anomaly expected to be three times as large as the global figure over the next five northern hemisphere winters. <br/>Northern Europe including the UK will likely experience increased rainfall for the May to September period over the next five years, the report says.<br/>Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc.<br/>Unexplained ocean warming alarms scientists<br/>Wind is main source of electricity for first time<br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves -

Higher temperatures and rising sea levels will impact the youngest alive today far more than older generations. But the power to act is often still in the hands of older people, including parents.<br/>Big changes are difficult, especially when they involve other people. Where do you begin? For this year's Earth Day, we spoke to people who have successfully had tricky climate chats at home. Here are their top tips:<br/>Eating less meat is one of the best ways to reduce our impact on the planet, say scientists. <br/>Ilse, 17, lives in Brighton with her parents Antonia and Sally. They used to eat meat two or even three times a day. When Ilse was 13 she decided to do more about climate change and read that cutting out meat was a good start. <br/>Sally and Antonia were sceptical at first, worried about not getting enough protein or that Ilse was too young to make that decision.<br/>\"I was thinking, you're not doing the cooking. It's a big hassle for us,\" says Antonia, saying she worried about how to cook \"nice\" Chinese vegetarian meals. After a one-day-a-week trial, they quickly scaled up and after a year were totally meat-free. <br/>\"It was daunting at the beginning, but now it's really good. There's a million recipes out there,\" Antonia adds. Ilse jumps in to say her favourite now is vegetarian fajitas, and they cook a lot of roast vegetables or lasagne. <br/>Sally says that seeing the emotional impact of the topic on her daughter helped to persuade her it was the right thing for her family. \"It's actually seeing her really stick to that commitment, even though we knew that she liked the taste of meat. That made me stop and think,\" she explains. <br/>Ilse is part of Teach the Parent, a national campaign that encourages these conversations between generations. It was started by young people frustrated with the lack of international climate action and their feelings of powerlessness, says Melanie Kee from Students Organising for Sustainability UK who helps to run the project.<br/>Even if the first conversation goes badly, Ilse says keep going. \"Big lifestyle changes take time. If you bring it up every so often, it shapes people's attitudes in the long term.\"<br/>How we travel is a major source of carbon emissions, but switching from driving or flying can potentially limit family holidays and cost more.<br/>Phoebe L Hanson, a 21-year-old student from Stafford, persuaded her family to go to Cornwall instead of flying abroad. Facts are important but she advises focussing on the reasons why you care. <br/>\"Say something like, 'I'm really scared about my future, these are the reasons I want to do something',\" she suggests.  Her mum Tracy explains that as Phoebe got older, their relationship changed from Tracy explaining facts to her to meeting in the middle to share knowledge.<br/>Present a solution, not just a problem, Phoebe explains. \"Give them options for something fun or exciting.\" <br/>\"Saying 'let's do this thing instead' is really good way to communicate,\" she suggests.  <br/>She also says one answer to concerns about money is to discuss what type of world parents want children to inherit. \"People talk about how expensive trains are, but think about what the carbon emissions from taking a plane mean in the long term for us,\" she says.<br/>Radically reducing what we buy and throw away can improve our carbon footprint, but it can be time-consuming and difficult.<br/>Becky Little, who is 20 and a community carer in Worcester, persuaded her parents Rob and Ellen to reduce food waste and think more carefully about what they buy.<br/>\"Be well-informed about the things you want your family to start changing so they can see you care and have done some research,\" she says.<br/>Her parents were concerned about convenience but she focussed on the positive impacts. \"Explain why it will make their lives easier or cheaper,\" she suggests.<br/>\"Make connections with things they care about,\" she advises. Her family like to volunteer so they made meals using leftover food to donate to people in their local community.<br/>\"It's important to not go into it expecting them to change their whole lives. Small things can make a difference,\" she explains.<br/>Ilse, Phoebe and Becky all say that the conversations can be challenging at times but worth it. \"Taking action as an individual mean I've managed to feel a lot more in control of my future,\" Phoebe explains. <br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

But the world has already warmed by 1.1C and now experts say that it is likely to breach 1.5C in the 2030s, despite all the political speechmaking.<br/>\"It has always been clear in the IPCC and in climate science, that it's not very likely that we always will stay below 1.5C,\" said Dr Oliver Geden, from the German Institute for International and Security Affairs and a member of the report's core writing team.<br/>Dr Geden and his colleagues now argue that coming back down as quickly as possible after overshooting this mark is where the focus should be. <br/>Overshooting is risky, as the report acknowledges, because it might trip tipping points that can't be uncrossed, such as the melting of permafrost that would in turn release vast amounts of warming gases.  <br/>Coming back from overshooting will need expensive, unproven technology to pull CO2 from the air, something known as carbon capture.<br/>It also means that it's even more urgent to get as quickly as possible to net zero - where the amount of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere does not increase. Every increment of global warming and every year that goes by really matters. <br/>While the report doesn't definitively say it, there are some clear indications that there's no future for coal, oil and gas on a liveable planet.<br/>It highlights how renewable forms of energy such as wind and solar are now cheaper and that sticking with fossil fuels may be more expensive in many places than switching to low carbon systems.<br/>\"The message in terms of urgency, I think, is stop burning fossil fuels as fast as humanly possible,\" Dr Friederike Otto, one of the report's authors told BBC News.<br/>\"It is not because we are lacking some important piece of technology or some important knowledge. It is because so far, the sense of urgency has been lacking in the places where the important decisions are made.\"<br/>While it is easy to think that scientific reports on climate change are all about governments and energy policy, the IPCC has been moving to highlight the fact that the actions that people can take make by themselves make massive difference to the overall picture. <br/>\"We could cut 40 to 70% of projected 2050 emissions with end-use measures,\" said Kaisa Kosonen from Greenpeace, who was an observer at the IPCC approval session.<br/>This includes shifting to plant-based diets, avoiding flights, building more walkable and bikeable cities,\" she told BBC News. <br/>The report nudges governments towards reforming their transport, industry and energy systems so that making these low carbon choices becomes much easier and cheaper for individuals.<br/>It's amazing to think that the decisions we make around the world over the next seven years will echo down the centuries.<br/>The report warns that with sustained warming of between 2 and 3C, the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets will be lost \"almost completely and irreversibly\" over multiple millenia.<br/>Many other thresholds will be crossed at low levels of heating, impacting things like the world's glaciers. <br/>To stop this runaway train of warming, governments need to up their commitments before 2030, to reach net zero by 2050, in order to keep warming in or around 1.5C by 2100. <br/>\"I think our climate system, but also our social systems and our ecosystems, all show us that it's bloody urgent, so that we can still change the world to make it a better place for all of us,\" said Dr Otto.<br/>The real strength of the IPCC is that their reports are agreed with governments - and as such the reports are approved by their representatives in the presence of the scientists who research and write them.<br/>But the future of fossil fuels is becoming more and more a political question. <br/>Last November in Sharm el-Sheikh, a number of countries tried but failed to get the UN to agree to phase out oil and gas as well as coal. <br/>This argument is not going away - with the EU now openly supporting such a move.<br/>This new IPCC report will be central to it when countries meet again at COP28 in Dubai later this year. <br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

These targets are supposed to rapidly cut the greenhouse gas emissions that warm our planet's atmosphere.<br/>\"There is a rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future for all,\" the report states.<br/>Governments had previously agreed to act to avoid global temperature rise going above 1.5C. But the world has already warmed by 1.1C and now experts say that it is likely to breach 1.5C in the 2030s.<br/>The UK government responded that the report makes it clear that countries must \"work towards far more ambitious climate commitments\" ahead of the UN climate summit COP28 in November.<br/>\"The UK is a world leader in working towards net zero, but we need to go further and faster,\" a spokesperson said. <br/>Small islands in the Pacific are some of the countries expected to be worst hit by climate change. <br/>Responding to the report, the chair of the Alliance of Small Island States Fatumanava-o-Upolu III Dr. Pa'olelei Luteru said: \"While our people are being displaced from their homes and climate commitments go unmet, the fossil fuel industry is enjoying billions in profits. There can be no excuses for this continued lack of action.\" <br/>The report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change - the scientific body that advises the UN on rising temperatures - is agreed on by all governments involved.<br/>Their new study aims to boil down to one slim volume several landmark findings on the causes, impacts and solutions to climate change that have been released since 2018. <br/>It outlines the significant impacts that climate change is having on the world already, and explains that these will get much worse. <br/>By 2100 extreme coastal flooding that used to happen once-a-century is expected to occur at least annually in half of the world's tidal gauge locations - places where sea level recordings are made.<br/>Concentrations of the warming gas CO2 in the atmosphere are at their highest in 2 million years. The world is now warmer than at any time in the past 125,000 years - and will likely get warmer still over the next decade. <br/>\"Even in the near term, global warming is more likely than not to reach 1.5C even under the very low greenhouse gas scenario,\" the report states.<br/>\"If we aim for 1.5C and achieve 1.6C, that is still much much better than saying, it's too late, and we are doomed and I'm not even trying,\" Dr Friederike Otto, from Imperial College, a member of the core writing team for this report, told BBC News.<br/>\"And I think what this report shows very, very clearly is there is so much to win by trying.\"<br/>The synthesis shows that projected emissions of CO2 from existing fossil fuel infrastructure, such as oil wells and gas pipelines, would bust the remaining carbon budget - the amount of CO2 that can still be emitted - for staying under this key temperature threshold. <br/>And while not explicitly mentioning new projects like Willow oil in the US or the Cumbria coal mine in the UK, the scientists involved have few doubts about their impact. <br/>\"There's not a cut-off day (for fossil fuels), but it's clear that the fossil fuel infrastructure we already have will blow through that carbon budget,\" Dr Oliver Geden, from the German Institute for International and Security Affairs and a member of the report's core writing team, told BBC News.<br/>\"The remaining carbon budget in opening new fossil fuel infrastructure is certainly not compatible with the 1.5C target.\"<br/>The document argues strongly that going past 1.5C will not be the end of the world as this may only be a \"temporary overshoot\". <br/>The authors say that they are optimistic that dramatic changes can be achieved rapidly, pointing to the massive falls in the price of energy made from solar and wind. <br/>They also argue that changes driven by consumers in terms of diet, food waste and switching to low carbon transport can achieve significant cuts in emissions from many sectors. <br/>But the report also acknowledges that in addition to getting to net zero emissions as soon as possible, large scale use of carbon dioxide removal technology will be needed.<br/>Some observers have their doubts. \"We know what needs to happen, but the carbon removal part and carbon capture and storage ideas are a massive distraction,\" said Lili Fuhr, from the Centre for International Environmental Law, who attended the approval session.<br/>Responding to the report's call for more urgent action, the UN secretary general is calling for countries to bring forward their plans for net zero by a decade. <br/>\"Leaders of developed countries must commit to reaching net zero as close as possible to 2040, the limit they should all aim to respect,\" he said in a statement. He also calls on the likes of India and China who have announced net zero plans for beyond 2050 to try and bring them forward by a decade as well.<br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

You'll know in your heart when it's good.\"<br/>\"We try to be good first time,\" smiles singer Cristal Ramirez.<br/>The US quartet are recording their first ever session for BBC Radio 1, who've made their single, Always Get This Way, the station's tune of the week.<br/>There are a couple of false starts: A drum sample isn't firing and an autotune effect is misbehaving. Guitarist Katie Henderson commandeers a laptop from their sound engineer, swipes through two dozen menus and recalibrates the backing track. <br/>\"Autotune's hella scary when it goes wrong,\" she observes. <br/>But once they rip into their three-song set, there's no stopping them. Even when Cristal \"chokes on my own spit\" during the final chorus of Always Get This Way.<br/>Spirits are justifiably high: A couple of hours ago, they released their third album, I've Loved You For So Long, and the reviews are trickling in.<br/>\"Seven out of 10 from The Line Of Best Fit,\" announces their PR. \"Eight out of 10 from Clash.\"<br/>This prompts a brief, animated discussion about how publications arrive at their scores; and whether a seven is positive or merely average.<br/>\"In the end, I don't really care about reviews,\" concludes Cristal. \"But I want a 10.\"<br/>The release couldn't be any more different to their last record, Under My Influence, which dropped a couple of weeks into the first lockdown in 2020. <br/>At the time, the band were still confident they'd get to play those songs live when summer rolled around.<br/>\"We really were in denial for a while,\" laughs bassist McKenna Petty. \"We thought it would all be over soon.\"<br/>Instead, their plans were ripped out of their hands. The album was left in limbo. The pressure to build on the buzz surrounding their debut vanished, leaving bigger questions about their future. <br/>\"We were kind of mourning our career, not sure how that was gonna go,\" says Alisa Ramirez, the band's drummer and Cristal's younger sister. \"We went into a really dark place.\"<br/>Cristal started having panic attacks, knocking on her sister's door every night at 3am. Alisa would try to comfort her, making her oatmeal and talking her back to sleep.<br/>But her anxiety had deeper roots than the pandemic.<br/>All four Aces were brought up in Provo, a deeply religious town in the US state of Utah, about 45 minutes away from the headquarters of the Mormon church.<br/>\"If you're not familiar with Mormonism, it's just intense Christianity, really,\" says Cristal. \"But it's a way of life in Utah. It's the world you live in. We didn't know people that weren't Mormon in high school.\"<br/>The sisters, who were \"tomboys from the time we were little kids\", were \"constantly reminded we don't fit in,\" says Alisa. <br/>\"The culture is super homophobic, super patriarchal,\" agrees McKenna. \"There's a blueprint you're supposed to follow, as women especially, of getting married young, having a family, not having a career. <br/>\"Just for some context, Utah has the highest suicide rate among LGBTQ youth in the whole country. So it's a really big issue, how they isolate queer youth, especially.\"<br/>Cristal had her first crush on another girl in kindergarten but she squashed her feelings, believing they were sinful. She tried praying to be straight and dated boys in high school before coming out to her sister at the age of 18. <br/>Alisa didn't bat an eyelid before replying, \"Oh, same.\"<br/>As soon as they could, they disavowed Mormonism and fled Utah for Los Angeles. But though their bandmates supported them, they were still tied to the church.<br/>So when, in 2016. the sisters presented the band with a song called Loving Is Bible - a \"grand declaration\" that God is tolerant of all sexualities - it caused a certain amount of internal friction.<br/>\"That song almost didn't come out because it was really upsetting to Kenna and Katie,\" says Alisa.<br/>\"The church conditions you to be scared because your salvation is on the line,\" McKenna explains. \"I was really scared of what other people would think.\"<br/>Five years later, things have changed. Katie has also come out as queer and left the church. McKenna, the band's only straight member, also stepped away from Mormonism despite getting married in the LDS Temple in 2019.<br/>\"I really didn't have a good experience there [at the temple]. That was kind of the catalyst of me leaving.<br/>\"But my biggest issue was when the girls came out to me. I was like, 'This feels real and what the church is teaching doesn't. There's something wrong with the church.'\"<br/>I've Loved You For So Long is the first album The Aces have recorded where they're all on the same page. But it was only possible after the solitude of the pandemic forced them to confront their past.<br/>\"As sisters, it started clicking that we'd spent the last six years running away from our hometown and trying to not be associated with our upbringing,\" says Alisa. <br/>\"We were ashamed about it and embarrassed about it. It deeply affected our mental state and and it's still affecting us to this day.\"<br/>At first, Cristal was reluctant to share those feelings in her lyrics. <br/>\"I was like, 'I don't want to talk about that'. I want to go to studio and not talk about it because that's my whole existence, all the time, and it's miserable.\"<br/>The breakthrough came when they were working on, of all things, a sexually-charged pop song about lust at first sight. Originally called Don't Speak, Alisa texted her sister, suggesting she change the lyrics to \"don't freak\" and making it about her panic attacks.<br/>\"I was like, 'Wait, that's actually really cool',\" says the 27-year-old. \"And it opened up these big conversations about mental health and anxiety and identity.\"<br/>Don't Freak came out as a standalone single in 2021, but its confessional approach reverberates throughout The Aces' new album.<br/>\"Everything I love / I'm told I shouldn't touch / Cause good girls love Jesus / Not that girl from Phoenix,\" sings Cristal, reliving her childhood with justifiable anger on the punky Suburban Blues.<br/>I Always Get This Way was written as Cristal's mental health unravelled, addressing her guilt at \"falling apart\", and the way it affects her relationships.<br/>But the album ends with the gorgeously catchy jangle-pop of Younger, where the singer tells her 14-year-old self: \"I wouldn't change anything.\"<br/>\"When I was 14, I was in so much pain about my identity, about what my life was going to look like, but all I needed was someone to say 'You're okay and you're gonna figure it out',\" she says.<br/>United by their experiences, the band tear into their new songs with a fresh musical ferocity. <br/>The spiky guitars on Girls Make Me Wanna Die are a direct callback to their beginnings, playing Paramore covers in a neighbour's garage before they were even teenagers. Other tracks draw on The Cure and Depeche Mode, who they'd hear around the house growing up.<br/>Katie, the most reserved in conversation, is the band's musical backbone, playing funky, staccato guitar riffs on the poppy title track, and shimmering shoegazy lines on the more introspective Person.<br/>\"That's really what elevated our band, was when we added Katie,\" says McKenna. \"That's when everything got better.\"<br/>\"It's just so cool to watch her chase sounds, chase tones,\" agrees Cristal. \"She's such an amazing musician that we're always just like, 'Yeah, let's throw solo in there. She'll make the song better.'\"<br/>Unsure how to handle the praise, Katie whispers to herself: \"What is even happening?\"<br/>That camaraderie, that mutual love, is what makes The Aces unique. <br/>Most bands push their lead singer to the foreground, and Cristal could certainly dominate if she wanted to, but The Aces are a gang. <br/>At Maida Vale, they move as a pack, trading goofy jokes and dancing to their own songs, having previously forced their Uber driver to play the new album at full blast on the way over. (\"We'd better get a five-star passenger rating,\" laughs Cristal).<br/>\"It's scary to think where I'd be without this band,\" says Alisa.<br/>\"What brought us together was that intrinsic feeling of not belonging, and wanting to create something where we could hang out together and feel like we did belong.\"<br/>\"It's just been this incredible support system for our entire lives,\" agrees her sister. <br/>\"People ask us, 'How did you not break up?' and, to me, that's the craziest question because it didn't even feel like an option. <br/>\"It was just like, 'We are The Aces.

It has been such a labour of love.\" <br/>The Wall Street Journal quoted an Archewell spokeswoman as saying Meghan was \"continuing to develop more content for the Archetypes audience on another platform\".<br/>When the agreement with Spotify was first announced, it was billed as a relationship which would produce several series - but in the end, only one materialised. <br/>American media reports suggest the royal couple failed to meet the productivity benchmark required by Spotify, and therefore wouldn't be receiving the full value of the contract.<br/>Since splitting from the royal family, Harry and Meghan have looked to capitalise on their global fame in order to become financially independent.<br/>That has included a multi-million dollar content deal with Netflix, and Harry's huge contract with Penguin Books, which has already produced his autobiography Spare.<br/>It follows Spotify's announcement last week that it was cutting 200 jobs in its podcast division after a period of heavy investment in the medium, saying it was embarking on a \"strategic realignment\".<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Meghan: 'They were concerned how that would look for the institution'<br/>Is the 'have-a-go' podcaster era coming to an end?<br/>Where do Harry and Meghan get their money?<br/>Harry and Meghan dismiss South Park lawsuit rumour<br/>I want to stop hate towards Meghan, Harry tells court<br/>Harry surrounded by 'web of unlawful activity'<br/>African leaders tour Kyiv after air raid alert<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Greece denies coastguard rope led to boat tragedy<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Following their recent reunion, he said: \"It was as wonderful an experience this time as it was 50 years ago. I shall miss her.\"<br/>Other tributes were paid from across the worlds of the arts and politics.<br/>Labour MP Tulip Siddiq, who now sits in Jackson's former seat, tweeted: \"Devastated to hear that my predecessor Glenda Jackson has died.<br/>\"A formidable politician, an amazing actress and a very supportive mentor to me. Hampstead and Kilburn will miss you Glenda.\"<br/>Shadow culture secretary Lucy Powell, who worked for Jackson before becoming an MP herself, recalled the \"incredibly kind\" politician's \"cutting humour\" and \"general disdain at most things\".<br/>\"She was the definition of an icon, successfully spanning the world of acting and politics with great aplomb,\" Powell wrote.<br/>Broadcaster and former Conservative MP Gyles Brandreth said she was \"a wonderful actress, a committed politician [and] a remarkable human being\".<br/>\"We became MPs on the same day in 1992 & I treasure our unlikely friendship,\" he wrote. \"She was such a gifted, caring & special person who came into the world to make a difference - and did.\"<br/>A spokesman for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said it was \"extremely sad news\", adding: \"His thoughts will be with her friends and family at this time.\"<br/>TV presenter Carol Vorderman said: \"To see this unique woman turn into a firebrand in politics was deeply impressive for young girls like me. May she rest in peace.\"<br/>Jackson began acting after joining an amateur dramatics group as a teen while working in Boots near her tome town of Birkenhead in Merseyside.<br/>She won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts (Rada) in London, and joined the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) in 1963.<br/>After making her name on stage, she won her first Oscar for playing a headstrong artist in director Ken Russell's film of DH Lawrence's novel Women in Love.<br/>Her second Academy Award came three years later for A Touch of Class, a romantic comedy in which she played a fashion designer caught up in a catastrophic love affair with a US businessman. <br/>She did not attend either ceremony, though, saying she was busy.<br/>\"All awards are very nice to have,\" she told BBC Radio 4's This Cultural Life last year. \"But they don't make you any better.\"<br/>The role in A Touch of Class came about after she famously showed off her comedy skills in a guest appearance as Cleopatra on Eric Morecambe and Ernie Wise's hit Saturday night TV show.<br/>\"I've always said, and I mean it, they were the apotheosis of my career, working with them,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs.<br/>She also played the Egyptian queen - more seriously - on stage in Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra for the RSC.<br/>Sir Jonathan, who was also in that production, told BBC Radio Wales: \"Everyone will talk about her tremendous strength and courage and intelligence, [and] her wit.<br/>\"I worked with her twice in the 70s, and she was always direct, always honest. And, like the greatest art, her work was simple and uncluttered.\"<br/>In its tribute, the RSC described her as \"a tour de force in acting and politics, dedicating her life to both\".<br/>The company added: \"We're proud her extraordinary talent was seen on RSC stages early in her career in ground-breaking productions.\"<br/>Jackson played Elizabeth I in BBC drama Elizabeth R - another role she famously revisited - winning Emmys for both Elizabeth R and also playing the queen opposite Dame Vanessa Redgrave in 1971 film Mary, Queen of Scots.<br/>Further Oscar nominations came her way for portraying a frustrated office worker in a love triangle in 1971's Sunday Bloody Sunday, and for taking the title role in 1975's Hedda, adapted from Henrik Ibsen's Hedda Gabler.<br/>Labour MP Chris Bryant, who wrote a biography of Jackson in 1999, told BBC Radio 4's The World At One: \"She had such versatility.<br/>\"It's the quality of the work, and the variety. Her voice could go to gravel to caramel in three seconds.\"<br/>Former Labour MP Baroness Hoey told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"When she came into Parliament, she was so modest. She never wanted to be reminded that she was an actress.\"<br/>Other credits included playing English poet Stevie Smith in Stevie, and as Hollywood icon Patricia Neal in The Patricia Neal Story.<br/>A staunch Labour supporter, she was approached to stand for Parliament - and said she agreed because she disliked former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and the \"destruction that her policies has had on human beings\".<br/>There was a link between acting and politics, she said.<br/>\"The best theatre is about trying to find and tell the truth,\" she told Desert Island Discs. \"It's not about covering up. It's not about playing games. It's not about hiding. It's not about pretending you're something you're not.<br/>\"It's trying to find what it is to be a human being and why we behave towards each other in the ways that we do.

Sounds a bit naff and likely very cheesy, one strictly for the fans. <br/>\"Dismiss Greatest Days though and you'll be missing out on one of 2023's biggest movie surprises... It's a wholesome celebration of friendship, tinged with heartbreak, that ultimately proves to be a crowdpleaser.\"<br/>Greatest Days is directed by Coky Giedroyc and written by Tim Firth, who has adapted his own stage musical, originally titled The Band.<br/>Bea plays Rachel, a hardworking NHS nurse who was a huge fan of Take That in her teens, along with her four best friends from school.<br/>When she wins tickets to see the group on their reunion tour in Athens, she reunites her old group, some of whom have not seen each other for 25 years. <br/>The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw said: \"A jukebox musical featuring the works of Take That might not ever be one for the cool kids; undoubtedly this is a bit broad.<br/>\"But it's a splurge of feelgood from director Coky Giedroyc and screenwriter Tim Firth, adapting his own stage show, and it's at least as enjoyable as the much-hyped Mamma Mia! movies.\"<br/>The film features many of Take That's biggest hits, including Shine, Never Forget, Patience, Back For Good and Rule the World.<br/>However, the group are only referred to as \"The Boys\" in the film, rather than their real-life name.<br/>In a three-star review, Terry Staunton of the Radio Times said: \"At its root, director Coky Giedroyc's feel-good fare is a tale of everyday, ordinary women taking stock of their lives and pondering what the future holds.<br/>\"This being a film with the music of Take That at its foundation, viewers are guaranteed a succession of bangers; familiar and enduring hits whose anthemic qualities made them shoo-ins for a fresh lease of life on the West End stage in the first place.\"<br/>Total Film's Tom Dawson wrote: \"Giedroyc doesn't ignore life's inevitable sadnesses - along the way there are unexpected bereavements, family rifts, unfulfilled youthful dreams\u2026 It's the uplift that sticks, though.\"<br/>There was praise for the cast from Smooth Radio's Tom Eames, who said: \"Aisling Bea proves she can lead a film with charm and relatability, while there are standout 'watch this space' performances from up-and-comers Eliza Dobson and Jessie Mae Alonzo.\"<br/>Greatest Days is released in the UK on Friday, following its London premiere on Thursday evening. It received its first screening at the Cannes Film Festival last month.<br/>\"It may be fuelled by the schmaltzy lyrics of a boy band, but this is ultimately a clear-eyed celebration of female friendship,\" said Screen Daily's Nikki Baughan.<br/>\"Aisling Bea brings a sharp wit (and essential levity) to the central character of Rachel; now a mid-40s no-nonsense children's ward nurse but, back in 1993, a 16-year-old school girl (played, in excellent casting, by Bea lookalike Lara McDonnell) and diehard fan of a boyband only ever referred to as 'The Boys'.<br/>\"Underneath the '90s vibes, colourful production design and occasionally cringey boyband lyrics, that's a deep-rooted sentiment that we can all take to heart.\"<br/>Not everybody was a fan, however. The Telegraph's Robbie Collin awarded only two stars and said: This jukebox musical is unlikely to relight your fire.<br/>\"Far too much of it still feels scaled to the stage,\" he said. \"Comic material that in a theatre might have simply played as broad comes across as forehead-smashingly crass.\"<br/>Empire's Olly Richards also gave the film two stars, writing: \"The film can't find its rhythm... it's tonally all over the place.<br/>\"It does at least finish on a high, with a big shouty Never Forget. But you probably will forget quite quickly, regardless.\"<br/>There was a more positive review from The Independent's Clarisse Loughrey, who said: \"It's well-performed and efficiently emotive. Just like the music of Take That, I guess.\"<br/>But, she added: \"Much like a classic Take That track, this is a film that cares much more for the display of emotion than it does its root cause - the second it dares get specific, it risks losing that wide-scale relatability.\"<br/>Yahoo's Roxy Simons said: \"As far as musicals go, Greatest Days is an enjoyable caper thanks to its fun reinterpretations of Take That's songs, like the airport-based rendition of Shine that features stylish choreography and elaborate costumes <br/>\"Some songs feel perfectly suited for the scene they're used in, but there are others that feel as if they were added on just as a way to make sure fan favourites weren't missed off the list.

In total, more than 60 women have made allegations against him.<br/>Some of those involved in the latest lawsuit have previously made public accusations against him.

I just soaked in this landscape.\"<br/>For the first seven series of the TV series, the lead detective was DI Jimmy Perez, played by Douglas Henshall, but the Glasgow-born actor quit the role last year.   <br/>In the new series, currently being filmed, Jensen plays DI Ruth Calder, a native Shetlander who reluctantly returns to the isles after 20 years working for the Met Police in London.<br/>The 53-year-old, who was born in Annan in Dumfriesshire, got her big break when she starred alongside Ricky Gervais in Extras in 2005.<br/>She went on to appear regularly in US TV series Ugly Betty before returning to the UK with roles in shows such as Agatha Raisin and Catastrophe.<br/>In 2019 she reunited with Gervais in the Netflix comedy series After Life.<br/>She says taking over from Henshall on Shetland is \"big boots to fill\".  <br/>\"I almost can't think about it too much because I would get the fear,\" she says.<br/>\"I've tried to look at it as a new project for me and its a new world because people predominately know me for a lot of comedy that I've done.\"<br/>Long-term fans of the show have become accustomed to DI Perez's famous peacoat.<br/>So what has Jensen's DI Calder picked for Shetland's wintry weather? <br/>\"I think it's important for TV detectives to have what I call a silhouette,\" she says, referencing both Henshall and the main character in the TV detective series Vera, which is also written by Ann Cleeves.<br/>\"You can see Vera in a shadow in a silhouette miles away and you know it was her,\" Jensen says. <br/>She says DI Calder has returned to Shetland from London so she is very urban. <br/>\"She's very much more sophisticated than the weather here would allow,\" Jensen says. <br/>\"There's a lot more cashmere involved because I said to my costume designer I'm a wee bit feeble in the cold.<br/>\"So at the moment there's lots of cashmere and it's quite long and sleek.\"<br/>While Jensen replaces Henshall in her new role, Shetland favourite Alison O'Donnell, who plays DI Alison \"Tosh\" McIntosh, remains a mainstay.<br/>Jensen says the two of them \"get on like a house on fire\" and are like \"two naughty school girls\".<br/>She says both actresses are very small and they find it amusing to arrest lots of 6ft tall men.<br/>The last series of Shetland averaged 7.2 million viewers in the UK and it is popular around the world. <br/>Since it first aired in 2013 thousands of tourists, many from cruise ships, have been to Shetland on the trail of the murders and to see Jimmy Perez's fictional home at the Lodberries in Lerwick.<br/>Shirley Mey, from Florida, is a big fan and says she loved seeing the area. <br/>\"I think when they shoot things here they do as much exteriors on site and that's what I really like about it,\" she says. <br/>\"We'll miss Jimmy Perez, but I'm glad it will continue.\"          <br/>Richard and Elizabeth Eastwick, from New Jersey, also enjoy the crime drama. <br/>\"Jimmy Perez embodies the role so well that it's going to be hard to adapt to somebody else doing it,\" Richard says.<br/>\"We always have to guess who the villain is. I'm always wrong.\"<br/>Visit Scotland's manager for Shetland, Steve Mathieson, says the impact has been fantastic for tourism. <br/>He says surveys show 38% of leisure tourists who visit were influenced  by a TV series and 87% of that figure said it was the Shetland series.<br/>So does Jensen think there will be a ninth series?<br/>She says: \"I would certainly come back, but I've got to get some more Shetland jumpers.\"<br/>Shetland series eight will air on BBC One later in the year.   <br/>Shetland announces Ashley Jensen as new lead<br/>Douglas Henshall to quit role in Shetland<br/>African leaders tour Kyiv after air raid alert<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Greece denies coastguard rope led to boat tragedy<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

I'm not sure which is the greater crime.\"  <br/>The large exhibition also includes a detailed model explaining exactly how Banksy managed to shred his Girl With Balloon painting during an auction at Sotheby's in London in 2018.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>The anonymous artist uploaded a video of the destruction onto Instagram but soon deleted the post<br/>The work had just been auctioned for \u00a31m, when an alarm went off inside the frame and the picture dropped into a hidden shredder. A malfunction meant that the destruction stopped just over halfway.<br/>Banksy declared that it was now a new piece of work titled Love Is In The Bin and three years later the original buyer sold it for more than 20 times what they had paid for it. <br/>Other exhibits include the Union Flag stab vest worn by Stormzy when he headlined Glastonbury in 2019 and pieces previously only seen in Bethlehem in the West Bank, including a pillow fight between an Israeli soldier and a Palestinian citizen.<br/>The artist's most recent solo show was 2009's Banksy versus Bristol Museum, which included a burnt-out ice cream van in the main entrance hall, playing out spooky sounds as a giant ice cream melted on its roof.<br/>Banksy has held an exhibition in Glasgow before. He was a relative unknown when in 2001 he jointly put on Peace Is Tough at The Arches venue, with Jamie Reid, famous for his design work with The Sex Pistols.<br/>The event is described as having been poorly attended but did feature early works including Monkey Queen. <br/>He also created a number of stencil-based works around the city, none of which still exist. <br/>The announcement for Banksy's new show says that \"the artist has been plagued by a number of unsanctioned global exhibitions in recent years\", a reference to events such as The Art of Banksy, which are completely unauthorised.<br/>The Art of Banksy, which returns to London in September, describes itself as \"the world's largest collection of original and authenticated Banksy artworks\" and states that is has had 1.5 million visitors around the globe. <br/>In a statement Banksy jokes: \"While the unauthorised Banksy shows might look like sweepings from my studio floor, CUT & RUN really is the actual sweepings from my studio floor.\"<br/>There is a reason why the exhibition is being held at Glasgow's Gallery of Modern Art. <br/>In a sign welcoming people to the venue, Banksy explains that he brought the show here because his \"favourite work of art in the UK\" is right outside. <br/>He writes: \"For anyone who isn't aware - the statue out the front has had a cone on its head continuously for the past 40 odd years. Despite the best efforts of the council and the police, every time one is removed another takes its place.\"<br/>Banksy is referring to the 1844 statue of the first Duke of Wellington sitting on a horse. <br/>Members of the public have been placing road cones on the statue's head for more than four decades, making it a Glasgow institution, one which featured in the Commonwealth Games opening ceremony when Glasgow hosted the event in 2014. <br/>The Lonely Planet travel guide once included it in a list of the Top 10 most bizarre monuments on earth. <br/>Now that road cone has brought Banksy back to Glasgow. <br/>CUT & RUN is on until 28th August and at weekends will stay open all night. There are plans for the exhibition to tour.   <br/>The traffic-coned statue that inspired Banksy<br/>Who is the mysterious artist Banksy?<br/>'We pulled down Banksy's drone with a fishing net'<br/>Banksy exhibition in Glasgow<br/>Auchinleck knife victim scarred for life after 'feud going back years', court told<br/>Property: Stunning villa for sale in Helensburgh<br/>Emergency teams in Drumchapel after fire hydrants targeted by vandals<br/>Work begins on 48 new homes after 'high demand'<br/>Inverclyde weather forecast: Met Office predicts change this weekend<br/>Details of coronavirus booster drop-in clinic being held in Inverclyde<br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Rupert Murdoch shut down the 168-year-old paper.<br/>In 2012, the Leveson Inquiry looked into the culture, practices and ethics of the press and published its recommendations.<br/>But that was more than a decade ago. Done and dusted, you might have imagined.<br/>Prince Harry has dragged the issue back into the spotlight. Perhaps only he has the celebrity, the drive - and the funds - to take on the tabloids.<br/>A new BBC documentary, Scandalous: Phone Hacking on Trial, offers up some context to his quest. And it suggests there are still some uncomfortable - and unanswered - questions for the British media.<br/>Actress Sienna Miller has spoken for the first time in depth and on camera about her experiences as part of the documentary.<br/>She settled a case with the Sun over phone hacking in 2021. News Group paid her a significant sum of money but made no admission of liability regarding what she alleged took place at the newspaper.<br/>At the time, she stood outside the Rolls Building of the High Court - the same court in which Prince Harry has been pursuing his case against Mirror Group in recent weeks - and said she had wanted to go to trial but didn't have \"countless millions\".<br/>People old enough to remember the early 2000s may have a hazy memory of the reports in question - an up-and-coming actress who was endlessly in the papers. Perhaps the least charitable will have viewed her as a wannabe who used a romantic relationship with a famous star to court fame.<br/>Her descriptions force us to question those assumptions.<br/>In a powerful and emotional interview, Miller tells the BBC: \"It was completely crazy, the number of stories that were coming out. And the number of accurate stories that were appearing in the press was baffling.\"<br/>Catapulted on to the front pages by a relationship with actor Jude Law, when he cheated on her with his children's nanny - who sold her story - it was all over the papers. Miller then discovered she was pregnant. That too was reported in the UK, having appeared first in a US publication. It made her decision whether or not to terminate the pregnancy horrendously public.  <br/>\"I remember one photographer saying, 'Have you had your tits done to keep him?' And obviously I was pregnant\u2026 it was just awful,\" she said.<br/>\"I felt somebody must be selling stories. And I sat down the five people in our lives who knew and interrogated them violently. I was under such intense pressure.<br/>\"I remember my doctor's office phoning me and saying, 'We've sent the records that you'd asked for'. And me saying, 'I didn't ask for any records'.\"<br/>Miller's court case brought to light payments by the Sun to private investigators, such as \u00a3250 on 21 July 2005 for \"Sienna phone inquiries\". Or \u00a3950 on 3 August 2005 for \"Sienn's [sic] Miller pregnant research\".<br/>Dan Waddell, a paralegal involved in pursuing cases against News Group, tells the BBC he believes these are indicative of phone hacking and other unlawful information gathering, including blagging private information to discover her pregnancy.<br/>News Group also told the BBC it does not accept Miller's version of events, which it says is not borne out by evidence. It says it is limited in the response it can give while litigation is ongoing.<br/>The private investigator that allegedly accessed Miller's medical records denies \"blagging\" the doctor's office.<br/>News Group Newspapers, which owned the News of the World, has reportedly paid out hundreds of millions of pounds in costs and damages to settle phone hacking cases in recent years.<br/>The vast majority relate to the News of the World. News Group has never admitted that phone hacking ever took place at its daily tabloid, the Sun. But can we be sure it didn't?<br/>It has settled Sun-only claims - without admissions of liability - with Miller and at least five others. Former Liberal Democrat MP Simon Hughes and former footballer Paul Gascoigne were among the first.  <br/>Neil Wallis, who's worked in senior editorial positions at the Sun and News of the World, as well as its rival the Sunday People, says claims for civil damages are \"an industry\".<br/>He tells the programme: \"The main newspaper groups are caught between a rock and a hard place. If you spend \u00a31m on fighting that case, if you can settle it for \u00a3100,000 I'm afraid it's a no-brainer. It's cheaper to settle than to fight for the truth.\"<br/>He calls it a \"legal scandal\".<br/>Within the last year, News Group has also reached Sun-only settlements, again without any admission of liability, with jockey Kieren Fallon and two people who aren't celebrities: London 7/7 bombing survivor John Tulloch, and Patricia Bernal.  <br/>Bernal's daughter Clare was shot dead in 2005 by a man with whom she had had a three-week relationship. Five years after the murder, the police told Bernal the News of the World had hacked her phone and Clare's.<br/>Bernal tells the programme: \"It's quite unbelievable that individuals could go to such lengths at a time when a family is so grief stricken.\"<br/>There's also an interview with Glenn Mulcaire, the private investigator who went to prison in 2007 for phone hacking at the News of the World.<br/>Mulcaire tells the BBC that the interview has been a \"long time coming\". Some will view the statements of a convicted hacker as tainted. For the first time on camera, Mulcaire admits he also hacked for the Sun. <br/>He says: \"I listened to Heather Mills' voicemails for The Sun. I hacked not only the target, which in this case would be Heather Mills, but also friends and family and associates, so they could get access to material from voice messages left by Heather.\"<br/>News Group has told the BBC it denies it asked Mulcaire to hack for the Sun. It paid Mills a significant sum in 2019 to settle her claim ahead of a trial, admitting Mulcaire hacked for the News of the World.  <br/>It made no admissions over hacking for the Sun. <br/>We learned from Prince Harry's recent case against Mirror Group that it has paid out \u00a3100m in costs and damages to settle 600 claims of phone hacking since 2015.<br/>That was after a judge in a previous civil case ruled that interception of voicemails was widespread at its papers for a decade.<br/>MGN says: \"Where historical wrongdoing has taken place, we have made admissions, take full responsibility and apologise unreservedly, but we will vigorously defend against allegations of wrongdoing where our journalists acted lawfully.<br/>\"MGN is now part of a very different company. We are committed to acting with integrity and our objective in this trial is to allow both the business and our journalists to move forward from events that took place many years ago.\"<br/>Actress Shobna Gulati, best known for Dinnerladies and Coronation Street, was one of those who sued MGN in 2015.<br/>When you watch her interview for the new programme, you realise the impact of what happened to her - even now.<br/>A single mum, she describes how she could \"never figure out\" how the paparazzi knew where she was going to be. It led to rows with boyfriends as her relationships \"became fodder\" and fears those closest to her were selling stories.<br/>Gulati says she had hoped to find a partner and have some more children.  <br/>\"That hasn't happened because I've missed those years. I've missed those years because it was all very tumultuous, filled with paranoia and anxiety and mistrust, and you can't form relationships like that.\"<br/>It took many months to persuade people whose phones had been hacked to take part in the programme. As Miller puts it: \"The whole point of fighting these newspapers is because I was so keen to have my privacy. I feel a sense of duty to expose them as they have exposed us.\"<br/>It was a dark chapter in media history. It was also a very different time - when the tabloids were all powerful, when the right to some privacy was an afterthought, when the prejudices expressed in many newspapers were commonplace.  <br/>One of the most shocking things to watch out for are the headlines used when Simon Hughes was outed as bisexual. \"Limp Dem confesses.\" \"Another one bites the pillow.\" Terms that would never be used these days.<br/>Some argue that campaigners, many of them previously involved in Hacked Off, are using the legal system to have a go at the tabloids. They say there are conflicts of interest, not least that some stand to gain financially every time a case is successfully put through the courts. Other witnesses, they point out, are themselves convicted criminals.<br/>Wallis spent four years on bail as part of Operation Weeting, the Metropolitan Police investigation into phone hacking, before the charges were dropped.  <br/>He says what's happening is a \"campaign against journalism\", which could force parts of the British media out of business.<br/>\"You have just about anybody who's ever appeared in a tabloid newspaper saying, 'Give me large wodges of cash please'.\"<br/>Others believe the final reckoning is still unfolding.  <br/>In an alternative reality, perhaps Prince Harry would have married Chelsy Davy years ago and got on with royal life.<br/>Instead, he's leading the charge to bring about reform of the press.

But Jackson was not easily flattered.<br/>Famously prickly, her view of Tinseltown often bordered on contempt. \"If I'm too strong for some people,\" she said, \"that's their problem\".<br/>And, at the height of her acting power, she gave it all up for a career in politics.<br/>Glenda May Jackson was born on 9 May 1936 in Birkenhead, in Wirral, the daughter of a bricklayer. <br/>She attended the local grammar school, leaving at 16 to work at Boots.<br/>Bored, she joined a YMCA drama group. \"I had no real ambition about acting,\" she later recalled.  \"But I knew there had to be something better than the bloody chemist's shop.\"<br/>Two years later, she won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA).<br/>It was, according to one reviewer, her \"intense, sexually-charged talent\" that won her a place at the prestigious academy.<br/>She made an impression while still at RADA, when she appeared in a production of Terence Rattigan's Separate Tables. <br/>She followed this up with the traditional actor's apprenticeship, doing six years in rep.  She also had a small role in the 1963 film, This Sporting Life.<br/>By this time she had married actor and art dealer Roy Hodges. The couple had a son, Dan, who is a noted political commentator. <br/>She joined the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) in 1964. A year later, her big breakthrough came in Peter Brook's stage production of Marat/Sade.<br/>Jackson played the lunatic asylum inmate who finds herself acting the role of Charlotte Corday, the assassin of the French revolutionary, Jean Marat.<br/>David Edgar described her performance as that of a \"waif-like narcoleptic unable to control her behaviour, but also - completely believably - the differently-mad person playing Corday\".<br/>Jackson transferred with the production to Broadway and, in 1967, appeared in a film version - also directed by Brook.<br/>In 1969, she won her first Oscar, for best actress, in Ken Russell's adaptation of the DH Lawrence novel, Women in Love.<br/>The beautifully shot film became notorious for its nude scenes which, Jackson later recalled, she played with \"a prevailing sense of coldness\".  <br/>Her co-star Oliver Reed - hardly a shrinking violet himself - memorably described acting alongside her as like \"being run over by a Bedford truck\".<br/>The movie sparked Jackson's admiration for director Russell. Russell reciprocated, casting her in The Music Lovers, his biopic of Tchaikovsky.<br/>The film, which revolved around the relationship between the homosexual composer and his nymphomaniac wife - played by Jackson - was not a commercial success. <br/>But, according to one critic, the film was worth watching \"thanks largely to a powerhouse performance by Glenda Jackson, one actress who can hold her own against Russell's excess\".<br/>In 1971, having appeared as Elizabeth I in the historically dubious film, Mary, Queen of Scots, she reprised the role in BBC TV's Elizabeth R.<br/>The six-part series saw her play the Virgin Queen from princess to ailing old woman.  <br/>Jackson played the part with her customary intensity, even shaving her hair to accommodate the make-up required as her character aged.<br/>She was now firmly established as one of the world's foremost dramatic actresses.  She responded by sending herself up.<br/>One interviewer described her as \"so defiantly charmless that there is something oddly engaging about her, even vulnerable\".<br/>\"As for her sense of humour,\" they went on, \"it's by no means non-existent, but you often need long tweezers to find it.\"  But that did not mean she lacked comic timing.<br/>In 1971, she made her first appearance on the Morecambe and Wise Show - playing a comedy Cleopatra.  <br/>\"All men are fools,\" she declared with a flourish, \"and what makes them so is not having beauty like what I have got.\"  The audience loved it, and Hollywood took note.<br/>Soon she found herself cast opposite George Segal in a romantic comedy, A Touch of Class.  <br/>Jackson plays a British divorcee who has an affair with a married American, and falls in love. Her classy, understated performance won her a second Oscar.<br/>\"Stick with us,\" cabled Morecambe, \"and we will get you another one\". But - as with her previous Academy Award - she refused to go to Hollywood to pick up the statuette.  <br/>\"You don't do a play to compete for an award, \"she explained. \"I didn't win them. They were given to me.\"<br/>Jackson's marriage ended in 1976, after Jackson's husband sued for divorce on the grounds of adultery.  <br/>She did not deny it, but later noted that she had never been involved in a non-violent relationship.<br/>\"When I have to cry,\" she later said, \"I think about my love life. And when I have to laugh, I think about my love life.\"<br/>She returned to the RSC in the title role of Ibsen's Hedda Gabler, directed by Trevor Nunn.  She was Oscar-nominated for the subsequent film version, which Nunn also directed.<br/>She also received plaudits for her role in Howard Barker's play, Scenes from an Execution, broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 1984 - which subsequently transferred to the stage.<br/>Jackson wowed the critics on Broadway when she appeared in Eugene O'Neill's melodrama, Strange Interlude.  It required her to be on stage for four hours, as her character aged from a naive teenager to embittered mother. <br/>The New York Times was ecstatic: \"She's equally mesmerizing as a Zelda Fitzgerald-esque neurotic, a rotting and spiteful middle-aged matron and, finally, a spent, sphinx-like widow happily embracing extinction.\"<br/>She joined forces with Russell again in 1989, with an appearance in The Rainbow.<br/>At the age of 56, Jackson announced she was quitting acting - to stand as a Labour parliamentary candidate in the 1992 general election.<br/>\"The best theatre is trying to tell the truth,\" she said. \"And the best politics is trying to tell the truth.\"<br/>In an otherwise miserable election for her party, she won a notable victory in Hampstead and Highgate, which had been a Conservative seat for two decades.<br/>When Labour came to power in 1997, Jackson became a junior minister with responsibility for London Transport.<br/>She resigned two years later, to make a bid to become Labour's candidate for the London mayor, but was defeated by Frank Dobson.<br/>A left-winger by inclination, she became a fierce critic of Tony Blair's New Labour project and spoke out against the invasion of Iraq.<br/>In 2005, she threatened to stand against Blair for the party leadership unless he announced his intention to stand down.<br/>With boundary changes, Jackson clung on to her seat in the 2010 general election with a wafer-thin majority of 42.<br/>But the most controversial moment in her political career came in April 2013, when Parliament was recalled to pay tribute to the former prime minister, Margaret Thatcher.<br/>Lady Thatcher had just died. But Jackson saw no reason to rein in her criticism of a woman she believed \"had inflicted heinous social, economic and spiritual damage upon the country\".<br/>Conservative MPs were furious when the Speaker refused to rule her remarks out of order. One political commentator accused the Labour left of being \"petty\", \"childish\" and \"self-indulgent\" with its ungracious attacks on the Iron Lady's memory. The writer was Jackson's son, Dan Hodges.<br/>Jackson decided not to defend her seat at the 2015 general election. And - at the age of 79 - she returned to acting.<br/>She played the 104-year-old Adelaide Fouque in a BBC Radio 4 production entitled Emile Zola: Blood Sex and Money.  <br/>And, in 2016 - a full quarter of a century after last treading the boards - took on the role of King Lear at the Old Vic.  <br/>\"My fear,\" she said, \"was that I would not have the physical or vocal strength\" to play one of Shakespeare's most challenging parts.  <br/>But the Daily Telegraph described her performance as \"one of those 11th-hour feats of human endeavour that will surely be talked about for years to come\".<br/>Two years later, she won a Tony Award on Broadway in a revival of Edward Albee's Three Tall Women.<br/>Chain-smoking and often barbed, she tolerated no fools. \"No-one does scorn like Jackson,\" said one shell-shocked interviewer.  <br/>But the writer Marilyn Stasio best summed up the experience of watching her act:  \"It is like looking straight into the sun,\" she wrote in Variety magazine.  <br/>\"Her expressive face registers her thoughts while guarding her feelings. But it's the voice that really thrills. <br/>\"Deeply pitched and clarion clear, it's the commanding voice of stern authority.  Don't mess with this household god or she'll turn you to stone.\"<br/>Jackson was winning accolades for her acting work as recently as 2020, when she won a Bafta TV Award for best leading actress for her performance in Elizabeth is Missing, about a woman suffering from dementia.<br/>Shortly before her death, Jackson completed filming The Great Escaper, in which she co-starred with Michael Caine.<br/>Sir Michael Caine leads tributes to Glenda Jackson<br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Her job is done.<br/>\"I didn't realise I was a good screamer until I started working with the guys,\" she says. \"I'm now going to go home and gargle some honey.\"<br/>The filming takes place in a large professional studio with multiple sets on an industrial estate in Rochford - a far cry from Churchyard's earliest films, which were shot in family bedrooms.<br/>\"My first feature film, I Scream on the Beach, was shot over weekends with what we could spare from our earnings,\" the 35-year-old says.<br/>The crew is shooting scenes for two films - Mosaic, which has a budget of about \u00a37,000, and Video Shop Tales of Terror: Lust and Revenge, which Churchyard hopes to keep \"well under \u00a310,000\".<br/>Market studies show the horror genre is becoming increasingly popular with younger audiences, particularly in the US, where it is biting at the heels of the action film market.<br/>The independent horror scene depends on a mix of DVD, screenings at key festivals such as FrightFest and Horror on Sea and, increasingly, online streaming.<br/>\"There's a big appetite for independent, low-budget horror,\" says Churchyard, who works as a video editor during the week.<br/>It is an industry, he says, in which fans with the necessary passion and ability can help make the films they love. Fans, he says, like 48-year-old Singh Lall.<br/>By day Mr Lall works as a business studies teacher at a local secondary school. By night (or in this case weekend) he is the producer of Video Shop Tales of Terror: Lust and Revenge.<br/>\"I've been a genre fan for as long as I can remember,\" says Lall. \"I used to stay up late with my mum watching Hammer films and that led to horror festivals.\"<br/>It was through networking at those festivals that he got the chance to make Video Shop Tales of Terror two years ago.<br/>\"If somebody had told me I'd be producing horror films five years ago, I would have said, 'never in a million years',\" he says.<br/>\"But that's the beauty of this - anybody can pick up a camera and create something and there are outlets, festivals and fans. I am one of them.\"<br/>Lauren Jane Barnett and Tony Mardon have travelled to the Essex set from London to help out.<br/>When Mardon, usually a director, learns one of the female cast members has not been able to make it, he puts on a short sequin dress and a red wig to cover the part<br/>\"Everybody helps each other; it is just how it is. Doing stuff like this is great, though I don't usually wear a dress.\"<br/>\"And it is a lot of fun,\" says film historian Barnett, who moved to the UK from North Carolina 13 years ago.<br/>\"I grew up watching B movies and because I met Tony through my work, I ended up in his film The Witches of the Sands and, because everybody knows each other, I'm here to help out.<br/>\"Acting is an accidental part of the journey.\"<br/>Make up artist Alex Gent, a former newspaper journalist, has a lot on his hands.<br/>\"I've been told we want somebody turned into a robot, I've got somebody I've got to kill off quite graphically and I know I've got some wounds and injuries to inflict during the day,\" he says.<br/>Among the most grizzly of the injuries on his job sheet is what's known as a \"face pull-off\", in which the actor's face appears to be ripped away from their head.<br/>\"Once you've got the tools and the confidence you can actually do things quite easily,\" he says.<br/>The robot outfit created by Gent was worn by Andrea Rose.<br/>Thus far in her horror career, the softly-spoken actress is most often cast as a sinister feminine aggressor or a zombie.<br/>\"People say they just can't imagine me as a scare actor, but I just love it,\" she says.<br/>Today, she after playing the robot, she then plays a victim.<br/>\"It is really nice to be a victim because I'm usually the sinister one.\"<br/>Chris Mills and Annabella Rich are rising stars in the indie horror scene and have travelled from Portsmouth and Chichester to perform.<br/>Mr Mills, 33, will be playing a space cop and a character called Joshua, a delinquent son, who will be joining the rest of his family for a festive meal.<br/>\"We love horror, we really do,\" says Mr Mills. \"We absolutely live and breathe it.\"<br/>\"The independent horror scene in the UK is just so inclusive and fun,\" says Ms Rich, 27. <br/>\"Quite a lot of the big actresses started out in horror.<br/>\"A lot of people turn their noses up at it, but it is great and has one of the best fan bases around.<br/>\"The films are some of the only ones you can make on such a low budget and will see a great return.\"<br/>Photography: Laurence Cawley<br/>Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

It was one of several songs on a cassette labelled \"For Paul\" that Lennon had made shortly before his death in 1980. <br/>Lo-fi and embryonic, the tracks were largely recorded onto a boombox as the musician sat at a piano in his New York apartment.<br/>Cleaned up by producer Jeff Lynne, two of those songs - Free As A Bird and Real Love - were completed and released in 1995 and 96, marking the Beatles' first \"new\" material in 25 years.<br/>The band also attempted to record Now And Then, an apologetic love song that was fairly typical of Lennon's later career, but the session was quickly abandoned.<br/>\"It was one day - one afternoon, really - messing with it,\" Lynne recalled.<br/>\"The song had a chorus but is almost totally lacking in verses. We did the backing track, a rough go that we really didn't finish.\"<br/>Sir Paul later claimed George Harrison refused to work on the song, saying the sound quality of Lennon's vocal was \"rubbish\".<br/>\"It didn't have a very good title, it needed a bit of reworking, but it had a beautiful verse and it had John singing it,\" he told Q Magazine.<br/>\"[But] George didn't like it. The Beatles being a democracy, we didn't do it.\"<br/>There were also said to have been technical issues with the original recording, which featured a persistent \"buzz\" from the electricity circuits in Lennon's apartment.<br/>In 2009, a new version of the demo, without the background noise, was released on a bootleg CD. Fans have speculated that this recording may not have been available in 1995, suggesting it was stolen from his apartment, along with other personal effects, after his death.<br/>In the intervening years, Sir Paul has repeatedly talked about his desire to finish the song.<br/>\"That one's still lingering around,\" he told a BBC Four documentary on Jeff Lynne in 2012. \"So I'm going to nick in with Jeff and do it. Finish it, one of these days.\"<br/>It would seem that technology has now afforded the musician a chance to achieve that goal.<br/>The turning point came with Peter Jackson's Get Back documentary, where dialogue editor Emile de la Rey trained computers to recognise the Beatles' voices and separate them from background noises, and even their own instruments, to create \"clean\" audio.<br/>The same process allowed Sir Paul to \"duet\" with Lennon on his recent tour, and for new surround sound mixes of the Beatles' Revolver album to be created last year.<br/>\"He [Jackson] was able to extricate John's voice from a ropey little bit of cassette,\" Sir Paul told Radio 4's Martha Kearney. <br/>\"We had John's voice and a piano and he could separate them with AI. They tell the machine, 'That's the voice. This is a guitar. Lose the guitar'. <br/>\"So when we came to to make what will be the last Beatles' record, it was a demo that John had [and] we were able to take John's voice and get it pure through this AI. <br/>\"Then we can mix the record, as you would normally do. So it gives you some sort of leeway.\"<br/>However, the musician admitted that other applications of AI gave him cause for concern. <br/>\"I'm not on the internet that much [but] people will say to me, 'Oh, yeah, there's a track where John's singing one of my songs', and it's just AI, you know? <br/>\"It's kind of scary but exciting, because it's the future. We'll just have to see where that leads.\"<br/>The star was talking to Radio 4 ahead of the launch of a new book and accompanying photography exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery.<br/>Titled Eyes Of The Storm, the project features portraits taken by Sir Paul on his own camera, between December 1963 and February 1964, as the Beatles were catapulted to global fame.<br/>Beatles' Revolver: How AI has revived a classic<br/>McCartney's Glasto show revealed in unseen photos<br/>Sting: AI-written songs don't impress me at all<br/>African leaders tour Kyiv after air raid alert<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Greece denies coastguard rope led to boat tragedy<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

I need a fresh start.

He now tries to emulate the \"soulful and raw\" 90s sound of that scene. <br/>In April his two great passions - dance music and Ayr - finally collided when he staged the Pavilion Festival in his home town. <br/>With the help of STREETrave, which was responsible for some legendary club nights in Ayr in the 80s and 90s, they brought 7,500 ravers to Ayr for the inaugural festival.<br/>He said it was \"biblical\" to work with the experienced promoters, who were returning to the Ayrshire coast for the first time in 30 years.<br/>\"I had no idea how to run a festival. I just had an idea in my head,\" he said. <br/>\"I can always picture stuff like that but you never know how it's going to turn out until you have the people there and it's all set up. I just never thought it was going to happen.\"<br/>McVicar headlined the two-day event alongside acts like Skream, Kettama, Karen Dunbar and Optimo Espacio.<br/>\"It's all about celebrating being Scottish and having a good time,\" the DJ said. <br/>His house rules were: \"Don't be a dafty\". <br/>\"It worked,\" he said. \"Everyone was so lovely and it was a credit to the punters that came to Pavilion.<br/>\"I've put faith in my hometown and they've given that back to me tenfold.\"<br/>He said he wanted to give a boost to a town which had seen a downturn in fortunes since he left. <br/>\"I want folk to have belief and see a different part of Scotland which doesn't normally get talked about,\" he said. <br/>The event was a huge success - and now the leader of South Ayrshire Council has backed plans for the festival to be held annually over the next five years. <br/>But McVicar is being secretive about his future plans for Pavilion. <br/>\"All we're focusing on is making the experience as good as it can be on the site and hopefully we'll increase the capacity a little bit - just a little bit every year.\"<br/>Although he can now add \"successful festival organiser\" to his CV, he is not letting it distract from his music. <br/>He's working on a new album and a collaboration with one of the world's most famous DJs and record producers. <br/>\"I'm writing an album right now and me and Calvin Harris have got a track on it right now... that's an exclusive, by the way, I've not told anyone that,\" he said. <br/>They're both Scottish - Harris is from Dumfries - but they're from \"different realms\", according to McVicar. <br/>\"We both play different music but the amount of respect I have for him, for everything he's done and the fact he's Scottish as well is just insane.<br/>\"And then when he saw me he was like: 'Its good to finally meet you.' He's lovely\u2026 what a lovely guy he is.<br/>\"I'm looking to release the album next year and I think it's going to be a huge turning point in me going from Ewan McVicar, the wee happy DJ, to actually folk taking me a bit more seriously. <br/>\"It's not just fun anymore.

A love of music has shaped both her life and her approach to design, she says.<br/>\"This morning I went up to my design studio and they were playing heavy rock. I looked up at the girls and said, 'Soz, I'm changing it.'\"<br/>Choosing the right music to create the right \"buzz\" for clients who come to visit her west London studio is of the utmost importance to Kelly Hoppen.<br/>Music sets the mood for them, but it also helps her get creative. \"It has to be a certain music for me to get into the zone to design,\" she explains.<br/>In fact, it's often through discussion of music that the decisive creative breakthroughs with clients are made.<br/>\"I say to them, 'If you wanted your room to sound like a piece of music, what would it be?'\" she says. \"Some don't understand the question, but others say, 'Oh, 100%, Say A Little Prayer for You by Burt Bacharach.' And I get that! <br/>\"I can't explain why, but music is design to me.\"<br/>In a career that spans five decades, Hoppen, 63, has established herself as one of the UK's best-known interior designers. She is famed for her neutral palette, Zen-like greys which are meant to create a relaxing ambience. <br/>Many of her celebrity customers have been musicians, including Victoria Beckham, Sean \"Diddy\" Combs and, most recently, Boy George.<br/>Her job is to figure out what they really want, which isn't always straightforward. Boy George visited her home and explained the decor he was after.<br/>\"I said, 'I'm absolutely convinced you don't [want that],\" recalls Hoppen.<br/>But by speaking to him she found out the deeper feelings he was looking for, which gave her clues on how to express his personality in home decor - which is very different to his flamboyant stage persona, she points out.<br/>It's the part of the job she loves, getting into a client's head like a psychologist, she says.<br/>The language of music is part of her method for \"getting the information\" she needs.<br/>Hoppen was born in South Africa, where her mother is from, but with her British father the family moved to London when she was two.<br/>They went back to visit her grandparents during holidays, and her grandmother's elegant home was another design inspiration for her.<br/>In the mid-1970s, aged 16, she decided to \"run away\" back to South Africa on her own. <br/>Her parents had divorced and she was living with her father after falling out with her mother. When her father died unexpectedly at the age of 48, the huge shock was the trigger for her to go.<br/>Back in apartheid South Africa she befriended the musical group The Pacific Express and toured with them. The group contained both black and Indian members. She was breaking apartheid laws by mixing with them, and found herself in jail on one occasion as a result.<br/>She had known the risks, but the music drew her in.<br/>The experience left her \"heartbroken and disgusted\" at what South Africa was like under apartheid so she did not go back.<br/>More CEO Secrets interviews:<br/>Instead, she channelled her passion for music into interior design, starting her company in her teens without qualifications, and growing it organically, one client at a time.<br/>Hoppen's understated look for interiors has appealed to clients who specialise in luxury environments, whether it is boutique hotels, cruise ships or airlines looking to please first-class customers. <br/>She says it's a reputation she has played along with, though she's not averse to a splash of colour.

Nope.\") <br/>Apart from her design consultancy, her business empire also includes her best-selling books, which explain some of her design secrets.<br/>The jobs that come into her studio tend to be from high net-worth clients, or companies that cater to them. Her customers have not been particularly affected by the cost of living crisis, she says.<br/>She is aware of \"the divide\" that exists between her clientele's design needs, and the day-to-day concerns of most people.<br/>But she is equally passionate about improving home design for those on smaller budgets, she says, and has built a large following on Instagram, sharing ideas about how to do it.<br/>Interior design doesn't have to involve spending money, she says. You can create impact by small things like changing cushions, or rehanging pictures.<br/>\"I'm such a geek about it, if I could go into everyone's homes and help with the changes, I would. I'd love to be that magician.\"<br/>People have come to appreciate their homes more now as \"sanctuaries\" since the pandemic and lockdowns, Hoppen believes.<br/>And one thing that music and good interior design at home have in common, she's realised, is that they both have the power to influence your mood and have a positive effect on your mental health.<br/>You can follow business reporter Dougal Shaw on LinkedIn<br/>African leaders tour Kyiv after air raid alert<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Greece denies coastguard rope led to boat tragedy<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

A new streaming series shows what became of the characters.<br/>The Full Monty film opened with a shot of a derelict Sheffield factory, and ended with a group of former employees hauling themselves off the scrapheap to stage a strip show in a working men's club.<br/>Twenty-six years on, the new Disney+ series opens with a shot of the same working men's club. It's now derelict too.<br/>A quarter of a century may have passed, but not much has changed.<br/>And despite the 1997 film's uplifting ending, it turns out that most of the six friends have only narrowly avoided dereliction themselves. <br/>They are led by lovable rogue Gaz, played by Robert Carlyle. The actor says that after years of industrial decline, when the film came out there was a sense of optimism in the UK, thanks to New Labour, Cool Britannia and Britpop. \"It seemed to be that things can only get better.\"<br/>That didn't last long, though, Carlyle continues. \"The past 25 years have been really tough for people. Twenty-five years, it seems, of austerity that's really chipped away at these characters and their lives.<br/>\"It's chipped away the infrastructure in the country as well. And I think the show reflects that.\"<br/>Gaz is now a porter on a psychiatric ward, while best mate Dave (played by Mark Addy) is a caretaker at the school where his wife Jean (Lesley Sharp) is headteacher. Both fertile settings for storylines about a crumbling state.<br/>Meanwhile, Gerald (Tom Wilkinson) and Horse (Paul Barber) have been left behind by modern life, and Lomper (Steve Huison) runs a caf\u00e9 called Big Baps with his husband - although that name soon gets cancelled.<br/>Only Guy (Hugo Speer) seems to have prospered, now the privately-financed pantomime villain.<br/>However, he disappears half-way through the series because the actor was himself cancelled after Disney investigated \"allegations of inappropriate conduct\" on set. The actor denied that and said he \"didn't believe I'd done anything wrong\".<br/>The gang are joined by William Snape - who played Gaz's son Nathan in the film - and Talitha Wing, who has been cast as Gaz's daughter Destiny.<br/>At 26, Wing is the same age as the film. She familiarised herself by watching it with her grandparents. \"I thought we'd find different bits funny,\" she says.<br/>\"But we all actually were laughing at the same bits. So the humour and people coming together in times of hardship, I guess, is something that transcends time and generations, and is a story that everyone can understand.<br/>\"Even though I might not have been around at the time that it was going on, I feel like you can take the message and apply it to whatever is going on [today]. And unfortunately in some instances, not that much has changed.\"<br/>The eight-part series has been co-written by Simon Beaufoy - who was nominated for an Oscar for the original - and Alice Nutter.<br/>They have been able to put a wide range of issues \"in a package and still make it funny\". Carlyle says. \"That's the genius of Simon's writing. If you don't laugh, you'll cry.\"<br/>With the main characters now in their mid-50s to mid-70s, the South Yorkshire-set comedy-drama resembles what might emerge if Ken Loach directed Last of the Summer Wine.<br/>In a three-star review, The Telegraph's Michael Hogan said the new version \"firmly wears its politics on its sleeve - with mixed success\".<br/>\"The issues will be all too recognisable, especially to those in neglected communities,\" he wrote.<br/>\"If the optimism of the original... has gone, that's the point - this is a sobering reminder of how far we haven't come.\"<br/>Collider's Chase Hutchinson described it as \"a slightly baggy series elevated by the charm of flawed characters just trying to find their way in the world\".<br/>He concluded that \"the overall experience is a mirthful yet melancholic one worth riding along with\".<br/>While having eight episodes does make the series \"slightly baggy\" (there are major plots about a Britain's Got Talent-winning dog, a lost racing pigeon and a Job Centre siege), it does provide more time for characters like Jean.<br/>\"In the 90 minutes that was the film, naturally and rightly the story had to be about that group of men, who were all trying to live with being made redundant,\" Sharp says.<br/>\"What's fantastic about revisiting it is that instead of having 90 minutes, you've got eight hours to explore in detail what has happened subsequently to all of those characters. And yes, that includes a lot of really vibrant, whip smart women - young and older. <br/>\"So I think it's great that the original film, which was male centric, is now being ameliorated by the presence of some really interesting older and younger women.\"<br/>While revisiting a beloved film is a surefire way to attract eyeballs, it also comes with expectations.<br/>\"Revisiting anything can be fraught with complication,\" Sharp accepts. \"But because the film had been so loved and because Simon obviously wanted to continue telling the story of those characters, it felt like it was an enormous opportunity.\"<br/>One plot line that gets relatively little screen time is stripping. \"Well, nobody really needs to see that,\" smiles Addy. \"It's about so much more.<br/>\"That was our starting block and it's interesting to see where these characters have gone from there.\"<br/>Much of the film's appeal, though, came from the idea of stripping, if not the act itself - as a clever way to give the men a liberating and cheeky opportunity to shed society's limitations and regain control of their lives.<br/>Its feel-good power was such that the film has spawned a number of celebrity charity spin-offs - see The Real Full Monty on Ice - as well as inspiring amateur fundraisers.<br/>\"There are still men who get together and do the Full Monty for charity,\" Carlyle notes. \"And I think that's an amazing thing. If The Full Monty has done nothing [else] and it was only that, then it is worth it.\"<br/>The actor originally feared the film would bomb because it was such a tough shoot. \"You'd go home at night thinking, what is this? Is this funny? Is this anything?\" he says.<br/>\"I thought, this is never going to work. Of course, the finished article proved me wrong.\"<br/>This time, filming was \"relatively easy\", he says. \"It really was beautiful to see the guys again, because you look in each other's faces and you see life, you know, in the lines in their face. And that was lovely.<br/>\"And the thing is, The Full Monty has been like a huge big warm shadow that's followed me my whole career. There's only about four or five other people in the world that understand that. And it's those guys. It was fantastic to be back doing all that again.\"<br/>The Full Monty is on Disney+ from Wednesday 14 June.<br/>Striking Full Monty writers picket own premiere<br/>First images of new Full Monty series released<br/>The Full Monty to return as TV series<br/>Stars go the Full Monty on stage<br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Tory shot Meg.\"<br/>Megan told the courtroom Lanez had offered her $1m to keep quiet about what happened, and called her afterwards to apologise, claiming he was \"just too drunk\".<br/>Through tears, she said she had regrets about coming forward, saying speaking out had been \"torture\".<br/>Lanez was convicted in December of three charges: assault with a semiautomatic firearm, having a loaded, unregistered firearm in a vehicle and discharging a firearm with gross negligence.<br/>Prosecutors are seeking a 13-year prison sentence and the 30-year-old faces deportation to his native Canada.<br/>But he still hasn't been sentenced.<br/>On 13 June, a judge accepted his lawyer's request to delay the sentencing until 7 August to give them more time to prepare their recommendations.<br/>During the brief court hearing, Lanez - wearing an orange jail outfit and black cap - mostly kept his head down and barely made eye contact with anyone.<br/>Outside the court, Lanez' supporters stood opposite crowds of fans carrying \"We stand with Megan\" signs.<br/>And as Megan arrived at the building, his side heckled her by shouting: \"Why are you lying on that boy?\"<br/>Accusations of lying have dogged the Grammy-winning rapper throughout the case, because her story changed early on.<br/>She initially told police she'd been hurt by stepping on broken glass.<br/>It wasn't until later, on Instagram, when she first said that Tory had shot her. <br/>She then told an interviewer she'd needed surgery to remove bullets from her feet which had missed her bones and tendons.<br/>Megan, 27, said she lied to officers at the time because she didn't want to \"get in more trouble\". <br/>It sparked a long war of words between her and Lanez - they both released tracks about the case.<br/>In his song Money Over Fallout, Lanez accused Megan of trying to frame him, while Megan said she was the one \"speakin' facts\" in her track Shots Fired.<br/>The dispute spilled out into the wider hip-hop world, with artists like 50 Cent and even Drake getting involved.<br/>Megan frequently defended herself on Twitter and said she'd been painted as aggressive and a \"snitch\".<br/>She suggested misogynoir - misogyny against black women - could be why she was targeted.<br/>Megan criticised Drake when he released Circo Loco, a collab with 21 Savage that appeared to reference the shooting case.<br/>But she did receive support from fellow artists, like JoJo and Kehlani. <br/>And a group of prominent black women, including #MeToo founder Tarana Burke, released an open letter backing Megan.<br/>In Da Club rapper Fiddy eventually apologised for sharing memes casting doubt on Megan's version of events.<br/>He said he'd changed his mind after hearing evidence from the trial.<br/>Lanez has always denied the charges against him, he's filed various appeals and his lawyers could launch other motions after his sentence.<br/>Since the guilty verdict, Megan has tried to reclaim the narrative around the shooting, and spoken about the effect \"false narratives\" and \"conspiracy theories\" had on her.<br/>In an Elle Magazine feature, she said the guilty verdict \"was a victory for every woman who has ever been shamed, dismissed, and blamed for a violent crime committed against them\".<br/>\"We can't control what others think, especially when the lies are juicier than the truth,\" she said.<br/>\"But as a society, we must create safer environments for women to come forward about violent behaviour without fear of retaliation.\"<br/>Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.<br/>Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here. <br/>50 Cent sorry for Megan Thee Stallion lying claims<br/>Tory Lanez guilty of shooting Megan Thee Stallion<br/>Megan Thee Stallion testifies Tory Lanez shot her<br/>Megan Thee Stallion shooting trial begins in LA<br/>Megan Thee Stallion living with bullet fragments in feet<br/>Megan Thee Stallion 'scared' after 2020 shooting<br/>Megan Thee Stallion 'told to dance before shooting'<br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Vaccines were one part of the response.<br/>One dose provides about 78% protection against the virus, with a second extending that protection.<br/>Cases have fallen in the UK since last year when about 35 cases a day were being detected at one point. There have been only 21 cases in 2023.<br/>However, 11 have been detected in London since about the start of May. Most were in people who had chosen not to have the vaccine. <br/>The virus causes a rash and distinct lesions that can last for weeks, as well as fever, headache and muscle aches.<br/>\"It is vital we respond to recent rises in cases, and that is why we are extending mpox vaccinations in London,\" said Prof Susan Hopkins, the UKHSA's chief medical adviser.<br/>\"If you live in London or regularly travel there or abroad and have sex and are eligible for vaccination, please do consider it.\"<br/>She said vaccination was key for reducing the severity and spread of the disease. <br/>Dr Claire Dewsnap, president of the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV, said she \"strongly\" encouraged people to have the vaccine after a \"worrying\" spike in cases. <br/>\"This is particularly important as we move into the summer months, during which festivals and events are more common, increasing the likelihood for people to have multiple sexual partners,\" she said.<br/>Those eligible for the vaccine include gay, bisexual or other men who have sex with men who have many sexual partners, participate in group sex or attend sex on premises venues such as gay saunas or fetish venues. Staff who work there are also eligible.<br/>It is caused by a virus which is in the same family of viruses as smallpox, although it is much less severe. <br/>Initial symptoms include fever, headaches, swellings, back pain, aching muscles.<br/>Once the fever breaks out a rash can develop, often beginning on the face, then spreading to other parts of the body, most commonly the palms of the hands and soles of the feet.<br/>Anyone with the virus should abstain from sex while they have symptoms, to help prevent passing it on to others.<br/>Monkeypox given new name by global health experts<br/>Mpox: London sees rise in cases in the last month<br/>African leaders tour Kyiv after air raid alert<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Greece denies coastguard rope led to boat tragedy<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Instead she was in for months while Sam Eljamel operated on her seven times. <br/>The BBC can reveal her surgeon - the former head of neurosurgery at NHS Tayside - was harming patients and putting them at risk for years but the health board let him carry on regardless.<br/>NHS Tayside has consistently claimed it only knew about concerns from June 2013 and that they put him under supervision at that point but an NHS whistleblower has told the BBC the health board knew as early as 2009 that there were serious concerns.<br/>BBC Scotland has spoken to three surgeons who worked under Mr Eljamel at Tayside. All three said he was a bully who was allowed to get away with harming patients.<br/>All three said there was a lack of accountability in the department and that Mr Eljamel was allowed to behave as if he were a \"god\" - partly because of the research funding he brought to the department. <br/>The health board told the BBC it was working with the Scottish government to support an independent review of patients' care under Mr Eljamel and that it could not comment on individual cases. <br/>Before her operation in 2011 Leann used to work full-time and go on holidays abroad with friends but her life was blighted by migraines. <br/>Mr Eljamel, reputed to be the best neurosurgeon in Scotland, told her he could help. <br/>It would be one operation and she would be home in a matter of days, she was told. <br/>He would remove a small part of her skull to alleviate pressure and he told her he would use a new glue to seal the wound. <br/>Leann told the BBC: \"Unfortunately it did not seal properly and it burst.<br/>\"The wound burst open and the brain fluid started to pour out the back of my neck.\"<br/>She says the next day her hospital bed was \"soaked\" with her spinal fluid. <br/>When she got up to use the bathroom she collapsed and said the fluid went all over the floor. A nurse put a wet floor warning sign on the area. <br/>Leann says that her mum had to chase Mr Eljamel down a corridor to get him to come and look at her - at which point she was rushed back into surgery. <br/>Leann spent months in hospital. She contracted meningitis and developed hydrocephalus. Mr Eljamel ordered her to have four lumbar punctures - which her medical notes say she specifically should not have had. <br/>Leann knows now he was using the glue as part of a research trial. <br/>\"Experimenting on me - that's what he was doing,\" she says. <br/>\"There can't be any other reason to try a glue, try different shunts, that's experimenting.<br/>\"I was his guinea pig.\" <br/>She adds: \"He had free rein on my body. He was playing God with my body and the NHS handed him the scalpel, seven times.\"<br/>When Leann tried to raise concerns with staff she was told that Mr Eljamel had saved her life. She was not told that he was under investigation, nor that he had been later forced to step down. <br/>It was only after seeing recent BBC coverage she realised she was not alone. <br/>Leann is now 33. She lives in constant pain. She needs crutches to walk and has a tube - called a shunt - through her body controlling her spinal fluid. <br/>\"Everything is changed,\" she says. \"My dream was to be a police officer and that will never happen.<br/>\"I struggle with that, not being able to have the career you want, not being able to have the lifestyle you want, not being able to have children.<br/>\"A lot of things have been taken away through no fault of my own.\"<br/>Leann is one of 100 patients calling for a public inquiry to find out exactly what harm Mr Eljamel did. <br/>The damage to her and other patients is irreversible but she wants to ensure the health board is held accountable and that no other surgeon can cause such damage. <br/>She says she only realised he had harmed patients after seeing a story by BBC Scotland.<br/>\"I thought it was just me, I didn't know there was 99 other people,\" she says. <br/>\"I don't understand how he got to wash the blood off his hands and go home.\"<br/>Mr Eljamel was suspended by NHS Tayside following internal and external reviews in 2013 and went to work in Libya.<br/>For the first time, three people who worked with Mr Eljamel have spoken to the BBC.<br/>Mark, not his real name, says he is speaking out now because he fears the health board has still not learnt the lessons of the past. <br/>\"I did raise concerns at the time but I was shut down,\" he says. <br/>\"Part of me feels guilty I did not do anything [more] about it but I was too junior. <br/>\"We were told we would never get our traineeship.\"<br/>He says nurses, senior surgeons and managers knew at least as early as 2009 that Mr Eljamel was regularly away from the hospital doing private work when he was meant to be operating on patients.<br/>Mark says that on a weekly basis Mr Eljamel left junior surgeons to operate unsupervised. <br/>\"Letting a junior operate when you're not even in the building and a patient coming to harm is negligent,\" he says. <br/>\"NHS Tayside has covered things like this up for a long time in Dundee.<br/>\"It went all the way up to the board. They all knew about it.\"<br/>Mark remembers on one occasion being in surgery to watch the junior operating on Mr Eljamel's patient when the junior surgeon accidentally cut through the spinal cord. <br/>He said the spinal fluid was \"pouring out\" and that he and another surgeon were sent running to find a more senior surgeon. That patient was left permanently disabled. <br/>\"What has this top neurosurgeon done to these patients?\" He says. \"I think serious harm. Cover-ups happen so these things need to be looked into again. <br/>\"Drawing a line is easy to say but the culture will not change if you just draw a line in the sand. You need to change the culture first to protect the patients.\" <br/>The three surgeons told us Mr Eljamel discouraged the use of X-rays because he was so arrogant and because it saved him money. <br/>It is thought that as a result he operated in the wrong place on the spines of at least 70 patients - leaving many permanently disabled.<br/>Mark says one of the reasons Mr Eljamel was considered \"untouchable\" was that he brought so much money in to the department through research projects which many of them considered to be \"odd and even questionable\".<br/>A spokeswoman for NHS Tayside said: \"The NHS Tayside medical director and chief executive met with the cabinet secretary and local Tayside MSPs in April to discuss the ongoing concerns of patients of Professor Eljamel. <br/>\"It was agreed at the meeting that NHS Tayside would work with Scottish government regarding the next steps to support individual patients through a process independent of both the health board and government. <br/>\"NHS Tayside remains committed to do whatever is required to support the independent process recognising it will be tailored to the circumstances of individual patients. <br/>\"While we cannot comment on individual patients and their treatment due to patient confidentiality, we would invite Ms Sutherland to contact NHS Tayside's Patient Liaison Response Team.\"<br/>Health board review over botched operations surgeon<br/>Damning report on top surgeon's botched operations<br/>Surgeon ordered to pay \u00a32.8m compensation bill<br/>Top surgeon harmed patients for years<br/>African leaders tour Kyiv after air raid alert<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Greece denies coastguard rope led to boat tragedy<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Although, they are not truly \"synthetic\", as the starting material was cells cultured from a traditional embryo in the laboratory. <br/>\"It's beautiful and created entirely from embryonic stem cells,\" Prof Zernicka-Goetz told the Guardian newspaper.<br/>She has already developed synthetic mouse embryos with evidence of a developing brain and beating heart. <br/>Meanwhile, scientists in China have implanted synthetic monkey embryos into female monkeys - although, all the pregnancies failed. <br/>The synthetic embryos do not behave in exactly the same way as normal embryos. And it is unclear how their use in research should be governed.<br/>Prof Briscoe said: \"On the one hand, models of human embryos made of stem cells might offer an ethical and more readily available alternative to the use of IVF-derived [in-vitro fertilisation] human embryos. <br/>\"On the other hand, the closer stem-cell-derived models of human embryos mirror human embryos, the more important it is to have clear regulations and guidelines for how they are used.\" <br/>Most countries use the 14-day rule in human-embryo research. This allows an embryo created by fertilising a human egg to be grown for 14 days.<br/>However, these \"embryo models\" are not legally \"embryos\" and are not governed by the same laws.  <br/>Dr Ildem Akerman, from the University of Birmingham, said: \"These findings suggest that we would soon develop the technology to grow these cells beyond the 14-day limit, with potentially more insights to gain into human development. <br/>\"Nevertheless, the ability to do something does not justify doing it.\" <br/>Legal and ethical experts in the UK are drawing up a voluntary set of guidelines for how to proceed.  <br/>Researchers hope these synthetic embryos will further understanding of the earliest stages of human's lives.<br/>Prof Roger Sturmey, from the University of Manchester, said: \"We know remarkably little about this step in human development but it is a time where many pregnancies are lost.<br/>\"So models that can enable us to study this period are urgently needed to help to understand infertility and early pregnancy loss.\" <br/>Follow James on Twitter.<br/>African leaders tour Kyiv after air raid alert<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Greece denies coastguard rope led to boat tragedy<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Cases have fallen by more than 99% since the late 1980s and about 20 million people who would have been paralysed can walk thanks to vaccines. <br/>The original or \"wild\" poliovirus is now contained to small pockets of Afghanistan and Pakistan and the oral vaccines play a pivotal role in the attempt to rid the world of polio. <br/>\"The issue is they're genetically unstable,\" Dr Andrew Macadam, from the UK's MHRA, told BBC News.<br/>It takes only one mutation to turn the safe polio vaccine back into a virus that can move out of a child's stomach, invade their nervous system and cause paralysis. <br/>And if those viruses spread from an immunised child - through their contaminated faeces - there is a risk of infecting the unvaccinated and triggering an outbreak. <br/>There are now more cases of \"vaccine-derived polio\" than of the wild poliovirus and the polio detected in London's sewers last year was connected to the oral vaccine. <br/>So the researchers have genetically altered the weakened virus even further to make it much harder for it to start causing paralysis again. <br/>\"By genetically modifying this part of the virus, we could modify this region so it couldn't revert and this I think has been remarkably successful,\" Dr Macadam said.<br/>Prof Raul Andino, from University of California San Francisco, said he was \"super-proud\" of the scientific effort showing the vaccine was \"50 to 100 times more stable\".<br/>In March 2021, the World Health Organization made the researchers' vaccine against type-two polio available for emergency use. Since then, it has been used more than 650 million times. <br/>Now, in the journal Nature, the researchers have detailed the creation of stable vaccines against polio types one and three. <br/>The first-stage human trials of the upgraded vaccines have already been conducted - and, the researchers say, the data, which is still being analysed, is \"very promising\". <br/>The trio represent the first new polio vaccines in 50 years. <br/>\"I don't think there's any question that they're helpful, the new vaccines address the instability question, but it doesn't address the coverage issue,\" Dr Macadam said.<br/>Tackling the last 1% of polio cases has proven stubborn. The original goal was to completely eradicate polio by the year 2000 - but delivering vaccines to some of the poorest and most conflict-ridden parts of the world has been a challenge. <br/>Prof Alan Barrett, from the Sealy Institute for Vaccine Sciences, at the University of Texas, called the \"super-engineered\" vaccines a feat of \"impressive science\".<br/>\"[But] will it lead the endgame to the finish line? That is a big question,\" he added.<br/>Joseph Swan, from the World Health Organization and the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, said more stable vaccines were a \"significant part\" of the plan for a polio-free world.<br/>But, he said: \"Simply having these new and better tools will not get us over the finish line - vaccination, not just vaccines, is what will end polio.\"<br/>There was now a \"unique opportunity\" to eradicate wild poliovirus - but vaccine-derived polio outbreaks were causing problems in places facing \"complex humanitarian emergencies\", in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Yemen. <br/>The oral polio vaccine is no longer used in the UK and other countries with established healthcare systems as they have moved to the polio injection.<br/>Follow Jameson Twitter. <br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

both epidemiologists - said a coronavirus had already jumped to humans on a significant scale twice in the 21st Century, in the form of severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers).<br/>And it had been \"a reasonable bet\", before 2020, another one might follow, infectious-diseases expert and former professor of international public health Jimmy Whitworth said.<br/>By mid-January 2020, people in the international public-health community had been aware the Covid-19 outbreak had been \"out of the ordinary\", he said.<br/>\"It wasn't going to die away - it was something bigger than that,\" Mr Whitworth said.<br/>And by end of January, people in public health had been very clear it had been \"an impending wave that was coming to UK\".<br/>\"For those of us who had memories of Sars, the parallels were something that gave us shivers\", Mr Whitworth added.<br/>Asked about the dangers of a virus being leaked, deliberately or accidentally, from a laboratory, Cambridge University fellow in emerging infectious diseases Dr Charlotte Hammer said she was aware of four incidents involving the Sars virus. <br/>But when it came to controlling an outbreak once it had started to infect thousands of people, the virus's origins mattered \"very little\".<br/>What is the UK Covid-19 inquiry?<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Bereaved families express their loss, in a film shown to the inquiry<br/>The UK saw one of the worst first waves of Covid in Europe, in spring 2020. <br/>In April and May that year, about 160,000 deaths were registered -

Inquiries can make recommendations although these do not have to be adopted by ministers. <br/>The Covid inquiry, launched by Boris Johnson in May 2021, covers decision-making during the pandemic in both Westminster and the devolved administrations.<br/>At the time, Mr Johnson said all aspects of the UK's response would be \"under the microscope\". <br/>It is being chaired by Baroness Heather Hallett, a retired judge and crossbench peer.<br/>She previously led the inquests into the 7/7 London bombings.<br/>The inquiry has no formal deadline but is due to hold public hearings across the UK until at least 2025.<br/>At the first public hearing in London, Baroness Hallett said she planned to publish updates and reports \"as we go along\" on the inquiry's website. <br/>Public hearings are streamed on the inquiry's YouTube channel, and witness transcripts will be published on its website.<br/>Members of the public can apply to attend public hearings in person. <br/>The inquiry is split into different parts.<br/>Work in four areas has already begun:<br/>Future strands - with hearings due in 2024 and 2025 - will look at:<br/>Scotland is also holding a separate inquiry.<br/>Baroness Hallett's team is expected to focus on the biggest and most controversial aspects of the government's response, including:<br/>The inquiry is also expected to consider whether too many restrictions were imposed as the pandemic progressed. <br/>Over the course of 80 days in autumn 2020, for example, England went from the so-called \"rule of six\" to a tiered system of regulations, then into a national lockdown and then back to tiers.<br/>The government's policy towards schools is also likely to be on the agenda.

This is thought to be the first time a government has taken legal action against its own public inquiry.<br/>Baroness Hallett said it was her job to decide if material was relevant.<br/>However Mr Johnson said he was \"perfectly content\" for the inquiry to have WhatsApp messages sent after May 2021. He said earlier messages were not available because his mobile phone was involved in a security breach and had not been used since. <br/>Former Health Secretary Matt Hancock also said he was happy to share his messages, although many of these have already been leaked by the journalist Isabel Oakeshott, who helped Mr Hancock write his book, Pandemic Diaries.<br/>Covid-19 Public Inquiry<br/>African leaders tour Kyiv after air raid alert<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Greece denies coastguard rope led to boat tragedy<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Check on those who may be more vulnerable, such older people and babies.<br/>Here's what you need to know about the effects of heat on the body and how to stay cool.<br/>As the body gets hotter, blood vessels open up. This leads to lower blood pressure and makes the heart work harder to push the blood around the body.<br/>This can cause mild symptoms such as an itchy heat rash or swollen feet as blood vessels become leaky. <br/>At the same time, sweating leads to the loss of fluids and salt and, crucially, the balance between them in the body changes. <br/>This, combined with the lowered blood pressure, can lead to heat exhaustion. Symptoms include:<br/>If blood pressure drops too far, the risk of heart attacks rises.<br/>Our bodies strive to keep a core temperature of about 37C whether we're in a snowstorm or a heatwave.<br/>It is the temperature our bodies have evolved to work at. <br/>But as the weather gets hotter, the body has to work harder to keep its core temperature down.<br/>It opens more blood vessels near the skin to lose heat to our surroundings and starts sweating.<br/>As the sweat evaporates, it dramatically increases the heat lost from the skin.<br/>The UK Health Security Agency has some tips:<br/>Use thin sheets, cool your socks in the fridge before putting them on and stick to your usual bedtime routine, experts say.<br/>If they can be cooled down within half an hour, then heat exhaustion is not normally serious.<br/>NHS advice says: <br/>However, if they do not recover within 30 minutes, then what follows is heat stroke.<br/>It is a medical emergency and you should call 999.<br/>People with heat stroke may stop sweating even though they are too hot. Their temperature could go over 40C and they might have seizures or lose consciousness. <br/>Old age or some long-term conditions, such as heart disease, can leave people less able to cope with the strain heat puts on the body.<br/>Diabetes can make the body lose water more quickly and some complications of the disease can alter blood vessels and the ability to sweat. <br/>Children and those who are less mobile may also be more vulnerable. Brain diseases, such as dementia, can also leave people unaware of the heat or unable to do anything about it.<br/>People who are homeless will also be more exposed to the sun. Those living in top-floor flats will also face higher temperatures.<br/>Yes - but people should keep taking their medication as normal and need to make more effort to stay cool and hydrated.<br/>Diuretics - sometimes called \"water pills\" - increase the amount of water the body expels. They are taken widely, including for heart failure. In high temperatures, they increase the dangers of dehydration and imbalances in key minerals in the body.<br/>Antihypertensives - which lower blood pressure - can combine with the blood vessels that are dilating to cope with the heat and cause dangerous drops in blood pressure.<br/>Some drugs for epilepsy and Parkinson's can block sweating and make it harder for the body to cool itself.<br/>And other drugs such as lithium or statins can become more concentrated and problematic in the blood if there is too much fluid loss. <br/>There are about 2,000 deaths caused by high temperatures in England every year.<br/>Most of these will be heart attacks and strokes caused by the strain of trying to keep body temperatures stable.<br/>The higher death rate starts to kick in once the thermometer passes 25C-26C.<br/>However, the evidence suggests the deaths tend to be caused by higher temperatures in spring or early summer rather than \"peak summer\".<br/>This could be because we start to change our day-to-day behaviour as summer progresses and we get more used to dealing with the heat.<br/>The evidence from previous heatwaves is the increase in deaths happens very quickly - within the first 24 hours of the heatwave. <br/>Follow James on Twitter.<br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

In England just 61% of patients start treatment in that time against a target of 85%.<br/>Growing delays are, in part, the flip side of a medical success story.<br/>Scientific progress in cancer care has been remarkable, with cutting-edge drugs offering hope where previously there was little that could be done.<br/>New techniques are more effective but often far more complex for doctors to deliver.<br/>At the same time the UK population is getting older - and as cancer risk is strongly linked to age it means more more demand for expensive scanners, along with more staff to analyse those scans, and more specialist doctors and nurses. <br/>The Royal College of Radiologists (RCR) describes the situation as a perfect storm - and says the workforce is struggling to keep up.  <br/>Across the four UK nations, it calculates there is now a 15% shortfall of specialist cancer doctors - or clinical oncologists - who deliver chemotherapy and radiotherapy. <br/>Without action, it says this gap will grow to 25% - or a shortage of 368 full-time consultants - by 2027.<br/>Just as concerning is an even larger shortage of consultant radiologists - highly trained doctors who interpret scans to diagnose cancer or monitor its progression.<br/>The RCR says for each month a patient waits to start cancer treatment, the risk of death is increased by about 10%. <br/>In its annual survey, 44% of cancer service managers say they are now \"highly concerned\" about patient delays, up from 29% in the previous year.<br/>\"There are examples in almost every cancer centre where parts of the service just aren't running as well as we would like,\" said Dr Tom Roques, a consultant oncologist and vice-president of the RCR.<br/>\"We're having to tell patients all the time that we can't quite treat them as quickly as we would like, or in the way that we'd like, and that's a stressful thing to have to do.\"<br/>Kevin O'Hara, 60, from County Durham, broke five ribs in a motorbike accident last November. <br/>A scan of his upper body also picked up a shadow near one of his kidneys that was later diagnosed as cancer.<br/>He was offered drug treatment meant to slow the growth of the tumour and - in early February - was told the waiting list for surgery would be three to four months. <br/>That period has now been and gone but he is still waiting for a date for his operation. <br/>\"Every day you are waiting and waiting and nothing changes,\" he said. <br/>\"I come home from work and go to the door and, when there's no envelope that says NHS on the top, I just get so depressed.\" <br/>There is another trend in cancer care which is often overlooked.<br/>The last decade has seen a dramatic increase in people coming forward to get checked after spotting a possible symptom such as an unusual lump, strange mole or unexplained weight loss.<br/>The reasons for that are complex and include a bounceback in demand since Covid, stronger guidance for GPs to refer to cancer specialists, major NHS publicity drives and the work of campaigners such as \"Bowelbabe\" Deborah James.<br/>Cancer doctors view the spike in demand as a \"very good thing\", as a growing proportion of patients are now diagnosed earlier when cancer is easier to treat.<br/>But it also puts more pressure on NHS services, with waiting times for diagnosis and other scans one of the key bottlenecks in the system.<br/>Since Christmas there have been some signs of progress, with the NHS in England reducing the backlog of long waits for treatment and hitting one of its other standards - for faster diagnosis - for the first time. <br/>This video can not be played<br/>In Blackpool, the NHS has hit its skin cancer targets by changing the way patients are diagnosed, in an approach which is now being rolled out across England. <br/>The RCR also says there is a \"chink of light\" - with recruitment of oncologists rising over the last three years, particularly in parts of the country with the worst staff shortages.<br/>It wants each UK nation to increase medical school places and training posts, and says more also needs to be done to stop experienced staff cutting their hours or leaving the profession early. <br/>The Department of Health said that the total number of full-time staff in the cancer workforce in England had risen by 51% to 33,093 since 2010.<br/>A spokesman added: \"We want to build on this progress and will publish a workforce plan shortly to ensure we have the right numbers of staff, with the right number of skills.\"<br/>The Scottish government is also expected to publish its new 10-year cancer strategy within weeks, setting out ways to attract and retain more staff.<br/>The Welsh government recently published a cancer improvement plan and says it is now investing heavily to train more staff and build more diagnostic and treatment centres.  <br/>In Northern Ireland, the health department said it is \"extremely disappointing\" that cancer targets are being missed. It has recently opened two new rapid diagnostic centres and started a \"cancer strategy workforce review\". <br/>Data visualisation by Liana Bravo.<br/>Follow Jim on Twitter.<br/>Has your treatment been affected by the junior doctor strikes?

But vaping's helped millions of people to ditch traditional cigarettes.<br/>It's widely considered less harmful than smoking tobacco - and the UK government endorses vapes as a quitting aid.<br/>But what do you do when you want to take the next step and quit completely?<br/>The main reason vaping gets you hooked is nicotine - the same ingredient that makes smokers crave cigarettes.<br/>It's thought to be pretty harmless on its own, but is powerfully addictive. That's why vaping isn't recommended for non-smokers.<br/>Nicotine creates new receptors in the brain when it enters the body, and you quickly come to associate it with feeling good.<br/>So when you stop getting it you'll feel cravings. These tend to be worse in the first three to four days after your last dose.<br/>According to the NHS, other withdrawal symptoms, like bad moods, are likely in the early stages of quitting.<br/>There's no firm answer to this - it varies for each person - but there are some things we do know.<br/>It's technically possible to go \"cold turkey\" and suddenly stop vaping. But most people find this very difficult.<br/>Experts, such as the National Centre for Smoking Cessation and Training (NCSCT), generally recommend some sort of gradual approach.<br/>One tip for vapers is to reduce the nicotine strength of their e-liquid in two to four-week stages, working down to 0% solutions.<br/>This can be trickier with disposable vapes, which tend to come in higher strengths.<br/>But zero-nicotine versions are available, and the NCSCT says using one alongside your regular vape can help.<br/>Failing that, a temporary switch to a tank-style vape, giving you access to different e-liquids, might be better. <br/>Other reduction strategies include:<br/>Another option is Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) - patches, gum and sprays used instead of a vape.<br/>Nicotine pouches that go between the gum and lip are starting to appear on some shop shelves but these aren't currently recommended by the NHS.<br/>Like smoking, if you've been vaping a long time you're likely to have formed habits around it.<br/>Certain situations or times of day - triggers - will have got you used to reaching for your vape. <br/>This can be hard to snap out of, so it can help to figure out what they are.<br/>It's also a good idea to try and fill this time with something else to distract you, like exercise.<br/>If you are a former smoker, the NCSCT says it's worth keeping a vape on hand for emergencies.<br/>Because, if you do relapse, it's better than reaching for a cigarette.<br/>Follow Newsbeat on Twitter and YouTube.<br/>Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here<br/>High lead and nickel levels found in illegal vapes<br/>Free vapes to be handed out in anti-smoking drive<br/>Vaping - is it a risk-free option?<br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Now, with the FBI adding its voice, the politics and division behind the hunt for the truth are being laid bare.<br/>There are few scientific debates as divisive and toxic as the question of Covid's origin. <br/>While researching for the upcoming podcast I'm making for the BBC about it, I've heard virologists question the motives and professionalism of colleagues with whom they disagree over two alternative possibilities.<br/>They are whether the virus infected its first human in a Wuhan market, or in a Chinese government-controlled lab. <br/>\"I wouldn't want [him] to be doing that experiment,\" one eminent virologist said dismissively of another who had raised questions about the risks of the Wuhan scientists' work. <br/>Professional relationships have been damaged and friendships lost. Some have simply had enough. <br/>\"Nothing personal, but I'm not prepared to take part in anything that gives air time to the lab leak conspiracy horseshit,\" one virologist said to me when I invited him to take part in our series. <br/>It should be no surprise then that US intelligence agencies and government departments have also struggled to reach a consensus on Covid's origins.<br/>The recent news that the US Department of Energy has changed its intelligence assessment to conclude - apparently with low confidence - that the virus came from a lab, brings the number of agencies supporting that view to two. <br/>It had already been reported that the FBI had come to the same conclusion - with a \"moderate\" level of confidence - and now FBI Director Christopher Wray has spelled out in public that the bureau believes \"a potential lab incident\" was to blame.<br/>Four US intelligence agencies are said to still believe the evidence points to the virus coming from nature, and two remain undecided. <br/>The intelligence assessments are based, of course, on classified information.  The different agencies are part of what's known in the US as the \"intelligence community\", with each one drawing on different expertise and sources of information, from human intelligence to the work of government scientists.<br/>The Department of Energy's Office of Intelligence and Counterintelligence, for example, can call on scientific and technological know-how from the 17 national laboratories that are overseen by the department.<br/>The agencies' work can overlap but it's unclear how much they've collaborated on the question of the origin of Covid.<br/>There were claims during the days of the Trump administration that several researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a national-level research facility known to have been studying and experimenting with coronaviruses, had become sick in November 2019, leading them to seek hospital treatment. <br/>But no details have been released about the sourcing of that intelligence.  <br/>And the US government has said the symptoms were consistent with both Covid-19 and common seasonal illnesses - making it difficult for anyone to independently assess the true relevance of the claim. <br/>In early 2020, the lab-leak theory's association with President Donald Trump led some to treat it as disinformation: a deliberate, even xenophobic attempt to deflect blame for his administration's own handling of the pandemic.  <br/>But there were scientific arguments too - with claims that an examination of the genetic structure of Sars-CoV-2 proved conclusively that it couldn't have come from a lab.  <br/>Later, others would argue that analysis of the early patient data around that Wuhan market where the disease first emerged went even further to prove a natural origin beyond all doubt - and we will hear from some of those scientists in our podcast. <br/>These scientists may wonder whether politics are once again at play in the timing of the comments from the FBI director, a Trump appointee, just as the Republican Party, now in control of the US House of Representatives, begins to turn its attention to the lab-leak once again.<br/>On the other hand, under President Biden the lab-leak theory has been largely freed of its associations with his predecessor.<br/>Which is perhaps why other scientists are increasingly willing to speak out about their concern that the theory may have been too swiftly dismissed. <br/>Professor Larry Gostin, from Georgetown University and an advisor to the World Health Organization \u00a0- although himself favouring a natural origin - does not believe there is yet enough evidence to definitively rule out a lab-leak and thinks it was a mistake to try to do so. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\"Science shouldn't discount the public interest like that,\" he told me. He suggests that Donald Trump, who has indulged in conspiracy theories across a range of other issues, may in fact have been right to question this narrative. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\"I mean, yes, you do have conspiracy theories. But was he, you know, wrong in wanting that information about the lab? No.\"<br/>Some experts hope that Congress may now be able to uncover new information.  <br/>US scientists have collaborated closely with the Wuhan Institute of Virology and there may yet be data held by government agencies or research archives that could prove useful.  <br/>Meanwhile the Chinese government of course pushes back at any and all suggestions that the virus came from China - via a market or a lab.  <br/>My own attempts to examine those possibilities led, at least in part, to my forcible departure from the country, under threat of legal action by the authorities in 2021.  <br/>State media accused me of \"stigmatising China as being the origin of the novel coronavirus\" and of having \"maliciously incited hostility from the international community to China.\" <br/>The question of Covid's origin is likely to remain shrouded in bitterness, acrimony and politics in both Washington and Beijing.<br/>The lack of information is both why President Biden ordered his intelligence agencies in 2021 to use \"every tool\" to look again for answers, and also why they're finding them so hard to come by. <br/>John's podcast on the hunt for the origin of Covid is coming soon on BBC Sounds and BBC Radio 4<br/>Covid origin likely China lab incident - FBI chief<br/>Covid origin studies say evidence points to market<br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

That's a good thing for communication, for families and for most people.\"<br/>Face coverings were first recommended in healthcare settings in June 2020.<br/>The requirement to wear them in other places, such as on buses and in shops, was then introduced later as the country opened up after Covid lockdown measures. <br/>This legal requirement ended in April last year but guidance for health and social care settings was kept in place.<br/>Now staff, patients, service users and visitors will no longer be routinely asked to wear face masks in these settings.<br/>The BBC has heard from people with health conditions who have concerns about the latest relaxation of the rules.<br/>Brian Keeley, from Aberdeen, had a heart transplant in 2013 and takes medication every day to suppress his immune system and prevent organ rejection.<br/>Although he expects medics in immunotherapy settings will continue to wear masks, Brian frequently has appointments in other healthcare settings where he fears people may not be as careful.<br/>He said: \"I go to clinic every six months, but I also have to go to the GP, to respiratory appointments, local clinics to give blood samples, vaccinations clinics that are full of people.<br/>\"These are things we have to do anyway and nobody there knows the level of vulnerability of people. <br/>\"I was at the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary recently and everyone there was wearing face masks.

The BBC has not seen or independently verified the WhatsApp messages nor the context in which they were sent.<br/>After congratulating the then education secretary Sir Gavin Williamson on delaying A-level exams for a few weeks - a shorter period than some teaching unions called for - Mr Hancock had some choice words. <br/>On 1 October 2020, Mr Hancock messaged Sir Gavin: \"Cracking announcement today. What a bunch of absolute arses the teaching unions are.\"<br/>Sir Gavin replied: \"I know they really really do just hate work.\"<br/>In response, Mr Hancock returned two laughing out loud and a bullseye emoji. <br/>Mr Hancock texted his old boss George Osborne, ex-chancellor and then-Evening Standard editor, on 28 April 2020 to \"call in a favour\" asking for a favourable front page, as he tried to reach his own deadline to reach 100,000 daily Covid tests. <br/>Mr Osborne replied: \"Yes - of course - all you need to do tomorrow is give some exclusive words to the Standard and I'll tell the team to splash it.\"<br/>After replying with a quote, Hancock later writes in capital letters: \"I WANT TO HIT MY TARGET!\"<br/>The editor answered bluntly: \"I gathered.\"  <br/>In another interaction, on 9 November 2020 Mr Hancock asked for an explanation about Mr Osborne calling for Boris Johnson to make testing his number one priority and insisted: \"OK but mass testing is going very well.\"<br/>\"No-one thinks testing is going well, Matt,\" Mr Osborne replied. <br/>Sir Gavin, messaging Mr Hancock, on 10 May 2020 ahead of schools reopening, asked for the health secretary's help in getting personal protective equipment (PPE) for schools \"as a last resort so they can't use it as a reason not to open\". <br/>The education secretary texted: \"All of them will [open] but some will just want to say they can't so they have an excuse to avoid having to teach, what joys!!!\"<br/>Boris Johnson had misgivings about the government's shielding advice in discussions with the chief medical officer Prof Sir Chris Whitty. In August 2020 the then-prime minister suggested that if renewed lockdown restrictions were needed over-65s be offered a choice on shielding.<br/>Mr Johnson, addressing Sir Chris in a WhatsApp group on 9 August, said: \"If you are over 65 your risk of dying from Covid is probably as big as your risk of falling down stairs. And we don't stop older people from using stairs. What do you think?\"      <br/>Sir Chris conceded that he \"would think twice before shielding unless it threatened the NHS\". Chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance replied: \"We haven't found shielding easy or very effective first time round.\"<br/>Only a few days previously, shielding had ended for more than two million clinically vulnerable people in England, Scotland and Wales. Since March 2020 they had been advised to stay at home to avoid contracting Covid. Shielding later returned. <br/>Helen Whately, who was social care minister at the time, travelled 50 miles to a Covid test centre so a relative could be tested in September 2020, according to the Telegraph. There were restricted numbers of home testing kits and the public had to book a slot at a testing centre, where they could swab themselves and it would be sent to a laboratory. <br/>Speaking of the experience on 19 September, she messaged Mr Hancock: \"So my mystery shopping shows the system is definitely working, at least for some.\"<br/>Mr Hancock enthusiastically replied \"for MOST!\", despite UK labs struggling to keep up with demand and people being asked to travel hundreds of miles to get tested. <br/>Mr Hancock clashed with Sir Gavin over whether to close schools ahead of their return January 2021. <br/>In private WhatsApp messages with a special adviser, he said he had to take \"rear guard action\" to ensure schools did not open, while the then-education secretary was battling to keep children in school. <br/>During a meeting on Zoom on 28 December 2020 to decide on the fate of students, Mr Hancock and his special adviser Emma Dean appeared to send each other messages commenting on the call, according to the Telegraph. <br/>Ms Dean said: He's [Sir Gavin] freaking out. You can tell he isn't being wholly rational.\"<br/>Mr Hancock got his way as schools closed days later amid a national lockdown.<br/>In an earlier exchange in September the pair took aim at Sir Gavin following the education secretary being forced to abandon A-level and GCSE students being given grades by algorithm. <br/>Replying to Ms Dean's suggestion Gavin looked awful and questioning if the education secretary was OK, Mr Hancock said: \"He needs a haircut and a holiday somewhere other than Scarborough!\"<br/>During the May 2020 drive to hit the 100,000 tests per day target, trucks full were bought from Amazon.<br/>Mr Hancock was worried the government could look \"flaky\" if it was accused of using them to pad the stats.<br/>But there was jubilation when the target was hit - not least from Gina Coladangelo, the aide with whom Mr Hancock had an affair.<br/>She messaged: \"Drinks cold in fridge at [Department for Health]. Feel free to open them before we are back [beer emoji]\".<br/>But problems continued. Mr Johnson admitted in June he was \"going quietly crackers\" over capacity, asking \"what is wrong with us as a country that we can't fix this?\".<br/>In September, Mr Hancock was advised to avoid an interview with Andrew Neil \"because he could go hard on testing\".<br/>One set of messages shows Boris Johnson getting in a muddle over statistics.<br/>He flagged a Financial Times article stating the global case fatality rate had fallen below 0.04. Mr Johnson wanted to know why the British death rate appeared to be much higher at 4%.<br/>Chief scientific officer Sir Patrick, chief medical officer Sir Chris, aide Dominic Cummings, Cabinet Secretary Simon Case and Mr Hancock all chipped in.<br/>When Mr Vallance eventually pointed out the FT figure is a probability, not a percentage, the PM replied \"Eh\" followed by another message reading simply \"?\".<br/>He offers \"five marks\" to whoever can explain the difference and asks them to \"show working\" - before Mr Cummings assures him it is a \"common confusion\".<br/>In the same exchange, Mr Johnson says he \"knows what I would prefer\" if he was 80 and given a choice between exposure to Covid-19 and \"destroying the economy\".<br/>A collection of more than 100,000 messages sent between former Health Secretary Matt Hancock and other ministers and officials at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic have been obtained by the Telegraph.

The Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) has been studying coronaviruses in bats for over a decade.<br/>The institute is a 40-minute drive from the Huanan wet market where the first cluster of infections emerged.<br/>Those who entertain the theory say it could have leaked from a WIV lab and spread to the wet market. Most argue it would have been an unaltered virus collected from the wild, rather than engineered.<br/>The controversial theory first emerged early on in the pandemic, and was promoted by then-US President Donald Trump. Some even suggested it could have been engineered as a possible biological weapon.<br/>While many in the media and politics dismissed these as conspiracy theories at the time, others called for more consideration of the possibility. The idea has persisted, despite many scientists pointing out there is no evidence to back it up.<br/>A classified US intelligence report - saying three researchers at the Wuhan laboratory were treated in hospital in November 2019, just before the virus began infecting humans in the city - began circulating in US media in 2021.  <br/>But it was reported the Biden administration had shut down a state department investigation, set up by President Trump, into the lab-leak theory.<br/>\"That possibility certainly exists, and I am totally in favour of a full investigation of whether that could have happened,\" Anthony Fauci, President Biden's chief medical adviser, told a US Senate committee hearing in May 2021.<br/>President Biden says he asked for a report on the origins of Covid-19 after taking office in 2021, \"including whether it emerged from human contact with an infected animal or from a laboratory accident\".<br/>In May 2021, Mr Biden ordered intelligence officials to \"redouble\" their efforts on this.<br/>The issue is still hotly contested.<br/>A World Health Organization (WHO) investigation was supposed to get to the bottom of it, but many experts believed it produced more questions than answers.<br/>A team of WHO-appointed scientists flew to Wuhan in early 2021 on a mission to investigate the source of the pandemic. After spending 12 days there, which included a visit to the laboratory, the team concluded the lab-leak theory was \"extremely unlikely\".<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Dr Peter Daszak: \"Our focus needs to shift to those supply chains to the (Huanan Seafood) Market\"<br/>But many have since questioned their findings. <br/>A prominent group of scientists criticised the WHO report for not taking the lab-leak theory seriously enough - it was dismissed in a few pages of a several-hundred-page report.<br/>\"We must take hypotheses about both natural and laboratory spillovers seriously until we have sufficient data,\" the scientists wrote in Science Magazine.<br/>They're not the only experts who called for the laboratory leak to be looked at more closely.<br/>Even the WHO's own director-general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, called for a new investigation, saying: \"All hypotheses remain open and require further study.\"<br/>And Dr Fauci said in 2021 he was \"not convinced\" the virus originated naturally. That was a shift from a year earlier, when he thought it most likely Covid had spread from animals to humans.<br/>China has hit back at suggestions the virus may have escaped from a laboratory by calling it a smear. State media have consistently accused the US government and Western media of spreading rumours about the source of the pandemic.<br/>Responding to Mr Wray's remarks, China's foreign ministry spokesperson accused US intelligence agencies of politicising the investigation into the origins of the virus.<br/>The US intelligence community had a history of \"misdeeds\" involving \"fraud and deception\", Mao Ning told a press briefing. As such, she said, their conclusions regarding the origins of Covid-19 had no credibility.<br/>China has pushed another theory, suggesting the coronavirus may have entered Wuhan in food shipments of frozen meat from elsewhere in China or South-East Asia. <br/>The Chinese government has also pointed to research published by one of its leading virologists into samples collected from bats in a remote, abandoned mine. <br/>Prof Shi Zhengli - often referred to as \"China's Batwoman\" - a researcher at the Wuhan Institute, published a report in 2021 revealing that her team had identified eight coronavirus strains found on bats in the mine in China in 2015. The paper says that coronaviruses from pangolins pose more of an immediate threat to human health than the ones her team found in the mine.<br/>Added to this is an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory long pushed by Chinese propagandists - and repeated by Mao Ning at the foreign ministry briefing on 1 March 2023 - suggesting  the coronavirus was made and leaked from Fort Detrick in Frederick, Maryland, about 80km (50 miles) north of Washington DC.<br/>Once the centre of the US biological weapons programme, Fort Detrick currently houses biomedical labs researching viruses including Ebola and smallpox.<br/>Yes, and it's called the \"natural origin\" theory.<br/>This argues the virus spread naturally from animals, without the involvement of any scientists or laboratories.<br/>Supporters of the natural origin hypothesis say Covid-19 emerged in bats and then jumped to humans, most likely through another animal, or \"intermediary host\".<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Covid-19 and Wuhan: Why don't we know more?<br/>That idea was backed by the WHO report, which said it was \"likely to very likely\" that Covid had made it to humans through an intermediate host.<br/>This hypothesis was widely accepted at the start of the pandemic, but as time has worn on, scientists have not found a virus in either bats or another animal that matches the genetic make-up of Covid-19, leading some to doubt the theory.<br/>Nevertheless, following FBI Director Wray's remarks, many scientists who have studied the virus have stressed there is no new scientific evidence pointing to a lab leak.<br/>A natural origin is still the more likely theory, said Professor David Robertson, head of viral genomics and bioinformatics at the University of Glasgow.<br/>\"There's been an accumulation of evidence (what we know about the viruses biology, the close variants circulating in bats and locations of early human cases) that firmly points to a natural origin centred on the Huanan market in Wuhan city,\" he said.<br/>Prof Alice Hughes from the University of Hong Kong agreed. She said the US Department of Energy's conclusion that the virus was most likely the result of a lab leak in Wuhan \"appears not to be based on new evidence, and remains the weaker of the two main hypothesis of the origin of the virus\". <br/>Given the massive human toll of the pandemic - with the recorded deaths of about 6.9 million people worldwide - most scientists think understanding how and where the virus originated is crucial to prevent it happening again.<br/>If the \"zoonotic\" theory is proved correct, it could affect activities such as farming and wildlife exploitation. In Denmark, fears about the spread of the virus through mink farming led to millions of mink being culled.<br/>But there would also be big implications for scientific research and international trade if theories related to a laboratory leak or frozen food chains were confirmed. <br/>Any confirmation of a leak may also affect how the world views China, which has already been accused of hiding crucial early information about the pandemic, and place further strain on US-China relations.<br/>\"From day one China has been engaged in a massive cover-up,\" Jamie Metzl, a fellow at the Washington-based Atlantic Council who has been pushing for the lab-leak theory to be looked into, told the BBC in 2021<br/>\"We should be demanding the full investigation of all origin hypotheses that's required.\"<br/>But others have cautioned against pointing the finger at China too quickly.<br/>\"We do need to be a bit patient but we also need to be diplomatic. We can't do this without support from China. It needs to be a no-blame environment,\" Prof Dale Fisher, of Singapore's National University Hospital, told the BBC.<br/>China hits back as US revisits Covid lab theory<br/>Covid lab leak in China 'extremely unlikely' - WHO<br/>Wuhan scientist 'welcomes' visit over lab leak claim<br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

They offer greater protection against severe disease or death. <br/>China claims to have made about half of all the world's Covid vaccine stock. But the government has not given approval to foreign-produced mRNA vaccines for general use in mainland China. <br/>BioNTech, the German company which partnered with Pfizer to produce a Covid vaccine, has also worked with a Shanghai-based company, Fosun Pharma, to develop the same mRNA-based vaccine.<br/>This has been made available to German nationals living in China, and is also available in Hong Kong and Macau. However, it is not currently authorised for the Chinese mainland market.<br/>China is reported to be developing its own mRNA vaccines, and although one has been given approval for emergency use in Indonesia, it is not being used in China at the moment.<br/>When asked about the EU offer to send surplus stock of its mRNA vaccines, a Chinese official spokesperson, Mao Ning, said that China already had an adequate supply of vaccines.<br/>\"China's Covid situation is predictable and under control,\"\u2002she told a news conference on 3 January.<br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

That figure is three times higher than officially recorded deaths from the disease.<br/>Separate analysis by the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates about 15 million excess deaths due to coronavirus over a similar period.<br/>Nearly every nation in the world is now administering vaccines and publishing rollout data, while at least 157 countries and territories have moved on to booster jabs. <br/>The map below, using figures collated by Our World in Data - a collaboration between Oxford University and an educational charity - shows the total number of doses given per 100 people, mostly first doses.<br/>According to that data, more than 64% of people have been fully vaccinated on every continent apart from Africa, where the figure is about 20%.<br/>\n                        Percent of people fully vaccinated\n                    <br/>\n                            Please upgrade your browser to see the full interactive\n                        <br/>\n                    This information is regularly updated but may not reflect the latest totals or vaccines administered for each location. Total doses may include booster doses in addition to those required for full vaccination. The definition of full vaccination varies by location and vaccine type and is subject to change over time. Full vaccination can refer to a person receiving all required doses of a specific vaccine or sometimes recovery from infection plus one dose of a vaccine. Definitions have not yet been updated to account for booster campaigns to control the spread of new variants. Some locations may reach vaccination rates over 100%, such as Gibraltar, due to population estimates that are lower than the number of people who have now been vaccinated in that place. \n                <br/>\n                    Source: Our World in Data\n                <br/>\n                    Last updated: 5 July 2022, 13:28 BST\n                <br/>Some countries have secured more vaccine doses than their populations need, while other lower-income countries are relying on a global plan known as Covax, which is seeking to ensure everyone in the world has access to a vaccine. <br/>Of those countries that have moved on to booster campaigns, Chile, Uruguay and Singapore have currently vaccinated the highest proportion of people. <br/>Daily global cases fell after a spike in the spring but are now rising again, with the emergence of the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants of the Omicron variant.<br/>Studies suggest that Omicron - which quickly became dominant in numerous countries - is milder than the Delta variant, but far more contagious. The subvariants are even more contagious. <br/>Asia<br/>Asia, which was the centre of the initial outbreak that spread from Wuhan in China in early 2020, shows a mixed picture.<br/>North Korea, which admitted its first Covid infections in May of this year, has now seen 4.75 million symptomatic \"fever cases\" according to the state news agency. <br/>China appears to have recovered from a recent spike which earlier saw thousands of cases reported each day and millions of people placed under lockdown in large cities such as Shanghai. However, a fresh outbreak appears to be under way in eastern Anhui Province.<br/>In Japan, after two years of closure the government reopened its borders to visitors from 98 countries and regions but with strict limitations. <br/>It marked the most significant moment so far in the country's slow relaxation of its Covid-19 entry restrictions.<br/>Europe<br/>Reported daily cases are rising in several European countries, due to the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants. Testing is also now more limited than at previous points in the pandemic.<br/>In the UK, the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show a 32% jump in infections last week. Hospitalisations are also increasing. <br/>North America<br/>The US has recorded 87 million cases and more than a million deaths - the highest figures in the world. <br/>However, daily cases and death counts have now fallen to lower levels than during much of the pandemic. <br/>Latin America<br/>Latin America is seeing some pockets of rising cases, though infections are at low levels among the countries which were hardest hit previously.<br/>Mexico and Guatemala are among countries seeing a rise in June.<br/>Brazil has been the worst-hit country in the region overall, recording more than 32 million cases and 672,000 deaths - the world's second-highest official death toll. <br/>In Peru, there have been over 213,000 deaths and the country has the world's highest number of deaths by population size - more than 657 deaths for every 100,000 people.<br/>Africa<br/>Africa has seen more than 12 million cases and 255,000 deaths - but the true extent of the pandemic across the continent is not known as testing rates are low.<br/>According to the official figures, South Africa has been the worst-hit country with more than 4 million confirmed cases and more than 100,000 deaths. <br/>South Africa was the first country to identify the new Omicron variant and it led to a sharp increase in infections - the fourth wave of infections in the country.<br/>Middle East<br/>Several countries in the Middle East have seen severe outbreaks of the virus since the pandemic began, though levels are currently at their lowest this year.<br/>The official death toll in Iran, the region's worst-hit country, is more than 140,000 and it has seen over seven million confirmed cases. <br/>Neighbouring Iraq has seen 25,000 deaths and in excess of two million confirmed cases.<br/>In January Israel was hit by the Omicron wave seen across the world, but infections have now come down. Its vaccination rollout has been highly successful at minimising the number of hospitalisations and deaths in the country. <br/>Oceania<br/>Early in the pandemic, Australia and New Zealand were widely praised for their response to Covid but both saw an increase in cases at the start of the year. <br/>So far, Australia has seen more than 8 million confirmed cases, with spikes in January and April. It has also recorded more than 10,000 confirmed deaths due to coronavirus.<br/>Daily cases are rising in New Zealand following a fall. So far it recorded 1.3 million cases, but only 1,535 deaths.<br/>In early May the country opened its borders to international visitors for the first time in two years.<br/>Covid-19 was first detected in the city of Wuhan, China, in late 2019 but the outbreak spread quickly across the globe in the first months of 2020.<br/>It was declared a global pandemic by the WHO on 11 March 2020.<br/>A pandemic is when an infectious disease is passing easily from person to person in many parts of the world at the same time. <br/>The data used on this page comes from a variety of sources. It includes figures collated by Johns Hopkins University as well as national governments and health agencies.<br/>When comparing figures from different countries it is important to bear in mind that not all governments are recording coronavirus cases and deaths in the same way. This makes like for like comparisons between countries difficult.<br/>Other factors to consider include: different population sizes, the size of a country's elderly population or whether a particular country has a large amount of its people living in densely-populated areas.

More than 49 million - 85% of over-12s - have had both doses.<br/>While uptake of first and second doses dropped off late last year, there was a steep rise in people having boosters. However, booster numbers dipped over the Christmas holiday period and remain low. <br/>More than 38 million booster doses have been administered across the UK so far.<br/>Overall vaccination rates have now levelled off in every age group in England apart from the youngest bands.<br/>The aim of the vaccination programme is to protect as many people as possible from serious illness through developing the UK population's immunity against Covid-19.<br/>Data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggests more than nine in 10 adults in the UK now have coronavirus antibodies - which is evidence of a past Covid infection or having received at least one dose of a vaccine.<br/>However, this figure does not tell us how many people are protected from infection or how close we are to reaching herd immunity - the point at which everyone is protected, directly or indirectly, as a result of high immunity levels in the population.<br/>Across the country, there continues to be some variation in the vaccine programme.<br/>Scotland has vaccinated 93% of those aged 12 and over with at least one dose, while England and Wales have hit 92% and Northern Ireland 89%.<br/>Second doses are also being rolled out, with all nations reaching more than 80% of over-12s so far.<br/>Across the English regions, the South West has vaccinated 87% of the same age group with at least one dose, while London has reached 70%.<br/>When looking at boosters, the South West has reached 68% of people aged 12 and over, while for London the figure is 46%.<br/>There have also been disparities between ethnic groups and poorer and wealthier areas.<br/>Analysis of NHS records by the OpenSAFELY group - a collaboration between Oxford University and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine - shows that black people were the least likely to have received a booster vaccine.<br/>The study was based on more than 20 million patient records in England and covers people not living in care homes. Areas of London are under-represented in the data.<br/>In addition, booster take-up in poorer areas is lower than in more affluent areas.<br/>Currently, the Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna, Novavax and one-shot Janssen vaccines are approved for use throughout the UK. <br/>Others, such that produced by CureVac, have not yet been given the green light.<br/>The UK had ordered more than 540 million doses of seven of the most promising vaccines, including the four so far approved for use. <br/>In addition, the government has now signed deals to buy 114 million more doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to use in 2022 and 2023. <br/>French vaccine maker Valneva said the UK government had scrapped a deal for 100m doses of its vaccine, which is yet to be approved.<br/>Will a vaccine give us our old lives back?<br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

The more Covid that is circulating, the more chance there is for the virus to mutate. <br/>But new variants can pop up anywhere - the UK, Brazil, South Africa and India have all been the likely origins of previous variants of concern.<br/>So will the new Covid test restrictions make any difference?<br/>Several countries are asking travellers from China to produce a negative Covid test in order to gain entry. <br/>The US said this would \"slow the spread\" of the virus, while scientists worked to identify any potential variants that may emerge. But no-one is suggesting that this will stop Covid cases coming in. <br/>Italy has gone further, and is imposing mandatory post-arrival PCR tests on travellers from China. Those that test positive will need to quarantine for several days. <br/>This has the advantage of enabling genomic sequencing of the virus, and so aids the search for new variants. But it will also add to airport congestion.   <br/>Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said that those travellers from China who have tested positive so far are carriers of \"Omicron variants already present in Italy\". Italy wants an EU-wide approach on the issue - but the EU's disease agency says, for many reasons, that is \"unjustified\".<br/>In the UK, there is plenty of Covid about. Probably well over a million people a week are getting infected, either at work, home or socialising - in other words anywhere people gather. The latest ONS survey estimated that around 1 in 45 people had the virus earlier this month.<br/>But most of the UK population is very well protected from severe illness, via a combination of vaccines and repeated natural infection.<br/>That means Covid - while still a potential danger here - is no longer the threat it once was.  <br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Hope and worry as Beijing relaxes zero-Covid policy<br/>How many Covid cases are there in China?<br/>US demands Covid tests for visitors from China<br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

The new genetic versions that keep appearing are called variants. <br/>There have been a few major variants already, such as alpha and delta, that have caused massive waves of infection. <br/>The latest ones experts are concerned about - BA.4 and BA.5 - are very closely related to the Omicron variant behind last winter's wave.<br/>They were added to the World Health Organization's monitoring list in March and have also been designated as variants of concern in Europe.<br/>They were spotted circulating in South Africa at the beginning of the year and now appear to be spreading much more quickly than other variants.<br/>Most European countries now have them and they look set to overtake other types of Covid soon. That's already happened in Portugal - BA.5 is now dominant there. <br/>In the US, officials say they are seeing rising numbers of infections caused by the two new subvariants. <br/>Covid infections in the UK are also increasing, driven by BA.4 and BA.5. <br/>Australia has reported cases too.<br/>Experts are unsure how hard countries will be hit.<br/>BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron are not thought to be any more lethal than other types of Covid. <br/>Lots of people have built up some immunity from past infections and vaccination, which is helping to make the disease less risky overall.<br/>But the new subvariants do appear to be spreading more easily.<br/>This is partly because immunity may be waning, but also because of the mutations the virus has undergone. <br/>Many countries have also lifted their Covid restrictions, meaning people are mixing more, which gives the virus more chances to spread.<br/>BA.4 and BA.5 appear to be able to infect people even if they've recently had other types of Omicron. <br/>A wave of new infections could lead to more hospitalisations and some more deaths.<br/>As with other Covid variants, the risk or serious illness remains highest for people who are elderly, or who have significant underlying health conditions. <br/>Although current vaccines are not a perfect fit, they are still the best line of defence. <br/>They have cut the risk of severe illness against the other major Covid variants, including Delta, Alpha, Beta and Gamma. <br/>Doctors say it is vital people get the recommended number of doses to gain maximum protection against existing and emerging variants. <br/>Updated versions of vaccines against Covid variants are already being designed and tested.<br/>Manufacturers could scale up production quickly too, and regulators have already discussed how to fast-track the approval process. <br/>Viruses make carbon copies of themselves to reproduce, but they aren't perfect at it. Errors creep in that change the genetic blueprint, resulting in a new version of the virus. <br/>If this gives the virus a survival advantage, the new version will thrive. <br/>The more chances coronavirus has to make copies of itself in us - the host - the more opportunities there are for mutations to occur. <br/>How many people have had boosters so far?<br/>Covid map: Where are cases the highest?<br/>Kyiv under attack as African leaders visit on peace mission<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - the changing face of Russia's dead<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Professional soldiers to petty thieves - changing face of Russia's war dead<br/>The BBC's North Korea investigation: How we did it, and why<br/>Quiz of the week: What was blamed on Beyonc\u00e9?<br/>The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence<br/>iPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sour<br/>The Indians taking on giant Saudi-backed refinery<br/>The pop band who ditched Mormonism and found themselves<br/>Can African leaders bring peace to Ukraine?<br/>'Survivors took refuge in trees - and died of hunger'<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.
