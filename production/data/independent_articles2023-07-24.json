Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe late BBC newsreader George Alagiah said in a final report on BBC News \u201cI have gotten to a place to see life as a gift\u201d.The award-winning journalist, who had presented the BBC News At Six for the last 20 years, died on Monday from bowel cancer after being first diagnosed in 2014. He was 67.At the end of Monday\u2019s edition of the programme, his former colleague Sophie Raworth revealed Alagiah had hoped to come into the BBC studio one last time to thank the viewers but did not get the chance.In a video montage in his honour which featured clips and pictures, Alagiah admitted it had taken him time to process the diagnosis after he was first told he had bowel cancer.\u201cMy life, for what it is worth, is divided into pre-cancer and post-cancer. The weird thing about a bowel cancer journey is you don\u2019t really know the beginning and you don\u2019t really know the end,\u201d he said in the video.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow live\u201cSo I know the day I was diagnosed with bowel cancer, but I don\u2019t know when it started. Because I was at the top of my game, I was having a fantastic time at work and home, and then suddenly you hear those words \u2018I\u2019m sorry to tell you Mr Alagiah, you\u2019ve got bowel cancer\u2019.\u201cAt first when you\u2019re told, you don\u2019t know how to respond and it took me a while to understand what I needed to do.\u201dHe continued: \u201cFor me, I had to get a place of contentment and the only way I knew how to do that was literally to look back at my life.\u201cActually, when I look back to my journey, where it all started, looked at the family I had, the opportunities my family had, the great good fortune to bump into Fran who\u2019s been my wife and lover for all these years. The kids that we brought up, it didn\u2019t feel like a failure.\u201cI wish I hadn\u2019t had cancer, obviously. But I have cancer and I\u2019m glad of the things I\u2019ve learned about myself and about my community, my friends and my family as a result\u201cI have gotten to a place to see life as a gift. Rather than kind of worrying about when it\u2019s going to end and how it\u2019s going to end, I\u2019ve got to a place where I can see it for the gift it is. I feel that gift keenly every morning.\u201dBefore airing the video on the BBC\u2019s News At Six, Raworth remembered Alagiah as a \u201cman of great values and indomitable spirit\u201d.She recalled launching the evening news show with him 20 years in January 2003, saying that he felt \u201cenormously proud and privileged\u201d to be presenting the programme.\u201cHe loved being in the newsroom, being part of the team, and he made a good cup of tea as well. We all adored him,\u201d she added.\u201cHe felt a real connection with the audience too. After he was diagnosed with cancer, just over nine years ago, he received thousands of letters and messages from people who wrote to him as if they knew each other, strangers who spoke to him as a friend.\u201cHe was really touched by your support. George was a man of great values and indomitable spirit. A big smile of velvety love, a great friend.\u201dBBC newsreaders Clive Myrie and Naga Munchetty fought back tears earlier in the day as they delivered the news of his death on air.Broadcaster Myrie became emotional as he paid tribute to Alagiah during the lunchtime BBC News broadcast, saying: \u201cOn a personal note, George touched all of us here in the newsroom with his kindness and generosity, his warmth and good humour.\u201cWe loved him here at BBC News and I loved him as a mentor, colleague and friend.\u201cHis spirit, strength and courage in the later years of his life is something his family can be so proud of. Journalism has lost a giant.\u201dMunchetty also became choked up as she interrupted her live show on BBC Radio 5 Live around midday to deliver the news.As her voice broke, she said: \u201cApologies for the emotion in my voice \u2013 he was so loved in our newsroom.\u201dAlagiah, who was born in Sri Lanka, continued to present for the BBC when he was not receiving treatment.He joined the corporation in 1989 and spent many years as one of its leading foreign correspondents before moving to presenting.He was a specialist in Africa and covered the civil wars in Somalia and Liberia as well as the genocide in Rwanda 20 years ago.Throughout his career he interviewed central political figures, among them former South African president Nelson Mandela, Archbishop Desmond Tutu and ex-Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe.He was nominated for a Bafta in 1994 for his coverage of Saddam Hussein\u2019s genocidal campaign against the Kurds of northern Iraq and was named Amnesty International\u2019s journalist of the year in 1994 for reporting on the civil war in Burundi.He first began hosting the 6pm news bulletin in early 2003, but stepped up to front it solo four years later following the departure of his co-host, Natasha Kaplinsky.Kaplinsky wrote on Instagram: \u201cGoodbye dearest George. I will miss you so very much. It was such a privilege to be your friend.\u201dBBC director-general Tim Davie said: \u201cAcross the BBC, we are all incredibly sad to hear the news about George. We are thinking of his family at this time.\u201cGeorge was one of the best and bravest journalists of his generation who reported fearlessly from across the world as well as presenting the news flawlessly.\u201cHe was more than just an outstanding journalist, audiences could sense his kindness, empathy and wonderful humanity. He was loved by all and we will miss him enormously.\u201dQuestion Time presenter Fiona Bruce said Alagiah was \u201cthat rare thing \u2013 a first-rate journalist and an all round lovely human being.\u201dShe added: \u201cIntegrity and decency shone through him. That and a mischievous sense of humour with an endearing giggle.\u201dIn a piece for the Telegraph, Bruce recalled being selected alongside Alagiah in 1999 as one the new faces of BBC News, saying: \u201cGeorge was a brilliant choice, whether he knew it was coming or not.\u201cAuthority and warmth is what you are always after when anchoring a live news broadcast. George had both in spades, and it came from such an authentic place.\u201dShe added that having him as a colleague and friend when they were both propelled into the public eye was \u201calways immensely comforting\u201d as she knew he was one of the few people she could \u201cabsolutely trust\u201d.Nick Robinson, presenter of BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, paid tribute saying: \u201cGeorge was a brilliant journalist, a lovely man and an inspiring example to all fighting serious illness. His friends will miss him deeply.\u201dBroadcaster John Simpson said: \u201cA gentler, kinder, more insightful and braver friend and colleague it would be hard to find.\u201cI loved having his company in the BBC World Affairs Unit, and his progress after that was a pleasure to watch.\u201dFormer BBC correspondent Jon Sopel added: \u201cTributes will rightly be paid to a fantastic journalist and brilliant broadcaster \u2013 but George was the most decent, principled, kindest, most honourable man I have ever worked with. What a loss.\u201dLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he was \u201cdeeply saddened\u201d by news of Alagiah\u2019s death.He said: \u201cA much-loved face of BBC News for decades, George will also be remembered for his brilliant, fearless journalism as foreign correspondent. He rightly won awards for his evocative, boundary pushing reporting. British journalism has lost a talent. My thoughts are with his family and loved ones.\u201dAfter his diagnosis Alagiah endured two rounds of chemotherapy and several operations, including the removal of most of his liver.He returned to work after his treatment was over but the cancer came back and spread, leading to breaks from the studio while he received treatment.Following his diagnosis, Alagiah also campaigned for cancer charities, including Macmillan Cancer Support and Bowel Cancer UK, to help raise awareness.Before joining the BBC, Alagiah worked as a print journalist and went on to write a number of books including A Home From Home, which looked at what it means to be British.Throughout his illustrious career, he also presented other shows such as Mixed Britannia, looking at the UK\u2019s mixed-race population.RecommendedRising temperatures \u2018likely to be beneficial\u2019 for Britain, says Lord FrostHouse of Lords could be replaced by bots with \u2018higher productivity\u2019, says peerRelatives of infected blood victims demand full compensation in letter to No 10He was made an OBE in the 2008 New Year Honours.He is survived by his wife of 40 years, Frances Robathan, their two sons and three grandchildren."}, {"_id": "64bef80b51ac33362ba19b0f", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/greece-fires-rhodes-corfu-rescue-flights-b2380957.html", "primaryCategory": "Home News", "subCategories": "test", "title": "UK rescue flights for tourists fleeing \u2018out of control\u2019 wildfires on Rhodes and Corfu", "lead": "<p>\u2018Out of control\u2019 fires spark largest evacuation in Greek history, as Ryanair continues flights </p>", "author": "Simon Calder and Andy Gregory", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 21:56:51", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:39.968353", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-24T21:56:51+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/24/18/newFile-2.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Get the free Morning Headlines email for news from our reporters across the worldSign up to our free Morning Headlines email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Rising temperatures are likely to be beneficial.\n\nI don't think the families of people who died because of heat are very much cheered by the fact that there are fewer people dying because of coldLord Deben\u201cThe Government Actuary\u2019s Department, no less, wrote in April this year, and I quote, \u2018it is the low winter temperatures that have a greater effect on the number of deaths\u2019. Since the start of the millennium, a decline in deaths from cold temperature periods has more than offset any increase in the number of deaths associated with warmer temperature over the same period.\u201cNow, I\u2019m not sceptical about adaptation. I\u2019m sceptical about mitigation.\u201cI suggest that the rational thing to do is to move away from the current high-cost mitigation efforts, efforts which also involve massive investments in unproductive renewables, huge changes in lifestyles as well as crushing economic growth, and pursue mitigation in a different way.\u201cInvesting in effective energy production, nuclear, gas, other technologies as they emerge, and meanwhile, spend the manageable sums that we need to on adaptation so we can adjust to the perfectly manageable consequences of slowly rising temperatures as they emerge.\u201dSpeaking after Lord Frost, Labour former minister Lord Whitty said: \u201cThe idea that we can have a choice between mitigation and adaptation is absurd. We need both.\u201dReferring to the recent by-election in Uxbridge and South Ruislip, he added: \u201cAs to the current furore in the newspapers over the weekend after a by-election in which 250 people voted the wrong way, we have the pressure on the leaders of our two main parties to back off from their commitment to green policies and to climate change.\u201cI find that absolutely absurd.\u201d\n\nWe will see... more vector-related diseases, mosquito-related diseases such as Zika virus, West Nile fever and indeed, potentially, malaria in the future if the predictions are correctLord KakkarSome Tories have been calling for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to delay climate pledges after the party narrowly held on to Uxbridge and South Ruislip in last week\u2019s by-election, with Labour\u2019s failure to win being attributed to the expansion of London\u2019s Ultra Low Emission Zone (Ulez) scheme.Tory former environment minister Lord Deben, who recently left his role as chairman of the Climate Change Committee, said: \u201cWe do have a certainty here. The weather is changing. It\u2019s changing dramatically and we have actually to sort out our acceptance to it.\u201cAnd that means that we can\u2019t talk about deaths as Lord Frost did. I don\u2019t think the families of people who died because of heat are very much cheered by the fact that there are fewer people dying because of cold.\u201cThe fact of the matter is we have to deal with these problems.

But he pledged to meet the ambition by the middle of the decade with intensive building in cities, as he unveiled plans that would make it easier to convert empty retail premises into flats, as well as a push to expand Cambridge.It comes after The Independent revealed that the majority of councils had failed to build a single social home in the past five years, as 1.2 million families languish on waiting lists.Housing charities described Mr Gove\u2019s plan as a \u201cmixed bag\u201d and warned that stuffing people into unsuitable converted accommodation could make the housing crisis worse.RecommendedWhat are Government\u2019s latest housing proposals and will they help with crisis?Sunak confirms bulk of Britain\u2019s new homes will not \u2018concrete over the countryside\u2019 as Gove announces reformsRishi Sunak hits out at \u2018top-down targets\u2019 on housebuildingAnd Conservative MPs \u2013 some of whom are against new housing in their areas \u2013 seized on the housing secretary\u2019s plan for an urban extension of Cambridge and vowed to fight it.In a speech in King\u2019s Cross, Mr Gove said the government would be \u201cunequivocally, unapologetically and intensively concentrating our biggest efforts in the hearts of our cities\u201d.\u201cWe haven\u2019t dropped the 300,000 target,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a conclusion that people have drawn erroneously, if I can put it politely.\u201dAsked about reports that ministers are changing the target so that it is no longer mandatory, he said: \u201cIt never was. The 300,000 target remains as it always has been.\u201dMr Gove however conceded that the government was making \u201cspecific changes\u201d to the National Planning Policy Framework that would alter the way the local plans are drawn up.Under these changes, the way the national ambition for 300,000 homes is translated into local housing targets would give individual councils more room for manoeuvre. Critics say it will result in fewer homes being built.Prime minister Rishi Sunak was also talking about housing on Monday (PA Wire)A report by the Commons housing committee published earlier this month said these plans would make it \u201cimpossible to achieve\u201d the 300,000 ambition nationally.But Mr Gove on Monday said he was \u201cconfident we\u2019re on a trajectory to reach that 300,000 target\u201d. The housing secretary also used his speech to accuse Labour of wanting to concrete over the countryside after the opposition announced earlier this year that it wanted to build more housing on green-belt land. The housing secretary said the opposition\u2019s approach to planning would lead to \u201cerosion of environmental assets,\u201d \u201ccommunities opposing development\u201d, and that it would not provide \u201cthe scale of growth that we need\u201d.But shadow housing secretary Lisa Nandy said: \u201cIt takes some serious brass neck for the Tories to make yet more promises when the housing crisis has gone from bad to worse on their watch.\u201dQuizzing the government in the House of Lords, Labour\u2019s Baroness Taylor mocked the policy, telling peers: \u201cWith over a million people on social housing waiting lists, and 7,000 social rented homes built last year, does the minister really think a few flats built over chip shops is going to solve the problem? My Lords, it\u2019s like putting a sticking plaster on a severed limb.\u201dThe government has a target to be building 300,000 homes a year by the mid-2020s (PA Wire)Previous attempts by the government since 2010 to light a fire under housebuilding have met opposition from inside the Conservative Party, and Gove faces an uphill battle to get his plans through.Ahead of the speech, South Cambridgeshire MP Anthony Browne said he would \u201cdo everything I can to stop the government\u2019s nonsense plans to impose mass housebuilding on Cambridge\u201d. He said the area was already suffering from a water shortage which further development could make worse.Asked about the MP\u2019s comments Mr Gove replied: \u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll find a compelling way forward. We can\u2019t have Cambridge \u2013 an exceptional city \u2013 being held back.\u201dPolly Neate, chief executive of the housing charity Shelter, described the speech as \u201ca real mixed bag\u201d. \u201cWe need proper investment to build much-needed genuinely affordable homes, not more piecemeal reform,\u201d she said.\u201cConverting takeaways and shops into homes and restricting building to city centres won\u2019t help. It could risk creating poor quality, unsafe homes that cause more harm than good.\n\nUK news in picturesShow all 501/50UK news in pictures\n\nUK news in pictures24 July 2023Women embrace each other as one of them arrives at Gatwick Airport after being evacuated off the Greek island of RhodesReutersUK news in pictures23 July 2023People enjoying the weather on Bournemouth beach in DorsetPAUK news in pictures21 July 2023Newly elected Labour MP Keir Mather (left), with Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer at Selby football club, North Yorkshire, after winning the Selby and Ainsty by-electionPAUK news in pictures18 July 2023Tony Blair (left) speaks with Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer during the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change's Future of Britain Conference in central LondonPAUK news in pictures17 July 2023David Barber, the King\u2019s Swan Marker, examines a swan during the annual census of the swan population along sections of the River ThamesReutersUK news in pictures16 July 2023Spain\u2019s Carlos Alcaraz holds the winner\u2019s trophy after beating Serbia\u2019s Novak Djokovic during their men\u2019s singles final tennis match on the last day of the 2023 Wimbledon ChampionshipsAFP/GettyUK news in pictures15 July 2023Tunisia\u2019s Ons Jabeur is interviewed in the Media Theatre in the Broadcast Centre after her defeat in the final of the Ladies\u2019 Singles on day thirteen of the Wimbledon tennis championships in LondonPA WireUK news in pictures13 July 2023His Majesty The King\u2019s Coronation Ensemble and Her Majesty The Queen\u2019s Coronation Ensemble, during a photo call for the new Coronation display for the summer opening of the State Rooms at Buckingham Palace.PAUK news in pictures12 July 2023Beavers are released by the National Trust at Wallington estate in Northumberland in a project to improve local biodiversity and mitigate the effects of climate changePAUK news in pictures11 July 2023People hug as they admire Submergence inside Propyard, Bristol, where a 20,000 sq ft immersive art installation, curated by art collective Squidsoup, titled Beyond Submergence, is being exhibitedPAUK news in pictures10 July 2023Tracy Seven with a Beef Shorthorn as she prepares her cattle ahead of the Great Yorkshire Show at the Showground in Harrogate, which opens to the public on Tuesday.PAUK news in pictures9 July 2023Mark Wood, right, celebrates with Chris Woakes, left after England won the third test match in the seriesAFP via GettyUK news in pictures8 July 2023Zharnel Hughes of Shaftesbury celebrates after winning the Men\u2019s 100m Final at the UK Athletics Championships at Manchester Regional ArenaGettyUK news in pictures7 July 2023Andy Murray of Great Britain plays a backhand against Stefanos Tsitsipas of Greece in the Men's Singles second round match during day five of The Championships Wimbledon 2023 at All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet ClubGettyUK news in pictures6 July 2023Queen Camilla during a visit to Lochcarron of Scotland at the Waverley textile mill in Selkirk, in the Scottish Borders, as part of the first Holyrood Week since the King's coronation.PAUK news in pictures5 July 2023Anti-monarchy protesters hold placards near the St Giles\u2019 Cathedral on the day of the National Service of Dedication and Thanksgiving for Britain\u2019s King Charles, in EdinburghReutersUK news in pictures4 July 2023Andy Murray celebrates break point against Ryan Peniston in their men\u2019s singles first round match at Wimbledon GettyUK news in pictures3 July 2023A cigar smoked by Winston Churchill, which is expected to fetch \u00a3600-800 is pictured on his statue in Westerham, KentPAUK news in pictures2 July 2023England\u2019s Ben Stokes hits a six off the bowling of Australia\u2019s Josh Hazlewood during the last day of the second Ashes test at Lords Cricket Ground in LondonAction Images via ReutersUK news in pictures1 July 2023Pata Yamaha Prometeon rider Toprak Razgatiloglu followed by Aruba.It Racing -

The secretary of state clearly agrees these homes are essential, so the government should put its money where its mouth is and get on with building a new generation of social homes.\u201dStewart Baseley, the executive chair of the Home Builders Federation, said: \u201cWhilst welcoming the recognition from government that it needs to act if we are to build more homes, the proposals do little to address the major reasons why housing supply is falling.\u201cThe government needs to focus on why the planning process is collapsing and reverse the proposals to weaken the planning system that have now seen 59 local authorities withdraw their housing plans.\u201dRecommendedTories at war over green policies after Uxbridge by-election shockRevealed: Britain\u2019s council housing shame as majority of councils fail to build a single homeSpeaking during a visit to the West Midlands on Monday, Rishi Sunak said the government was \u201cmaking good progress\u201d towards the 300,000 target.\u201cActually, if you look at what has happened over the past few years, we have seen some of the biggest years for new housing supply that we\u2019ve seen in decades and in the last year that we have figures for, the highest number of first-time buyers in over 20 years,\u201d he said.\u201cWe are making progress, I\u2019m proud of that progress, and we\u2019re not stopping there.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeSuella Braverman breached her duty as home secretary by failing to provide asylum-seekers \u2013 including pregnant women and young children \u2013 with sufficient support while waiting for their claims to be determined, the High Court has ruled.The Royal Courts of Justice heard on Friday that Ms Braveman acted unlawfully in withholding \u00a33-a-week payments for healthy food for pregnant women and children between the ages of one and three while in the care of the British state.The legal challenge was brought by five asylum-seekers, three of whom complained delays in providing financial support risked breaching their human right to be free from degrading and inhuman treatment. The other two individuals challenged Home Office failures to make the payments while they were living in hotel accommodation.The ruling by Lord Justice Swift means the Home Office \u201cmust now start making these payments to the thousands of pregnant women and people with children under three years old in hotels without delay\u201d, legal firm Deighton Pierce Glynn, which represented some of the claimants, said.RecommendedInside \u2018quasi-prison\u2019 barge set to house 500 migrants - as we go on board for the first timeA beach tragedy highlights the EU\u2019s migration crisis \u2013 and how Spain\u2019s election could make things worseAsylum-seekers are barred from paid work during their first year in the UK, and cannot receive benefits, instead receiving accommodation and a general rate of \u00a347.39 a week in support.The Home Office, therefore, has a legal duty to provide them and any dependants with appropriate support, including \u00a33 each week for pregnant women.On Friday, Lord Justice Swift ruled that delays in the system meant that the home secretary\u2019s decision to provide this support only in the form of full-board hotel accommodation, rather than in cash, was unlawful.Suella Braverman was found to have breached her duty of care to asylum-seekers  (AP)The court also found that the Home Office\u2019s failure to provide emergency interim financial support to those waiting for a decision on their application for such support was unlawful.John Crowley, an associate solicitor at legal firm Leigh Day, said: \u201cIt cannot be right that people legitimately seeking asylum are made to suffer such degrading treatment. It is time for the Home Office to abide by its legal duties and rectify this wide-reaching problem.\u201dThe first asylum-seeker represented by the firm, known as K, is a single mother from India with a five-year-old child, who left her husband as a result of domestic violence. She and her daughter lived with her friend but had no money to meet their basic needs, so applied for \u201csubsistence only\u201d support in January 2022. While the Court has now given guidance that decisions should ordinarily be made within 10 days, the Home Office did not grant her application until August 2022, and only after the issue of a judicial review claim challenging the delays. She tried to get emergency financial support so that she could buy food but was told she would have to move into a hotel, which she feared would unsettle her daughter, and was an unnecessary expense.

After a delay of 11 weeks, the Home Office accepted he was destitute and granted him accommodation and financial support in May 2021. However, it then failed to provide accommodation for seven months and financial support for a year. The third claim was by an 82-year-old disabled female asylum-seeker from Pakistan known as AM, who applied for accommodation and financial support in November 2021. Despite calling numerous times, and pointing out that she was about to be made homeless, she was told that her documents had not been received. She was forced to re-apply multiple times and eventually launched legal action last October. After denying that it had ever received her documents, it transpired on the day before the final hearing in February 2023, that the Home Office had received AM\u2019s documents in June 2022, Leigh Day said.Recommended3,000 asylum seekers \u2018could be living on barge and ex-military sites by autumn\u2019Hundreds of migrants cross Channel as Illegal Migration Bill set to become lawA Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cWe are considering the court\u2019s findings and will respond in due course.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64bef80c51ac33362ba19b13", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/richard-okorogheye-death-what-happened-b2380960.html", "primaryCategory": "Home News", "subCategories": "test", "title": "What happened to missing teenager Richard Okorogheye?", "lead": "<p>An investigation found Mr Okorogheye should have been classed as a missing person earlier </p>", "author": "Martha McHardy", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 20:20:35", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:40.932302", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-24T20:20:35+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2021/03/29/18/newfile.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Get the free Morning Headlines email for news from our reporters across the worldSign up to our free Morning Headlines email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

However, none were found to have a case to answer for misconduct.RecommendedRichard Okorogheye: Grieving mother says \u2018every day is torment\u2019 one year after teen found dead in woodsPolice need to be trained not to discriminate against black families in missing person cases, say expertsRichard Okorogheye: Two more police officers face misconduct probe over missing teenager who diedWho was Richard Okorogheye? Richard Okorogheye was a student at Oxford Brookes University, studying computer science and cyber security.He had sickle cell disease which forced him to shield throughout the coronavirus pandemic, only leaving the house for hospital appointments for regular blood transfusions to treat his condition.Mr Okorogheye told his mother that he was \u201cstruggling to cope\u201d throughout lockdown.When did Richard Okorogheye go missing? The teenager left his home in West London on Monday, March 22, 2021, without his medication after telling his mother he was going out.His mother returned home from a nursing shift at around 9pm to discover he was missing but his wallet, bus pass and bank card had been left behind.The teenager\u2019s mother contacted police the following day, but her son was not officially recorded as missing until 8am on March 24.The Met Police said the student left his home headed in the direction of Ladbroke Grove at approximately 8.30pm on March 22.The last confirmed sighting of Mr Okorogheye was when he was seen boarding the 23 southbound bus in Ladbroke Grove at 8.44pm.Police said further enquires established that he then took a taxi journey from the W2 area of London to a street in Loughton, Essex.He was captured on CCTV walking alone on Smarts Lane, Loughton, towards Epping Forest at 12.39am on Tuesday 23 March.CCTV from the early hours of March showed the student wearing an all-black outfit and carrying a black satchel bag with a white Adidas logo.Richard Okorogheye (Evidence Joel )When was Richard Okorogheye\u2019s body found?Mr Okorogheye\u2019s body was found by police in a pond in Epping Forest on Easter Monday.Two days later, police confirmed the body was Richard\u2019s following a post-mortem examination, which found no evidence of physical trauma or assault.Detective Superintendent Danny Gosling, head of the Met\u2019s Central West Public Protection Unit, said: \u201cMy deepest sympathies go out to Richard\u2019s family at this incredibly difficult time.\u201cThis was not the outcome that any of us had hoped for and we will ensure that his grieving family are well-supported by specially trained officers.\u201cI would like to extend my thanks to the many officers, staff and members of the public who have each played a part in the extensive effort to locate Richard.\u201dCCTV from the early hours of March showed the student wearing an all-black outfit  (Supplied)Ms Joel described the discovery of her son\u2019s body as \u201cdevastating\u201d.She told The Evening Standard: \u201cMy baby will never come home to his mummy again. He was taken away from me too early.\u201cThe only child I have. It\u2019s devastating and the last thing I thought I\u2019d hear.\u201dHow did Richard Okorogheye die?Mr Okorogheye\u2019s cause of death was given as \u201cconsistent with drowning\u201d by consultant forensic pathologist Dr Benjamin Swift during the first day of an inquest held at Essex Coroner\u2019s Court in Chelmsford, on 24 July 2023.Dr Swift was told by Mr Okorogheye\u2019s family that he had been unable to swim and disliked water.Mr Swift said there were no acute injuries externally or internally on Mr Okorogheye\u2019s body and no marks of an offensive or defensive nature.Area coroner Sean Horstead decided the inquest would not look into the wider circumstances surrounding Mr Okorogheye\u2019s death, as his provisional view was that Mr Okorogheye had died by the time his mother first reported him missing to the police.What has Richard Okorogheye\u2019s family said?Mr Okorogheye\u2019s mother has previously rejected an apology from the Metropolitan Police following the \u201csubstandard level of service\u201d she received.Ms Joel filed a complaint against the Met after her son was found on April 5. In a statement issued through her lawyers, she said: \u201cThe IOPC investigation has confirmed what I always knew \u2013 in the darkest period of my life, I was dismissed by multiple Metropolitan Police staff at all levels of seniority and my son\u2019s disappearance was not taken seriously.\u201cIt is a matter of deep regret to me that despite both the IOPC and Metropolitan Police concluding that the performance of three police officers (including an inspector) and three call handers fell short of the standard expected, nobody will face misconduct proceedings.\u201cTherefore the apology is not accepted.\u201dMetropolitan Police officers at the scene at the Wake Valley pond in Epping Forest following the discovery of Richard Okorogheye\u2019s body.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe government\u2019s plans to tackle the climate emergency have been thrown into turmoil as Rishi Sunak signalled he could delay or even abandon green policies that put financial pressure on families.The prime minister is rethinking his green agenda after pressure from right-wing Tory MPs to win over voters after the party\u2019s narrow win in last week\u2019s Uxbridge and South Ruislip by-election. Downing Street was forced to insist its pledge to reach net zero by 2050 \u201cremains\u201d, but the prime minister\u2019s spokesperson said he is \u201cmaking sure we listen to consumers and business\u201d and will \u201ccontinually scrutinise\u201d plans such as the banning of new petrol and diesel car sales by 2030. Other policies under scrutiny include the government\u2019s plan to phase out gas boilers by 2035. Mr Sunak\u2019s spokesperson said both initiatives \u201cremain our commitment\u201d, but the PM would take a \u201cproportionate and pragmatic\u201d approach to make it \u201ceasier\u201d for households already grappling with financial pressures from high inflation.

The cost to consumers of green policies has been thrust into the spotlight by the Tories\u2019 narrow win in the Uxbridge by-election, which was driven almost entirely by opposition to London mayor Sadiq Khan\u2019s expansion of the ultra-low-emission zone (Ulez).Mr Sunak\u2019s suggestion the government could scale back some green policies came under fire from the Green Alliance think tank. Deputy political director Chris Venables said the only \u201cproportional and pragmatic\u201d response to the climate crisis is to \u201cpull every lever we can\u201d to get to net zero.\u201cIt is disappointing to see the government and the opposition hesitate on this over the weekend, especially during a period of extreme weather, and in the face of all the evidence saying that acting now will save lives, rebuild our economy, and protect the future of the planet,\u201d Mr Venables said. A government source said there are no discussions going on to review current net zero policies. And a Downing Street spokesperson said: \u201c2030 remains our commitment, of course it\u2019s right to listen to consumers and businesses so our path to net zero is proportionate and pragmatic.\u201dBut it has been suggested ministers will draw lines around some net zero policies, while others could be watered down or scrapped. The Times reported on Monday that officials are considering an \u201cAston Martin exemption\u201d to the 2030 deadline, which would give small carmakers longer to convert to electric vehicles.Low-traffic neighbourhoods also face a ban, and landlords will be given longer to meet energy efficiency targets, it said.Sunak said the government will move towards net zero in a way that doesn\u2019t give people \u2018more hassle\u2019  (Getty Images)The prime minister insisted on Monday that reaching net zero is important to him, following accusations he is \u201cuninterested\u201d in the environment.

The interim payment for deaths not yet recognised is critical.\u201cThese payments are not just about compensation, they symbolise acknowledgement and they represent initial recognition of each life lost.\u201dJanine Jones, whose haemophiliac brother Marc Payton died in 2003 at the age of 41 after being infected with HIV and hepatitis C, was among the group handing in the letter.Ms Jones, 58, of Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, said her brother was diagnosed with HIV in 1985 when he was 23 and told he had hepatitis C in 1990.Their elderly parents, Ron and Val, had both died while waiting for justice.She told the PA news agency: \u201cIn the last two years while the inquiry has been going on both our parents have died.\u201cThey were both in their 80s and they died with no recognition at all for their son\u2019s death.\u201cBecause he wasn\u2019t married or he didn\u2019t have a partner when he died, there has been no compensation paid to him at all.\u201dShe said of her parents: \u201cThey were devastated from his diagnosis anyway. Mum always blamed herself for giving him haemophilia because she was the carrier.\u201cIt absolutely crucified them, they never got over it.\u201cMy mum, the last three years of her life she had dementia and every time she saw me it was the first words out of her mouth: \u2018Where\u2019s Mark?

We regret the upset that has been caused to the child.\u201cA PCSO (police community support officer) can be seen comforting the child; however, we know that this does not take away from the impact that this will have on him.\u201cWe are seeking to make contact with the female in question to understand the wider circumstances.\u201cGiven the level of public concern we will ask the Independent Office for Police Conduct to review the circumstances shown in the video clip.\u201cWe are currently working with the local senior police teams and Transport for London.\u201dIn a statement, the Met Police said: \u201cWe are aware of a video circulating showing a female being handcuffed by police. Officers from the Roads and Transport Policing Command were conducting a joint revenue protection operation with Transport for London inspectors in Whitehorse Road, Croydon, on Friday, 21 July.\u201cOne woman left the bus after not complying with a revenue inspector\u2019s request to check that she had paid her fare. When asked to stop by police she attempted to walk off and became abusive. As a result, she was arrested on suspicion of fare evasion and detained.\u201cWhen it was later established that the woman had paid she was de-arrested and allowed to go on her way.\u201cThe woman was with her child and we appreciate that the video and circumstances look concerning. However, it is a snapshot of a wider incident. The video from this incident and the officer\u2019s body-worn video, which was active for a longer period than the social media clip, have been reviewed.\u201cOur officers regularly liaise with local community groups and forums and we will be discussing the matter with them and listening to their views.\u201dThe IOPC said a complaint had been made accusing police of racially profiling the woman, who is Black.A spokesperson said: \u201cWe have received a complaint referral from the Metropolitan Police Service following an incident in Whitehorse Road, Croydon on 21 July where a woman was handcuffed.\u201cThe complaint alleges the woman was racially profiled and verbally abused by an officer.\u201cWe will now assess the referral and decide if any further action is required from us.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64bef80f51ac33362ba19b1d", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/dambusters-lincolnshire-colin-bell-the-sun-lancaster-b2381051.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "King pays tribute to RAF veterans as he marks Dambusters\u2019 80th anniversary", "lead": "Charles visited the home of the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight.", "author": "Tony Jones", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 18:11:32", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:43.233056", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-24T18:11:32+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/24/19/ae39591922a03d783b90d7acb5642a35Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjkwMzA2NzU1-2.73118265.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeGreen campaigners have urged Rishi Sunak not to water down plans to make landlords improve the energy efficiency of their properties.Activists fear that the 2028 date for all rented properties to have an energy efficiency rating of C or better could be pushed back after the Prime Minister said he wanted to ensure action on climate change was \u201cproportionate and pragmatic\u201d.Over the weekend, cabinet minister Michael Gove suggested the deadline for improving energy efficiency could be pushed back due to the high costs involved.Mr Gove, the Housing Secretary, told the Daily Telegraph: \u201cMy own strong view is that we\u2019re asking too much too quickly.\u201cWe do want to move towards greater energy efficiency, but just at this point, when landlords face so much, I think that we should relax the pace that\u2019s been set for people in the private rented sector, particularly because many of them are currently facing a big capital outlay in order to improve that efficiency.\u201dRecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow live\n\nLetting landlords off the hook will only further risk the Government missing its legally binding climate and fuel poverty targetsChris Venables, Green Alliance political directorOn Monday, environmental groups urged the Government not to delay its energy efficiency target.Chris Venables, political director of the Green Alliance think tank, said: \u201cWith millions of people on the front line of a cost-of-living crisis driven by sky-rocketing energy bills, it is alarming to see Sunak proposing to weaken already insufficient plans to make sure renters have well-insulated homes.\u201cLetting landlords off the hook will only further risk the Government missing its legally binding climate and fuel poverty targets, never mind playing politics with the lives of the elderly and the vulnerable as we head into another difficult winter.\u201dRobbie MacPherson, political adviser at climate group Uplift, said: \u201cWe have seen what happens when governments \u2018ditch the green crap\u2019 \u2013 energy bills spike, climate breakdown worsens and struggling households pay the price.\u201cLandlords must be front and centre in ensuring that renters are provided with safe, warm homes. Energy efficiency and renewables are the answer to fixing Britain\u2019s broken energy system, not new oil and gas fields like Rosebank which receive billions in tax breaks despite record profiteering from industry.\u201cWe must avoid another winter where pensioners and other vulnerable households are faced with impossible choices again because of government dithering.\u201dAsked whether the Government was delaying the deadline, Downing Street said it was \u201cconsidering the correct approach\u201d as ministers scrutinised net zero plans.The Prime Minister\u2019s official spokesman said: \u201cIt\u2019s right that we ensure proposals take into account the wider developments in energy efficiency and private rented sectors including the upcoming review of the EPC system, the Renters\u2019 Reform Bill, the introduction of the decent home standard in the private sector.\u201cThat\u2019s to ensure that the costs and circumstances relating to energy efficiency improvement are fair and proportionate for landlords and tenants.\u201dThe current proposals would see all new tenancies required to have an energy performance certificate (EPC) rating of C or above by 2025, with this expanded to all existing tenancies by 2028.More than half of tenants live in homes with an EPC rating of D or below, with poorer tenants more likely to live in less energy efficient homes.Climate change think tank E3G estimated that improving energy efficiency would save renters an average of \u00a3570, but landlords would be expected to pay the first \u00a310,000 of any energy efficiency work themselves.A consultation on the energy efficiency target ended in January 2021, but the Government is still to respond.Landlords welcomed the suggestion the deadline could be delayed, saying a lack of clarity meant there was no hope of meeting the deadline.Ben Beadle, chief executive of the National Residential Landlords Association, said: \u201cThe NRLA wants to see properties as energy efficient as possible, but the sector needs certainty about how and when this will happen.RecommendedKing pays tribute to RAF veterans as he marks Dambusters\u2019 80th anniversaryBars of gold located after National Party makes complaint to authorities\u2018Astonishing failure\u2019 at prison holding hundreds of sex offenders\u201cMinisters need to develop a proper plan that includes a fair financial package to support improvements in the private rented sector.\u201cWe will continue to work with all parties to develop pragmatic and workable proposals.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64bef80f51ac33362ba19b20", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/charlotte-owen-boris-johnson-lords-b2380915.html", "primaryCategory": "UK Politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Who is Charlotte Owen and why did she get a peerage?", "lead": "<p>The 29-year-old aide among controversial names on Boris Johnson\u2019s resignation honours list </p>", "author": "Matt Mathers", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 17:28:38", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:43.925050", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-24T17:28:38+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/12/14/newFile.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up for the View from Westminster email for expert analysis straight to your inboxGet our free View from Westminster email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticePenny Mordaunt said she does not believe the Government has been dragging its feet on the issue of paying full compensation to those affected by the NHS infected blood scandal.She was giving evidence to the Infected Blood Inquiry, as bereaved relatives of victims of the scandal called on the Government to pay wider compensation.The current Commons Leader, formerly the minister responsible for the Infected Blood Inquiry as paymaster general between February 2020 and September 2021, insisted there was \u201cno let-up\u201d in her time in the role.But she also described how she had tried and failed to secure a meeting with then chancellor Rishi Sunak and other Treasury ministers about preparing for the possibility of paying compensation in 2020, with Government bandwidth \u201cvery stretched\u201d by the pandemic.Ms Mordaunt said the Covid pandemic had been an \u201call-consuming\u201d issue, and there was a \u201cpretty chaotic situation\u201d at the Treasury and Department of Health at the time.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow live\n\nI do not think there is any delay to moving as quickly as we can on these mattersPenny MordauntConcerns of delays in the Government\u2019s approach to compensation were put to Ms Mordaunt, and she was asked if, hypothetically, the Government was deliberately dragging its feet, whether that would be morally objectionable.Ms Mordaunt replied saying \u201cyes\u201d, it would be, but added: \u201cThat has not been my experience in my current role.\u201dElsewhere in her evidence, she said: \u201cI do not think there is any delay to moving as quickly as we can on these matters, and it would have been pointless to have set up this inquiry and the (compensation framework) study not to then proceed with making redress.\u201dThe inquiry was established in 2017 to examine how thousands of patients in the UK were infected with HIV and hepatitis C through contaminated blood products in the 1970s and 1980s.About 2,400 people died in what has been labelled the worst treatment disaster in the history of the NHS.Inquiry chairman Sir Brian Langstaff has said that an interim compensation scheme should be widened so more people \u2013 including orphaned children and parents who lost children \u2013 could be compensated.Sir Brian said in April that he was taking the unusual step of publishing the recommendation ahead of the publication of the full report into the scandal so that victims would not face any more delays.Under the initial scheme, victims themselves or bereaved partners can receive an interim payment of around \u00a3100,000.The inquiry has recommended the Government establish an arms-length compensation body now and definitely before the final report in the autumn.The evidence session heard how Ms Mordaunt wrote to Mr Sunak when he was chancellor on July 13 2020 saying: \u201cI believe it to be inevitable that the Government will need to provide substantial compensation. The costs are likely to be high.\u201d\u201cI believe we should begin preparing for this now, before the inquiry reports,\u201d she said in the letter.Ms Mordaunt told the inquiry she did not receive a written response, or even a formal acknowledgement to say it had been received, but she added there were \u201cdiscussions between officials\u201d.The lack of a response would have been unusual at other times, she said, but noted the situation was \u201cnot normal\u201d during the pandemic.She then wrote again in September 2020, saying: \u201cI cannot stress enough the urgency of taking long overdue action on financial support and compensation.\u201dIn a handwritten addition to the letter, she wrote: \u201cWe have ideas about a solution to this and have been trying for some time to secure a meeting with you.\u201d\n\nI think that there is a moral obligation to address the many issues that those affected by this have, and I am very conscious that that can't happen soon enoughPenny MordauntIn his written evidence to the inquiry, Mr Sunak said it was \u201cunclear\u201d whether he saw either of Ms Mordaunt\u2019s letters, but that it was not uncommon for his correspondence to be filtered by ministers\u2019 staff.He said a holding response was sent to the second letter in September, but added \u201cI do not know if anything else happened thereafter\u201d.On the time taken to commission a study looking at options for a framework for compensation, first announced in March 2021, Ms Mordaunt said: \u201cThis was against a backdrop of immense activity on that all-consuming issue of the pandemic.\u201cSo I think that was a factor in terms of speed of response to things. But I think not an unreasonable one given how much bandwidth that that issue was absorbing in Government.\u201dAsked if in hindsight it took too long to commission the study, she said: \u201cI think that everything about the situation has taken too long.\u201cIn my shift as paymaster general I do not think we could have worked faster in thrashing out and dealing with some of these issues.\u201dRecommendedRichard Okorogheye\u2019s cause of death \u2018consistent with drowning\u2019, inquest hearsBoris Johnson\u2019s former adviser becomes youngest peer in the House of LordsRepatriation flights return British holidaymakers from Rhodes after wildfiresShe also told the inquiry: \u201cI think that there is a moral obligation to address the many issues that those affected by this have, and I am very conscious that that can\u2019t happen soon enough.\u201dApplause could be heard coming from the room when Ms Mordaunt\u2019s evidence session came to an end."}, {"_id": "64bef81151ac33362ba19b26", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/liam-smith-greater-manchester-minshull-street-crown-court-york-gbh-b2381012.html", "primaryCategory": "Crime", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Acid murder trial hears of secret prison recording", "lead": "Father-of-two Liam Smith was shot and had acid poured on him after a one-night stand, Minshull Street Crown Court in Manchester heard.", "author": "Pat Hurst", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 16:28:52", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:45.325542", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-24T16:28:52+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/24/17/3044ba852d0c81dd641d88986883ddb3Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjkwMzAyMzA4-2.70706704.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

He simply was a wonderful human being.\u201dAlagiah, who was born in Sri Lanka, continued to present for the BBC when he was not receiving treatment.He joined the corporation in 1989 and spent many years as one of its leading foreign correspondents before moving to presenting.He was often a specialist in Africa and covered the civil wars in Somalia and Liberia as well as the genocide in Rwanda 20 years ago.Throughout his career he interviewed central political figures, among them former South African president Nelson Mandela, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, and ex-Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe.He was nominated for a Bafta in 1994 for his coverage of Saddam Hussein\u2019s genocidal campaign against the Kurds of northern Iraq and was named Amnesty International\u2019s journalist of the year in 1994 for reporting on the civil war in Burundi.He first began hosting the 6pm news bulletin in early 2003, but stepped up to front it solo four years later following the departure of his co-host, Natasha Kaplinsky.Kaplinsky said it was a \u201cprivilege\u201d to be friends with Alagiah as she paid tribute.\u201cGoodbye dearest George. I will miss you so very much. It was such a privilege to be your friend\u201d, she wrote on Instagram.BBC director-general Tim Davie said: \u201cAcross the BBC, we are all incredibly sad to hear the news about George. We are thinking of his family at this time.\u201cGeorge was one of the best and bravest journalists of his generation who reported fearlessly from across the world as well as presenting the news flawlessly.\u201cHe was more than just an outstanding journalist, audiences could sense his kindness, empathy and wonderful humanity. He was loved by all and we will miss him enormously.\u201dQuestion Time presenter Fiona Bruce said Alagiah was \u201cthat rare thing \u2013 a first-rate journalist and an all round lovely human being.\u201dShe added: \u201cIntegrity and decency shone through him. That and a mischievous sense of humour with an endearing giggle.\u201cI remember his 60th birthday party, surrounded by his wonderful family and his glamorous sisters like\u00a0so many birds of paradise.\u00a0It was an intimate family affair and I know George counted his blessings to be there with the people he loved so much.\u201cHe fought with all he had to stay with them as long as he could. We loved him in the newsroom and we \u2013 I \u2013 miss him so much.\u201dNick Robinson, presenter of BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, paid tribute saying: \u201cGeorge was a brilliant journalist, a lovely man and an inspiring example to all fighting serious illness. His friends will miss him deeply.\u201dBroadcaster John Simpson said: \u201cA gentler, kinder, more insightful and braver friend and colleague it would be hard to find.\u201cI loved having his company in the BBC World Affairs Unit, and his progress after that was a pleasure to watch.\u201dFormer BBC correspondent Jon Sopel added: \u201cTributes will rightly be paid to a fantastic journalist and brilliant broadcaster \u2013 but George was the most decent, principled, kindest, most honourable man I have ever worked with. What a loss.\u201dLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he was \u201cdeeply saddened\u201d by news of Alagiah\u2019s death.He said: \u201cA much-loved face of BBC News for decades, George will also be remembered for his brilliant, fearless journalism as foreign correspondent. He rightly won awards for his evocative, boundary pushing reporting. British journalism has lost a talent. My thoughts are with his family and loved ones.\u201dAfter his diagnosis Alagiah endured two rounds of chemotherapy and several operations, including the removal of most of his liver.He returned to work after his treatment was over but the cancer came back and spread leading to breaks from the studio while he received treatment.Appearing in a campaign in aid of Macmillan Cancer Support in 2022, speaking about the impact of his own experience of living with stage four bowel cancer, Alagiah said: \u201cPeople always ask me how I cope and it\u2019s the hardest question\u2026\u201cThe challenge at first was getting my cancer diagnosis straight in my head \u2013 despite having so much going for me, a successful career and a loving family, here I was just being told I was dying.\u201dIn\u00a0a videocast for the charity Bowel Cancer UK in 2020 in which he said he sometimes felt he had the \u201ceasy part\u201d, living with bowel cancer while his loved ones had to watch.He said: \u201cThose of us living with cancer know that it affects our families almost as much as ourselves.\u201cIn some ways I\u2019ve felt through my six-plus years living with cancer that sometimes I have the easy part\u2026 My job is just to stay fit and my family has got to watch all of the other things.\u201dThe chief executive of Bowel Cancer UK paid tribute to Alagiah, describing him as a \u201chuge advocate\u201d of the charity since he shared his diagnosis.Genevieve Edwards said in a statement to the PA news agency: \u201cHe supported our campaign calling on the NHS to lower the bowel cancer screening age to 50, shared his experience of the disease to raise lifesaving awareness of the symptoms, as well as speaking to our wonderful supporters about living with advanced bowel cancer at events that have raised thousands of pounds for the charity.\u201cMost recently, he hosted our podcast \u2013 he gave not only his time but his phenomenal broadcasting skills, his incredible warmth and his personal insight into living with the disease. We will never forget how much of his precious time he gave to the charity and the kindness he showed to our supporters during a very difficult time in his life.\u201dBefore joining the BBC, Alagiah worked as a print journalist and went on to write a number of books including A Home From Home, which looked at what it means to be British.Throughout his illustrious career, he also presented other shows such as Mixed Britannia, looking at the UK\u2019s mixed-race population.He was made an OBE in the 2008 New Year Honours.He is survived by his wife of 40 years, Frances Robathan, their two sons and three grandchildren.Professor Peter Johnson, NHS England\u2019s national clinical director for cancer, said: \u201cI am very sorry to hear that George Alagiah has died with bowel cancer and my thoughts are with his friends and family.RecommendedFamily \u00a310,000 out of pocket after Rhodes holiday ruined by wildfiresMagic mushroom ingredient \u2018could help treat anorexia\u2019Psilocybin may be a potential treatment for anorexia, research suggests\u201cTalking about cancer can save lives and that George was able to speak so openly and honestly about living with cancer will undoubtably make a difference to many others: I am very grateful that he felt able to do this.\u201cWith all cancers, acting at the first sign of symptoms can make a big difference to how cancer can be treated, and as George often reminded people, it\u2019s important to be aware of the symptoms of bowel cancer \u2013 so if you have noticed any changes such as blood in your poo, a change in bowel habits or pain and bloating \u2013 please do come forward for checks as soon as possible.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64bef81351ac33362ba19b2e", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/rhodes-family-emma-faversham-royal-engineers-b2380976.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Family \u00a310,000 out of pocket after Rhodes holiday ruined by wildfires", "lead": "Chris Elworthy, a farmer from Faversham, and his family had their flight and villa cancelled.", "author": "Jamel Smith", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 15:12:41", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:47.238220", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-24T15:12:41+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/24/16/24151500-7de5fedd-1d81-4382-a55a-67954519bb9d.png?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Richard always wanted to make me proud by going to university to ensure that he had the education and skills to enjoy a good standard of life as an adult.\u201cRichard had a bright future ahead of him.

Only a few weeks before he disappeared, Richard came up to me in the kitchen and said, \u2018Mum, I really appreciate you, you do so much for me\u2019.\u201cThe last time I saw Richard, I was leaving our home to do a night shift.

My thoughts are with his family and loved ones.\u201dAfter his diagnosis Alagiah endured two rounds of chemotherapy and several operations, including the removal of most of his liver.He returned to work after his treatment was over but the cancer came back and spread leading to breaks from the studio while he received treatment.Appearing in a campaign in aid of Macmillan Cancer Support in 2022, speaking about the impact of his own experience of living with stage four bowel cancer, Alagiah said: \u201cPeople always ask me how I cope and it\u2019s the hardest question\u2026\u201cThe challenge at first was getting my cancer diagnosis straight in my head \u2013 despite having so much going for me, a successful career and a loving family, here I was just being told I was dying.\u201dIn\u00a0a videocast for the charity Bowel Cancer UK in 2020 in which he said he sometimes felt he had the \u201ceasy part\u201d, living with bowel cancer while his loved ones had to watch.He said: \u201cThose of us living with cancer know that it affects our families almost as much as ourselves.\u201cIn some ways I\u2019ve felt through my six-plus years living with cancer that sometimes I have the easy part\u2026 My job is just to stay fit and my family has got to watch all of the other things.\u201dThe chief executive of Bowel Cancer UK paid tribute to Alagiah, describing him as a \u201chuge advocate\u201d of the charity since he shared his diagnosis.Genevieve Edwards said in a statement to PA: \u201cHe supported our campaign calling on the NHS to lower the bowel cancer screening age to 50, shared his experience of the disease to raise lifesaving awareness of the symptoms, as well as speaking to our wonderful supporters about living with advanced bowel cancer at events that have raised thousands of pounds for the charity.\u201cMost recently, he hosted our podcast \u2013 he gave not only his time but his phenomenal broadcasting skills, his incredible warmth and his personal insight into living with the disease. We will never forget how much of his precious time he gave to the charity and the kindness he showed to our supporters during a very difficult time in his life.\u201dBefore joining the BBC, Alagiah worked as a print journalist and went on to write a number of books including A Home From Home, which looked at what it means to be British.Throughout his illustrious career, he also presented other shows such as Mixed Britannia, looking at the UK\u2019s mixed-race population.He was made an OBE in the 2008 New Year Honours.He is survived by his wife of 40 years, Frances Robathan, their two sons and three grandchildren.Professor Peter Johnson, NHS England\u2019s national clinical director for cancer, said: \u201cI am very sorry to hear that George Alagiah has died with bowel cancer and my thoughts are with his friends and family.RecommendedDelaying rented homes\u2019 energy efficiency plans would be \u2018alarming\u2019 \u2013 think tankResearchers find eight habits that could help you live 20 years longerNear-extinct and \u2018extremely precious\u2019 kingfishers to be released into the wild\u201cTalking about cancer can save lives and that George was able to speak so openly and honestly about living with cancer will undoubtably make a difference to many others: I am very grateful that he felt able to do this.\u201cWith all cancers, acting at the first sign of symptoms can make a big difference to how cancer can be treated, and as George often reminded people, it\u2019s important to be aware of the symptoms of bowel cancer \u2013 so if you have noticed any changes such as blood in your poo, a change in bowel habits or pain and bloating \u2013 please do come forward for checks as soon as possible.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64bef81551ac33362ba19b36", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/anjem-choudary-islamist-westminster-magistrates-court-ilford-east-london-b2380908.html", "primaryCategory": "Crime", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Islamist preacher Anjem Choudary appears in court charged with terror offences", "lead": "The charges relate to the banned organisation Al-Muhajiroun, which Choudary is accused of leading.", "author": "Gwyn Wright", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 13:11:20", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:49.386274", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-24T13:11:20+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/24/14/d7ef4ebd90802a47e31e4c1ade8b89e7Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjkwMjkwNDQ1-2.61031774.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

The carriage completely tipped over and I was thrown from my seat.\u201cEverything went dark. After a few moments the silence was broken by the most terrible screams.\u201cI tried to free my arm but it was completely trapped. The man who I had been sitting next to prior to the crash was now lying on top of me. The man was not moving and he was completely unresponsive.\u201cHe had suffered a fatal head injury. This memory stays with me to this day. I remember other passengers stepping over me to get off the tram.\u201cI remember how cold and damp it was. I\u2019m not sure how long I lay on the tram floor. The emergency services eventually arrived.\u201dAs he was freed by London Ambulance staff he was told he was the last survivor to be extracted from the wreckage.Mr Kennedy said he woke up at St George\u2019s Hospital in Tooting to be told that doctors had been unable to save his arm and it had to be amputated.\n\nWe have to live with the consequences of other people's actions for the rest of our lives.

Guests are not allowed, and anyone who is not back by that time will be phoned and offered a taxi to collect them.Officials showing journalists around the Bibby Stockholm on Friday detailed a host of planned activities including sports events, allotments, cycling, hiking and festival excursions.English classes are also being planned, and contractors are setting up a computer room and TV lounges on board.A view of the canteen area onboard the Bibby Stockholm (AP)There are two outdoor courtyards, a gym and a multi-faith prayer room, although a bar advertised on owner Bibby Marine\u2019s website is now off-limits to asylum seekers and reserved as a staff lounge.A raft of contractors commissioned by Australian travel firm Corporate Travel Management, which is running the barge as part of a wider contract worth \u00a31.6bn, are looking after laundry services, and 24-hour food provision.A draft menu stuck to the wall of the canteen includes a range of soups, stews, roast turkey, \u201cdrums chicken\u201d and mysterious \u201cbeef collage\u201d.A view of inside one of the bedrooms onboard the Bibby Stockholm accommodation barge at Portland Port in Dorset, which will house up to 500 asylum seekers.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeIt was 8.13am on the morning of her 12th wedding anniversary when M\u00e0iri Robertson Carrey was woken by the emergency alert.Two hours further up the coastline, a pod of pilot whales had run aground and was now trapped on a remote beach on the Isle of Lewis \u2013 with a desperate race against time underway to save the lives of as many as possible.But despite completing her extensive training as a volunteer marine medic only last September, there was little which could have prepared Ms Carrey for the scenes awaiting her on the rugged golden-white sands of Traigh Mh\u00f2r, which last weekend played host to the UK\u2019s deadliest mass stranding in decades.Pod of 55 whales found dead after mass stranding in ScotlandNo fewer than 55 pilot whales lay strewn across the beach \u2013 many of them already dead \u2013 when they were discovered on Sunday morning by a fellow volunteer with British Divers Marine Life Rescue (BDMLR), who, like Ms Carrey, had only completed her training 10 months ago.The discovery \u2013 on an outer Hebridean island accessible only by ferry or plane \u2013 sent instant shockwaves through the UK\u2019s network of cetacean experts, who rallied from across the country to join a mammoth response still in force one week on as scientists conduct post-mortems.RecommendedGladis the killer whale and her gang of orcas, out for revenge in GibraltarCould the spate of mysterious killer whale boat attacks be spreading beyond Gibraltar?Early investigations suggest one of the whales encountered difficulty giving birth and \u2013 given the strong social and emotional bonds between pilot whales \u2013 was fatally followed onto the beach by the others, according to BDMLR director of welfare and conservation Dan Jarvis.Given that just 15 whales were still alive by the time they were discovered, they are believed to have washed ashore in the middle of the night \u2013 one of several unfortunate factors which compounded the difficulties faced by rescuers.With pilot whales weighing up to two tonnes and growing to seven metres in length, it\u2019s \u201cjust not physically possible\u201d to move them closer to the water, \u201cso you\u2019re very much at the mercy of time and tide\u201d, said Mr Jarvis, who was coordinating the network from Cornwall last Sunday.Pod of 55 whales found dead after mass stranding in Scotland\u201cIf you\u2019re lucky,\u201d he said, \u201cyou know exactly how long they\u2019ve been stranded for, and if you\u2019re even luckier, they strand on an incoming tide which gives you an opportunity to refloat them. But with this case it was completely the reverse.\u201cWe didn\u2019t see them strand, they\u2019d possibly been there for hours already, and they were found on high tide, so there was really not any opportunity to do anything for the ones that were high and dry by the time first responders got there.\u201dMoreover, Traigh Mh\u00f2r is in a \u201cdead zone\u201d for phone signal and the rescuers\u2019 high-frequency radios were also struggling \u2013 meaning any communication had to be done at least a mile-and-a-half from the beach.But by the time Ms Carrey and her husband had arrived from their home in Scarista, at the opposite end of the Isle of Harris, some 25 coast guard staff, fire and rescue officials and BDMLR medics were already at the scene, along with a few members of the public.\n\nThey were spread out across the beach in kind of an arc ... You were nose-to-tail with a number of others that weren\u2019t alive\u201d In a testament to their training, the plan drawn up by her fellow volunteer who was first on the scene remained in place long into the afternoon, and attempts had already been made to refloat two whales who were \u201cstill quite active\u201d and were beached closer to the water, while other survivors were triaged.While one sole survivor managed to swim away and has not been spotted since, the other whale \u2013 thought to be a calf, drawn to its mother on the beach \u2013 continued to wash back up on the beach despite multiple attempts to refloat it, with the sea state eventually deemed unsafe for the rescuers to continue.But with high tide not set to return until 7pm, rescuers faced a tense situation \u2013 and Ms Carrey and her husband were met by the sight of whales strewn across the beach, with those who remained alive identifiable by the soaked towels and blankets in which they were covered to keep them wet.\u201cWhen I arrived I was just advised \u2018choose one\u2019 because we didn\u2019t have enough medics to be one-to-one,\u201d said Ms Carrey, who ended up looking after three different whales.\u201cThey were spread out across the beach in kind of an arc. Some of them were very, very close together,\u201d she told The Independent, adding that for every whale she was tending, \u201cyou were nose-to-tail with a number of others that weren\u2019t alive\u201d.The living whales were covered in blankets to keep them wet (Mairi Robertson Carrey/via REUTERS)Initially choosing the two \u201cthat looked really quiet\u201d, Ms Carrey \u201cnoticed that the longer I spent with the whale I\u2019d chosen, the more lively it became and its breathing became more regular\u201d.The whales were \u201cblowing quite hard through their blowholes\u201d, with their entire bodies visibly moving and shuddering, and the two livelier whales lashing their tail \u2013 known as flukes \u2013 and \u201cstruggling a bit on the sand\u201d.Ms Carrey, who works full-time at the BumbleBee Conservation Trust and is also working on the Lottery-funded Species on the Edge programme, also recalled hearing either a \u201cvibration through the ground\u201d or a \u201cnoise vibrating from one of the whales\u201d she was with, which she \u201ckept feeling through the sand\u201d.\u201cI was talking to them and saying \u2018everything\u2019s going to be fine\u2019, and after a few hours kind of ran out of words, and I was humming and singing,\u201d she said, recalling singing a Gaelic lullaby to one of the whales.\u201cMy mum\u2019s from Harris,\u201d she explained. \u201cAll kinds of things come through your mind in that situation, I suppose. Just things I thought might be soothing or comforting \u2013 or maybe it was me that was being soothed or comforted, I\u2019m not sure.\u201dWith the sea receding, channels were dug out to harness rainy streams coming off the dunes directly to the whales. Sandbanks were also built up against the whales\u2019 flanks and under their flippers to keep them upright and help them breathe.But despite all their best efforts, at 3pm it was decided by a veterinarian that the whales should be euthanised to save them from further suffering, in the face of a punishing and near-impossible wait for high tide to return at 7pm.Channels of water were dug by the coast guard and sandbanks built to keep the whales upright  (Mairi Robertson-Carrey/BDMLR via AP)\u201cYou\u2019ve got bodies everywhere, you\u2019ve got a few survivors \u2013 but you\u2019ve only got a limited amount of resources to do anything,\u201d said Mr Jarvis. \u201cThese animals, when they\u2019re out of water, do start to crush themselves under their own weight, as they live entirely in the marine environment.\u201dAs their skeleton loses its ability to support their bodies, \u201cthat crushing effect over time will start to cut off circulation and affect the function of organs and muscles and tissues, and will start to build up toxins which will effectively poison the animal and kill it\u201d. \u201cGenerally speaking,\u201d he added, \u201cit\u2019s around six hours that they\u2019re viable for, out of the water.\u201dMs Carrey described the decision as a \u201cheartbreaking\u201d moment \u2013 as those not involved in the euthanasia and early post-mortem procedures were told to leave the beach. Some volunteers had only just arrived on ferries from Ullapool and Skye, while a vet who flew from Oxford on a private plane had just reached Dundee and was turned around.\u201cIt hit people really hard. People left in tears and really heartbroken,\u201d said Ms Carrey. \u201cI went to say goodbye to the three [whales] I\u2019d been supporting and that was very emotional. I think after that, when I realised what was going to happen, I just mentally and emotionally shut down and got through it, I guess.\u201dM\u00e0iri Robertson Carrey said she had since been reflecting upon the strength of the connections between both the animals and the humans involved (M\u00e0iri Robertson Carrey)That process was still ongoing a week later, with an area set out at a local landfill site for the whales to be examined as experts with the Scottish Marine Animal Stranding Scheme and elsewhere sought to glean vital information about the tragedy, and why events like it and others may have happened. With a single post-mortem taking hours, the team of just a handful of experts \u2013 including some from the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) \u2013 have been warned they faced \u201ca race against the clock\u201d to inspect as many of the whales as possible before their bodies are too decomposed.It is hoped that bacteriology, toxicology and virology samples will reveal diseases the whales may be suffering from or any ingestion of harmful human pollutants \u2013 potentially shining a light on the cause of the stranding, and the threats whales face in oceans across the world, experts said.Full post-mortems on even just a few of the whales \u201cwill be very valuable in indicating whether the cause of the stranding was human-related in any way\u201d, said Professor Peter Evans, director of the Sea Watch Foundation.With whale pods often matriarchal, Prof Evans suggested the stranding may have been caused by the mature female having difficulty giving birth and the others following it ashore due to their strong social bonds \u2013\u00a0a situation which caused a mass stranding of 21 whales on Skye in 2015. A less likely possibility is that the tragedy was caused by a \u201cnavigational error\u201d, causing the pod difficulties in unfamiliar, shallow water which hampered their sonar capabilities, he told The Independent.Or post-mortems may show evidence of haemorrhaging or bubbles in their tissue, which could reveal a human cause \u2013 such as seismic surveys for the fossil fuel industry, the naval military use of sonar, or the use of explosives to clear Second World War-era mines, Prof Evans said.It is a question of no small significance, given that Sunday\u2019s tragedy by all accounts represents the deadliest mass stranding seen on British shores for decades \u2013 outstripping a 2011 stranding at the Kyle of Durness, blamed on underwater Navy explosions, in which 19 of 70 beached whales were saved.And according to Rob Deaville, who leads the ZSL team helping conduct post-mortems, \u201creports of whale strandings are currently on the rise in the UK, and we\u2019re still trying to understand why\u201d. Mr Jarvis also reports a slight uptick in mass pilot whale strandings which began around 15 years ago, which he suggested could potentially be a result of climate change pushing cetaceans into unfamiliar habitats closer to shore, or their population increasing.But Prof Evans disagreed, pointing to strandings involving up to 150 whales spanning back centuries, and said the increase across all cetacean species over the past 30 years \u2013 comprising some 17,000 incidents \u2013 \u201cis probably as much to do with better reporting than anything else\u201d.Regardless of its place in history, the stranding on Lewis is one which will live long in the memories of those on the beach at Traigh Mh\u00f2r.\u201cWe\u2019re doing a lot of support with our team who were involved because it is quite a traumatic experience,\u201d said Mr Jarvis, calling this work \u201ca really important part of the aftermath\u201d.\u201cWhen you get there, the adrenaline kicks in and you\u2019ve got a job to do.\u201d But afterwards, \u201cwhen you come down again and you fully absorb the impact ... the sight, the sound, everything really can hit you\u201d, he said.Despite initially having felt \u201ca bit numb\u201d about the tragedy, Ms Carrey said she had been reflecting in recent days upon the strength of the connections between both the animals and the humans involved.RecommendedWhat a whale stranded on UK coast 10 years ago tells us about the climate crisisUrgent warning to avoid popular tourist beach after dead whale found\u201cSeeing the whales ... and how closely they were lying together on the shore, it did make you really think about those animal bonds,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that came through really strongly on Sunday, how important all the bonds are \u2013 for the whales, but for humans with nature as well, and with each other.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64bef81851ac33362ba19b42", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/police-netherlands-glasgow-spain-police-scotland-b2380851.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Police release animated image of man wanted for 2007 murder", "lead": "The images show how wanted man Derek Ferguson may look today.", "author": "Craig Paton", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 11:29:17", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:52.293353", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-24T11:29:17+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/24/12/24cf999860ba25583ca4d9cd143cdfbdY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjkwMjgzOTkw-2.25373943.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeAn environment campaign organisation has lost another round of a High Court fight with directors of oil giant Shell.ClientEarth, a shareholder in Shell, had raised concern about Shell\u2019s \u201cclimate change strategy\u201d and wanted to make a \u201cbreach\u201d of duties claim against directors.A High Court judge in May refused to give\u00a0ClientEarth\u00a0permission to continue its claim after considering written arguments.ClientEarth\u00a0has now failed in a bid to persuade Mr Justice Trower to reconsider his decision.The judge, who had considered oral arguments at a recent High Court hearing, in the Rolls Building in central London, on Monday ruled against ClientEarth for a second time.\n\nIt appears to me that ClientEarth\u2019s application and the evidence adduced in support of it do not disclose a prima facie case for giving permission to continue the claimMr Justice TrowerHe concluded that that ClientEarth\u2019s application should be dismissed.\u201c\u2026it appears to me that ClientEarth\u2019s application and the evidence adduced in support of it do not disclose a prima facie case for giving permission to continue the claim,\u201d said Mr Justice Trower in a written ruling.\u201cIn the light of the fact that the matter has now been reconsidered at an oral hearing, I will also make an order dismissing the claim.\u201dShell directors had argued\u00a0ClientEarth\u2019s\u00a0reconsideration application should be dismissed.Mr Justice Trower had published a ruling in May after considering written arguments.He had said in his May ruling that, in order to pursue its claim, ClientEarth had to show there had been \u201can actual or proposed act or omission involving negligence, default, breach of duty or breach of trust\u201d by a director or directors.The judge had dismissed the charity\u2019s application after concluding that it had not produced sufficient evidence to support its claim.Barristers representing\u00a0ClientEarth then outlined the \u201cpremise\u201d of the charity\u2019s case at a hearing.Shell directors had \u201calready identified\u201d climate change risk as a \u201cmaterial factor\u201d that \u201cimpacts on their duties\u201d to promote the company\u2019s long-term commercial success, they said.Lawyers argued that the long-term success of the company required an \u201ceffective and workable\u201d climate change strategy, and said plans adopted by Shell directors were \u201cirrational\u201d.They argued that strategies adopted by directors constituted a \u201cbreach of their duties\u201d and said ClientEarth\u2019s\u00a0claim should be allowed to proceed.Lawyers representing Shell argued that Mr Justice Trower\u2019s May ruling was \u201cunimpeachable\u201d.They said\u00a0ClientEarth\u00a0had received \u201cminimal support\u201d from shareholders and argued that the judge should \u201cstand by\u201d his decision.Mr Justice Trower said, in Monday\u2019s ruling, that ClientEarth held \u201conly 27 shares in Shell\u201d and indicated that a \u201cvery small proportion of the total shareholder constituency\u201d supported the charity\u2019s claim.He said it was the \u201cconstituency as a whole\u201d whose \u201cviews should carry very considerable weight\u201d when determining how Shell could \u201cbest manage the climate change risk\u201d.Lawyers representing Shell had suggested that ClientEarth\u2019s motivation was not the company\u2019s \u201cbest interests\u201d.Mr Justice Trower said there was \u201csubstance\u201d in that argument.\u201cIn my view, the fact that ClientEarth is the holder of only 27 shares in Shell, but is nonetheless proposing that it should be entitled to seek relief on behalf of Shell in a claim which on any view is of very considerable size, complexity and importance (and will be exceptionally expensive and time-consuming to pursue), gives rise to a very clear inference that its real interest is not in how best to promote the success of Shell for the benefit of its members as a whole,\u201d said the judge.\u201cIn short, there is substance in Shell\u2019s submission that ClientEarth\u2019s motivation is driven by something quite different from a balanced consideration as to how best to enforce the multifarious factors which the directors are bound to take into account when assessing what is in the best interests of Shell.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64bef81951ac33362ba19b47", "url":

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe Government has announced a new raft of proposals to increase housebuilding as it tries to meet its promise of building 300,000 homes a year by the mid-2020s.Michael Gove told an audience in London on Monday the Government is on track to deliver one million new homes during the current Parliament and put forward a series of proposals to tackle the UK\u2019s housing crisis.Below, the PA news agency looks at the key questions surrounding the housing crisis and the latest proposals.\u2013 How bad is the housing crisis?It is difficult to measure the full scale of the UK\u2019s housing crisis but most measures suggest it is severe.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveA 2019 study by Heriot-Watt University suggested England alone needed to build 340,000 houses per year, including 145,000 affordable homes, to meet the backlog, while the Centre for Cities think tank suggested the UK is missing four million homes.While the Government has committed to building 300,000 homes a year, it is missing its target, with 233,000 homes completed in 2021/22.The official waiting list for social housing remains at about 1.2 million households, while an investigation by The Independent found two-thirds of local authorities failed to build a single council house in 2021/22.The shortfalls mean tenants are often forced into sub-standard housing, while increases in private rents have accelerated since the Covid pandemic.According to estate agent Hamptons, private rents for new tenancies rose by 11.1% in the last financial year, while rents in desirable areas rose even faster. In London, rents rose by almost 17.2% and averaged \u00a32,210 per month.\u2013 What is the Government proposing?The Government\u2019s latest announcement on the housing crisis contains a raft of proposals designed to boost the number of new homes.One is for a review of \u201cpermitted development rights\u201d to allow shops and takeaways to be converted into homes without the need for planning permission. Such rights already exist for some properties, such as office blocks, with conversions accounting for 22,770 new homes in 2021/22.The other main prong of the announcement is a focus on brownfield sites and \u201curban areas\u201d rather than \u201cconcreting over the countryside\u201d, with a new \u201curban quarter\u201d in Cambridge set to be the first area to benefit from a new \u201csuper squad\u201d of planners working on clearing obstacles to major housing developments.The exact location of this new development \u2013 with homes, laboratories and green spaces \u2013 is not clear, but similar plans were unveiled earlier this year for Cambridge City Airport, which was taken out of the green belt in 2006.Other proposals announced by Housing Secretary Michael Gove include a \u00a324 million fund for training in the skills needed to increase housebuilding, and an Office for Place to lead a \u201cdesign revolution\u201d, following on from his promise of ensuring new homes are \u201cbeautiful\u201d and designed alongside local communities.\u2013 Will it work?Commentators are sceptical as to whether the Government\u2019s latest proposals will do much to solve the housing crisis, with several pointing to the decision to scrap housebuilding targets at the end of last year as a key problem.Property consultancy Knight Frank\u2019s head of planning, Stuart Baillie, said plans to expand permitted development rights are \u201cunlikely to have meaningful impact on housing supply\u201d, resulting in hundreds rather than thousands of new homes.Similar conversions have also been criticised for providing poor quality housing, with the Town and Country Planning Association telling MPs they represented \u201cthe worst face of the current UK housing crisis\u201d.Plans for a focus on brownfield site are also likely to run into trouble.The \u201cbrownfield first\u201d approach has effectively been planning policy for years and successive governments have made similar commitments to \u201cfocus on brownfield\u201d before.Under Liz Truss, then-housing secretary Sir Simon Clarke told the Conservative Party conference in 2022 he would speed up brownfield development, Boris Johnson told the Commons he was committed to \u201cbrownfield first\u201d in 2020, and David Cameron pledged in 2011 to release huge swathes of brownfield land for housebuilding.But brownfield development is often more expensive than building on green fields, with the sites presenting challenges such as contaminants, and proposals often meet local opposition anyway.Within hours of the latest announcement, South Cambridgeshire MP Anthony Browne had already declared his opposition to \u201cthe Government\u2019s nonsense plans to impose mass housebuilding on Cambridge\u201d.RecommendedTicket-holder claims \u00a311.6m Lotto jackpotSNP activist hints at attempt to challenge Yousaf leadershipJeremy Hunt shares his fight against cancer \u2018curse\u2019 that killed both his parentsSuch opposition is often motivated by concern about the impact on local resources, with Mr Brown saying the area has \u201cquite literally run out of water\u201d.Some greenfield development will also be needed in any case, with estimates suggesting there is only space on brownfield sites for just over one million homes.But others are more optimistic.

Read our\u00a0privacy notice Cambodia's longtime ruling party on Monday lauded its landslide victory in weekend elections as a clear mandate for the next five years, but the United States said its stifling of the opposition meant the vote could not be considered free or fair and that Washington was taking punitive measures.Autocratic leader Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party won 120 of 125 available seats in Sunday's elections, according to preliminary results.The 70-year-old, who has been in power for 38 years, has said he plans to hand the prime minister's job off to his oldest son, 45-year-old Hun Manet, who is Cambodia's army chief and won his first parliamentary seat Sunday.It is part of what is expected to be a broad generational change in top positions for the CPP. And while it is not yet clear exactly when Hun Manet might take over, Hun Sen has suggested it could be as early as within the next month.On his Facebook page Monday, Hun Manet said the election result showed that the \u201cCambodian people have clearly expressed their wills through votes,\u201d adding that he thanked Cambodians for their \u201clove and confidence in the CPP\u201d and pledged that the party would \u201ccontinue to serve Cambodia and Cambodian people better and better.\u201dRecommendedUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideFollowing a challenge from the opposition Cambodian National Rescue Party in 2013 that the CPP barely overcame at the polls, Hun Sen responded by going after leaders of the opposition, and eventually the country's sympathetic courts dissolved the party. Ahead of Sunday's election, the unofficial successor to the CNRP, known as the Candlelight Party, was barred on a technicality from running in the election by the National Election Committee.The U.S., European Union and other Western countries refused to send observers to the election, saying it lacked the conditions to be considered free and fair. Russia and China were among the countries that did send observers.Late Sunday, the U.S. State Department said it had \u201ctaken steps\u201d to impose visa restrictions \u201con individuals who undermined democracy and implemented a pause of foreign assistance programs\u201d after determining the elections were \u201cneither free nor fair.\u201d\u201cCambodian authorities engaged in a pattern of threats and harassment against the political opposition, media, and civil society that undermined the spirit of the country\u2019s constitution and Cambodia\u2019s international obligations,\u201d State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said.\u201cThese actions denied the Cambodian people a voice and a choice in determining the future of their country.\u201dMichael Greenwald, spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Phnom Penh, said Monday the visa restrictions would be placed on people involved in \u201cthreatening and harassing the political opposition, media and civil society\u201d but he would not specify who or how many individuals that would entail.Similarly, he would not elaborate on the scope of the pause of foreign assistance programs, saying only that it involved \u201cseveral\u201d new activities, and noting that the U.S. had contributed some $3 billion dollars to programs over the last 30 years.The State Department urged the CPP to use its new term to restore \u201cgenuine multi-party democracy.\u201d Regional advocacy group ASEAN Parliamentarians for Human Rights called on all democracies to denounce the elections.\u201cWe must pressure the Cambodian government to end all forms of political persecution and immediately and unconditionally release political prisoners,\" said Eva Kusuma Sundari, a former Indonesian lawmaker. \"There must also be an independent investigation into human rights violations and electoral irregularities, with the aim of ensuring accountability,\u201d she added.Under Hun Sen, Cambodia has become the Southeast Asian nation with the closest ties to Beijing, and China's Foreign Ministry on Monday made no mention of any concerns about the way the elections were handled. \u201cAs a good neighbor and friend, we warmly congratulate Cambodia on the successful holding of the 7th national election,\u201d spokeswoman Mao Ning told reporters. \u201cWe believe that Cambodia will make greater achievements in national construction and development in the future, bringing more benefits to its people.\u201dWith the Candlelight Party barred from running, FUNCINPEC, a royalist party whose name is a French acronym for the National Front for an Independent, Neutral and Cooperative Cambodia, benefitted the most from any anti-CPP sentiment.Having won no seats in the last two elections, it won all five Sunday that did not go to the CPP. Party president Norodom Chakravuth told The Associated Press ahead of the election that he would be prepared to work with CPP but \u201conly if they're fair with us.\u201dThis would be a mistake, however, said Astrid Nor\u00e9n-Nilsson, a Cambodia expert at Sweden\u2019s Lund University who was in Phnom Penh for the elections.\u201cThe best the FUNCINPEC could do to build on that would be to keep the greatest distance possible from the CPP and take up the role of an opposition party, rather than that of a party that works hand in hand with the CPP,\u201d she told AP.FUNCINPEC spokesman Nhoeun Raden said the party is still collecting data and had no immediate comment on their better-than-expected results.Recommended8 police officers assigned to protect South Africa's deputy president arrested over highway attack11 killed as roof collapses at middle school gym in China's far northeast, officials sayNew evacuations ordered in Greece as high winds and heat fuel wildfires_____Rising reported from Bangkok."}, {"_id": "64bef81a51ac33362ba19b4b", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/humza-yousaf-angus-macneil-twitter-fife-westminster-b2380742.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "SNP activist hints at attempt to challenge Yousaf leadership", "lead": "Chris Hanlon posted a picture of SNP leadership nomination forms, but said he had not \u2018made any decisions\u2019.", "author": "Craig Paton", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 09:09:42", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:54.485341", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-24T09:09:42+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/24/09/cd05ab23887699e14741a4038247064aY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjkwMjcyNDY4-2.73048415.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeUK airlines are continuing to sell flights for immediate departure from the UK to Rhodes despite the wildfires that have seen thousands of tourists evacuated from the island. The UK\u2019s two biggest tour operators, Jet2 and Tui, have cancelled all flights and holidays to Rhodes for several days ahead. They are and offering refunds because of the fires, which have been raging on the Greek island for six days.But other airlines are continuing to offer seats on flights to Rhodes, and the travel firm Thomas Cook says most of its customers booked to travel ion Sunday and Monday are travelling as normal.From London Gatwick, easyJet has five flights to Rhodes on sale on Tuesday. But for those who no longer wish to travel, the airline is allowing free changes for passengers booked up to 29 July.Three easyJet aircraft are also flying out empty to pick up UK holidaymakers wanting to come home early.RecommendedSimon Calder: BA and easyJet still selling flights to Rhodes despite wildfiresFirst rescue flights for British holidaymakers due to arrive on fire-ravaged RhodesBritish family abandon \u00a32.5k Greek holiday over blistering 40C Cerberus heatwaveRyanair says its operations to and from Rhodes are normal and that usual conditions apply.Jet2 and Tui are dispatching aircraft with no passengers from UK airports to Rhodes to pick up holidaymakers. Both have dispatched teams to help customers.Tui customers on the island are being told: \u201cWe are aware that many of our guests are now located at evacuation centres or found temporary shelter at other hotels. We are relentlessly working on improving the situation for our guests and our teams are working closely with the local authorities.\u201cCustomers currently in Rhodes will return on their intended flight home.\u201dHolidaymakers were evacuated from their hotels and left their belongings behind  (AP)Rhodes airport is on the northwestern shore of the Greek island, close to the capital, Rhodes Town. With no imminent danger in that area, airlines are entitled to operate a \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d policy, with normal terms applying.But most are expected to provide some options to customers, with package holidaymakers benefiting from extra protection.It comes after holidaymakers were forced to flee resorts on Saturday, with some British tourists describing \u201cterrifying\u201d scenes of turmoil as power cuts caused \u201cchaos\u201d on the island. Thousands of tourists have been evacuated  (AP)In previous days the wildfire was confined to the island\u2019s mountainous centre, but aided by winds, very high temperatures and dry conditions, it spread on Saturday towards the coast on the island\u2019s central-eastern side.The Foreign Office advises travellers to contact their airline or travel operator. For 24/7 British consular assistance, UK citizens abroad can call +44 20 7008 5000.The FCDO has also sent a Rapid Deployment Team to Rhodes to support British nationals, and the Greek Foreign Affairs ministry has set up a help desk at Rhodes airport.I am in Rhodes and want to leave as soon as possible. What are my options?Many tourists are in that position. Jet2 and easyJet are operating special repatriation flights in addition to the normal schedule. The general principle is that British Airways says passengers booked to fly from Rhodes to London can switch to earlier flights without penalty \u2013 though little space may be available. The earliest BA departure with space available is on Wednesday evening.Other carriers may adopt a similar policy. But availability is scarce, with no seats on easyJet flights to the London area until late on Tuesday evening, and not before Wednesday to Manchester.Most airlines are operating their normal schedules, and are likely to continue to do so from Rhodes \u2013 though more outbound flights may be empty, as Jet2 and Tui are doing.Flights are full. Are there any other ways out from the island?Yes. Dodekanisos Seaways sails once or twice a day from Rhodes Town to Kos, where there are fairly frequent flights to the UK. The 8am sailing is usually the fastest and most reliable, taking around 2h30m. A taxi will take you from the port to the airport in about 30 minutes, with much cheaper but slower buses available.Flights on Tuesday 25 July include a Ryanair departure to London Stansted which is currently selling at just \u00a337.The ferry voyage to Marmaris in Turkey is shorter, at around one hour, but the closest airport, Dalaman, is a long way from the town \u2013 making for a 90-minute taxi journey or two hours in a bus. In addition the frontier formalities leaving Greece and arriving in Turkey will take time.I lost my travel documents in the scramble to leave the area. Can I leave the island?Yes. To help tourists who were evacuated from their accommodation in a hurry and left their passports behind, the Greek authorities are issuing emergency and temporary identification to allow them to board their flights.Ryanair says: \u201cPassengers departing from Rhodes should be advised that we will accept temporary travel documentation issued by the Greek Police.\u201dIf I am brought home early, will I get some or all of my money back?People who are anxious about being on the island but whose holidays have not been directly affected are unlikely to be offered any recompense for the lost holiday times. Package holidaymakers whose trips are curtailed because their accommodation cannot be used are due a partial refund under the Package Travel Regulations. But it may not be as much as the traveller might expect.If a two-week holiday that cost \u00a31,000 per person ends a week early, the refund will not simply be half the cost of the trip, ie \u00a3500. The holiday company is entitled to subtract the value of the flights, which might be \u00a3400 \u2013 meaning only half of the remainder will be refunded, ie \u00a3300.If you make the decision to return ahead of schedule, no compensation is due. Travel insurance may help with extra costs if you can demonstrate you spent them reasonably.I am booked to travel imminently to Rhodes. Can I cancel for a refund?If the travel firm or airline cancels your trip you can expect a full refund within two weeks. If the flight is going ahead, then your rights depend on whether you are on a proper package holiday or have booked flights and accommodation separately.Under the Package Travel Regulations, holidaymakers can cancel for a refund \u201cif unavoidable and extraordinary circumstances occur at the place of destination or its immediate vicinity which significantly affect the performance of the package or the carriage of passengers to the destination\u201d.In the case of key parts of Rhodes, this looks like reasonable grounds to cancel.These are the companies\u2019 policies for imminent departures as of 4pm on Monday.British Airways: passengers booked to Rhodes in the next week can rebook for a different date up to November 2023.easyJet: all easyJet Holidays packages up to and including Tuesday 25 July are cancelled, with full refunds offered. Flight only passengers booked to travel to or from Rhodes until 29 July can transfer for free to another date or can request a flight voucher by calling easyJet Customer Services on 0330 551 5151.Jet2: all flights and holidays that are due to depart to Rhodes up to and including 30 July have been cancelled, with full refunds offered.Ryanair: \u201cFlights to/from Rhodes Airport are currently operating as normal and unaffected by the forest fires. Please check your Ryanair app where you will be notified of any changes to your Ryanair flight.\u201dThomas Cook: the online travel agent is allowing customers due to depart to holidays in the affected areas in Kiotari and Lardos up to 31 July to cancel their holidays for a full refund. Customers booked to travel to elsewhere in Rhodes on Tuesday and Wednesday are being offered full refunds.Tui: \u201cWe have cancelled all outbound flights to Rhodes up to and including Friday 28 July, and have also cancelled all outbound flights for customers travelling to impacted hotels up to and including on Sunday 30 July. All customers due to travel on these flights will receive full refunds. Passengers due to travel to areas not affected by fires on Saturday 29 and Sunday 30 July will be offered a fee free amend to another holiday or the option to cancel for a full refund. \u201cI am booked to travel to Rhodes in August. Can I cancel?Not at this stage. Depending on events over the next few days, travel firms will make decisions on their plans for the peak summer month.The travel industry appears to be preparing the ground for a restart in tourism to some of the unaffected areas of Rhodes. A spokesperson for Abta, the travel association, said: \u201cWe understand that some of the resorts have had their evacuation order removed by the Greek authorities and people have been advised that they can return to the resorts of Lindos, Pefkos and Kalathos.\u201cTravel companies will be liaising with their accommodation providers to ensure that they are ready to receive customers and customers will be notified accordingly.\u201dWould you go to Rhodes?I sympathise with everyone who is feeling apprehensive about travelling to an island that, in places, is nothing short of a disaster area. Even though distressed and exhausted holidaymakers are still trying to return from Rhodes, some tourists have been proceeding with their trips as booked in the past few days.But I would not travel there immediately: with people still trying to get out and the infrastructure under pressure, it would be unhelpful.Looking ahead a few days, though, I believe the picture will change significantly. By tomorrow I believe the vast majority of people who understandably want to come home will have done so: large amounts of air capacity are going in as repatriation flights. Pressure on the resources will ease. And the damage to the resorts on the south east shore of Rhodes will be clear.For people who are booked to the affected area, it may be that you are offered a choice between moving to a different location or a full refund. But getting all your money back is likely to be offered only if the travel firm deems it impossible for you to have a safe and enjoyable holiday.The people of Rhodes have shown outstanding kindness and courage towards overseas tourists. In most parts of the island \u2013 and 90 per cent is unaffected \u2013 they will want to get back to work delivering great experiences for visiting holidaymakers. And, in a week or two, I would be glad to go there and meet them.Meanwhile, what is happening in Corfu?A wildfire, which some reports say was started deliberately, has led to evacuations of some villages and a few hotels in the north east of the Ionian island.A Tui spokesperson said on Monday: \u201cWe\u2019ve been working with the local authorities in Corfu following the outbreak of a wildfire in the north east of the island last night resulting in guests being evacuated from a small number of hotels.\u201cAs a precautionary measure we also stopped new arrivals into the affected hotels for Monday 24 and Tuesday 25 July. The situation is now fully under control and guests are returning to their hotels to continue their holidays as planned.\u201dThe Abta spokesperson said: \u201cThe situation in Corfu is quite different to the situation in Rhodes. The wildfire on the north east of the island of Corfu is on a much smaller scale and is affecting significantly fewer holidaymakers.\u201cSome of the resorts were evacuated as a precautionary measure and we understand that those who were initially evacuated have mostly been able to return to their resorts and their accommodation.RecommendedBrits \u2018virtually forced\u2019 to pick flights over trains due to \u2018overpriced\u2019 rail faresTourists fined \u00a31,200 each for \u2018extremely dangerous\u2019 selfie More rail disruption as union announces new August overtime ban for train drivers\u201cCorfu is a very large island.

energy market, allowing domestic heating bills to climb down after a long winter of sky-high prices.With inflation lodged stubbornly at 8.7 per cent, new woes have emerged for mortgage holders battling high interest rates and in the shape of bloated prices in the supermarket aisles, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) putting food inflation at 18.4 per cent in May.However, Sainsbury\u2019s chief executive Simon Roberts has said he believes that level is about to start falling as retail sales improve in response to the warmer weather, noting that the price of staple items like bread, butter, milk, pasta and meat fell at his supermarket during the second quarter of the year in response to more favourable trading conditions.That said, the news that supermarkets have been accused of profiteering from \u201crip off\u201d fuel prices on the forecourt, resulting in drivers being made to pay nearly \u00a31bn over the odds for petrol and diesel over the last year, is likely to further demoralise a beleaguered public weary of struggling against the economy.Below, we look at what support is available to households this August.RecommendedJuly dates for DWP cost of living payments, benefits and pensionsFood bank use is a choice, suggests Veterans Minister Johnny MercerMotorists forced to pay 6p a litre too much as supermarkets accused of using customers as \u2018cash cows\u2019Extra \u00a31,350 of support being paid outDespite the expiration of Rishi Sunak\u2019s Energy Bill Support Scheme at the end of March (an initiative that handed out \u00a3400 in monthly instalments of \u00a366 and \u00a367), millions of households on low incomes will receive further cost of living support from the government this year worth up to \u00a31,350 in total.Eight million eligible means-tested benefits claimants, including people on universal credit, pension credit and tax credits, will receive \u00a3900 in instalments as part of a programme that began this spring, with the money going directly to bank accounts in three tranches, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has said.There will also be a separate \u00a3150 payment for more than six million people with disabilities and an extra \u00a3300 for over eight million pensioners.Here are the payment windows that have been announced so far, with more precise dates expected later in the year:\u00a3301 \u2013 First cost of living payment \u2013 already issued between 25 April and 17 May (or 2 to 9 May for people on tax credits but no other low-income benefits)\u00a3150 \u2013 Disability payment \u2013 during summer 2023\u00a3300 \u2013 Second cost of living payment \u2013 during autumn 2023\u00a3300 \u2013 Pensioner payment \u2013 during winter 2023/4\u00a3299 \u2013 Third cost of living payment \u2013 during spring 2024Bank holiday brings payment schedule changeThe usual state support in the shape of benefits and pensions payments will also be going out in August, although the arrival of the Summer Bank Holiday on Monday 28 means that anyone expecting to receive their money on that date can typically expect it to be paid into their bank accounts one working day earlier (Friday 25, for instance).That applies to anyone expecting to receive any of the following from the DWP in August:Universal creditState pensionPension creditDisability living allowancePersonal independence paymentAttendance allowanceCarer\u2019s allowanceEmployment support allowanceIncome supportJobseeker\u2019s allowanceFor more information on how and when state benefits are paid, please visit the government\u2019s website.Energy Price Guarantee expired as cap loweredThe sweltering weather we can expect to continue into August \u2013 which has already brought the warmest June since records began in 1884 \u2013 might not be comfortable for everyone but it will at least greatly reduce the need for having the central heating switched on, which proved such an expense over the course of the winter just gone.The government\u2019s Energy Price Guarantee (EPG) \u2013 introduced by Liz Truss last September to ensure households paid no more than \u00a32,500 for their electricity and gas, with the government subsidising the remainder owed to providers under Ofgem\u2019s Energy Price Cap (EPC) \u2013 was extended by chancellor Jeremy Hunt in his Budget of 15 March for a further three months.Mr Hunt had reportedly been tempted to increase the EPG to \u00a33,000, a considerably less generous offer that would have eased the burden on the state, but ultimately thought better of it, extending the guarantee into April, May and June.Now that the EPG has finally expired, consumers will once more be paying the EPC rate, which Ofgem set at \u00a32,074 for the third quarter beginning 1 July, a huge fall from the \u00a33,280 it was set at during the second quarter, from which households were shielded by the intervention of the government\u2019s overriding guarantee.That 17 per cent decrease reflects recent drops in wholesale energy prices \u2013 the amount energy firms pay for electricity and gas before supplying it to households \u2013 and, although it is a significant drop from the eye-watering rates of the last two years, the figure remains more than \u00a31,000 a year above pre-pandemic levels.As for what might happen next, consultancy firm Cornwall Insight predicts that July\u2019s fall will be followed by another drop in October, when it expects the typical annual bill to be \u00a31,976.RecommendedBudget 2022: Hunt says UK in recession as he announces huge tax risesJeremy Hunt increases energy windfall tax in budgetJeremy Hunt freezes tax allowances and hits 45p rate payersUnfortunately, it believes the typical bill will then rise again in January 2024 to \u00a32,045 and Cornwall does not expect energy prices to return to pre-Covid levels before the end of the decade at the earliest.It has also warned customers that prices remain subject to wholesale market volatility, with the UK\u2019s reliance on energy imports meaning that geopolitical incidents like the war in Ukraine could continue to have a detrimental impact."},

can expect in July \u2013 if last year\u2019s record-breaking heatwave is anything to go by \u2013 might not be comfortable for everyone but it will at least greatly reduce the need for having the central heating switched on, which proved such an expense over the course of the winter just gone.The government\u2019s Energy Price Guarantee (EPG) \u2013 introduced by Liz Truss last September to ensure households paid no more than \u00a32,500 for their electricity and gas, with the government subsidising the remainder owed to providers under Ofgem\u2019s Energy Price Cap (EPC) \u2013 was extended by chancellor Jeremy Hunt in his Budget of 15 March for a further three months.Mr Hunt had reportedly been tempted to increase the EPG to \u00a33,000, a considerably less generous offer that would have eased the burden on the state, but ultimately thought better of it, extending the guarantee into April, May and June.Now that the EPG has finally expired, consumers will once more be paying the EPC rate, although Ofgem has announced that will be \u00a32,074 from 1 July, a huge fall from the \u00a33,280 it was set at during the second quarter, from which households were shielded by the intervention of the government\u2019s overriding guarantee.That 17 per cent decrease reflects recent drops in wholesale energy prices \u2013 the amount energy firms pay for electricity and gas before supplying it to households \u2013and, although it is a significant drop from the eye-watering rates of the last two years, the figure remains more than \u00a31,000 a year above pre-pandemic levels.As for what might happen next, consultancy firm Cornwall Insight predicts that July\u2019s fall will be followed by another drop in October, when it expects the typical annual bill to be \u00a31,976.RecommendedBudget 2022: Hunt says UK in recession as he announces huge tax risesJeremy Hunt increases energy windfall tax in budgetJeremy Hunt freezes tax allowances and hits 45p rate payersUnfortunately, it believes the typical bill will then rise again in January 2024 to \u00a32,045 and Cornwall does not expect energy prices to return to pre-Covid levels before the end of the decade at the earliest.It has also warned customers that prices remain subject to wholesale market volatility, with the UK\u2019s reliance on energy imports meaning that geopolitical incidents like the war in Ukraine could continue to have a detrimental impact."}, {"_id": "64bef81d51ac33362ba19b59", "url":

She told The Independent that her two oldest children Emily, 12, and Adrian, 10, have to sleep in the living room of her two-bed private rental flat because of the water that leaks from the roof in the second bedroom. Her youngest child, Thiago, aged two, has developed breathing problems that Ms Rodriguez believes are caused by the mould on the walls.She recalled: \u201cI was sleeping with my baby recently and the water was coming from the light in the ceiling. All my bed was totally wet and I called my landlord and he didn\u2019t pick up. I sent so many emails but he doesn\u2019t want to repair anything. There is mould on the walls. It is black and the wall is totally wet.\u201dBaby Thiago was diagnosed with a respiratory tract infection and given antibiotics to manage his wheezing in the summer of last year.

She was moved into her current flat after fire service officers and council workers arrived at her previous home and told residents they needed to move out immediately because it was unsafe.She told The Independent: \u201cIt\u2019s stressful waiting and you don\u2019t know when you might be moved out again or where you might be going.\u201dShe explained that when she first arrived at the flat, with her husband and teenage daughter, it was not furnished. She said: \u201cWhen we first moved in here, we were sleeping on the floor for about six to eight months because we didn\u2019t know how long we were staying there. We didn\u2019t have any bed or anything to bring with me.\u201d\u201cThere was just a cooker and a washing machine and a fridge, that was all the house had. I had to buy all the things from scratch. I was just sleeping on the carpet with a blanket.\u201d\u2018Renaissance\u2019 needed The drop in local authorities building houses has been stark in recent decades. More than 100,000 homes were built a year in England during the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, which has dwindled to a few thousand annually in recent years, according to data from the Department for Levelling Up.In each year of the last five financial years, two-thirds of councils failed to build a single home, analysis of the government data shows.In 2021-22, 207 out of the 307 councils that provided data to the government had not built a home in that year. A snap survey of district and borough councils in England carried out by The Independent also found that just over half of local authorities did not build a single home in the annual year 2022. Of the 148 that responded, 80 said they had not completed a home last year. This was compared with 73 who had completed no house builds in 2021.Councils were historically big builders of housing  (House of Commons research library )Birmingham council had completed the most new homes, with 185 properties in 2022, 97 of which were for social rent. Islington council had delivered 178 properties in 2022, 136 of which were for social rent. And Rotherham metropolitan borough council had delivered 124 homes, with 90 built at affordable rates, 20 for shared ownership and 14 for market sale.Charlie Trew, head of policy at housing charity Shelter, said cuts during the period of austerity meant a council\u2019s ability to build housing was stripped back.Changes in grant funding from central government have also added to the problem and left councils increasingly reliant on cross-subsidy (where councils build a mixture of social rent properties and properties to privately rent), he added.\u201cWe would like to see a renaissance in council house building, particularly socially rented homes. We would like to see many more councils getting back into the business of it,\u201d he said.Talking about the benefits of council-built homes, Mr Trew said: \u201cYou\u2019re not getting very many numbers [of social rent homes] through private development because the developer is trying to maximise profit. They are trying to cut the delivery of those homes as much as possible, whereas a council who is responsible for the social housing wait lists and for homelessness has a direct incentive to build homes that are genuinely affordable to local people.\u201d\u2019The government needs targets\u2019Elizabeth Wyatt, at the Housing Action Southwark and Lambeth, has seen how the shortage of council homes impacts those in her borough.\u201cIf you need a family-sized council home, then you have to wait years and years,\u201d she said. \u201cIn Southwark, you see one five-bed come up once a year for example. The more bedrooms you need, the longer your wait is. Lots of families are overcrowded in a one-bedroom home, which they would happily give up, but the family-sized homes are just not there.\u201dExplaining the difference in rents, she said: \u201cHousing associations will offer social rent, which can be really similar to council rent, but they also offer affordable rent, which is 80 per cent of market rent. That\u2019s hundreds of pounds of rent difference per week and compared to council rent it is really unaffordable for a lot of families.\u201dPrime Minister Rishi Sunak has faced criticism for dropping the mandatory target of building 300,000 new homes a year by the mid-2020s. The national target, based on the estimate number of homes needed to keep pace with demand, was introduced in 2017 by then chancellor Philip Hammond. But last year Liz Truss branded the target \u201cStalinist\u201d and said it should be scrapped. Mr Sunak\u2019s government has said the target still exists, but that it is now \u201cadvisory\u201d rather than \u201cmandatory\u201d.Labour has promised to reintroduce the targets and to restore 70 per cent home ownership. They have also pledged to build hundreds of thousands of new council homes, saying that local authorities will not be allowed to opt out of building homes.Councillor Ahsan Khan, Waltham Forest\u2019s member for housing, said that the scrapping of housing targets was a mistake. \u201cThe government needs to have targets and it needs to incentivise all sectors, in particular councils, to bring forward council homes for people on housing registers right across the country.\u201dCouncillor Diarmaid Ward, from Islington council, said: \u201cIt costs about \u00a3300,000 to build a council home in London and the government grant only covers about a third of that. So you\u2019ve got to find the other two-thirds somewhere. Added to that you\u2019ve got Right to Buy, which depletes the council housing stock. If you mix in the twin evils of inflation and interest rates, it makes for a very difficult environment.\u201dThe Local Government Association, which represents councils, has called for a \u201cgenuine renaissance in council house building\u201d.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe post-pandemic cost of living crisis is continuing to make life difficult in Britain this summer \u2013 even after a degree of stability returned to the international energy market, allowing domestic heating bills to climb down after a long winter of sky-high prices.With inflation lodged stubbornly at 8.7 per cent, new woes have emerged for mortgage holders battling high interest rates and in the shape of bloated prices in the supermarket aisles, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) putting food inflation at 18.4 per cent in May.However, Sainsbury\u2019s chief executive Simon Roberts has said he believes that level is about to start falling as retail sales improve in response to the warmer weather, noting that the price of staple items like bread, butter, milk, pasta and meat fell at his supermarket during the second quarter of the year in response to more favourable trading conditions.That said, the news that supermarkets have been accused of profiteering from \u201crip off\u201d fuel prices on the forecourt, resulting in drivers being made to pay nearly \u00a31bn over the odds for petrol and diesel over the last year, is likely to further demoralise a beleaguered public weary of struggling against the economy.Below, we look at what support is available to households this August.RecommendedJuly dates for DWP cost of living payments, benefits and pensionsFood bank use is a choice, suggests Veterans Minister Johnny MercerMotorists forced to pay 6p a litre too much as supermarkets accused of using customers as \u2018cash cows\u2019Extra \u00a31,350 of support being paid outDespite the expiration of Rishi Sunak\u2019s Energy Bill Support Scheme at the end of March (an initiative that handed out \u00a3400 in monthly instalments of \u00a366 and \u00a367), millions of households on low incomes will receive further cost of living support from the government this year worth up to \u00a31,350 in total.Eight million eligible means-tested benefits claimants, including people on universal credit, pension credit and tax credits, will receive \u00a3900 in instalments as part of a programme that began this spring, with the money going directly to bank accounts in three tranches, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has said.There will also be a separate \u00a3150 payment for more than six million people with disabilities and an extra \u00a3300 for over eight million pensioners.Here are the payment windows that have been announced so far, with more precise dates expected later in the year:\u00a3301 \u2013 First cost of living payment \u2013 already issued between 25 April and 17 May (or 2 to 9 May for people on tax credits but no other low-income benefits)\u00a3150 \u2013 Disability payment \u2013 during summer 2023\u00a3300 \u2013 Second cost of living payment \u2013 during autumn 2023\u00a3300 \u2013 Pensioner payment \u2013 during winter 2023/4\u00a3299 \u2013 Third cost of living payment \u2013 during spring 2024Bank holiday brings payment schedule changeThe usual state support in the shape of benefits and pensions payments will also be going out in August, although the arrival of the Summer Bank Holiday on Monday 28 means that anyone expecting to receive their money on that date can typically expect it to be paid into their bank accounts one working day earlier (Friday 25, for instance).That applies to anyone expecting to receive any of the following from the DWP in August:Universal creditState pensionPension creditDisability living allowancePersonal independence paymentAttendance allowanceCarer\u2019s allowanceEmployment support allowanceIncome supportJobseeker\u2019s allowanceFor more information on how and when state benefits are paid, please visit the government\u2019s website.Energy Price Guarantee expired as cap loweredThe sweltering weather we can expect to continue into August \u2013 which has already brought the warmest June since records began in 1884 \u2013 might not be comfortable for everyone but it will at least greatly reduce the need for having the central heating switched on, which proved such an expense over the course of the winter just gone.The government\u2019s Energy Price Guarantee (EPG) \u2013 introduced by Liz Truss last September to ensure households paid no more than \u00a32,500 for their electricity and gas, with the government subsidising the remainder owed to providers under Ofgem\u2019s Energy Price Cap (EPC) \u2013 was extended by chancellor Jeremy Hunt in his Budget of 15 March for a further three months.Mr Hunt had reportedly been tempted to increase the EPG to \u00a33,000, a considerably less generous offer that would have eased the burden on the state, but ultimately thought better of it, extending the guarantee into April, May and June.Now that the EPG has finally expired, consumers will once more be paying the EPC rate, which Ofgem set at \u00a32,074 for the third quarter beginning 1 July, a huge fall from the \u00a33,280 it was set at during the second quarter, from which households were shielded by the intervention of the government\u2019s overriding guarantee.That 17 per cent decrease reflects recent drops in wholesale energy prices \u2013 the amount energy firms pay for electricity and gas before supplying it to households \u2013 and, although it is a significant drop from the eye-watering rates of the last two years, the figure remains more than \u00a31,000 a year above pre-pandemic levels.As for what might happen next, consultancy firm Cornwall Insight predicts that July\u2019s fall will be followed by another drop in October, when it expects the typical annual bill to be \u00a31,976.RecommendedBudget 2022: Hunt says UK in recession as he announces huge tax risesJeremy Hunt increases energy windfall tax in budgetJeremy Hunt freezes tax allowances and hits 45p rate payersUnfortunately, it believes the typical bill will then rise again in January 2024 to \u00a32,045 and Cornwall does not expect energy prices to return to pre-Covid levels before the end of the decade at the earliest.It has also warned customers that prices remain subject to wholesale market volatility, with the UK\u2019s reliance on energy imports meaning that geopolitical incidents like the war in Ukraine could continue to have a detrimental impact."},

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeHundreds of patients are taking up hospital beds across England every day despite being ready to leave, due to hold-ups in sorting transport, medicines and paperwork, or because they have nowhere to be discharged to, new analysis shows.Disagreements between a patient or their family and medical staff, plus the need to install specialist equipment in a person\u2019s home, are among other reasons for delays.But the biggest obstacle to the speedy discharge of patients is lack of beds in other settings, such as care homes or community hospitals, which health chiefs have dubbed a \u201ccapacity crunch\u201d that needs \u201cappropriate funding\u201d.It is the first time figures have been published that break down the reasons for discharge delays.They show that, among patients in England in June who had been in hospital at least 14 days since their arrival, an average of 1,791 a day were unable to be discharged due the lack of a bed in a residential or nursing home that was likely to be a permanent placement, while 1,727 a day were waiting for a rehabilitation bed in a community hospital or a similar setting.RecommendedBereaved relatives in compensation plea as Government figures face blood inquirySunak confirms bulk of Britain\u2019s new homes will not \u2018concrete over the countryside\u2019 as Gove announces reformsCharities lament unfulfilled promise four years on from vow to \u2018fix social care\u2019An average of 2,033 patients a day were waiting for resources to assess and begin care at home, the highest number in any category, according to analysis by the PA news agency of NHS England data.Some discharge delays involve issues within hospitals themselves, including hold-ups for a particular medical decision such as writing the discharge summary, which applied to an average of 390 patients per day last month.Other examples are waits for community equipment and adaptations to housing (an average of 234 patients per day), for a therapy decision to discharge (421 patients), for transport (98 patients) and for medicines to take home (44 patients).An NHS spokesperson told the PA news agency: \u201cDelayed discharges put considerable pressure on the NHS, which is why the health service has been working closely with colleagues in local authorities on a range of initiatives to send more patients home when they are medically fit to leave.\u201cThe reasons for patients not being able to leave the hospital when they are fit for discharge are often complex, and making more data available \u2013 as committed to in our Urgent and Emergency Care Recovery Plan \u2013 is one way to help local health services plan with social care partners the alternative care that patients need, such as reablement support so they can safely return home, or a care home placement.\u201dDelays in discharging patients can lead to knock-on effects in other parts of the healthcare system, such as fewer beds for people needing treatment and handover delays outside hospitals causing patients to wait inside ambulances, which was one of the biggest pressures on the NHS last winter.Two of the most complex reasons for delays listed in the new data are where there is a disagreement between a patient, their family and the NHS about a plan to discharge; and when a patient is homeless or has no place to be discharged to.Among people who had been in hospital at least two weeks and who were ready to leave but were not discharged, these reasons accounted for an average of 128 and 142 patients a day respectively.\n\nDelayed discharge is caused by several factors including a capacity crunch of staff and beds in social care and community health servicesMiriam Deakin, NHS ProvidersMiriam Deakin, director of policy and strategy at NHS Providers, the membership organisation for NHS trusts in England, said: \u201cDelayed discharge is caused by several factors including a capacity crunch of staff and beds in social care and community health services \u2013 both of which need appropriate funding.\u201cInvestment in rehabilitation and intermediate care could also help more people stay independent in the community, reduce avoidable hospital admissions and ensure that after a hospital stay, patients can return home or to a community setting in a timely way with appropriate support.\u201cThe short-term national funding pots we\u2019ve seen recently cannot offer sustainable solutions. A fully funded long-term workforce plan for social care, accompanied by debate about long-term funding and reform, would put the sector on a sustainable footing.\u201cWe hope this data published by NHS England shines a light on these issues and encourages efforts \u2013 nationally and locally \u2013 to address them.\u201dHospitals in south-east England account for around one in five patients in each of the main categories, a higher proportion than any other region, PA analysis shows.This includes 437 (22 per cent) of the 2,033 daily average of people waiting for resources to start care at home, 355 (20 per cent) of the 1,791 waiting for a bed in a residential or nursing home, and 330 (19 per cent) of the 1,727 waiting for a rehabilitation bed in a community hospital.University Hospitals Sussex was the NHS trust with the highest average of delayed discharges due to a wait for resources to begin care at home, at 99 patients per day, ahead of Manchester University (70) and Leeds Teaching Hospitals (66).It also had the highest average for delays due to waits for a bed in a community hospital (85 patients per day), ahead of Norfolk & Norwich University Hospitals (56) and University Hospitals of Leicester (55).Manchester University NHS trust recorded the highest average due to waits for a bed in a residential or nursing home (81 patients per day), followed by Leeds Teaching Hospitals and Liverpool University Hospitals (both 80 per day).\n\nWe are investing a record \u00a31.6 billion to support timely and safe discharge from hospitalDepartment of Health and Social CareOverall, an average of 12,334 hospital beds in England per day last month were occupied by people ready to be discharged \u2013 down from 12,597 in May and 12,760 in April.The equivalent figure for June 2022 was 11,590.A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \u201cWe are working to ensure patients leave the hospital as soon as they are medically fit, and the number of patients each day who are ready to be discharged but still in hospital has reduced by 2,200 in England since January.\u201cWe are investing a record \u00a31.6bn to support timely and safe discharge from hospital.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeHundreds of patients are taking up hospital beds across England every day despite being ready to leave, due to hold-ups in sorting transport, medicines and paperwork, or because they have nowhere to be discharged to, new analysis shows.Disagreements between a patient or their family and medical staff, plus the need to install specialist equipment in a person\u2019s home, are among other reasons for delays.But the biggest obstacle to the speedy discharge of patients is lack of beds in other settings, such as care homes or community hospitals, which health chiefs have dubbed a \u201ccapacity crunch\u201d that needs \u201cappropriate funding\u201d.It is the first time figures have been published that break down the reasons for discharge delays.They show that, among patients in England in June who had been in hospital at least 14 days since their arrival, an average of 1,791 a day were unable to be discharged due the lack of a bed in a residential or nursing home that was likely to be a permanent placement, while 1,727 a day were waiting for a rehabilitation bed in a community hospital or a similar setting.RecommendedBereaved relatives in compensation plea as Government figures face blood inquirySunak confirms bulk of Britain\u2019s new homes will not \u2018concrete over the countryside\u2019 as Gove announces reformsCharities lament unfulfilled promise four years on from vow to \u2018fix social care\u2019An average of 2,033 patients a day were waiting for resources to assess and begin care at home, the highest number in any category, according to analysis by the PA news agency of NHS England data.Some discharge delays involve issues within hospitals themselves, including hold-ups for a particular medical decision such as writing the discharge summary, which applied to an average of 390 patients per day last month.Other examples are waits for community equipment and adaptations to housing (an average of 234 patients per day), for a therapy decision to discharge (421 patients), for transport (98 patients) and for medicines to take home (44 patients).An NHS spokesperson told the PA news agency: \u201cDelayed discharges put considerable pressure on the NHS, which is why the health service has been working closely with colleagues in local authorities on a range of initiatives to send more patients home when they are medically fit to leave.\u201cThe reasons for patients not being able to leave the hospital when they are fit for discharge are often complex, and making more data available \u2013 as committed to in our Urgent and Emergency Care Recovery Plan \u2013 is one way to help local health services plan with social care partners the alternative care that patients need, such as reablement support so they can safely return home, or a care home placement.\u201dDelays in discharging patients can lead to knock-on effects in other parts of the healthcare system, such as fewer beds for people needing treatment and handover delays outside hospitals causing patients to wait inside ambulances, which was one of the biggest pressures on the NHS last winter.Two of the most complex reasons for delays listed in the new data are where there is a disagreement between a patient, their family and the NHS about a plan to discharge; and when a patient is homeless or has no place to be discharged to.Among people who had been in hospital at least two weeks and who were ready to leave but were not discharged, these reasons accounted for an average of 128 and 142 patients a day respectively.\n\nDelayed discharge is caused by several factors including a capacity crunch of staff and beds in social care and community health servicesMiriam Deakin, NHS ProvidersMiriam Deakin, director of policy and strategy at NHS Providers, the membership organisation for NHS trusts in England, said: \u201cDelayed discharge is caused by several factors including a capacity crunch of staff and beds in social care and community health services \u2013 both of which need appropriate funding.\u201cInvestment in rehabilitation and intermediate care could also help more people stay independent in the community, reduce avoidable hospital admissions and ensure that after a hospital stay, patients can return home or to a community setting in a timely way with appropriate support.\u201cThe short-term national funding pots we\u2019ve seen recently cannot offer sustainable solutions. A fully funded long-term workforce plan for social care, accompanied by debate about long-term funding and reform, would put the sector on a sustainable footing.\u201cWe hope this data published by NHS England shines a light on these issues and encourages efforts \u2013 nationally and locally \u2013 to address them.\u201dHospitals in south-east England account for around one in five patients in each of the main categories, a higher proportion than any other region, PA analysis shows.This includes 437 (22 per cent) of the 2,033 daily average of people waiting for resources to start care at home, 355 (20 per cent) of the 1,791 waiting for a bed in a residential or nursing home, and 330 (19 per cent) of the 1,727 waiting for a rehabilitation bed in a community hospital.University Hospitals Sussex was the NHS trust with the highest average of delayed discharges due to a wait for resources to begin care at home, at 99 patients per day, ahead of Manchester University (70) and Leeds Teaching Hospitals (66).It also had the highest average for delays due to waits for a bed in a community hospital (85 patients per day), ahead of Norfolk & Norwich University Hospitals (56) and University Hospitals of Leicester (55).Manchester University NHS trust recorded the highest average due to waits for a bed in a residential or nursing home (81 patients per day), followed by Leeds Teaching Hospitals and Liverpool University Hospitals (both 80 per day).\n\nWe are investing a record \u00a31.6 billion to support timely and safe discharge from hospitalDepartment of Health and Social CareOverall, an average of 12,334 hospital beds in England per day last month were occupied by people ready to be discharged \u2013 down from 12,597 in May and 12,760 in April.The equivalent figure for June 2022 was 11,590.A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \u201cWe are working to ensure patients leave the hospital as soon as they are medically fit, and the number of patients each day who are ready to be discharged but still in hospital has reduced by 2,200 in England since January.\u201cWe are investing a record \u00a31.6bn to support timely and safe discharge from hospital.

reforms due to be announced by Housing Secretary Michael Gove, Rishi Sunak has confirmed that the Conservative Westminster government is on course to meet its target of building one million homes between 2019-24.Mr Sunak, who is due to visit the West Midlands, and Mr Gove are expected to provide more details on Monday about plans to prioritise house building in inner city areas.The proposals include developing a new urban quarter in Cambridge with space for homes, art facilities, laboratories and green areas.Mr Sunak said: \u201cToday I can confirm that we will meet our manifesto

families in every corner of our country.\u201cWe need to keep going because we want more people to realise the dream of owning their own home.\u201cWe won\u2019t do that by concreting over the countryside \u2013 our plan is to build the right homes where there is the most need and where there is local support, in the heart of Britain\u2019s great cities.\u201cOur reforms today will help make that a reality by regenerating disused brownfield land, streamlining the planning process and helping homeowners to renovate and extend their houses outwards and upwards.\u201dThe announcement comes only two weeks after a cross-party panel of MPs warned that Tory ministers are unlikely to deliver 300,000 new homes per year after the Prime Minister made the target advisory rather than mandatory as he looked to see off a potential backbench rebellion.The Levelling Up, Housing and Communities Committee, in a report published earlier this month, said that, while the government was on track to deliver one million new homes over the course of the current Parliament, it was not forecast to deliver 300,000 net new homes per year by the mid-2020s.\n\nOur plan is to build the right homes where there is the most need and where there is local support, in the heart of Britain\u2019s great citiesRishi Sunak, Prime Minister Clive Betts, the Labour committee chairman, said Mr Sunak\u2019s decision was \u201calready having a damaging impact on efforts to increase the building of new homes\u201d.Mr Gove, in a speech in London, will announce plans to slash red tape to pave the way for more conversions of shops and takeaways into houses in efforts to address the housing crisis.A review into the extension of permitted development rights is expected to make it simpler to extend homes and convert lofts so buildings can be expanded upwards and outwards.The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said ministers will also take steps to unblock bottlenecks in the planning system to speed up development approvals.Mr Gove will unveil intentions to invest \u00a324 million into a planning skills delivery fund to help clear backlogs.A \u201csuper-squad\u201d team of leading planners and other experts will be established to work across the planning system to unblock major housing developments, with their first port of call being in Cambridge to help realise the ambitions for the city.Developers will be asked to contribute more through fees to help fund the upgrades, officials in Mr Gove\u2019s department confirmed.In an interview with The Sunday Telegraph, Mr Gove said his proposals would also include creating development corporations to unleash a wave of new homes in cities such as Birmingham, Manchester and Liverpool.Councils will be given the opportunity to bid to set up the government-sponsored bodies which will have the power to use compulsory purchase orders to buy up land and sell parts of it on to developers to build new homes.Inspired by the regeneration created in east London by the Docklands Development Corporation in the 1980s, Mr Gove said his plans are to kick-start a \u201c21st-century renaissance for our great cities\u201d.In a statement ahead of his speech, the Housing Secretary said: \u201cMost people agree that we need to build more homes \u2014 the question is how we go about it.\u201cRather than concreting over the countryside, we have set out a plan today to build the right homes in the right places where there is community support \u2014 and we\u2019re putting the resources behind it to help make this vision a reality.\u201cAt the heart of this is making sure that we build beautiful and empower communities to have a say in the development in their area.\u201dOther plans included in Mr Gove\u2019s reforms package involve setting up the Office for Place, a body charged with ensuring a high standard of housing design and that communities have a say in the look of new developments.The plans have been welcomed by the construction firm Mace and the Royal Institute of British Architects.But the Local Government Association (LGA) has flagged concerns about the prospect of loosening the rules around permitted development rights, arguing it can lead to substandard housing.Councillor Shaun Davies, chairman of the LGA, said: \u201cPremises such as offices, barns and shops are not always suitable for housing.\u201cFurther expanding permitted development rights risks creating poor quality residential environments that negatively impact people\u2019s health and wellbeing, as well as a lack of affordable housing or suitable infrastructure.\u201cIt is disappointing that the government have ignored their own commissioned research that concluded that homes converted through a planning application process deliver higher quality homes than those converted via permitted development rights.\u201dLisa Nandy, Labour\u2019s shadow housing secretary, said: \u201cIt takes some serious brass neck for the Tories to make yet more promises when the housing crisis has gone from bad to worse on their watch, and when housebuilding is on course to hit its lowest rate since the Second World War because Rishi Sunak rolled over to his own MPs.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeA Black man who won an employment tribunal after being racially abused by a manager at Halfords has spoken of his anguish - and his outrage that the senior staffer still works for the company.Christopher Best, 34, took Halfords, one of the UK\u2019s largest retailers, to task this year arguing that he was discriminated against on the grounds of his ethnicity.It was found that his colleague, Mr Pillay, targeted him with abuse for over a year, comparing him to a \u201cmonkey crying for bananas\u201d and telling staff \u201cI don\u2019t care - I\u2019m going to be racist\u201d.Mr Best was awarded \u00a35,000 for \u201cinjury to feelings\u201d by the tribunal, while Mr Pillay was found to have breached the Equality Act by harassing his colleague more than once between October 2020 and November 2021.Speaking exclusively to The Independent for the first time since the tribunal\u2019s ruling, Mr Best said: \u201cMr Pillay\u2019s actions breached the store\u2019s own policies on gross misconduct, so, to me, it stands to reason that he should be sacked. RecommendedHalfords manager suing company for \u00a31m over alleged race discriminationRevealed: Britain\u2019s council housing shameLego legacy: The 26-year mystery of fantasy worlds lost at sea\u201cDuring the period of time that I suffered abuse from Mr Pillay, I felt victimised, angry and violated. There were times when I felt like I wanted to explode but I kept a cap on it, mindful of the consequences of being seen as a troublemaker.\u201cIt\u2019s disgusting that even in 2023, we still come across people who behave like Mr Pillay.\u201dBeing on the receiving end of racist abuse from Mr Pillay came as a horrible shock to Mr Best.The former employee was appointed as a Service Sales Advisor in 2012 at the Brixton branch, south London, before his contract was terminated in 2021. Mr Best argued racial harassment and unfair dismissal; however, the latter allegation was unfounded.Just 0.2 per cent of discrimination claims relating to ethnicity end up being heard at an employment tribunal, according to research from the Resolution Foundation in November.Mr Best\u2019s case against Halford was fuelled by a desire to hold the retailer accountable and he says rejected an opportunity to settle out of court for a five-figure sum.\u201cI turned it down because I couldn\u2019t do it and live with a clear conscience,\u201d Mr Best explained. \u201cIn the beginning, I wasn\u2019t even going to fight back. But then I realised that my case was strong.\u201cThe money didn\u2019t matter to me; it was more the principle of exposing how this man had treated me and the company. I hoped that good people will no longer be subjected to this treatment. That\u2019s what was important.\u201dDespite the tribunal\u2019s outcome, Mr Best still doesn\u2019t think justice has been served because Mr Pillay appears to still be employed by Halfords.\u201cHow can justice have been achieved when Mr Pillay is still working there? When it comes to equality within corporate organisations, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any denying that Black people fare worse than other ethnic groups.\u201dHalfords has not responded to multiple comment requests from The Independent, however, it has been confirmed that Mr Pillay is still employed by the company.He was still employed by the company when the tribunal took place in February 2023.Despite the tribunal\u2019s outcome, Mr Best still doesn\u2019t think justice has been served because Mr Pillay appears to still be employed by Halfords (PA Media)When we called the store on Friday, they said Mr Pillay now works at another branch.In recent years, the retailer has repeatedly come under fire for alleged racism in its ranks. The Independent previously revealed that Halfords is being sued for \u00a31 million by a former Black employee who alleges racial discrimination. This case remains ongoing.Mr Adjei-Dawkins, who didn\u2019t want his first name used, worked at Halfords as an assistant manager where he claims to have been bullied by managers and paid less than white colleagues in junior positions.The 32-year-old said he was \u201ccontinuously\u201d subjected to the treatment during his five-year tenure and was \u201cstereotypically labelled\u201d as \u201caggressive\u201d, despite having no prior disciplinary records, according to documents seen by The Independent.RecommendedRevealed: Britain\u2019s council housing shameLego legacy: The 26-year mystery of fantasy worlds lost at seaHow the UK\u2019s deadliest whale stranding in decades unfoldedRegarding Mr Adjei-Dawkins, a Halfords spokesperson said: \u201cWe dispute in the strongest possible terms all of Mr Adjei-Dawkins\u2019 claims. We have a large and diverse workforce, and we work hard to foster a welcoming and inclusive culture.Halfords operates over 600 stores across the UK and Ireland, with over 10,000 staff members.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe government\u2019s plans to tackle the climate emergency have been thrown into turmoil as Rishi Sunak signalled he could delay or even abandon green policies that put financial pressure on families.The prime minister is rethinking his green agenda after pressure from right-wing Tory MPs to win over voters after the party\u2019s narrow win in last week\u2019s Uxbridge and South Ruislip by-election. Downing Street was forced to insist its pledge to reach net zero by 2050 \u201cremains\u201d, but the prime minister\u2019s spokesperson said he is \u201cmaking sure we listen to consumers and business\u201d and will \u201ccontinually scrutinise\u201d plans such as the banning of new petrol and diesel car sales by 2030. Other policies under scrutiny include the government\u2019s plan to phase out gas boilers by 2035. Mr Sunak\u2019s spokesperson said both initiatives \u201cremain our commitment\u201d, but the PM would take a \u201cproportionate and pragmatic\u201d approach to make it \u201ceasier\u201d for households already grappling with financial pressures from high inflation.

The cost to consumers of green policies has been thrust into the spotlight by the Tories\u2019 narrow win in the Uxbridge by-election, which was driven almost entirely by opposition to London mayor Sadiq Khan\u2019s expansion of the ultra-low-emission zone (Ulez).Mr Sunak\u2019s suggestion the government could scale back some green policies came under fire from the Green Alliance think tank. Deputy political director Chris Venables said the only \u201cproportional and pragmatic\u201d response to the climate crisis is to \u201cpull every lever we can\u201d to get to net zero.\u201cIt is disappointing to see the government and the opposition hesitate on this over the weekend, especially during a period of extreme weather, and in the face of all the evidence saying that acting now will save lives, rebuild our economy, and protect the future of the planet,\u201d Mr Venables said. A government source said there are no discussions going on to review current net zero policies. And a Downing Street spokesperson said: \u201c2030 remains our commitment, of course it\u2019s right to listen to consumers and businesses so our path to net zero is proportionate and pragmatic.\u201dBut it has been suggested ministers will draw lines around some net zero policies, while others could be watered down or scrapped. The Times reported on Monday that officials are considering an \u201cAston Martin exemption\u201d to the 2030 deadline, which would give small carmakers longer to convert to electric vehicles.Low-traffic neighbourhoods also face a ban, and landlords will be given longer to meet energy efficiency targets, it said.Sunak said the government will move towards net zero in a way that doesn\u2019t give people \u2018more hassle\u2019  (Getty Images)The prime minister insisted on Monday that reaching net zero is important to him, following accusations he is \u201cuninterested\u201d in the environment. But he did not specifically recommit to the ban on selling new petrol and diesel cars from 2030 amid tensions over policies to tackle the emergency.Former business secretary Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg and Danny Kruger, the co-leader of the New Conservatives group of Tory MPs elected since the Brexit referendum, have been among those urging the prime minister to reconsider the deadlines for green initiatives.RecommendedBan on new petrol and diesel cars from 2030 will remain in place, says ministerBritish tourists describe fleeing for their lives from Rhodes wildfire: \u2018It was hell on earth\u2019Sir Jacob said that scrapping \u201cunpopular, expensive\u201d policies would be a \u201creal opportunity\u201d and proposed getting rid of the 2030 ban announced during Boris Johnson\u2019s premiership.But Mr Sunak has also faced allegations of environmental apathy from some quarters of the Conservative Party, with Tory peer Zac Goldsmith resigning as a minister after accusing Mr Sunak of being \u201cuninterested\u201d in the environment.London mayor Sadiq Khan is sticking by his policy of expanding Ulez, the \u00a312.50 daily charge for vehicles that fall short of emissions standards, to the capital\u2019s suburbs.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer had urged him to \u201creflect\u201d on the policy designed to cut air pollution after Labour failed to seize Uxbridge by 495 votes."}, {"_id": "64bef82451ac33362ba19b74", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/greece-rhodes-wildfires-corfu-latest-news-b2380607.html", "primaryCategory": "Europe", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Greece fires \u2013 live: Red alert for Crete as British tourists in \u2018living nightmare\u2019 on Rhodes and Corfu", "lead": "<p>Tuesday expected to bring more wildfires as \u2018extreme fire risk\u2019  issued for Crete and Rhodes </p>", "author": "Maryam Zakir-Hussain,Stuti Mishra,Andy Gregory and Martha McHardy", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 19:38:59", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:16:04.849266", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-24T19:38:59+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/23/11/22-248ea6eb8c1740c6802e6cb1279acec8.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "\u2715CloseGreece wildfires: Rhodes tourists sleep on airport floor awaiting evacuation\nFor free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Florida\u2019s coral reef is one such victim with die-off of the fragile system happening at an alarming rate due to abnormally high ocean temperatures, marine scientists have warned. The Florida Keys has already lost up to 90 per cent of its coral in the past 50 years. One area, known as Sombrero Reef, has had 100 per cent coral mortality, according to the Coral Restoration Foundation, along with almost all the corals in the nearby Looe Key Nursery.\u201cClimate change is our present reality,\u201d said Dr R Scott Winters, CEO of the foundation, in a statement. \u201cThe impact on our reefs is undeniable.\u201dThe Florida reef, which runs from Miami to Key West, is the third largest barrier reef in the world and the only one in the continental United States. Reefs are a crucial part of ocean ecosystems and 25 per cent of marine species rely on them.RecommendedDelhi reels from record rainfall | On The GroundWeather forecast for Greece as wildfires rage and second heatwave hits\u2018Weak tea\u2019: G20 fails to agree on cutting down fossil fuelsIn the last week, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) issued an Alert Level 2 on its coral bleaching warning system (the scale runs Levels 1-5). A Level 2 alert is issued when the average water surface temperature is 1.8F (1C) above normal for eight weeks in a row.Coral colours run the gamut from browns and greens to vibrant blues and purples due to the microscopic algae which live in its skeleton. \u201cBleaching\u201d, which turns the coral to a ghostly white, is a sign that the species are in big trouble and more susceptible to disease and starvation.Florida, like much of the southern half of the US, has experienced relentless heat and humidity in the past two months.Dead elkhorn coral at Sombrero Reef in the Florida Keys. The white areas are bleached coral, the brownish orange patches are \u201ctissue slough\u201d, coral tissue that has died before it has a chance to bleach  (Coral Restoration Foundation)Excessive heat warnings were issued for southern Florida on Monday with highs in the 90Fs and lows in the 80Fs, which may break records over the next couple of days, the National Weather Service reported.Ocean temperatures have also been abnormally high. The sea surface temperature in the Florida Keys is averaging 91F (33C) \u2013 far above the typical mid-July temperature of 85F (29.5C), NOAA\u2019s Coral Reef Watch program told the AP.These temperatures are being reached weeks earlier than in past years, NOAA noted.Andrew Bruckner, from the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, told the AP that some reefs began showing the first signs of bleaching at the start of July, and then this weekend, some reefs lost all their color. That had never been recorded before the start of August as the peak for bleaching typically happens in late August or September.If extreme temperatures fail to break, the consequences could be devastating. But a change in conditions would provide the reef with much-needed respite.A tropical storm or hurricane could churn the water and cool it down, according to NOAA.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe meeting between the energy ministers of the world\u2019s 20 richest countries ended with a \u201cdisappointing\u201d outcome that has been branded by experts as \u201cweak tea\u201d and a reneging of commitments made by them last year.The G20 countries, in their latest meeting held in India\u2019s tourist state Goa, failed to reach a consensus on cutting down fossil fuels amid globally record-shattering heatwaves and rising climate concerns.With just two months to go for the main G20 summit in September and four months for the Cop28 UN climate summit in Dubai, this meeting was seen as a crucial temperature gauge for the geopolitics of the urgent need for energy transition.Cutting down planet-heating fossil fuels is becoming an increasingly urgent call as back-to-back heatwaves caused by the climate crisis have led to record temperatures in large parts of the northern hemisphere with Europe, China and the US sweltering in unprecedented heat this year.However, experts said that when the world needed to hear a \u201cclarion call to action\u201d, the outcome of the meeting turned out to be \u201cweak tea\u201d.RecommendedG20 nations raked in $50bn in debt repayments from poor countries since Covid, report finds2023 is set to be hottest on record amid global heatwaves, scientists sayWhat is driving the record-breaking global heatwaves across three continents?\u201cWith temperature records being set daily around the world and the impacts of climate change spiralling out of control, the world needed to hear a clarion call to action from the G20 energy ministers meeting that just wrapped up in Goa,\u201d said Alden Meyer, senior associate at environmental think-tank E3G.\u201cInstead, what we got was very weak tea indeed, with the failure to set strong goals and implementation plans for at least tripling deployed renewable energy capacity worldwide by 2030 and sharp divisions on display around the need for a fair, fast, and equitable transition away from fossil fuels.\u201dOne of the biggest points of contention during the meeting was the call to cut down all fossil fuels, the emissions from which are heating the world. However, this issue has remained highly challenged in international climate negotiations.While at the Cop26 Glasgow summit in 2021, all countries agreed with the language to phase down coal, ministers at the G20 meeting failed to reiterate the commitment to accelerate the phasedown of unabated coal generation.Anusha Mata, senior policy advisor at E3G, said it showed there are \u201cclear divisions among energy leaders on the pathway to securing a clean energy future.\u201d\u201cThe weak language on fossil fuel phase down and absence of any mention of coal \u2013 the most polluting energy source \u2013 is a clear backtracking on previous commitments in last year\u2019s G20 Bali Declaration,\u201d she said. People cool themselves at the Trevi Fountain during a heatwave across Italy as temperatures are expected to cool off in Rome, Italy (REUTERS)The debate over the phasing out of fossil fuels, which is becoming all the more urgent with recent climate extremes, has been a long-standing dispute in international climate negotiations.India, a coal-reliant country and the host of the G20 summit this year, has been demanding that countries should agree to cut down all fossil fuels, including oil and gas, instead of just singling out coal.Experts said the ongoing dispute resulted in a watered-down language in the final outcome on fossil fuels and tripling of renewable energy capacity. They said it also showed the Dubai presidency for the upcoming Cop summit has a long way ahead to build consensus on key issues.\u201cThe fight over energy pathways seems to be a continuation of the disagreement at Cop27 over phasing down \u2018all fossil fuels\u2019, which India supported because it wanted oil and gas to be treated similarly to coal, which the world agreed to phase down \u2013 but not phase-out \u2013 at Cop26,\u201d said Tarun Gopalakrishnan, pre-doctoral fellow at the Climate Policy Lab, Centre for International Environment Policy. \u201cAs expected, India had to settle for language, for eg tripling of RE has been changed to \u2018tripling of clean technology capacity\u2019 and phasing down of all fossil fuels has been watered down. This has been the best diplomatic solution, but it is not the best climate policy solution.\u201dHowever, some progress was made, as countries agreed to step up energy efficiency and deployment of distributed renewable energy technologies as well as recognise the need for low-cost finance for clean energy transition in developing countries.But Mr Meyers said the Indian G20 presidency \u201cmust not accept this outcome as the final answer\u201d.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeIt was 8.13am on the morning of her 12th wedding anniversary when M\u00e0iri Robertson Carrey was woken by the emergency alert.Two hours further up the coastline, a pod of pilot whales had run aground and was now trapped on a remote beach on the Isle of Lewis \u2013 with a desperate race against time underway to save the lives of as many as possible.But despite completing her extensive training as a volunteer marine medic only last September, there was little which could have prepared Ms Carrey for the scenes awaiting her on the rugged golden-white sands of Traigh Mh\u00f2r, which last weekend played host to the UK\u2019s deadliest mass stranding in decades.Pod of 55 whales found dead after mass stranding in ScotlandNo fewer than 55 pilot whales lay strewn across the beach \u2013 many of them already dead \u2013 when they were discovered on Sunday morning by a fellow volunteer with British Divers Marine Life Rescue (BDMLR), who, like Ms Carrey, had only completed her training 10 months ago.The discovery \u2013 on an outer Hebridean island accessible only by ferry or plane \u2013 sent instant shockwaves through the UK\u2019s network of cetacean experts, who rallied from across the country to join a mammoth response still in force one week on as scientists conduct post-mortems.RecommendedGladis the killer whale and her gang of orcas, out for revenge in GibraltarCould the spate of mysterious killer whale boat attacks be spreading beyond Gibraltar?Early investigations suggest one of the whales encountered difficulty giving birth and \u2013 given the strong social and emotional bonds between pilot whales \u2013 was fatally followed onto the beach by the others, according to BDMLR director of welfare and conservation Dan Jarvis.Given that just 15 whales were still alive by the time they were discovered, they are believed to have washed ashore in the middle of the night \u2013 one of several unfortunate factors which compounded the difficulties faced by rescuers.With pilot whales weighing up to two tonnes and growing to seven metres in length, it\u2019s \u201cjust not physically possible\u201d to move them closer to the water, \u201cso you\u2019re very much at the mercy of time and tide\u201d, said Mr Jarvis, who was coordinating the network from Cornwall last Sunday.Pod of 55 whales found dead after mass stranding in Scotland\u201cIf you\u2019re lucky,\u201d he said, \u201cyou know exactly how long they\u2019ve been stranded for, and if you\u2019re even luckier, they strand on an incoming tide which gives you an opportunity to refloat them. But with this case it was completely the reverse.\u201cWe didn\u2019t see them strand, they\u2019d possibly been there for hours already, and they were found on high tide, so there was really not any opportunity to do anything for the ones that were high and dry by the time first responders got there.\u201dMoreover, Traigh Mh\u00f2r is in a \u201cdead zone\u201d for phone signal and the rescuers\u2019 high-frequency radios were also struggling \u2013 meaning any communication had to be done at least a mile-and-a-half from the beach.But by the time Ms Carrey and her husband had arrived from their home in Scarista, at the opposite end of the Isle of Harris, some 25 coast guard staff, fire and rescue officials and BDMLR medics were already at the scene, along with a few members of the public.\n\nThey were spread out across the beach in kind of an arc ... You were nose-to-tail with a number of others that weren\u2019t alive\u201d In a testament to their training, the plan drawn up by her fellow volunteer who was first on the scene remained in place long into the afternoon, and attempts had already been made to refloat two whales who were \u201cstill quite active\u201d and were beached closer to the water, while other survivors were triaged.While one sole survivor managed to swim away and has not been spotted since, the other whale \u2013 thought to be a calf, drawn to its mother on the beach \u2013 continued to wash back up on the beach despite multiple attempts to refloat it, with the sea state eventually deemed unsafe for the rescuers to continue.But with high tide not set to return until 7pm, rescuers faced a tense situation \u2013 and Ms Carrey and her husband were met by the sight of whales strewn across the beach, with those who remained alive identifiable by the soaked towels and blankets in which they were covered to keep them wet.\u201cWhen I arrived I was just advised \u2018choose one\u2019 because we didn\u2019t have enough medics to be one-to-one,\u201d said Ms Carrey, who ended up looking after three different whales.\u201cThey were spread out across the beach in kind of an arc. Some of them were very, very close together,\u201d she told The Independent, adding that for every whale she was tending, \u201cyou were nose-to-tail with a number of others that weren\u2019t alive\u201d.The living whales were covered in blankets to keep them wet (Mairi Robertson Carrey/via REUTERS)Initially choosing the two \u201cthat looked really quiet\u201d, Ms Carrey \u201cnoticed that the longer I spent with the whale I\u2019d chosen, the more lively it became and its breathing became more regular\u201d.The whales were \u201cblowing quite hard through their blowholes\u201d, with their entire bodies visibly moving and shuddering, and the two livelier whales lashing their tail \u2013 known as flukes \u2013 and \u201cstruggling a bit on the sand\u201d.Ms Carrey, who works full-time at the BumbleBee Conservation Trust and is also working on the Lottery-funded Species on the Edge programme, also recalled hearing either a \u201cvibration through the ground\u201d or a \u201cnoise vibrating from one of the whales\u201d she was with, which she \u201ckept feeling through the sand\u201d.\u201cI was talking to them and saying \u2018everything\u2019s going to be fine\u2019, and after a few hours kind of ran out of words, and I was humming and singing,\u201d she said, recalling singing a Gaelic lullaby to one of the whales.\u201cMy mum\u2019s from Harris,\u201d she explained. \u201cAll kinds of things come through your mind in that situation, I suppose. Just things I thought might be soothing or comforting \u2013 or maybe it was me that was being soothed or comforted, I\u2019m not sure.\u201dWith the sea receding, channels were dug out to harness rainy streams coming off the dunes directly to the whales. Sandbanks were also built up against the whales\u2019 flanks and under their flippers to keep them upright and help them breathe.But despite all their best efforts, at 3pm it was decided by a veterinarian that the whales should be euthanised to save them from further suffering, in the face of a punishing and near-impossible wait for high tide to return at 7pm.Channels of water were dug by the coast guard and sandbanks built to keep the whales upright  (Mairi Robertson-Carrey/BDMLR via AP)\u201cYou\u2019ve got bodies everywhere, you\u2019ve got a few survivors \u2013 but you\u2019ve only got a limited amount of resources to do anything,\u201d said Mr Jarvis. \u201cThese animals, when they\u2019re out of water, do start to crush themselves under their own weight, as they live entirely in the marine environment.\u201dAs their skeleton loses its ability to support their bodies, \u201cthat crushing effect over time will start to cut off circulation and affect the function of organs and muscles and tissues, and will start to build up toxins which will effectively poison the animal and kill it\u201d. \u201cGenerally speaking,\u201d he added, \u201cit\u2019s around six hours that they\u2019re viable for, out of the water.\u201dMs Carrey described the decision as a \u201cheartbreaking\u201d moment \u2013 as those not involved in the euthanasia and early post-mortem procedures were told to leave the beach. Some volunteers had only just arrived on ferries from Ullapool and Skye, while a vet who flew from Oxford on a private plane had just reached Dundee and was turned around.\u201cIt hit people really hard. People left in tears and really heartbroken,\u201d said Ms Carrey. \u201cI went to say goodbye to the three [whales] I\u2019d been supporting and that was very emotional. I think after that, when I realised what was going to happen, I just mentally and emotionally shut down and got through it, I guess.\u201dM\u00e0iri Robertson Carrey said she had since been reflecting upon the strength of the connections between both the animals and the humans involved (M\u00e0iri Robertson Carrey)That process was still ongoing a week later, with an area set out at a local landfill site for the whales to be examined as experts with the Scottish Marine Animal Stranding Scheme and elsewhere sought to glean vital information about the tragedy, and why events like it and others may have happened. With a single post-mortem taking hours, the team of just a handful of experts \u2013 including some from the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) \u2013 have been warned they faced \u201ca race against the clock\u201d to inspect as many of the whales as possible before their bodies are too decomposed.It is hoped that bacteriology, toxicology and virology samples will reveal diseases the whales may be suffering from or any ingestion of harmful human pollutants \u2013 potentially shining a light on the cause of the stranding, and the threats whales face in oceans across the world, experts said.Full post-mortems on even just a few of the whales \u201cwill be very valuable in indicating whether the cause of the stranding was human-related in any way\u201d, said Professor Peter Evans, director of the Sea Watch Foundation.With whale pods often matriarchal, Prof Evans suggested the stranding may have been caused by the mature female having difficulty giving birth and the others following it ashore due to their strong social bonds \u2013\u00a0a situation which caused a mass stranding of 21 whales on Skye in 2015. A less likely possibility is that the tragedy was caused by a \u201cnavigational error\u201d, causing the pod difficulties in unfamiliar, shallow water which hampered their sonar capabilities, he told The Independent.Or post-mortems may show evidence of haemorrhaging or bubbles in their tissue, which could reveal a human cause \u2013 such as seismic surveys for the fossil fuel industry, the naval military use of sonar, or the use of explosives to clear Second World War-era mines, Prof Evans said.It is a question of no small significance, given that Sunday\u2019s tragedy by all accounts represents the deadliest mass stranding seen on British shores for decades \u2013 outstripping a 2011 stranding at the Kyle of Durness, blamed on underwater Navy explosions, in which 19 of 70 beached whales were saved.And according to Rob Deaville, who leads the ZSL team helping conduct post-mortems, \u201creports of whale strandings are currently on the rise in the UK, and we\u2019re still trying to understand why\u201d. Mr Jarvis also reports a slight uptick in mass pilot whale strandings which began around 15 years ago, which he suggested could potentially be a result of climate change pushing cetaceans into unfamiliar habitats closer to shore, or their population increasing.But Prof Evans disagreed, pointing to strandings involving up to 150 whales spanning back centuries, and said the increase across all cetacean species over the past 30 years \u2013 comprising some 17,000 incidents \u2013 \u201cis probably as much to do with better reporting than anything else\u201d.Regardless of its place in history, the stranding on Lewis is one which will live long in the memories of those on the beach at Traigh Mh\u00f2r.\u201cWe\u2019re doing a lot of support with our team who were involved because it is quite a traumatic experience,\u201d said Mr Jarvis, calling this work \u201ca really important part of the aftermath\u201d.\u201cWhen you get there, the adrenaline kicks in and you\u2019ve got a job to do.\u201d But afterwards, \u201cwhen you come down again and you fully absorb the impact ... the sight, the sound, everything really can hit you\u201d, he said.Despite initially having felt \u201ca bit numb\u201d about the tragedy, Ms Carrey said she had been reflecting in recent days upon the strength of the connections between both the animals and the humans involved.RecommendedWhat a whale stranded on UK coast 10 years ago tells us about the climate crisisUrgent warning to avoid popular tourist beach after dead whale found\u201cSeeing the whales ... and how closely they were lying together on the shore, it did make you really think about those animal bonds,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that came through really strongly on Sunday, how important all the bonds are \u2013 for the whales, but for humans with nature as well, and with each other.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64bef82651ac33362ba19b7a", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/david-king-greek-rhodes-britons-mediterranean-b2380838.html", "primaryCategory": "News", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Greek fires \u2018big warning\u2019 for tourists to Mediterranean, says climate expert", "lead": "Nearly 20,000 people are fleeing blazes on the island of Rhodes in Greece\u2019s largest ever wildfire evacuation.", "author": "Danny Halpin", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 11:06:32", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:16:06.373269", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-24T11:06:32+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/22/23/22-3d061ead61504e468b91f0a812bb1d0b.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to the Independent Climate email for the latest advice on saving the planetGet our free Climate email\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

In terms of greenhouse gases, we have virtually doubled the amount of greenhouse gases compared to the pre-industrial level.\u201dIt is estimated that there are up to 10,000 Britons on Rhodes, many of whom have had to flee and sleep on the floors of schools, airports and sports centres.Airlines have begun to repatriate their customers back to the UK, with flights returning over the weekend.The Foreign Office said it has sent five of its staff and four British Red Cross responders to Rhodes to help support British nationals.RecommendedNorth Atlantic heatwave could be catastrophic for fish stocks, scientists warnPM told to \u2018rethink\u2019 green targets as ministers vow to shield public from costsSunak urged to drop \u2018unpopular\u2019 and \u2018expensive\u2019 green pledges ahead of electionA spokesman said: \u201cThey will be based at Rhodes International Airport to assist with travel documents and liaise with Greek authorities and travel operators on the ground.\u201cBritish nationals in Rhodes should contact their travel operator in the first instance for any queries regarding the rescheduling of flights and continue to check our updated gov.uk travel advice for information.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64bef82651ac33362ba19b7b", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/north-atlantic-fish-arctic-marine-stewardship-council-uk-government-b2380631.html", "primaryCategory": "News", "subCategories": "test", "title": "North Atlantic heatwave could be catastrophic for fish stocks, scientists warn", "lead": "Many species depend on a consistent and stable ocean temperature window, which is being upended because of human-induced climate change.", "author": "Danny Halpin", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 09:28:32", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:16:06.611446", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-24T09:28:32+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/24/06/785794e80704daf003b8cc267628acecY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjkwMTA2NjMx-2.31515727.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to the Independent Climate email for the latest advice on saving the planetGet our free Climate email\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThis year\u2019s North Atlantic heatwave may be catastrophic for fish stocks people rely on for food and livelihoods, scientists and the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) have warned.The ocean\u2019s surface temperature has been soaring above the previous record since early March with highs as much as 5C above the long-term average, classified as \u201cbeyond extreme\u201d by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \u2013 its highest category.Human-induced climate change has been steadily warming the oceans which have absorbed 90% of the excess heat produced by greenhouse gas emissions.Meanwhile, natural occurrences such as changes in wind patterns have driven the North Atlantic Ocean\u2019s temperature to record highs, scientists said.El Nino, a naturally occurring warming event in the eastern tropical Pacific, has also had an impact, driving up average ocean and air temperatures around the world, but its effects are not thought to be linked to the heatwave in the North Atlantic.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveExperts say climate change is shifting the temperature baseline, making heatwaves more frequent and more extreme and they can be just as devastating for some marine life as that on land.Dr Christopher Free, of the Marine Institute at University of California, Santa Barbara, said: \u201cIn the last decade, marine heatwaves have disrupted fisheries all around the world.\u201cIf conditions in the North Atlantic stay hot, similar catastrophes may be on the horizon.\u201dFish in the ocean, which lies between the east coast of North America and the UK and Western Europe, depend on cooler waters for spawning, with one species \u2013 the Norwegian spring spawning herring \u2013 declining by 40% since 2009, which is thought to be due to the warming oceans.The MSC is concerned that a combination of warming oceans and poor international management will lead to a crash in fish stocks that would put thousands of people out of work.Dr Olav Sigurd Kjesbu, of the Institute of Marine Research in Norway, said: \u201cWe know these pelagic fish stocks are sensitive to temperature changes.\u201cWe have already seen that climate affects their distribution, their ability to spawn and mortality rates.\u201cRapid warming of the seas could accelerate these changes. They could also have a significant impact on the ability of herring and blue whiting to reproduce based on recent analyses.\u201dProfessor Geraint Tarling, an ocean biologist at the British Antarctic Survey, said many species are moving north towards the Arctic and replacing native species there in a process known as Atlantification.Dr Craig Donlon, head of Earth surfaces and interior section at the European Space Agency, described this year\u2019s North Atlantic temperature rise as a \u201cscary situation\u201d but added that the ecosystem will adapt, with species migrating north replaced by others coming from the south.He said: \u201cWe can expect to see changes of biology structure, the ecosystem will adapt.\u201cSome species will migrate further north into the water that they feel more comfortable in, in terms of temperature, and of course, other species will migrate north into our waters from the south, bringing a bit more diversity.\u201dThe UK Government announced last week its plans to begin a large-scale monitoring programme of pelagic trawlers above 24m (79ft), fitting them with cameras and GPS to record the size and species of their catches in English waters in an effort to manage stocks more sustainably.RecommendedPM told to \u2018rethink\u2019 green targets as ministers vow to shield public from costsSunak urged to drop \u2018unpopular\u2019 and \u2018expensive\u2019 green pledges ahead of electionSunak and Starmer urged to uphold green pledges as Gove calls for slowdownErin Priddle, the MSC\u2019s regional director for Europe, said: \u201cPolicy-makers must find a way to incorporate stock shift changes, such as changing distributions of the North East Atlantic pelagics, into long-term and robust fisheries management plans.\u201cWithout joined-up and effective planning, our fisheries resources could be put at risk of overexploitation, overfishing, and even stock collapse.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64bef82651ac33362ba19b7c", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/rhodes-wildfires-british-tourists-flee-b2380448.html", "primaryCategory": "Europe", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018It was hell on earth\u2019: British tourists describe fleeing for their lives from Rhodes wildfire", "lead": "<p>Tourists are forced to shelter in schools, stadiums and alternative hotels as wildfires engulf swathes of popular holiday destination </p>", "author": "Matt Mathers", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 07:25:24", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:16:06.878061", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-24T07:25:24+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/23/15/SEI165097734.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

We need to know what changes using biostimulants could have on them, whether it\u2019s their quality, resistance to disease, how they respond to high heat or whether their flavour changes.\u201cReaching net zero means making our food production more sustainable. Biostimulants can hopefully do just that, but we need to be sure whisky won\u2019t suffer as a result.\u201dThe BioCrop project will supply three barley varieties to Heriot-Watt, named Cassia, Valeria and RGT Planet.Researchers Dr Ross Alexander and Dr Calum Holmes are to carry out experiments in the university\u2019s world-renowned International Centre for Brewing and Distilling (ICBD).Dr Ross Alexander said: \u201cWe\u2019ll be testing the barley in our micro maltings, which gives us a very controlled way to test grains at all stages of whisky production.\u201cAlthough it\u2019s laboratory-based, it is possible to produce malt comparable to that produced in commercial maltings.\u201cWe\u2019ll examine the barley on the nanoscale throughout the process to ensure it meets industry standards.

When Crawley hit his masterful 189 in the home side\u2019s only innings, Australia were floundering in the field, with dropped catches and overthrows creeping into the game of a side that is typically composed and clinical.It seemed like the momentum had shifted slightly, and although Australia might have been able to rediscover the form that saw them crowned World Test Championship winners, it remains disappointing that England were not able to level the series and take it to a decider.\u201cIt felt we were getting on top of them for sure and if we\u2019d won this game it would have been very interesting to see how they... well, they\u2019ve got some very good players and would have bounced back but the momentum would have been with us, for sure,\u201d Crawley said.RecommendedJoe Root gives England faint hope as rain and Marnus Labuschagne frustrate hostsThe Ashes LIVE: England vs Australia result and fourth Test reactionDay four of fourth Ashes Test: Eyes on the skies as England chase victoryEngland were criticised at times during the first two Test matches, largely for their reckless nature with the bat \u2013 especially at Lord\u2019s when they slid from 188 for one to 325 all out in reply to Australia\u2019s 416.But at Headingley and Old Trafford, it was a more composed performance. It was still Bazball, and at times England scored at seven an over, but they also absorbed pressure and did not try to hit the boundary from the first ball, and that was the difference.Crawley believes they will not change their approach for the Oval, with England needing a victory to level the series and deny Australia a first Ashes victory overseas since 2001.\u201cWe\u2019ll play the same way and to know we can make a big score.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeTrevor Francis was a footballer best known not for scoring in a European Cup final, earning 52 England appearances or later managing in major finals \u2013 all notable achievements \u2013 but for one of the game\u2019s historical landmarks, as British football\u2019s first million-pound player.In these days of \u00a3100m-plus fees, few bat an eyelid at modest seven-figure moves but in 1979, when Brian Clough\u2019s Nottingham Forest smashed the British transfer record to sign Francis from Birmingham City, the sum caused quite a stir.Naturally, Francis, who has died aged 69, felt he deserved to be remembered for much more, after a 34-year career in football that began in his prodigious teenage years and took him around the world, but he was nevertheless pleased to have his own unique place in the game\u2019s history.\u201cI played professional football for 23 years until I was 39,\u201d said Francis in an interview with The Guardian in 2019.\u201cI won European Cups with Nottingham Forest, I played 52 times over nine years for England, but whenever I go to a sporting occasion I\u2019m always introduced as the first \u00a31m footballer, as if that\u2019s the only thing I achieved in my career.RecommendedToday at the World Cup: Ary Borges hat-trick has Brazil up and runningWorld Cup 2023 live: Brazil vs PanamaKylian Mbappe\u2019s Al Hilal transfer could spark chain reaction affecting every top club\u201cBut do I feel proud of being the first \u00a31m player? Absolutely.\u201dTrevor John Francis was born at 41 Morley Place in Plymouth on 19 April 1954. He was the son of Roy Francis, a shift foreman with the South West Gas Board, and his wife Phyllis. Francis was the eldest of three children, having a younger brother Ian and sister Carolyn.His love of football was fostered at a young age by his father, who had played at semi-professional level. By the age of seven Francis was representing his school, Pennycross Primary, alongside boys at least two years older.He went on to Plymouth Public Secondary School for boys and was selected for the town\u2019s schools side at under-11, under-13, under-14 and under-15 levels. In all, he scored more than 800 goals in the Devon schools system and was soon attracting interest from Plymouth Argyle, Bristol City and Birmingham. The latter offered him an apprenticeship and he joined them at the age of 15.His dedication and determination made him stand out. This was underlined by his desire to improve his speed. Francis was known throughout his career for his pace but as a junior, it had been one area where he was criticised.He wrote: \u201cAt that stage of my development I took the advice and I would come back to St Andrew\u2019s in the afternoon wearing my spikes and I just ran sprints over and over again. It was worth it.\u201dIt certainly was. Francis scored at a prolific rate in the youth team and almost bypassed the reserves as he was fast-tracked into the first team. He became Birmingham\u2019s youngest senior player as he made his debut at the age of 16 years, 139 days as a substitute against Cardiff.He made an instant impact with 15 goals in his first 15 games, including all four in a victory over Bolton \u2013 a match he did not finish because of injury.He was tagged \u201cSuper Boy\u201d and comparisons with Jimmy Greaves and Denis Law were rife. Such was his impact the BBC\u2019s Sports Report once began a segment with the announcement, \u201cAnd Trevor Francis did not score today!\u201d\n\nDo I feel proud of being the first \u00a31m player? AbsolutelyTrevor FrancisBirmingham, then in the Second Division, saw their crowds swell to nearly 50,000. The club even reported a gate of 10,000 after Francis appeared in a youth game. All the while Francis remained an apprentice and still had to sweep terraces, mop floors and clean senior players\u2019 boots.Birmingham were promoted in 1972 and survived in the top flight for seven years. In all, Francis scored 133 goals for the club in 328 appearances before that groundbreaking move to Forest. By then he was almost 25 and yearning to join a club that could challenge for silverware.\u201cI want to be part of a successful team and unless I see signs that we are going somewhere I won\u2019t stay,\u201d he said after submitting one of six transfer requests that were swiftly rejected by the club.In the end, manager Jim Smith promised to let him go if fortunes did not improve and the club eventually accepted an offer from Forest in February 1979. Coventry pledged to match the deal with their chairman, Jimmy Hill, able to offer extra game time \u2013 with good financial incentives \u2013 with his American club, Detroit Express. Francis had previously spent a successful summer on loan with the Express but, ultimately, joining First Division champions Forest was more appealing.\u201cAt the time they were the only team in England that could challenge Liverpool,\u201d Francis said.Forest\u2019s charismatic manager Clough, who famously strolled into a press conference to unveil Francis carrying a squash racquet, immediately downplayed the fee.The previous record British move had been David Mills\u2019s \u00a3516,000 switch from Middlesbrough to West Brom just weeks earlier and Clough feared the pressures the \u00a31m price tag could bring. Clough claimed Forest had actually paid \u00a3999,999 for the player and said so persuasively, even if fees and taxes meant the final fee was around \u00a31.15m.\u201cBrian was very clever with the media,\u201d Francis said. \u201cHe used to make headlines, and wasn\u2019t bothered whether they were true or not.\u201dFrancis soon made further headlines himself, scoring the only goal as Forest beat Malmo in the 1979 European Cup final in Munich. The striker raced in at the back post to head a John Robertson cross from the left into the roof of the net.\u201cI used to write a column for the Roy of the Rovers comic and this was my own Roy of the Rovers moment,\u201d said Francis, whose fame saw his name \u2013 and apparent tendency to be photographed in tracksuits \u2013 written into the closing theme tune for popular sitcom Only Fools and Horses.Francis was on target again in the quarter-final against Dynamo Berlin and semi-final against Ajax as Forest retained the trophy the following year, although injury prevented him from playing in the final against Hamburg.Injuries actually repeatedly disrupted his Forest career and, with Clough often playing him as a winger, he arguably never fulfilled his potential at the club. He scored 28 goals in 70 league appearances before moving to Manchester City for \u00a31.2m in September 1981.That proved a short-lived move as injuries again bit and cash problems forced City to sell on the following summer, but he revived his career in an impressive four-year spell with Sampdoria, with whom he won the Coppa Italia in 1985. He then had a spell with Atalanta, won the Scottish Cup with Rangers in 1988 and finished his playing career with QPR and Sheffield Wednesday.On the international front, Francis won his first cap against Holland in 1977 and went on to score 12 goals for his country. He scored in group games against Czechoslovakia and Kuwait at the 1982 World Cup but was not selected for the 1986 tournament and did not play for England again.It was at QPR he took his first steps into management, operating as player-boss from 1988-89. It was not a successful spell and he sparked controversy when he fined Martin Allen for missing a game to attend the birth of a child.He fared better at Wednesday after taking over, again as player-manager, following Ron Atkinson\u2019s departure in 1991. The Owls finished third in the First Division in 1992 and reached the League Cup and FA Cup finals of 1993, losing both to Arsenal.He was sacked after a 13th-placed finish in 1995 but returned to management with Birmingham. He took them to the brink of promotion to the top flight as they reached the play-offs three times in succession from 1999-2001 but they missed out each time. They also appeared in the 2001 League Cup final but were beaten by Liverpool on penalties.Despite those relative successes, he left the club later that year after a poor run of form and a number of disagreements with owners David Gold and David Sullivan and, on one particular occasion, with their chief executive Karren Brady.\u201cWhen I sold her husband [Paul Peschisolido] to West Brom, let\u2019s just say she wasn\u2019t very happy,\u201d he said. \u201cHer language was somewhat colourful.\u201dHe returned to the game soon after with Crystal Palace but did not seek work in management again after being sacked at Selhurst Park in 2003.RecommendedToday at the World Cup: Ary Borges hat-trick has Brazil up and runningWorld Cup 2023 live: Brazil vs PanamaKylian Mbappe\u2019s Al Hilal transfer could spark chain reaction affecting every top clubHe went on to forge a media career as a football pundit and co-commentator.

Because he\u2019s as fit as ever. He just seems to keep playing and keep getting better.\u201cHis record over the last 12, 18 months is as good as anyone\u2019s, I would imagine.\u201dWhile Anderson\u2019s international future is once again a topic for debate, fellow seamers Mahmood and Reece Topley are on the comeback trail with eyes on this autumn\u2019s ICC Cricket World Cup in India.Topley, whose career has been littered with injuries, expects to make his return from a dislocated shoulder next week when Northern Superchargers take on Birmingham Phoenix at Headingley in their opening fixture of this season\u2019s Hundred.The 29-year-old left-armer believes fast bowlers across the sport will be seeking the advice of Anderson when he eventually does retire.\u201cHe\u2019s almost like a unicorn in the sense that it\u2019s unheard of,\u201d Topley said of the longevity of Anderson, who has taken a remarkable 689 wickets in 182 Test appearances \u2013 both England records.\u201cThere\u2019s no magic pill or anything like that, it\u2019s just hard work.\u201cHe\u2019s a master of his craft, he\u2019s worked at his craft and that mindset has surely translated into looking after his body as well.\u201cI\u2019m sure every fast bowler is going to have him on speed dial, if he does hang them up, to tap into some of his secrets.RecommendedWe\u2019re massively up for it \u2013 Zak Crawley says England hungry to end on Oval highPSG give Kylian Mbappe permission to talk to Saudi Arabian club Al HilalEx-footballers lead tributes to \u2018wonderful gentleman\u2019 Trevor Francis\u201cI know he\u2019s had a relatively quiet series but he\u2019s obviously got the class and it wasn\u2019t that long ago that we were all singing his praises so I\u2019m sure he\u2019s not far off a hatful of wickets, no matter if it is his last Test.\u201d:: KP Snacks are funding 100 new community cricket pitches over the next three years.

They beat underdogs Morocco 6-0 in their opening game, with Popp (2), Schuller and Klara Buhl finding the net along with two own goals, although the Atlas Lionesses made history as the first Arab team to play at a Women\u2019s World Cup.Monday also saw Brazil and their 37-year-old superstar Marta kick things off with a comfortable 4-0 victory Panama as Ary Borges scored a hat-trick, while Italy beat Argentina 1-0 in the first game of the day with veteran striker Cristiana Girelli coming off the bench to grab the winner.Elsewhere, France suffered a blow early in their campaign as they were held to a 0-0 draw by a battling Jamaica, who earned a first-ever Women\u2019s World Cup point. That came a day after England began with a win but the Lionesses were pushed all the way by Haiti in what was a close contest in Brisbane. Georgia Stanway\u2019s retaken penalty in the first half was enough to earn England a narrow victory, but goalkeeper Mary Earps had to make a big stop to protect their lead late on.Follow the latest World Cup scores, updates and news in today\u2019s live blogRecommendedWomen\u2019s World Cup TV schedule: How to watch every match todayWomen\u2019s football world rankings: Who could take No 1 at the World Cup?When do England women play next?

The shakiness of England\u2019s defence had thankfully been compensated for by Haiti\u2019s lack of a cutting edge but her irritation was still clear, and warranted.Time and time again the simple things just hadn\u2019t been done right. Balls had been allowed to sail over heads, lunges were delayed as passes skimmed through gaps, passes were sent wayward. It wasn\u2019t the start to the World Cup that England would have hoped for.England were ahead but that wasn\u2019t the sense you would get from reading the players\u2019 body language.

It was hardly the most encouraging sign for the Lionesses as they began their Women\u2019s World Cup with a nervy, narrow victory over Haiti, but with questions remaining over several key positions there is certainly no doubt over the quality and value of England\u2019s No 1.Georgia Stanway may have scored the only goal in this unconvincing opening win, but Mary Earps was England\u2019s match-winner. The Manchester United goalkeeper\u2019s left foot denied Haiti\u2019s Roseline Eloissaint, in what was one of several dangerous moments the Lionesses had to survive to get their World Cup off to a winning start.It\u2019s what makes a top goalkeeper - the ability to suddenly spring into life when called upon. England had 11 shots on target to Haiti\u2019s two, but those statistics are misleading and the side ranked 53rd in the world carried just as much threat as the European champions throughout the match. An equaliser would have been deserved, had Earps not intervened.Mary Earps is an England superstar \u2013 even if fans can\u2019t buy her shirtThe goalkeeper was England\u2019s match-winner as the Lionesses opened their World Cup campaign with a narrow win against Haiti Mike Jones24 July 2023 20:301690226132England goalkeeper Mary Earps hits out at Nike for refusing to sell her shirtEngland goalkeeper Mary Earps says Nike\u2019s decision to not sell her kit during the Women\u2019s World Cup is \u201churtful\u201d and \u201chugely disappointing\u201d.England\u2019s home and away kits are available for fans to buy, but the Lionesses goalkeeper kits have not been put up for sale by the team\u2019s kit supplier.Earps was England\u2019s goalkeeper when they won the Euros last summer and the Manchester United star was named Fifa\u2019s Best Women\u2019s Goalkeeper for 2022.Earps said England captain Millie Bright had told her she wanted to buy her kit for her niece, only to find it wasn\u2019t available for purchase.England goalkeeper Mary Earps hits out at Nike for refusing to sell her shirtEngland star Earps says it is \u2018very disappointing\u2019 that fans can\u2019t buy her goalkeeper jersey Mike Jones24 July 2023 20:151690225232Women\u2019s World Cup groups: A comprehensive guide to each squadThe Women\u2019s World Cup is finally here as the biggest tournament ever kicks off in Australia and New Zealand.The first 32-team Women\u2019s World Cup is set to be one of the most open yet, with a host of teams challenging to dethrone the two-time defending champions United States.England head \u2018Down Under\u2019 full of belief after their Euros success on home soil last summer, but that is also set to inspire co-hosts Australia and their star forward Sam Kerr.Here\u2019s everything you need to know ahead of the 2023 Women\u2019s World Cup, including group guides, players to watch, and how to follow on TV.Women\u2019s World Cup groups: A comprehensive guide to each squadThe full guide to the biggest ever Women\u2019s World Cup as the tournament kicks off in Australia and New Zealand Mike Jones24 July 2023 20:001690224332Every Women\u2019s World Cup kit ranked and ratedThe battle for the Women\u2019s World Cup is underway, but the contest for the best kit at the tournament has never been stronger.The biggest ever Women\u2019s World Cup means there are more new shirts to dive into than ever before, while Nike and Adidas have taken their creative experimentation process to another level in Australia and New Zealand.Like in 2019, the Women\u2019s World Cup features a host of unique designs - with Adidas unveiling a selection of nature-themed kits and Nike taking inspiration from various artistic movements.

Mike Jones24 July 2023 19:301690222532England\u2019s World Cup hinges on a defining questionSince arriving in Australia, Sarina Wiegman has stepped up work on a new system, that may not even be unveiled until the knock-out stages. It is an inherent acknowledgement that England are no longer in the strong position they were, but simultaneously something that may yet prove the winning of this World Cup.This has been reflected in the mood of the camp in Australia, beyond the distraction over bonuses. There is certainly no lack of faith, especially in Wiegman\u2019s ability to come up with something special. This is another benefit of a feat like the Euro 2022 victory. It banishes doubts, and fosters that immensely powerful feeling that everything will go well because the manager knows exactly what they are doing. It is why big games, as in that juncture quarter-final win over Spain, can almost seem like they will go exactly as Wiegman predicts.There\u2019s also the fact that, right now, the manager has one of the most talented teams in the world. For so long, this has seemed like the moment England were long building up to.The question now is whether that moment just comes at the wrong time.England\u2019s World Cup hinges on a defining question Off the pitch turmoil and a growing injury list hinder Sarina Wiegman\u2019s hopes of turning her European champions into World Cup winners Mike Jones24 July 2023 19:151690221632Why this Women\u2019s World Cup will be unlike anything we\u2019ve seen beforeAs the squads have been adjusting to Australia and New Zealand over the last few weeks, many coaches and staff members have been doing what the rest of the public does, bouncing around news stories about the different teams to see how they are doing. It is the point at which an international tournament takes on that enticingly self-contained quality. All eyes still go to the USA, especially with this being Megan Rapinoe\u2019s last World Cup, and the squad looking to see her off with a historic third successive victory.As the defending champions themselves look around the field, though, they aren\u2019t seeing what they used to. There is the usual confidence, of course, but also some caution. The gap between them and the rest of the teams isn\u2019t as big. Rapinoe\u2019s retirement may well close out a wider era, since the dominant factor in women\u2019s football over the last decade has been how the USA have enjoyed much longer-term development than the rest of the game. That has been seen as especially influential as regards physical conditioning, but the general feeling is that the European game and Australia have caught up.England would certainly have no fears there, especially given how they beat the USA in that signpost match back in October.Why this Women\u2019s World Cup will be unlike anything we\u2019ve\u00a0seen\u00a0beforeThe staging of the first 32-team Women\u2019s World Cup in Australia and New Zealand presents fresh challenges, but a supreme cast of talent and a wide-open tournament can take the game to new heights, writes Miguel Delaney Mike Jones24 July 2023 19:001690220732When can I watch England?England play their first match of the World Cup against Haiti in Group D on 22 July.

When Crawley hit his masterful 189 in the home side\u2019s only innings, Australia were floundering in the field, with dropped catches and overthrows creeping into the game of a side that is typically composed and clinical.It seemed like the momentum had shifted slightly, and although Australia might have been able to rediscover the form that saw them crowned World Test Championship winners, it remains disappointing that England were not able to level the series and take it to a decider.\u201cIt felt we were getting on top of them for sure and if we\u2019d won this game it would have been very interesting to see how they... well, they\u2019ve got some very good players and would have bounced back but the momentum would have been with us, for sure,\u201d Crawley said.RecommendedJoe Root gives England faint hope as rain and Marnus Labuschagne frustrate hostsThe Ashes LIVE: England vs Australia result and fourth Test reactionDay four of fourth Ashes Test: Eyes on the skies as England chase victoryEngland were criticised at times during the first two Test matches, largely for their reckless nature with the bat \u2013 especially at Lord\u2019s when they slid from 188 for one to 325 all out in reply to Australia\u2019s 416.But at Headingley and Old Trafford, it was a more composed performance. It was still Bazball, and at times England scored at seven an over, but they also absorbed pressure and did not try to hit the boundary from the first ball, and that was the difference.Crawley believes they will not change their approach for the Oval, with England needing a victory to level the series and deny Australia a first Ashes victory overseas since 2001.\u201cWe\u2019ll play the same way and to know we can make a big score.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe boxing landscape is arguably as intriguing as it has ever been.The past few years have seen heavyweight epics for the ages between Tyson Fury and Deontay Wilder, they have seen Saul \u201cCanelo\u201d Alvarez establish himself as the face of the sport in the eyes of many fans, and they have seen frequent displays of technical brilliance from champions in lighter weight classes.There have been upsets, title unifications, and there has been no shortage of drama \u2013 Anthony Joshua\u2019s defeats by Andy Ruiz Jr and Oleksandr Usyk standing out as prime examples.All of these fights and results have factored into The Independent\u2019s own top 10, pound-for-pound rankings for men\u2019s boxers, to be updated monthly. While there is no exact science to putting together lists such as this, a number of factors have been considered in making the rankings, including each fighter\u2019s overall record, recent record, level of activity and calibre of opposition.RecommendedTyson Fury seeks UFC star\u2019s help ahead of Francis Ngannou fightMuhammad Ali\u2019s \u2018comedy\u2019 fight shows Fury vs Ngannou isn\u2019t the joke you think it isLooking back with pride and forward with anticipation \u2013 Friday\u2019s sporting socialThe Independent\u2019s pound-for-pound rankings10. Juan Francisco Estrada (44-3, 28 KOs)Juan Francisco Estrada celebrates a 2017 win against Carlos Cuadras (Getty Images)The diminutive Mexican is a two-weight world champion, having obtained the WBA super-flyweight title with his split-decision victory over Roman Gonzalez in March 2021. That win saw Estrada, 33, avenge a 2012 defeat by \u201cChocolatito\u201d, but its narrow nature meant the old rivals were set to rematch last March, until Estrada had to withdraw due to Covid symptoms. Estrada has since outpointed Argi Cortes and triumphed in his delayed trilogy bout with \u201cChocolatito\u201d in December, winning a close fight by majority decision. His creative use of angles is one of his standout attributes, making him a fun watch each time out.9. Vasiliy Lomachenko (17-3, 11 KOs)Vasiliy Lomachenko (left) during his fight with Devin Haney in May  (AP)The Ukrainian southpaw (one of two on this list...) saw off Jorge Linares in 2018 to become a three-weight title holder, before adding further belts with notable wins against the likes of Luke Campbell and Jose Pedraza. \u201cLoma\u201d was somewhat surprisingly beaten by Teofimo Lopez in 2020, but the 35-year-old bounced back with three straight wins to maintain his status as one of the best boxers in the world. The two-time Olympic champion is in the twilight of his career now, which only made his terrific showing against the next fighter on this list even more impressive. Lomachenko came up narrowly short, but many observers felt that he had won.8. Devin Haney (30-0, 15 knockouts)Devin Haney (right) was a unanimous-decision winner against George Kambosos Jr in two fights in 2022  (Getty Images)The unbeaten American entered our list following his second straight clinic against George Kambosos Jr. Haney eased to a unanimous-decision win against the Australian on Kambosos\u2019 home turf in June 2022 to become undisputed champion at lightweight, before retaining that status in the pair\u2019s rematch in October \u2013 also in Melbourne. Prior to those clashes, Kambosos Jr was undefeated. At just 24 years old, the best is still ahead of Haney, though he must learn from his most recent bout, with Lomachenko in May.\u00a0It was a fight that Haney won, but not without controversy.7. Dmitry Bivol (21-0, 11 KOs)Dmitry Bivol outpointed Saul \u2018Canelo\u2019 Alvarez for a stunning win  (Copyright 2022 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.)Entered our list in May 2022, following his stunning victory over Saul \u201cCanelo\u201d Alvarez. The Russian remained unbeaten and retained the WBA light-heavyweight title with that result, which he achieved by fighting on the front foot, picking his shots wisely, and almost doubling the output of his opponent. Bivol, 32, won by two points on all three judges\u2019 scorecards, though the margins should have been much wider. A clinical showing that raised the Russian\u2019s profile immensely and likely sets up a rematch with Canelo down the line. Before that, though, Bivol was tasked with getting past the unbeaten Gilberto Ramirez in November. Bivol won on points with an aggressive and sharp performance, which saw him rise from ninth to seventh on our list. 6. Tyson Fury (33-0-1, 24 KOs)Tyson Fury after stopping Deontay Wilder again in a heavyweight epic in 2021  (Getty Images)Has eclipsed Anthony Joshua as the household name in British boxing. Fury, 34, returned to the sport in 2018 after three years off due to a long struggle with his mental health. Since then, he has established himself as one of the greatest heavyweights of all time, dethroning Deontay Wilder to become WBC champion in the pair\u2019s 2020 rematch, having controversially drawn with the American in their first clash, in 2018. In October 2021, Fury stopped Wilder for the second fight in a row to retain the belt, which he did again in April by knocking out Dillian Whyte with ease and once more in December with a late stoppage of Derek Chisora. A creative fighter who has demonstrated remarkable resilience and heart in the ring, Fury previously held the WBA, WBO, IBF and IBO titles and was looking to regain them in a fight with Oleksandr Usyk this spring. However, the fight \u2013 which would have crowned an undisputed heavyweight champion \u2013 fell through.5. Errol Spence Jr (28-0, 22 KOs)Errol Spence Jr leaving AT&T Stadium with another welterweight belt (Getty Images)The American has not been the most active fighter in recent years, but he has been slowly building a fine resume. Spence Jr holds impressive wins against the likes of Shawn Porter, Mikey Garcia, Danny Garcia and Carlos Ocampo. The southpaw stopped the latter, as well as notably finishing Kell Brook on the Briton\u2019s home turf earlier in his career, and a cancelled clash with Manny Pacquiao would surely have built up Spence even further had it come to fruition. Last time out, the 33-year-old beat Yordenis Ugas by brutalising the Cuban\u2019s eye, collecting another welterweight belt and rising up our rankings in the process. Spence will likely only continue to climb here, especially if he wins his long-awaited meeting with Terence Crawford...4. Terence Crawford (39-0, 30 KOs)Terence Crawford stopped Shawn Porter in November 2021 to stay unbeaten  (AP)The WBO welterweight champion has one of the most impressive resumes in the sport, and it just keeps getting better. Four of the American\u2019s last 10 opponents were undefeated before facing him, and all 10 were stopped by Crawford \u2013 who has a tremendous number of knockout and TKO victories to his name. Wins against big-name boxers Brook and Porter in 2020 and 2021 further enhanced the 35-year-old\u2019s profile, especially his victory over the latter, before Crawford stopped David Avanesyan in December 2022. Next up? Spence in late July.3. Saul \u2018Canelo\u2019 Alvarez (59-2-2, 39 KOs)Saul Alvarez following his stoppage win against Caleb Plant in 2021  (AP)In the 10 years since his loss to Floyd Mayweather, the Mexican has established himself as the face of boxing, with wins against Erislandy Lara, Miguel Cotto, Amir Khan, Gennadiy Golovkin, Daniel Jacobs, Billy Joe Saunders and many more of note. The effectiveness of the 32-year-old\u2019s counter-punching, slickness of his head movement and beauty of his body work make him a joy to watch.Detractors will point to Alvarez\u2019s clenbuterol controversy in 2018 and the fact that a few of his victories have come via controversial scorecards. Supporters will give more credence to Canelo\u2019s admirable level of activity and the great number of formidable foes he has fought and beaten. His three victories in 2021 \u2013 all stoppages \u2013 saw him ultimately become boxing\u2019s first ever undisputed super-middleweight champion. A title holder in four weight classes, the Mexican failed to add a second light-heavyweight title to his collection when he was outpointed by unbeaten Russian Bivol in May 2022.That result, which surprised a number of fans, marked just the second defeat of Canelo\u2019s professional career and saw him drop from No 1 in our list to No 4. He rebounded with a decisive points win against ageing rival Golovkin, though that result proved little at this point and only saw him climb one spot here. The ambitious Mexican then defended his super-middleweight belts against John Ryder in Guadalajara, dropping the Briton en route to a decision win that sees him stay put at No 3.2. Oleksandr Usyk (20-0, 13 KOs)Oleksandr Usyk (left) has outpointed Anthony Joshua twice in a row  (Getty Images)Was the only ever undisputed cruiserweight champion of the four-belt era before moving up to heavyweight, where he became WBA, WBO, IBF and IBO champion in 2021 by outpointing Anthony Joshua with relative ease. The Ukrainian, 36, is undefeated and most recently beat Joshua on points a second time to retain his heavyweight titles and climb two spots here. The southpaw, an Olympic gold medalist, is as technical and awkward as they come in the heavier weight classes, making a potential match-up with Fury an intriguing prospect \u2013 though that bout collapsed this spring. Next up for Usyk is mandatory challenger Daniel Dubois in mid-August.1. Naoya Inoue (24-0, 21 KOs)Naoya Inoue (left) stopped Paul Butler in Round 11 in December  (AP)One of the lesser-known names on this list to the more casual fan, the Japanese does not lack in prowess what he may lack in profile. Inoue has the best stoppage percentage of any fighter on this list, part of what makes him such an exciting fighter to watch \u2013 along with his effortless evasiveness, brutal body attacks, and frightening level of output. In June, \u201cMonster\u201d lived up to his nickname once again by eviscerating Nonito Donaire in a rematch, having narrowly outpointed the Filipino in their first fight.

Robert Whittaker (24-7, middleweight)Robert Whittaker holds one of the most impressive resumes in MMA (Zuffa LLC)The Australian has tasted defeat just three times in the last nine years. The first two of those three losses came against the phenomenal Israel Adesanya, with Whittaker losing the middleweight belt to his rival by TKO in 2019 before dropping a debatable decision to the \u201cLast Stylebender\u201d last February. Between those bouts, the \u201cReaper\u201d earned three straight wins against elite competition, and his earlier run to the belt saw him successfully navigate a murderers\u2019 row of opponents that is almost incomprehensible. He bounced back from his second loss to Adesanya with a masterful points win against Marvin Vettori, before suffering a shock TKO loss to Dricus Du Plessis in July.9. Dustin Poirier (29-7, 1 No Contest; lightweight)Former interim UFC lightweight champion Dustin Poirier  (Getty Images)The American has only two defeats in the last six years \u2013 coming against the greatest lightweight of all time in Khabib Nurmagomedov and one of the best active lightweights right now in Charles Oliveira. The \u201cDiamond\u201d holds eight wins against six different world champions of the sport, having beaten Conor McGregor twice in 2021 before most recently submitting Michael Chandler to improve that tally. He will fight Justin Gaethje, whom he stopped in 2018, in a rematch in July as the pair vie for the \u2018BMF\u2019 belt.8. Aljamain Sterling (23-3, bantamweight champion)Aljamain Sterling has recorded three title defences, all against ex-champions  (Getty Images)The Jamaican-American was mocked by some fans after winning the bantamweight title via disqualification in 2021, when Petr Yan landed an illegal knee while leading the bout. In a rematch 13 months later, Sterling silenced some doubters and irked others by winning a narrow decision. He then dominated former champion TJ Dillashaw en route to a TKO in October, as the challenger battled a dislocated shoulder, and went on to beat another ex-champion in Henry Cejudo this May, defeating the American \u2013 who had not fought in three years \u2013 via split decision. Some observers attach asterisks to each of Sterling\u2019s title defences, but all have come against former world champions, and \u201cFunk Master\u201d has now won nine fights in a row.7. Charles Oliveira (34-9, 1 NC; lightweight)Charles Oliveira has the most finishes and submissions in UFC history  (Getty Images)The Brazilian\u2019s 2010 debut in the UFC gave way to an inconsistent record with numerous failed weight-cuts along the way, but the former featherweight then turned his career around. An 11-fight win streak over five years saw Oliveira claim and retain the lightweight title vacated by the retired Khabib, then submit Justin Gaethje in May 2022 \u2013 one day after being stripped of the belt for a narrow weight-miss. That win positioned him as No 1 contender as he looked to regain the gold. However, he was submitted by Islam Makhachev in October as the Russian won the vacant title. Oliveira bounced back in June 2023, though, with a TKO win over Beneil Dariush in the first round. That result extended Oliveira\u2019s records for most finishes (19) and most submissions (16) in UFC history.6. Kamaru Usman (20-3, welterweight)Kamaru Usman was a dominant welterweight champion from 2019 until 2022  (AP)In 2021, Usman was arguably the best mixed martial artist in the world, let alone the UFC, and our pound-for-pound No 1. The Nigerian-American is perhaps the most clinical wrestler in the promotion and has added knockout power to his game in recent years, and he was unbeaten for nine years between 2013 and 2022 \u2013 with a dominant welterweight title reign for the last three years of that run. After five successful defences \u2013 two against Colby Covington, two against Jorge Masvidal, and one against Gilbert Burns \u2013 Usman dropped the belt to Leon Edwards last August, dominating his old opponent for much of the fight but falling to an incredible, late head kick. Edwards then outpointed Usman in London this March to retain the gold.5. Israel Adesanya (24-2, middleweight champion) (Getty Images)One of the most exciting fighters to watch in the history of the sport. The former kickboxer routinely produces striking masterclasses against his opponents, simply proving too slick and too clever for his competition. Adesanya has faced a who\u2019s-who of 185lbers, knocking out a number of them and losing to just one. The \u201cLast Stylebender\u201d suffered his first defeat in pro MMA in 2021, but there was even merit in that as the Nigerian-born New Zealander moved up a weight class to challenge then-champion Jan Blachowicz for the light-heavyweight title.He then began to \u201clap the opposition\u201d with back-to-back rematch wins against Vettori and Whittaker prior to his decision victory over Jared Cannonier at UFC 276. Adesanya then suffered just his second MMA defeat \u2013\u00a0and first at middleweight \u2013 in losing the title to old foe Alex Pereira in November. Pereira, who twice beat Adesanya in kickboxing bouts across 2016 and 2017, stopped the Kiwi in the final round to dethrone \u201cStylebender\u201d at the end of a thrilling encounter. But Adesanya finally exorcised his demon by knocking out Pereira in the second round in April, regaining the title and reasserting himself as the best middleweight in the UFC.4. Leon Edwards (21-3, 1 NC; welterweight champion)Leon Edwards made a successful first defence of the welterweight title in March  (Action Images via Reuters)Edwards became Britain\u2019s second ever UFC champion with a stunning, last-gasp knockout of Usman in August. After taking down the Nigerian-American \u2013\u00a0something no fighter had ever done in the UFC \u2013 in Round 1, Edwards continually rose to his feet amid an onslaught of grappling pressure from the champion over the next few frames, keeping himself in the fight. Then, with a minute left on the clock, Edwards knocked Usman out cold with a perfect head kick to take his gold, beating the man who outpointed him seven years earlier. Then, this March, Edwards outpointed Usman in London to solidify his status as champion. Edwards\u2019 first win over Usman saw him enter our list, while the second propelled him up the rankings. Since his 2015 loss to the \u201cNigerian Nightmare\u201d, Edwards is unbeaten with 11 straight wins (save for a No Contest against Belal Muhammad in 2021).3. Islam Makhachev (24-1, lightweight champion)Islam Makhachev won the UFC lightweight title by submitting Charles Oliveira in November  (AFP via Getty Images)Some used to question the Russian\u2019s credentials, given a lack of top-tier opponents on his record, though that was arguably due to highly-ranked fighters\u2019 tentativeness to risk their spots against a dangerous up-and-comer. Others accused Makhachev of benefiting from his connection to Khabib \u2013 his childhood friend and now one of Makhachev\u2019s coaches. Regardless, the 31-year-old banished any doubt in October when he submitted Oliveira \u2013 the fighter with the most submission wins in UFC history \u2013 to win the vacant lightweight title, suggesting that he would have done the same to most contenders at 155lbs.Makhachev then made it 12 wins in a row by outpointing Alexander Volkanovski in February, matching the Australian\u2019s record streak for an active fighter while retaining his title against the featherweight champion in a very close contest. In advance of that fight, many suggested that a Makhachev win would make him the new pound-for-pound No 1, but Indy Sport was more impressed by Volkanovski\u2019s showing in a higher weight class and would like to see Makhachev add some more notable names to his resume. As such, the Russian was our No 2, until...2. Jon Jones (27-1, 1 NC; heavyweight champion)Jon Jones returned to the UFC in March to collect a title in a second division  (Getty Images)When Jon Jones returned to the UFC in March after a three-year absence, winning the heavyweight title by submitting Ciryl Gane in the first round, many believed that the American confirmed himself as the greatest of all time. A lot of fans also felt that he should go straight to the top of any and all pound-for-pound lists. And Jones\u2019 victory certainly was impressive, particularly due to the manner in which it was achieved and the factors around the 35-year-old\u2019s heavyweight debut. It was also enough for the former two-time light-heavyweight champion to shoot straight into our rankings at No 2, with his long-term resume standing out more than Makhachev\u2019s (Jones has beaten numerous world champions), but his lack of activity keeping him below our No 1 \u2013 for the time being, at least.1. Alexander Volkanovski (26-2, featherweight champion)Alexander Volkanovski has defended and retained the featherweight title five times  (Getty Images)After suffering the sole defeat of his professional career in 2013, Volkanovski won a stunning 22 fights in a row. In fact, his only pro losses have come against a welterweight champion and a lightweight champion. All of the Australian\u2019s recent fights have pitted him against top names. In 2022, Volkanovski put on a clinic against fan favourite Chan Sung Jung before producing a masterclass to outpoint Max Holloway for the third time, leaving no doubt about his superiority over the man he dethroned in 2019. In doing so, the 34-year-old enhanced his own claim to be labelled the 145lbs GOAT. He even holds a win against the other standout contender for that status \u2013\u00a0Jose Aldo \u2013 as well as victories over Chad Mendes, Brian Ortega, and Yair Rodriguez.RecommendedUFC 291 fight card in full as Dustin Poirier faces Justin GaethjeWhat time does UFC 291 start this weekend?How to watch UFC 291 online and on TV this weekendVolkanovski is as dynamic, composed and well rounded as they come.

That is due to the stunning performance produced by the Aussie in that fight, with Volkanovski dropping Makhachev twice, neutralising the Russian in many of the grappling exchanges, and arguably winning the bout despite a significant size disadvantage.

Then, in March, light-heavyweight \u2018GOAT\u2019 Jon Jones moved up to heavyweight after three years away, submitting Ciryl Gane in the first round to win the title vacated by Francis Ngannou in January, when the latter left the UFC.Later in March, Britain\u2019s Leon Edwards retained the welterweight belt with a decision win over Kamaru Usman in London, seven months after taking the title from the \u201cNigerian Nightmare\u201d with a stunning head kick. April then kicked off with Israel Adesanya finally beating long-time rival Alex Pereira, the 33-year-old knocking out the Brazilian to regain the middleweight belt that he lost to Pereira in November.There are plenty more title fights to come, too.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeAs eye-watering as the Al Hilal offer to Paris Saint-Germain for Kylian Mbappe may be, it is itself not a blind bid. The Saudi Pro League club have for weeks been sounding out what it would actually take to bring him over. The Al Hilal president Fahad bin Nafel has been talking about the star to anyone who will listen - including in negotiations for other targets.The Mbappe camp have let a few conditions be known, but they are still considering everything. The 24-year-old himself is said to still be almost single-minded about joining Real Madrid next summer and countenancing nothing else, but there may be a few complications before then.That is the case with the entire transfer market right now, and this is finally a situation that brings the two major factors driving - or, really, halting - it together.One is Saudi Arabian money, which has caused everyone to rethink their plans. The other is the striker market, which currently has a lot of interlinked interests.The feeling is that one big deal will release everything, but the two biggest are log-jammed. It only adds to the intrigue that they are log-jammed for totally opposite reasons. Tottenham Hotspur do not want to sell Harry Kane. PSG are now desperate to sell Mbappe.RecommendedWorld-record bid made for Kylian Mbappe as PSG exit loomsPSG attempting to hijack Bayern Munich\u2019s bid to sign Harry KaneReal Madrid\u2019s Kylian Mbappe plan revealed after PSG declare intent to sell forwardThe potential chain reaction, according to those working on many of the deals, goes like this. If PSG do sell Mbappe, they will go even bigger for Kane.\u201cWhatever they were going to offer the player before, they\u2019d double it,\u201d in the words of one involved figure. Such a bid would almost certainly meet the \u00a3100m valuation that Daniel Levy is understood to see as a minimum to even consider a sale, but would also force a response from Bayern Munich. The German club are extremely confident they can get the player and that he wants to come, although one source quipped that \u201cthey have no experience of dealing with Daniel\u201d. While PSG are among the few parties that believe the Qatari project can themselves get a deal for Kane done, the general feeling is he will not go there and has little interest, but that he would instead see Manchester United as a first priority.They are currently negotiating for Atalanta\u2019s Rasmus Hojlund and pressing on with that. If it did come to a situation where Spurs were willing to sell Kane and openly negotiating with rival clubs, however, United would have to consider acting. It is even believed that the Old Trafford hierarchy would be prepared to set aside separate funds for the England international, such is the value of the signing.Kylian Mbappe in PSG training this summer  (AP)The thinking within the market, meanwhile, is that nothing else happens until the Kane decision is made.After that, if PSG do not get him, they will press ahead for Randal Kolo Muani or Dusan Vlahovic. If Vlahovic goes, Juventus will finally make a concrete move for Romelu Lukaku, who himself has an offer from Al Hilal.Which brings us full circle. There may now be another layer with Mbappe. PSG have been sounding out most of Europe\u2019s major clubs, with the response so far mixed.Manchester United are currently not interested this summer, and do not expect that to change. Barcelona and Chelsea have at least explored the possibility. The latter might appeal to Mbappe, especially due to a good relationship with Mauricio Pochettino, but it is understood that his first preference in the Premier League would actually be Arsenal. That is down to reasons like the romance of Thierry Henry's history there, as well as the idea of making history himself and delivering a first title in 20 years.As one figure close to the player\u2019s camp said amid the flurry of activity on Friday, \u201cif ever there was a window for that, it\u2019s now\u201d. Mikel Arteta is another who doesn\u2019t have that kind of budget, though, as he now needs to make sales to bring in another midfielder and potentially a right-back.It is one of the ironies of Mbappe\u2019s situation, and another sign of the direction the game is headed.The 24-year-old is so good, and his horizons as a footballer so vast, that he actually has very limited options. There are only about three or four clubs that could afford him. Lionel Messi found the same in 2021 and this summer.Long gone are the days when an upwardly mobile side in Serie A or La Liga might offer an exciting possibility, as was the case with even Ronaldo before the turn of the millennium.Harry Kane\u2019s future remains unresolved going into the final year of his contract (EPA)As it is, most major clubs are reluctant to move for other reasons beyond the budget. They think Mbappe only wants the traditional kingpins of European football: Real Madrid.Both the Spanish club and the player are currently willing to hold their nerve. That has increased pressure on PSG but numerous sources insist there is even more to it than just seeing such an asset go for free next summer, and to a club they have an increasingly tense relationship with.There is constant talk of a \u201cloyalty bonus\u201d, with Mbappe set to earn \u00a335m if he is still at Parc des Princes on 31 July. This would of course bring further Financial Fair Play costs for PSG, and that for a player of immense value they will get no money for anyway.Spurs may similarly see their megastar walk away for nothing and have so far come at it from the opposite perspective, although there are murmurs that is changing. Monday brought reports that club owner Joe Lewis has told Levy to sell if Kane will not sign a new deal. The industry view has long been this by far makes the most sense, especially as the club will have to adjust for a future without the striker sooner rather than later. A new tactical approach under Ange Postecoglou even offers something different.Paris Saint-Germain\u2019s French forward Kylian Mbappe will not sign a new deal in Paris (AFP via Getty Images)For now, everyone is monitoring what everyone else does, without making a decisive move. That\u2019s the nature of the market.A further aspect is that there are almost as many political complications within the Saudi Pro League as there are with the two main summer sagas.While Al Hilal are giddy at the prospect of signing Mbappe, that excitement is not shared within the wider division and not just for reasons of competition. Most of that is due to this idea that the player could do a year in the Saudi Pro League before decamping to the Bernabeu.It is not as neat a compromise for everyone as is being claimed - before you even get to the idea of such a footballer playing in a developing division for a season.One argument put forward is that for all the immediate focus Mbappe would bring, it could actually be damaging to the reputation of the competition if he were to just leave so quickly. The point of the wider project is to build for the long term and gradually create a luxurious but sustainable home for those outside the Premier League. The state does not want it to be somewhere where players are just parked.Denmark striker Rasmus Hojlund is Man Utd\u2019s preferred striker target  (Getty Images)An immediate departure for Madrid could also create a precedent where the higher-profile players arriving this summer could demand clauses allowing them to leave if Champions League clubs come in.RecommendedPSG give Kylian Mbappe permission to talk to Saudi Arabian club Al HilalWorld-record bid made for Kylian Mbappe as PSG exit loomsWayne Rooney hopes Marcus Rashford builds Man Utd legacy after signing new dealMost of all, though, an immediate Mbappe departure would leave a vacuum. The league would suddenly feel that bit more hollow again, with a move to Madrid instead confirming football\u2019s supposed natural order.The offer still stands, though. For now, it\u2019s only adding to the stand-still in the wider market."}, {"_id": "64bef82c51ac33362ba19b92", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/boxing/maxi-hughes-george-kambosos-robbery-b2380406.html", "primaryCategory": "Boxing", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Another boxing robbery: Maxi Hughes deserves justice for heist that shames the sport", "lead": "<p>George Kambosos took Hughes\u2019 IBO lightweight title thanks to a disgraceful decision in Oklahoma that must be investigated </p>", "author": "Steve Bunce", "datePublished": "2023-07-23 11:23:35", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:16:12.592018", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-23T11:23:35+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/23/12/GettyImages-1427029577.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free sport newsletter for all the latest news on everything from cycling to boxingSign up to our free sport email for all the latest news\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeMaxi Hughes was robbed of victory in a boxing ring on Saturday night in the fight of his life.Hughes is one of the most decent and honest men in the British boxing business and he deserves some justice for the heist.The robbery took place in a boxing backwater in Oklahoma when Hughes fought George Kambosos in defence of his IBO lightweight title. However, the real prize was the right to be ranked as the IBF\u2019s No 1 contender. Hughes boxed a simple, smart, careful 12 rounds and Kambosos, once a renowned world champion and attraction, fought like a man who only had to show up. In the end, that is all he had to do.At the finish of 12 controlled rounds from Hughes, he placed a ceremonial cowboy hat on his head to take the verdict; there was a long, long delay and that is never good for justice in a boxing ring. Hughes had stopped smiling before the decision was announced.RecommendedSpence vs Crawford live stream: How to watch fight online and on TV this weekendGeorge Kambosos reacts to \u2018robbery\u2019 claims after controversial win over Maxi HughesMuhammad Ali\u2019s \u2018comedy\u2019 fight shows why Fury vs Ngannou isn\u2019t the joke you think it isOne judge went 114-114, one went with 115-113 for Kambosos and the third, a man called Josef Mason, delivered the fully outrageous score of 117-111 for Kambosos. The Mason score means that in his opinion from ringside, Hughes managed to win just three rounds. I watched the fight live and watched it again; the US commentary team was silenced by the verdict. And so was I \u2013 Hughes won as many as nine rounds in a display of old-fashioned boxing. It was a delight to watch. Maxi Hughes had defeated Kid Galahad to win his IBO lightweight titlet  (Getty Images)It was not a slugfest, nobody famous outside of boxing was in the ring, nobody ripped their top off to reveal their naked breasts and, presumably, there will be no justice for Hughes. Right now, boxing is an event sport, and this fight was not, if I\u2019m being brutally honest, an event. In the ring at the end, Kambosos, who is a nice enough man, tried his best to hide his feelings. He knew. However, in the often-ridiculous realm of boxing conspiracies, there is a huge fight for Kambosos against a boxer called Teofimo Lopez; Kambosos shocked Lopez in 2021 to win three versions of the world title. Last month Lopez shocked Josh Taylor in New York. It is a simple storyline to follow and not pleasant to even be considering that dark forces could be at play. It still feels like incompetence, not corruption. Hughes, meanwhile, has always worn his heart out on his sleeve.\u201cIt was a bit of a kick in the b*****ks,\u201d said Hughes. \u201cI feel pretty silly standing here in my cowboy hat. I won that fight. I won it clearly.\u201dHughes has never been a mainstream boxer, never been one of the boys and men that promoters protect and develop. Hughes is from the other side of the boxing tracks. Hughes had fought to boxing relevance the hard way  (Getty Images)It has been a long and hard boxing road for Hughes in fights that he was often expected to lose. He lost for the sixth time in 34 fights, but this was the hardest loss to accept. He is 33 now, enjoying the career it looked like he would never have. He entered with the IBO lightweight title, a belt that can be used as a ticket to much bigger things.RecommendedWhat time does Inoue vs Fulton start?How to watch Inoue vs Fulton online and on TVWhat time does Spence vs Crawford start this weekend?\u201cI made him miss, I picked him off, I controlled the fight,\u201d said Hughes. \u201cI took this fight, I asked for it, I pushed for it, and I only did that because I want to earn the dollars to provide for my family. That is why I box.\u201dAt the end, the Kambosos interview was drowned by boos and Hughes had to take a break from talking to accept the applause. It was a tiny victory for the Yorkshire man on a night when the latest blatant heist took place in a boxing ring. It will continue, but it would be fair if Hughes could get some recognition for his part in a bad, bad night for officials at ringside."}, {"_id": "64bef82c51ac33362ba19b93", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/boxing/inoue-fulton-start-time-ring-walks-b2380853.html", "primaryCategory": "Boxing", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Inoue vs Fulton time: When does fight start in UK and US?", "lead": "<p><em>Indy Sport</em>\u2019s pound-for-pound No 1 moves up a division to challenge for unified gold</p>", "author": "Alex Pattle", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 16:39:48", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:16:12.858954", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-24T16:39:48+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2022/12/13/11/newFile.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free sport newsletter for all the latest news on everything from cycling to boxingSign up to our free sport email for all the latest news\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeWith the transfer window well underway, Manchester United have made two moves with the signing of Mason Mount from Chelsea and Andre Onana from Inter, with more certain to follow.Erik ten Hag is somewhat restrained by the fact the club takeover is dragging on, but additions will be made with a No.9, a new central midfielder and potentially a defensive addition all reported to be on the wishlist in the next two months.To generate the necessary funds, player sales are required, but offers for players such as Scott McTominay, Anthony Martial and Harry Maguire have so far been limited.United finished in the top four and reached two cup finals last season, a big improvement on their competitiveness in previous campaigns - but more is still required to challenge at the very top.Here\u2019s the latest news and updates concerning any transfers to and from Old Trafford:RecommendedTottenham transfer news: Harry Kane, Giovani Lo Celso, Conor Gallagher, Tosin Adarabioyo and moreLiverpool transfer news: Romeo Lavia, Joshua Kimmich, Cheick Doucoure, Thiago and moreChelsea transfer news: Michael Olise, Marc Guehi, Moises Caicedo, Callum Hudson-Odoi and moreRasmus HojlundUnited remain seeking a new No.9 to fit Ten Hag\u2019s plan, though little movement has been achieved. Both Harry Kane and Victor Osimhen have long been linked with the club, but it appears the desire and ability to acquire either of these two quality strikers has rapidly diminished within the United camp. However, Rasmus Hojlund remains a consistent name in United\u2019s transfer rumours.According to Fabrizio Romano, Manchester United will submit their first official bid for the striker next week, with the 20-year-old Hojlund eager to join. However, the clubs seem to be far apart when it comes to agreeing on a transfer fee. Hojlund\u2019s club, Atalanta, reportedly valued the Danish striker at \u00a386m, with United keen not to spend over \u00a360m for the Dane.Sofyan Amrabat After his stellar performance at the World Cup in December last year, Sofyan Amrabat attracted interest from a host of top European clubs. This summer could now be the time that the Fiorentina midfielder makes his move with Manchester United one of the clubs keen to negotiate a deal for the Moroccan international.While a deal for Hojlund remains their priority, Fabrizio Romano reports that the Red Devils may look to make a move for Amrabat at some point in the window with the departure of Fred or Scott McTominay potentially funding the move which would cost around \u20ac30m.Dean HendersonDespite the departure of David de Gea, it would appear that Dean Henderson\u2019s time at the Manchester club may be coming to an end after the arrival of Andre Onana earlier in the window. The goalkeeper spent last season on loan at Nottingham Forest and according to Rudy Galetti, both clubs are in advanced negotiations which would see the 26-year-old return on a permanent basis. Forest are already closing in on another United player with a deal agreed for winger Antony Elanga but there is confidence that Henderson could soon follow with personal terms already agreed. Henderson played 18 games for Forest last year before a thigh injury in January saw him sidelined for the rest of the season. Eric Bailly The Ivorian centre-back has been at the club since 2016 but has seen his time ruined with injuries and a lack of form, starting just 20 games in his last three seasons. Bailly spent last year on loan at Marseille but, with one year left on his contract, looks set to leave the club.The 29-year-old was left out of United\u2019s pre-season tour to the United States with Sky Sports\u2019 Dharmesh Sheth reporting that Bailly could be the latest player to make the move to Saudi Arabia. There is reported interest from two clubs with a deal likely to last three years and worth in the region of \u00a320 million.RecommendedManchester United agree deal with Inter Milan for goalkeeper Andre OnanaFootball rumours: Nottingham Forest vying for Manchester United\u2019s Dean HendersonKylian Mbappe\u2019s Al Hilal transfer could spark chain reaction affecting every top clubJack and Tyler FletcherSons of former Manchester United midfielder, Darren Fletcher, Jack and Tyler Fletcher could be the latest additions to the famous Manchester United academy.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeAfter a disappointing 2022/23 Premier League campaign, which saw Tottenham finish eighth in the table, significant changes are taking place around the club.Having sacked manager Antonio Conte in late March, results only got worse after his departure. Former Celtic manager Ange Postecoglou has been entrusted with the task of revitalising Spurs and will be assessing a new squad to achieve this goal. Heading into the transfer window, the club appeared keen to address three major issues: an attacking midfielder, a centre-back and a goalkeeper.With the \u00a340m signing of James Maddison from recently relegated Leicester City, it seems they have resolved one one of those issues, while signing goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario from Empoli in Serie A, for a reported fee of \u00a317.2m, solves another. Dejan Kulusevski has been secured on a permanent deal after impressing during an 18-month loan deal while Manor Solomon has also joined on a free from Shakhtar Donetsk.Meanwhile, the club remains in the news for departures too - and once again superstar Harry Kane finds himself surrounded by transfer rumours. Here\u2019s all the latest regarding Spurs.RecommendedUntil Harry Kane stays or goes, Tottenham are stuck in neutralChelsea transfer news: Michael Olise, Marc Guehi, Moises Caicedo, Callum Hudson-Odoi and moreLiverpool transfer news: Romeo Lavia, Joshua Kimmich, Cheick Doucoure, Thiago and moreHarry KaneAfter months of speculation about Tottenham\u2019s all-time leading scorer, Harry Kane, potentially leaving the club, it would not be surprising if the superstar Englishman ultimately remained. The long-standing rumours of Kane possibly joining Manchester United were put to rest when club chairman Daniel Levy decided not to allow the transfer to a domestic rival. Subsequently, Real Madrid emerged as the next potential destination. However, the Spanish club swiftly realised that they could not afford the substantial price tag associated with Kane, particularly after already spending \u00a388m on Jude Bellingham.This has resulted in Bayern Munich emerging as the sole remaining suitor in the market, but the two clubs seem to have a significant gap in their valuation of the transfer fee. Bayern have already seen their first two offers rejected but, according to The Times, the German club are ready to submit a third, improved offer when Spurs return from their pre-season tour. Kane does not plan to sign a new deal, meaning Tottenham could face the prospect of their star striker leaving on a free at the end of next season if a deal is not agreed this window.Giovani Lo CelsoAnother player who may well be heading for the exit is Argentina midfielder, Giovani Lo Celso. The 27-year-old joined the north London club from PSG in 2019 but never found his place in the Spurs midfield with other signings and formation changes eventually stifling his minutes in the starting eleven.Having spent the last 18 months on loan at Villarreal, Lo Celso has featured heavily in Spurs\u2019 pre-season tour with Postecoglou seemingly keen to give the midfielder a second chance at the club. Despite this, there is still a large possibility that the Argentine leaves Tottenham this summer with Marca reporting that Real Betis, Aston Villa, Napoli and Barcelona would all be interested in a move.Conor GallagherWith Lo Celso\u2019s departure still a possibility and the future of Pierre-Emile H\u00f8jbjerg up in the air, Tottenham may look to bring in a replacement in central midfield. According to The Evening Standard, that man could be Conor Gallagher.The Chelsea midfielder has featured during the club\u2019s pre-season tour to America but reportedly is being offered out to clubs as the west London outfit continue their clearout after a hugely disappointing season last year. Gallagher has been at Chelsea since he was six but has just two years left on his current deal. While Spurs may be interested, they will also face competition from West Ham who are ready to make a move for the Englishman as they look to fill the void left by Declan Rice\u2019s record-breaking move to Arsenal.Tosin AdarabioyoAnother area of concern for Spurs heading into the new season is centre-back with Tosin Adarabioyo emerging as a potential target. A new contract agreement between Fulham and Adarabioyo has yet to materialise, and with only one year remaining on his current deal, it appears that he may leave Craven Cottage.Moves for Bundesliga duo, Edmond Tapsoba and Mickey van de Ven, remain possible but football.london is reporting that Spurs will also step up their interest in the Englishman with a bid expected in the near future.Ashley PhillipsRecommendedFootball rumours: Kalvin Phillips attracting interest from LiverpoolWorld Cup 2023 live: Brazil vs PanamaFormer England striker Trevor Francis, the first \u00a31m player, dies aged 69Another centre-back of interest to Spurs is Blackburn youngster, Ashley Phillips.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe deafening screams of \u201cCome on, Tommy lad\u201d permeated Sepp Straka\u2019s ears across five soggy hours at Royal Liverpool on Sunday. The Austrian (-7), a winner on the PGA Tour in back-to-back years, clinched a runner-up place at The Open Championship for his best major finish yet. But a larger prize appears to have also been secured. The burly Austrian now looks odds-on to make his Ryder Cup debut at Marco Simone in Rome, bolstering a European side that is suddenly riding a wave of momentum as the American behemoth mostly staggers below unlikely major winners Wyndham Clark and Brian Harman and metronomic world No 1 Scottie Scheffler.Straka\u2019s Sunday experience would prepare him for both a Ryder Cup at home, absorbing the support, even if it was directed at his playing partner Tommy Fleetwood, and away, forcing him to block out the noise and focus on his own game.\u201cYeah, I think it may have helped me a little bit,\u201d Straka said after reflecting on his round. \u201cJust kind of took the pressure off me. Everybody was worried about Tommy. It was just such a cool experience to be able to play with him on Sunday in such a good week in his home area. Just really special to kind of share that with him.\u201dThe intrigue behind Straka\u2019s rise is connected with a swap at caddie, borrowing from American Kevin Kisner before the John Deere Classic to inspire victory in Illinois and now this breakout at the final major championship of the year.Outside of Harman, Straka was the only player to reach -8 at any stage of the tournament. Quite simply, captain Luke Donald knows Straka\u2019s ceiling is probably higher than anybody outside his European stalwarts Rory McIlroy, Jon Rahm, Viktor Hovland, Fleetwood, Matt Fitzpatrick, Tyrrell Hatton and Shane Lowry.RecommendedWalking with Rory: The sights and sounds of an Open round with McIlroyBrian Harman clinches Open glory at drenched Hoylake behind putting wizardryRory McIlroy turns attention to Ryder Cup as wait for fifth major continuesHis breakout year, if you even want to call it that after finishing seventh in the 2022 FedEx Cup, begs the question: What type of player is Donald getting?Well, Straka led the field in greens in regulation (45) last week, he also came out on top in total birdies made (21) \u2013 by four. A dream combination for matchplay, now the challenge is to retain that form for nine weeks.Straka revealed Donald confided in him during a practice day at Hoylake, handing him a boost by revealing he has \u201cbeen on his radar for a while\u201d.\u201cI don\u2019t know about that,\u201d Straka responded when it was put to him that he was now a lock for the team. \u201cBut I feel like my game is in a good place. I\u2019ve got a couple more months of tournaments to take advantage of the good play and hopefully I can do that.\u201dDonald\u2019s plans are now entering their final draft, with the team locked in from 3 September, three weeks out from the big dance in Rome.

His tied-71st finish at +10 ensures the Scot remains clinging on to the third and final European points place.If Straka, even as a wildcard, now joins the aforementioned group of McIlroy, Rahm, Hovland, Fleetwood, Fitzpatrick, Hatton and Lowry as locks, while Justin Rose\u2019s vast experience and victory at Pebble Beach is surely enough for a captain\u2019s pick, then MacIntyre will be keen to avoid entering the debate for those final two spots.If Yannik Paul (fourth), Adrian Meronk (fifth) and Victor Perez (seventh) can\u2019t displace MacIntyre in the next three events, they\u2019ll hope to become one of those lucky two.Donald\u2019s final decisions will probably come down to that trio, Swedish phenom Ludvig Aberg, Seamus Power and brothers Rasmus and Nicolai H\u00f8jgaard.Bob MacIntyre will be desperate to hold on to an automatic spot on Team Europe  (EPA)Has Justin Thomas played himself out of the American Ryder Cup team?Away from the\u00a0glory at Hoylake, Justin Thomas\u2019s plight continued with consecutive major championship rounds in the 80s.Cut at +11, following that rotten 82 on Thursday, including the painful nine scored at the 18th, Thomas redeemed himself with an even-par round of 71 on Friday.Tumbling to 24th in the world rankings and on the bubble at 75th in the FedEx Cup standings, he is now in jeopardy of missing the playoffs as one of the top 70 players invited. Thomas must rekindle that fire inside that inspired the most improbable of come-from-behind victories to make up seven strokes on Mito Pereira at last year\u2019s PGA Championship.If ever there was a Captain America on Team USA, Thomas would relish the role, with his feverish personality likely to rile the Europeans.The two-time major winner will hope a 6-2-1 Ryder Cup record and a 16-5-3 overall record in team competition for the United States, including 8-2-1 alongside good friend Jordan Spieth, will be enough for a wildcard.Zach Johnson\u2019s six wildcards will likely come from a group including Keegan Bradley, Spieth, Collin Morikawa, Harman, Cameron Young, Sam Burns, Rickie Fowler, Tony Finau and Thomas.Justin Thomas endured a dismal Open  (Getty)Is Brian Harman an outlier or can shorter hitters still thrive in professional golf?How refreshing it was to witness Harman, with a different style and eclectic mix of ingredients to his game, syphon off a major championship at 36 years of age no less in the era of bombers dominating professional golf.

The elite footballing school trains players for the men\u2019s Bundesliga side, Schalke, with Popp the only female student to attend the school courtesy of a special permit.Having also played for mixed-gender teams at FC Silschede, Popp eventually got her first taste of senior football at Recklinghausen in the fourth tier of German football. Her stay there would last just one year with the then 17-year-old joining top-flight Duisburg in 2008 under the tutelage of the current national team manager, Martina Voss-Tecklenburg.Popp would enjoy a hugely successful first season, winning the UEFA Women\u2019s Champions League and German Cup with Duisburg. She would follow that up the following season by retaining the German Cup with the season culminating in Popp making her debut for the senior national team in 2010.RecommendedFIFA Women\u2019s World Cup fixtures and full scheduleWomen\u2019s football world rankings: Who could take No 1 at the World Cup?Germany and Alexandra Popp are out for revenge - the World Cup is the perfect chanceAfter two further years, Popp transferred to Wolfsburg in 2012 where she remains today. Much like her debut season at Duisburg, Popp would hit the ground running at Wolfsburg with a famous treble-winning campaign that saw her side capture the UEFA Women\u2019s Champions League, Frauen-Bundesliga and German Cup.Her career at Wolfsburg went from strength to strength as Popp guided her side to a successful defence of the UEFA Women\u2019s Champions League and Frauen-Bundesliga in the 2013-14 season.Whilst her Wolfsburg side may not have tasted European glory since that 2014 season, they have been the dominant force in domestic German women\u2019s football with her side winning the German Cup for nine-straight seasons while also winning the Frauen-Bundesliga on five occasions.For the national team, Popp has also been a stalwart since her debut in 2010, scoring 62 goals in 128 appearances. Despite missing the final through injury, Popp scored eight goals as Germany went on to retain the Euros in 2013.Having lost in the semi-finals of the 2015 World Cup, the national side would go on to claim gold at the 2016 Rio Olympics. In 2019, Popp would become captain of the national side ahead of the World Cup where they fell to Sweeden in the quarter-finals.A heartbreaking injury in the warm-up for last year\u2019s Euros finals prevented Popp from playing as England defeated Germany in extra time."}, {"_id": "64bef83051ac33362ba19ba1", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/shaka-hislop-collapse-live-espn-real-madrid-ac-milan-b2380695.html", "primaryCategory": "Football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "ESPN presenter Shaka Hislop collapses live on air in scary moment during Real Madrid match", "lead": "<p>Hislop was covering Real\u2019s pre-season friendly against AC Milan in California when he collapsed on the touchline</p>", "author": "Luke Baker", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 13:26:31", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:16:16.101575", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-24T13:26:31+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/24/08/newFile-3.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Miguel Delaney\u2019s Reading the Game newsletter sent straight to your inbox for freeSign up to Miguel\u2019s Delaney\u2019s free weekly newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Mbappe sparked this entire saga by telling PSG he had no wish to sign a new deal last month. With Real Madrid keen to hold their nerve and not move for the French star until next summer, primarily for reasons of financial fair play, Al Hilal are willing to give all parties a potential out with even a one-year deal that could see Mbappe earn \u20ac700m for a season.One of the issues right now is almost that Mbappe has priced himself out of most moves, with all but about three or four clubs unable to afford him.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeLiverpool entered the 2022/23 campaign on the backs of heartbreak as they lost out on both the Champions League and Premier League on the last day of each competition. Liverpool began the season with high expectations but nothing seemed to go as planned as the club flamed out of the Champions League in the round of 16 to Real Madrid and found themselves finishing fifth in the Premier League en route to missing out on the Champions League for the first time since the 2015-2016 season.Klopp\u2019s club entered the transfer window with a clear emphasis on bolstering their midfield, particularly considering the confirmed departures of James Milner, Fabio Carvalho, and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain as well as rumoured exits for Jordan Henderson and Fabinho.The club has been proactive in pursuing this objective, having already secured the signatures of two quality midfielders and surpassing the \u00a3100 million spending mark for the first time since 2018. Still, Liverpool may not be done yet, as they aim to potentially complete a midfield trio of signings, with the highly sought-after defensive midfielder Romeo Lavia being a potential addition.Here are the latest news and transfer updates around Anfield:RecommendedChelsea transfer news: Michael Olise, Marc Guehi, Moises Caicedo, Callum Hudson-Odoi and moreAnge Postecoglou \u2018not relaxed\u2019 by uncertainty over Harry Kane\u2019s Tottenham futureManchester United sign Andre Onana in \u00a343m transfer from Inter MilanRomeo LaviaLiverpool have entered the Romeo Lavia sweepstakes in a bid to bolster their already much-improved midfield. The Southampton player has attracted strong interest from London clubs Arsenal and Chelsea, but neither appear willing to secure the services of the 19-year-old. With Arsenal spending a record transfer fee on Declan Rice and Chelsea focusing on trying to sign Moises Caicedo, Liverpool appear to be the front-runner for Lavia\u2019s services.The Daily Mail reports that the Saints have placed a price tag of approximately \u00a350 million on the Belgian, who would be the ideal addition to complete a trio of midfielders set to join Anfield. Klopp entered this transfer window with the intention of revamping an aging and struggling midfield, and he has achieved precisely that.With the acquisitions of attack-minded midfielders Alexis Mac Allister from Brighton for \u00a335 million and recently-signed Hungarian Dominik Szoboszli for \u00a360 million from RB Leipzig, Lavia would provide Liverpool with a defensively-minded midfielder to finalize an extremely talented group.Cheick DoucoureAnother central midfielder that is generating interest from Liverpool is Crystal Palace\u2019s Cheick Doucoure. The 23-year-old midfielder joined the Eagles from French club, Lens, last season and enjoyed a superb first season in the Premier League, winning the club\u2019s end-of-season Player of the Year award.According to The Evening Standard, the Mali international is one of the players on the Merseyside club\u2019s shortlist to replace Jordan Henderson and Fabinho who both look set to complete moves to Saudi Arabia. A fee in the region of \u00a350 million is set to be required by Crystal Palace, who is also said to be attracting interest from Paris Saint-Germain.Thiago Earlier in the window, Thiago became a prime target of interest from Saudi Arabia, with the Spaniard reportedly rejecting a lucrative offer from a team in the Saudi League, according to reports from The Athletic.The 32-year-old midfielder currently has one year left on his contract and intends to fulfil it at Anfield in the upcoming year. Despite this Fichajes is reporting that La Liga clubs, Real Sociedad and Sevilla, are still said to be monitoring the availability of the Spanish midfielder with Liverpool perhaps keen to cash in on the midfielder before his contract expires if they can bring in suitable replacements.Joshua KimmichIf Thiago was to leave Liverpool, one midfielder that Jurgen Klopp might have his eye on is the experienced German international, Joshua Kimmich. According to Fichajes, Liverpool are considering a bid for the Bayern Munich midfielder who has two years left on his deal.The 28-year-old has won 11 Bundesliga titles with the club and would provide plenty of experience at the heart of the Liverpool midfield, especially given the likely departures of Fabinho and Jordan Henderson. Liverpool might have to fend off interest from other clubs, though, with both Manchester United and Manchester City said to be considering a deal for Kimmich.Bradley BarcolaRecommendedEngland\u2019s Lotte Wubben-Moy begins Doodle Diary again \u2013 Friday\u2019s sporting socialJordan Henderson risks tarnishing Liverpool legacy after career built on characterLiverpool agree \u00a312m deal to sell Jordan Henderson to Saudi club Al EttifaqWith the departure of Roberto Firmio, there may well be a vacancy in Liverpool\u2019s forward line.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeAfter Chelsea experienced their worst season since the establishment of the Premier League, American owner Todd Boehly has taken significant measures to bring about change at Stamford Bridge.The Blues went through a revolving door of three managers last season, including Thomas Tuchel (now at Bayern Munich), Graham Potter, and interim manager and club legend Frank Lampard. Now, Mauricio Pochettino, who previously led London rivals Tottenham to a Champions League final, will take over the reins and attempt to restore stability to a club that won the Champions Leauge as recently as 2021.This summer, the club has witnessed an astonishing number of departures already, with several key players leaving who played pivotal roles at Stamford Bridge over the past few seasons. Among those having exited are Edouard Mendy, Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Mateo Kovacic, Kalidou Koulibaly, N\u2019Golo Kante, Kai Havertz, Mason Mount, and Christian Pulisic.These departures mark the beginning of a new era at Chelsea and may be the transformative change required for the club to regain its place in Europe.Here are the latest transfer rumours regarding the Blues:RecommendedArsenal transfer news: Record Declan Rice bid, Jurrien Timber and Granit Xhaka latestManchester United transfer news: Mason Mount bid accepted, David De Gea and Andre Onana latestTottenham transfer news: Harry Kane latest after Bayern Munich bids and trio on centre-back listMichael OliseAfter a summer of outgoings so far for the west London club, Chelsea now appear to be turning their focus to incomings as they look to assemble a squad that can improve on last season\u2019s miserable campaign. One player reportedly being eyed up is Crystal Palace\u2019s Michael Olise, with RMC Sport suggesting that the Blues have tabled a bid for the French winger. Olise is said to have a \u00a335m release clause in his contract, which runs until 2026, with Chelsea willing to pay above the buyout clause to secure preferable terms of payment for the 21-year-old. Chelsea are not alone in their interest in the playmaker, with Arsenal, Manchester City and PSG also said to be interested in Olise.Elye WahiAnother position Chelsea are keen to strengthen is the striker position. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has departed for Marseille while Romeulu Lukaku appears to not be in Pochettino\u2019s plans. Nicolas Jackson and Christopher Nkunku have already arrived but Chelsea are also keen on French youngster, Elye Wahi. According to Fabrizio Romano, Chelsea have reached advanced negotiations with Montpellier for a deal to bring the 20-year-old to the club. The Frenchman scored 19 goals in 33 games in Ligue 1 last season with Chelsea reportedly keen to loan out the striker this season before bringing him into the first-team picture the following season.Marc GuehiAfter Wesley Fofana picked up a second long-term knee injury, Chelsea are said to weighing up a move for a centre-back in this window. Thiago Silva, Levi Colwill, Benoit Badiashile and Trevoh Chalobah remain on the books but, according to The Evening Standard, the club is said to be weighing up a move for Crystal Palace\u2019s Marc Guehi. The 23-year-old left Chelsea for Crystal Palace for \u00a318 million in 2021 with no buy-back clause inserted into the deal. A fee of around \u00a350m is said to be required to bring the English defender back to west London after a couple of impressive seasons for the Eagles.Moises CaicedoWith Kovacic, Kante and Mount departing, Chelsea will look to bring in some central midfield replacements. According to The Evening Standard, one such player that the Blues may target is Brighton\u2019s Moises Caicedo.The Ecuadorian was a key player as Brighton finished sixth but has been the subject of much interest from the league\u2019s biggest club. Brighton turned down a \u00a370m bid by Arsenal in January and look set to demand \u00a3100m for their prized asset. Reports suggest that a \u00a360m bid has already been rejected but the London club believe that a fee in the region of \u00a380m could be agreed with Brighton.Callum Hudson-OdoiRecommendedMason Mount\u2019s sale is one part of Chelsea\u2019s \u2018masterplan\u2019, but what comes next?Dybala or Vlahovic: Which Serie A striker should Chelsea sign?Chelsea target two Serie A players in quest for experienced strikersChelsea\u2019s outgoings are not done for the summer, however, with Callum Hudson-Odoi the latest to be linked with a move away from Stamford Bridge.

Mbappe sparked this entire saga by telling PSG he had no wish to sign a new deal last month. With Real Madrid keen to hold their nerve and not move for the French star until next summer, primarily for reasons of financial fair play, Al Hilal are willing to give all parties a potential out with even a one-year deal that could see Mbappe earn \u20ac700m for a season.One of the issues right now is almost that Mbappe has priced himself out of most moves, with all but about three or four clubs unable to afford him. Chelsea are among the clubs to have considered a move, but the feeling is the price would be too high and that it would take a lot to convince Mbappe anyway.RecommendedWayne Rooney hopes Marcus Rashford builds Man Utd legacy after signing new dealWayne Rooney hopes Marcus Rashford builds Man Utd legacy after new dealESPN presenter Shaka Hislop collapses on air in scary moment during Real Madrid match"}, {"_id": "64bef83251ac33362ba19bab", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/olympics/swimming/michael-phelps-world-record-leon-marchand-b2380776.html", "primaryCategory": "Swimming", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Michael Phelps loses final swimming world record", "lead": "<p>Leon Marchand broke Phelps\u2019 record in the 400m individual medley by more than a second </p>", "author": "Shrivathsa Sridhar", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 10:20:09", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:16:18.554973", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-24T10:20:09+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/24/11/newFile-1.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free sport newsletter for all the latest news on everything from cycling to boxingSign up to our free sport email for all the latest news\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

We just picked it up and gave it to her. She doesn\u2019t need any encouragement to do that. Georgia is not the type of player that needs telling what to do or is lacking confidence.

He intends to spend much of his retirement tending to his animals on his farm in Melisey, the small town a few miles west of this race where he grew up and where his father was mayor. \u201cDonkeys bring me a pleasure I don\u2019t get from most humans,\u201d he said recently.RecommendedVingegaard completes Tour double as Philipsen denied Champs Elysees fairytaleJonas Vingegaard targets further Tour de France success after title defenceStage-by-stage guide to the 2023 Tour de France routePinot is only 33, but injuries have been cruel and it was his back which finally forced him to bring his career to a premature end.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeTottenham spent 72 days without a manager earlier this year, amid the surreal interregnum of Cristian Stellini and then the tenure of the interim to the interim, Ryan Mason, amongst talk of Julian Nagelsmann and Thomas Tuchel and Arne Slot and Luis Enrique and Xabi Alonso and Vincent Kompany and Ruben Amorim and Roberto De Zerbi.And yet, the eventual appointment Ange Postecoglou has soon discovered, it is not the longest they have spent in limbo. A few weeks into his reign \u2013 or, perhaps more pertinently, after a few weeks of working for Daniel Levy \u2013 and the Australian has found that Spurs have spent the summer so far in a state of permanent uncertainty.Everything \u2013 the mood, the expectation, the tactics, the transfer-market policy \u2013 is dictated by the question of whether Harry Kane stays. Postecoglou does not know what the answer will be. \u201cIt is fair to say I am not relaxed about it,\u201d he said on their pre-season tour of Australia. It is safe to say that was an understatement.Postecoglou is blameless in the Kane saga. Levy is not. The Tottenham chairman is entitled to refuse offers for his club\u2019s greatest goalscorer or to hold out for the best possible price. But a reason why Manchester United, despite their admiration for Kane\u2019s qualities, were quick to decide they would not pursue him this year was that they could see this scenario coming: that a summer spent fixated on Kane could end in futility, perhaps costing them other targets and meaning they missed out on a striker altogether. There was a lesson from history: that was Manchester City\u2019s fate in 2021, even if it did not prevent them from becoming champions the following season.RecommendedAnge Postecoglou \u2018not relaxed\u2019 by uncertainty over Harry Kane\u2019s Tottenham futureNow that may be a glimpse of the future, either for Tottenham or for Bayern Munich. They cannot both end up with Kane on 1 September: time is running out for one and the longer they spend squabbling over him, the greater the chance the loser will deem this a wasted window, with alternative attackers bought by other clubs in the meantime and their forward line left shorn of a potent force. Bayern may be better equipped to cope, despite the problems the lack of a No 9 caused them last season, but they run the risk of a second season in their own unhappy limbo, lacking a worthy successor to Robert Lewandowski. But Bayern have had two bids rejected while Uli Hoeness has claimed that, if Kane keeps his word, he will join them.Kane\u2019s ubiquity in any discussion involving Tottenham was clear to Postecoglou and not merely because Hugo Lloris\u2019 probable departure appears a sideshow in comparison. \u201cSuch a massive figure,\u201d said the Australian and Tottenham\u2019s other failings in the last four years, from poor managerial appointments to misguided signings to the drop-off in other players, have all contrived to render the ever-excellent Kane still more important.If Levy is partly culpable for that underachievement, he must share some responsibility for a situation where the balance of power has shifted. In to the last year of his contract, with no reason to re-sign right now and no probability he will during this window, Kane holds the cards. There is an argument \u2013 perhaps more footballing than financial \u2013 that Tottenham should risk losing him on a free transfer for another season of a guarantee of goals and the possibility that would power them into the Champions League. There is also the chance Levy\u2019s is a self-defeating brand of obduracy, that the coup of keeping Kane simply ends up costing Spurs: that it is his version of Antonio Conte playing for a 0-0 draw against AC Milan as Tottenham exited Europe.Ange Postecoglou, right, before a washed-out friendly with Leicester in Bangkok (Reuters)One way or another, Postecoglou could be collateral damage. His reign has begun with an upbeat feel and, in James Maddison in particular, a potentially terrific signing. And yet he is currently bogged down by the never-ending issue of Kane. \u201cI don\u2019t think that is good for anyone,\u201d Postecoglou said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it is good for Harry, I don\u2019t think it is good for the club.\u201dNor is it good for him as it all drags on. The last manager to take over at Tottenham in a summer, Nuno Espirito Santo, walked into a similar situation, albeit with a couple of significant differences. Kane then tried to force a move; he missed Spurs\u2019 first game of the season \u2013 a deceptively encouraging win over his suitors from City \u2013 whereas he is on the pre-season tour now. Kane scored a lone league goal for Nuno; the Portuguese was miscast as Tottenham manager and Postecoglou looks an altogether better fit.But his reign could also be defined by Kane. If Plan B is for Richarlison to lead the line, it would require quite a few alterations to the gameplan. If Plan C is for a new signing, any replacement would be a downgrade and, because Kane can be both prolific and a playmaker, scarcely a duplicate. So Postecoglou will have to formulate different strategies, with or without Kane. And so far, he is unsure which ones he will need. And for the Postecoglou revolution to take effect, he first needs the Kane resolution."}, {"_id": "64bef83451ac33362ba19bb0", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/boxing/kambosos-maxi-hughes-robbery-score-b2380724.html", "primaryCategory": "Boxing", "subCategories": "test", "title": "George Kambosos reacts to \u2018robbery\u2019 claims after controversial win over Maxi Hughes", "lead": "<p>The Australian took Hughes\u2019 IBO lightweight title with a heavily-disputed decision in Oklahoma </p>", "author": "Alex Pattle", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 08:48:00", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:16:20.380711", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-24T08:48:00+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/24/09/newFile-2.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free sport newsletter for all the latest news on everything from cycling to boxingSign up to our free sport email for all the latest news\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeEngland\u2019s suffered Ashes agony at Emirates Old Trafford, as their hopes of taking a memorable series to a winner-takes-all decider fell foul of the weather.The fifth and final day of the fourth Test was abandoned without a ball being bowled, leaving a dominant home side unable to pick up the hunt for the last five Australian wickets.The first draw of the \u2018Bazball\u2019 era guarantees the tourists will hold on to the urn, leading 2-1 with one more game to go at the Kia Oval, and here we look at some of the key questions coming out of the frustrating finish.If England can still draw the series 2-2, why have Australia retained the Ashes?RecommendedThe sporting weekend in picturesBen Stokes: We have \u2018done wonders for cricket in England\u2019 despite not winning Ashes England\u2019s Ashes hopes washed away as Australia retain urn in anti-climaxTo sum it up in a word: tradition. While England fans know all too well about one-day cricket\u2019s tie-breakers \u2013 having needed a super over and a boundary countback to pip New Zealand to the 2019 World Cup \u2013 Test cricket has no problem with the draw. When it comes to the format\u2019s oldest rivalry the holders must be beaten outright to lose their bragging rights. Australia\u2019s last trip to England ended with similar questions, as the tourists celebrated a 2-2 scoreline while England reflected on unfinished business. Captain Ben Stokes was given the chance to question the custom after the match, but waved it away without a second thought.Is there any way England could have forced a win in this Test?Having been criticised for declaring too early on the first day of the series at Edgbaston, Stokes now finds himself scrutinised for doing the direct opposite in the fourth Test. Rather than calling his side in shortly after lunch on day three, he allowed Jonny Bairstow to continue flogging Australia\u2019s bowlers in the afternoon session as he finished on 99 not out. England finished with a first-innings lead of 275, but did not have enough time in the field to convert that into victory. An earlier withdrawal would certainly have given them more time to collect 10 wickets, but a slimmer advantage means they would have probably needed to bat again. Ultimately, their push was ruined by the rain, with 30 overs out of a scheduled 180 over the weekend. By scoring their runs at almost 5.5 an over and picking 15 wickets, England can hardly be accused of being ponderous with the time they had.Australia captain Pat Cummins celebrates retaining the Ashes  (Getty Images)How can cricket stop important matches ending like this?Assuming the holy grail of cricket grounds with a roof remains an expensive pipe dream, what else is there to do? The World Test Championship final has been granted a reserve day since the International Cricket Council brought it in but the idea of rolling that idea out more broadly look fanciful in the extreme. Tours are getting shorter and more congested and the cost of booking holding venues and staff for an extra day that will rarely be used would be prohibitive, especially outside England. More realistic is a push to improve over-rates. Financial sanctions have proved a hollow threat. More proactive umpiring, fewer stoppages and run penalties could all be looked at, while others suggest eating into the lunch and tea breaks. The resistance to pulling start times forward from 11am to make up for lost time remains baffling.What\u2019s on the line at the Oval this week?2005: Eng won 2-12009: Eng won 2-12013: Eng won 3-02015: Eng won 3-22019: Drawn 2-2The last Australia side to win in England did so back in 2001, meaning the current class has a chance to do something a generation of their compatriots could not. They snapped a long losing streak with a shared series four years ago and will be desperate to go one better now. For England, there is a chance to keep up an undefeated streak under the Stokes-McCullum leadership regime and frustrate their rivals in the process. A 3-1 loss would be a poor reflection on their efforts over recent weeks, so there is some work to do to deliver a more fitting result.RecommendedDay five of fourth Ashes Test: England face battle with elements in victory pushThe Ashes LIVE: England vs Australia result and fourth Test reactionDay four of fourth Ashes Test: Eyes on the skies as England chase victoryWhy does it feel like the end of an era?Because it is. Several of the key protagonists are well into the autumn of their careers and face uncertain futures. The next battle is not until the winter of 2025/26 and there are a host of veterans for whom that seems a long way. England\u2019s record wicket-taker James Anderson turns 41 at the end of the month, Moeen Ali is sure to return to Test retirement in the coming days, while Stuart Broad (37), Chris Woakes (34) and Mark Wood (33) have plenty of miles on the clock. As for Stokes, his body is creaking and the toll his injury problems are taking is not yet clear. For Australia, David Warner has already set his own timetable for departure while it would be a surprise to see Steve Smith, Josh Hazlewood, Usman Khawaja, Mitchell Starc and Nathan Lyon on these shores again in 2027.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeEngland\u2019s suffered Ashes agony at Emirates Old Trafford, as their hopes of taking a memorable series to a winner-takes-all decider fell foul of the weather.The fifth and final day of the fourth Test was abandoned without a ball being bowled, leaving a dominant home side unable to pick up the hunt for the last five Australian wickets.The first draw of the \u2018Bazball\u2019 era guarantees the tourists will hold on to the urn, leading 2-1 with one more game to go at the Kia Oval, and here we look at some of the key questions coming out of the frustrating finish.If England can still draw the series 2-2, why have Australia retained the Ashes?RecommendedThe sporting weekend in picturesBen Stokes: We have \u2018done wonders for cricket in England\u2019 despite not winning Ashes England\u2019s Ashes hopes washed away as Australia retain urn in anti-climaxTo sum it up in a word: tradition. While England fans know all too well about one-day cricket\u2019s tie-breakers \u2013 having needed a super over and a boundary countback to pip New Zealand to the 2019 World Cup \u2013 Test cricket has no problem with the draw. When it comes to the format\u2019s oldest rivalry the holders must be beaten outright to lose their bragging rights. Australia\u2019s last trip to England ended with similar questions, as the tourists celebrated a 2-2 scoreline while England reflected on unfinished business. Captain Ben Stokes was given the chance to question the custom after the match, but waved it away without a second thought.Is there any way England could have forced a win in this Test?Having been criticised for declaring too early on the first day of the series at Edgbaston, Stokes now finds himself scrutinised for doing the direct opposite in the fourth Test. Rather than calling his side in shortly after lunch on day three, he allowed Jonny Bairstow to continue flogging Australia\u2019s bowlers in the afternoon session as he finished on 99 not out. England finished with a first-innings lead of 275, but did not have enough time in the field to convert that into victory. An earlier withdrawal would certainly have given them more time to collect 10 wickets, but a slimmer advantage means they would have probably needed to bat again. Ultimately, their push was ruined by the rain, with 30 overs out of a scheduled 180 over the weekend. By scoring their runs at almost 5.5 an over and picking 15 wickets, England can hardly be accused of being ponderous with the time they had.Australia captain Pat Cummins celebrates retaining the Ashes  (Getty Images)How can cricket stop important matches ending like this?Assuming the holy grail of cricket grounds with a roof remains an expensive pipe dream, what else is there to do? The World Test Championship final has been granted a reserve day since the International Cricket Council brought it in but the idea of rolling that idea out more broadly look fanciful in the extreme. Tours are getting shorter and more congested and the cost of booking holding venues and staff for an extra day that will rarely be used would be prohibitive, especially outside England. More realistic is a push to improve over-rates. Financial sanctions have proved a hollow threat. More proactive umpiring, fewer stoppages and run penalties could all be looked at, while others suggest eating into the lunch and tea breaks. The resistance to pulling start times forward from 11am to make up for lost time remains baffling.What\u2019s on the line at the Oval this week?2005: Eng won 2-12009: Eng won 2-12013: Eng won 3-02015: Eng won 3-22019: Drawn 2-2The last Australia side to win in England did so back in 2001, meaning the current class has a chance to do something a generation of their compatriots could not. They snapped a long losing streak with a shared series four years ago and will be desperate to go one better now. For England, there is a chance to keep up an undefeated streak under the Stokes-McCullum leadership regime and frustrate their rivals in the process. A 3-1 loss would be a poor reflection on their efforts over recent weeks, so there is some work to do to deliver a more fitting result.RecommendedDay five of fourth Ashes Test: England face battle with elements in victory pushThe Ashes LIVE: England vs Australia result and fourth Test reactionDay four of fourth Ashes Test: Eyes on the skies as England chase victoryWhy does it feel like the end of an era?Because it is. Several of the key protagonists are well into the autumn of their careers and face uncertain futures. The next battle is not until the winter of 2025/26 and there are a host of veterans for whom that seems a long way. England\u2019s record wicket-taker James Anderson turns 41 at the end of the month, Moeen Ali is sure to return to Test retirement in the coming days, while Stuart Broad (37), Chris Woakes (34) and Mark Wood (33) have plenty of miles on the clock. As for Stokes, his body is creaking and the toll his injury problems are taking is not yet clear. For Australia, David Warner has already set his own timetable for departure while it would be a surprise to see Steve Smith, Josh Hazlewood, Usman Khawaja, Mitchell Starc and Nathan Lyon on these shores again in 2027. The Oval Test could be the last dance for these teams."}, {"_id": "64bef83551ac33362ba19bb6", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/david-goodwillie-glasgow-united-club-news-b2380710.html", "primaryCategory": "Football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Glasgow club threatened with eviction over pursuit of convicted rapist David Goodwillie", "lead": "<p>David Goodwillie turned out for Glasgow United in a recent friendly</p>", "author": "Sports Staff", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 08:08:03", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:16:21.850877", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-24T08:08:03+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/28/17/e5048c4bf00763f82ff23bf27a1b6851Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg4MDU2NDM0-2.11785887.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Miguel Delaney\u2019s Reading the Game newsletter sent straight to your inbox for freeSign up to Miguel\u2019s Delaney\u2019s free weekly newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

When the issue reached FIFA, the sport's global governing body banned head coverings in competitions it sanctioned, except for coverings that exposed the neck. FIFA cited \u201chealth and safety\u201d concerns, some related to possible choking, with regulations forbidding \u201cequipment that is dangerous to himself or another player.\u201d\u201cThat really sent a strong message to Muslim women, particularly those who wear hijabs, (that) we don\u2019t belong,\u201d said Helal, an Australia-based operations manager of Creating Chances and Football United.Helal was among the social activists, Muslim athletes, and government and soccer officials who worked to overturn the ban.In 2012, FIFA granted the Asian Football Confederation a two-year trial period during which players would be allowed to wear head coverings at international competitions. No senior-level World Cups, men\u2019s or women\u2019s, were scheduled during the trial period.In 2014, FIFA lifted its ban on head coverings. Two years later, the under-17 Women\u2019s World Cup in Jordan marked the first time Muslim players wore headscarves during an international FIFA event.Maryan Hagi-Hashi, a Melbourne resident who attended Morocco\u2019s public practice session last week, said she is supporting the Atlas Lionesses alongside tournament co-host Australia.

They beat underdogs Morocco 6-0 in their opening game, with Popp (2), Schuller and Klara Buhl finding the net along with two own goals, although the Atlas Lionesses made history as the first Arab team to play at a Women\u2019s World Cup.Monday also saw Brazil and their 37-year-old superstar Marta kick things off with a comfortable 4-0 victory Panama as Ary Borges scored a hat-trick, while Italy beat Argentina 1-0 in the first game of the day with veteran striker Cristiana Girelli coming off the bench to grab the winner.Elsewhere, France suffered a blow early in their campaign as they were held to a 0-0 draw by a battling Jamaica, who earned a first-ever Women\u2019s World Cup point. That came a day after England began with a win but the Lionesses were pushed all the way by Haiti in what was a close contest in Brisbane.

The shakiness of England\u2019s defence had thankfully been compensated for by Haiti\u2019s lack of a cutting edge but her irritation was still clear, and warranted.Time and time again the simple things just hadn\u2019t been done right.

It was hardly the most encouraging sign for the Lionesses as they began their Women\u2019s World Cup with a nervy, narrow victory over Haiti, but with questions remaining over several key positions there is certainly no doubt over the quality and value of England\u2019s No 1.Georgia Stanway may have scored the only goal in this unconvincing opening win, but Mary Earps was England\u2019s match-winner.

Mike Jones24 July 2023 19:301690222532England\u2019s World Cup hinges on a defining questionSince arriving in Australia, Sarina Wiegman has stepped up work on a new system, that may not even be unveiled until the knock-out stages. It is an inherent acknowledgement that England are no longer in the strong position they were, but simultaneously something that may yet prove the winning of this World Cup.This has been reflected in the mood of the camp in Australia, beyond the distraction over bonuses. There is certainly no lack of faith, especially in Wiegman\u2019s ability to come up with something special. This is another benefit of a feat like the Euro 2022 victory. It banishes doubts, and fosters that immensely powerful feeling that everything will go well because the manager knows exactly what they are doing. It is why big games, as in that juncture quarter-final win over Spain, can almost seem like they will go exactly as Wiegman predicts.There\u2019s also the fact that, right now, the manager has one of the most talented teams in the world. For so long, this has seemed like the moment England were long building up to.The question now is whether that moment just comes at the wrong time.England\u2019s World Cup hinges on a defining question Off the pitch turmoil and a growing injury list hinder Sarina Wiegman\u2019s hopes of turning her European champions into World Cup winners Mike Jones24 July 2023 19:151690221632Why this Women\u2019s World Cup will be unlike anything we\u2019ve seen beforeAs the squads have been adjusting to Australia and New Zealand over the last few weeks, many coaches and staff members have been doing what the rest of the public does, bouncing around news stories about the different teams to see how they are doing. It is the point at which an international tournament takes on that enticingly self-contained quality. All eyes still go to the USA, especially with this being Megan Rapinoe\u2019s last World Cup, and the squad looking to see her off with a historic third successive victory.As the defending champions themselves look around the field, though, they aren\u2019t seeing what they used to. There is the usual confidence, of course, but also some caution. The gap between them and the rest of the teams isn\u2019t as big. Rapinoe\u2019s retirement may well close out a wider era, since the dominant factor in women\u2019s football over the last decade has been how the USA have enjoyed much longer-term development than the rest of the game. That has been seen as especially influential as regards physical conditioning, but the general feeling is that the European game and Australia have caught up.England would certainly have no fears there, especially given how they beat the USA in that signpost match back in October.Why this Women\u2019s World Cup will be unlike anything we\u2019ve\u00a0seen\u00a0beforeThe staging of the first 32-team Women\u2019s World Cup in Australia and New Zealand presents fresh challenges, but a supreme cast of talent and a wide-open tournament can take the game to new heights, writes Miguel Delaney Mike Jones24 July 2023 19:001690220732When can I watch England?England play their first match of the World Cup against Haiti in Group D on 22 July.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeAs the rain continued to pour, Brian Harman marched towards the claret jug, dissecting Royal Liverpool and clinching a six-shot victory at the 151st Open Championship.The American, whose nerveless final round of 70 took him to a winning score of -13, impressively blocked out the noise throughout a sodden afternoon at Hoylake. In fact, having vowed to sleep for 10 hours overnight on his five-shot lead, the unrelenting pitter patter of rain not only eased any nerves, it removed them entirely.Psychology can often play a bigger role than the brilliance of the world\u2019s best with a club in their hands. Harman has hinted as much and confessed to feeling anxiety; the claustrophobic nature and pressure of professional golf has dampened his impact on the biggest stage until now after showing such formidable potential in high school and college.The bowhunting fanatic, who has publicly revealed how he relishes elk hunting in Colorado, expertly swerved and blocked any counterattacks from his rivals behind a reliable short game. The foundation of this supreme win was built on a remarkable 58 out of 59 putts holed from 10 feet or less (98.3 per cent) across the four days. The putting wizards of this sport of course find that rare combination of skill and mental resilience.\u201cI\u2019ve always had a self-belief that I could do something like this,\u201d Harman said. \u201cIt\u2019s just when it takes so much time it\u2019s hard not to let your mind falter, like maybe I\u2019m not winning again. I\u2019m 36 years old. Game is getting younger. All these young guys coming out, hit it a mile, and they're all ready to win. Like when is it going to be my turn again?RecommendedRory McIlroy turns attention to Ryder Cup as wait for fifth major continuesWalking with Rory: The sights and sounds of an Open round with McIlroy\u201cI\u2019's been hard to deal with. I think someone mentioned that I\u2019ve had more top 10s than anyone since 2017, so that\u2019s a lot of times where you get done, you\u2019re like, dammit, man, I had that one; it just didn\u2019t happen for whatever reason.\u201cI had a lot of success as a junior golfer. I won the US Junior, and then as an amateur I was the No 1 ranked amateur in the world for a good while, was the youngest American to get picked for the Walker Cup. I had success. Like I had the pedigree. Then I got to college and it just kind of sputtered a little bit. I just didn\u2019t keep up with the progression.\u201dThe Hoylake deluge certainly dampened any fire from Harman\u2019s hopeful challengers, which saw a four-way tie for second at -7 with Jon Rahm, Tom Kim, Sepp Straka and Jason Day. And it was Rahm, riding high from a sizzling round of 63, who appeared most likely to inspect the Georgian\u2019s nerves to close the deal for a first major championship.There were even flickers of hope for the chasing pack once more. But the 36-year-old replied every time. He was forced to slice through thick greenside rough on three before draining a nerve-jangling seven-footer. Then Harman displayed his unflappable composure after an errant drive sailed into the bushes on five. No drama though, a simple penalty stroke, medicine gleefully swallowed after a bogey six, and then the dispiriting response to the field with an immediate birdie on the par-three sixth to solidify the inevitable.Brian Harman celebrates winning The Open Championship at Royal Liverpool (Getty)Many of the fervent British fans pinned their hopes on the bearded Rahm. The Spaniard, with his cap back to front to avoid raindrops splashing on his ball, rolled in a birdie on the fifth to move within three shots of Harman, but the conditions contained any potential for another round packed with fireworks. His fiery character and frustration eventually provided an explosive reaction to a bogey on 14, emphatically ending his bid.It quickly became one of those days for the rest, with Harman extinguishing any hope with each squelching step. And the story of this miserable day at Hoylake could almost be found with each of Rory McIlroy\u2019s facial expressions from the first ball the four-time major winner struck.Jon Rahm was unable to back up his sensation round of 63 on Saturday  (Getty)The agony of McIlroy\u2019s drought, which will extend to a 10th year, was played out with every wince and frown. But after the joy of three consecutive birdies on the front nine, to close within four, there was more predictable disappointment. Too little, too late, and McIlroy was forced to settle for a tie for sixth.Tommy Fleetwood\u2019s revival, after leading the tournament on Thursday, never materialised here. The classy Englishman succumbed to the notorious 17th, making triple bogey to cruelly tumble down the leaderboard in a tie for 10th. Fleetwood, whose genial nature continued to attract relentless cheers throughout the round despite his challenge fizzling out, displayed his character on the lonely walk to the 18th. Knowing that elusive major remains tantalisingly out of reach, he reached out to one young fan, offering his ball as a souvenir. Tommy Lad\u2019s time will surely come.Rory McIlroy\u2019s wait for a major will extend to a 10th year (Reuters)Attention for many now turns to the Ryder Cup in Rome this September. While Harman chalked up a third major out of four for Americans, this championship offered hope for Europe. Austrian Sepp Straka, with back-to-back years as a PGA Tour winner, offers an interesting wrinkle as a potential debutant for European captain Luke Donald, while Rahm, McIlroy, Fleetwood and Viktor Hovland all finished inside the top 13 and provide a potent quartet to at least offer resistance to a formidable American team.RecommendedBrian Harman holds nerve to win Open Championship by six shots at rainy HoylakeA closer look at 2023 Open champion Brian HarmanRory McIlroy turns attention to Ryder Cup as wait for fifth major continuesBut despite rising to a career-high 10th in the world and surely destined to be on Zach Johnson\u2019s team, Harman is opting to savour this moment after waiting 14 years as a professional to reach the pinnacle of golf.\u201cI\u2019m going to kick that can [Ryder Cup] down the road a little bit,\u201d Harman added. \u201cI\u2019m going to enjoy this.

They\u2019ve played some good stuff and dominated many parts of the Test matches.\u201cI\u2019ll be interested to see how Australia play at the Oval and whether or not they try to be positive. If England win at the Oval, they deserve it because they have been the better side. If Australia play the way they have in this test then England will absolutely wipe them.\u201cThey\u2019ll go back to the first two Tests and look at mistakes they\u2019ve made in the field and at that batting collapse in the first innings at Lord\u2019s, but I do think they are a team that learn quickly now.\u201dAustralia great Glenn McGrath, who was part of teams in 2001 and 2005, believes his country\u2019s passive performance in Manchester was a deliberate tactic to scrape the draw they needed to secure the urn.He also suggested England had cause for regret, suggesting they batted on too long on Friday before the weather turned and also passed up opportunities earlier in the series.\u201cTo me, Australia played this game in survival mode, to protect the lead they\u2019ve got,\u201d he said.\u201cAustralia knew what they wanted to do and they may have looked a bit ugly and a bit negative doing it, but their goal was to retain the Ashes in this match and they\u2019ve done it.RecommendedFootball rumours: Tottenham owner tells chairman to sell Harry KaneKey questions after abandoned final day of drawn fourth Ashes TestOn this day in 2014: Alistair Brownlee beats brother Jonny to Commonwealth gold\u201cLooking back at that declaration (decision), if they had finished at lunch on day three, given themselves 10 more overs when the ball was doing a bit more, they could easily have picked up six or seven wickets.\u201cThe story could be different.

It sees Wallace \u2013 who hosts BBC Two documentary series Inside the Factory \u2013 introduced to a fake company called Good Harvest who are pioneering technology in the sales of \u201chuman meat\u201d used by struggling people during the cost-of-living crisis.Wallace, 58, is shown visiting a human meat-harvesting plant in Lincolnshire, where he meets some of the donors. Looking around the factory, he explains that \u201cunder EU law, we couldn\u2019t possibly operate machines like this due to legislation.

It earned $98mm at the international box office, bringing its global takings to $180m.While Oppenheimer\u2019s critical ratings have blown past Barbie with a near-perfect Rotten Tomato score, the latter, which stars Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, has surpassed the Cillian Murphy-starring biopic\u2019s box office takings.

While Oppenheimer has been praised for its meticulous recreation of its mid-20th century setting, one fan seemingly spotted an error in a scene set in 1945.The moment in question comes after the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, when Oppenheimer is called upon to deliver a speech to a cheering crowd, many of whom are waving US flags.RecommendedBarbie vs Oppenheimer: Greta Gerwig makes history with biggest box office opening for a female directorGeorge Alagiah death: BBC newsreader dies aged 67 after bowel cancer diagnosisBarbie review: A near-miraculous achievement from Greta Gerwig and Margot Robbie\u201cIt was good and all, but I\u2019ll be that guy and complain they used 50-star flags in a scene set in 1945,\u201d wrote Twitter user @AndrewRCraig, alongside a still of the relevant scene.Period-accurate flags were used elsewhere in the film, such as the moment Oppenheimer stands beneath the 48-star flag at Trinity base camp.Some fans even argued that the mistake was in fact deliberate, and had been intended to subtly convey Oppenheimer\u2019s subjective recollections.\u201cPersonally i think it was done intentionally,\u201d they wrote, \u201cbecause coloured scenes were from Oppenheimer\u2019s perspective which is his present day\u2019s memory that was after the 50-star flag was established.\u201dWatch Apple TV+ free for 7 daysNew subscribers only. \u00a36.99/mo. after free trial.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeAt 5.29am on 16 July, 1945: the first ever atomic bomb is detonated. Against the desert landscape of New Mexico, the device explodes with a power equivalent to 21,000 tons of dynamite, releasing a flare of light so bright researchers said it would have been visible from Mars. The code name for this world-changing, history-making test event? Trinity. The bomb\u2019s creator, J Robert Oppenheimer, was said to have christened it thus as a tribute to the great love of his life and former mistress Jean Tatlock, with whom he shared a deep appreciation for John Donne\u2019s poetry. \u201cBatter my heart, three person\u2019d God.\u201dIt is a fascinating tidbit; one that speaks both to what kind of man Oppenheimer was and the influence that the women in his life undoubtedly had on him. And yet, this moment and others like it, do not make it into Christopher Nolan\u2019s new biopic, Oppenheimer. The three-hour epic is a tremendous film, expectedly tense and superbly acted by Cillian Murphy, who wears the physicist\u2019s signature porkpie hat and pipe as easily as his faraway gaze. Surrounding him are the many bespectacled scientists, buttoned-up politicians and gruff military personnel \u2013 all men \u2013 who played a pivotal part in his story. Largely absent, however, are the women of his life. A handful do appear \u2013 played by Florence Pugh, Emily Blunt and Louise Lombard \u2013 but their screen time is fleeting, and their importance is understated. The women of Oppenheimer are portrayed mostly as collateral damage, rather than what they were: an instrumental part of the story.Tatlock \u2013 the supposed inspiration for Trinity, herself \u2013 appears early on. Played by Florence Pugh, the character is presented as being cut from the Sylvia Plath cloth: sexually liberated, fiercely intelligent, cool in manner, and deeply troubled. It\u2019s true that, as the film portrays, Tatlock and Oppenheimer met at a Berkeley house party in the spring of 1936. She was 22; he was 10 years her senior. Born in Michigan, Tatlock came from a family of academics; her father, a Harvard-educated scholar, was an acclaimed English professor and an expert on Geoffrey Chaucer. Prior to attending Vassar College in 1931, Tatlock visited Europe, where she stayed with a friend in Switzerland who introduced her to the works of psychologist Carl Jung (her preference for Jung over Sigmund Freud is noted in Nolan\u2019s film, moments before she and Oppenheimer have sex for the first time). Tatlock went on to study psychology herself, graduating from Vassar in 1935 before going on to study at Stanford School of Medicine. It was while completing prerequisite courses in Berkeley that she met Oppenheimer at that house party. Over the years, much has been made of Tatlock\u2019s political background \u2013 she was a dues-paying member of the Communist Party of the USA. Her relationship with Oppenheimer \u2013 seen as an indicator of Oppenheimer\u2019s own political allegiances \u2013 was used as evidence against him in the security hearing of 1954, ultimately leading to the loss of his security clearance. But as Nolan\u2019s film shows, communism was flourishing in those circles at the time. It\u2019s likely that Oppenheimer would have explored the ideology with or without Tatlock; his brother and sister-in-law, plus many of his university colleagues, had belonged to the party at one point and opposed Franco in the Spanish Civil War. \u201cEven Jean\u2019s rather conservative father made donations to the ambulance corps,\u201d Patricia Klaus and Shirley Streshinsky, authors of the 2013 biography An Atomic Love Story: The Extraordinary Women in Robert Oppenheimer\u2019s Life, say over email. \u201cI think that for Jean and Oppenheimer, their shared interest in psychology was a stronger bond. And from Jean, one of their friends would later say, Oppenheimer learnt to be compassionate.\u201dThe film does depict that compassion, but also strongly suggests that there was a fervent sexual connection between the pair. In Nolan\u2019s version, their characters are often seen if not in the throes of sex then straight after the act. It\u2019s a portrayal that made Klaus uncomfortable. \u201cOppenheimer described Jean as a \u2018lyrical, yearning creature\u2019 and greatly admired her spirit and sensitivity,\u201d she says. \u201cI think from Kitty\u2019s [Oppenheimer\u2019s wife, whom he married in 1940] later comments \u2013 she said she had to teach him everything about sex, about how it could be \u2018fun\u2019 \u2013 and Jean\u2019s reluctance to marry, this indicates that their physical relationship was not the most important part of their connection.\u201d Oppenheimer proposed to Tatlock on two occasions; she declined both times.RecommendedChristopher Nolan and Cillian Murphy on Oppenheimer: \u2018Taking that risk on behalf of us all \u2013 there\u2019s nothing bigger than that\u2019Oppenheimer: The true story behind Christopher Nolan\u2019s biopic about \u2018the father of the atomic bomb\u2019Are Christopher Nolan\u2019s films right-wing? Oppenheimer finally suggests otherwiseBy the time Oppenheimer had begun working on building the atomic bomb, he only saw Tatlock on rare occasions. They met one other for a final time in June of 1943 when Oppenheimer \u2013 by then, married to Kitty and serving as the director of Los Alamos, the site where he and his team developed the atomic bomb \u2013 visited her in a clandestine trip to San Francisco, where Tatlock was working as a paediatric psychiatrist at Mount Zion hospital and undergoing psychiatric treatment for her depression. (\u201cToday, bipolar disorder might be suggested,\u201d say Klaus and Streshinsky of Tatlock\u2019s mental state at the time.)Years later, at the Atomic Energy Commission hearing that revoked the security clearance of Oppenheimer in 1954, Oppenheimer recalled how Tatlock had called him to visit because \u201cshe was still in love with me\u201d. As the film depicts, Kitty was in the room at the time of the hearing. It\u2019s not clear what happened in that final meeting between Oppenheimer and Tatlock, but Nolan\u2019s film suggests that it was there that Oppenheimer put an end to their affair once and for all. Whatever happened at that moment, Tatlock died by suicide seven months later. \u201cFor reasons of love and compassion, he had become a key member of Jean\u2019s psychological support structure \u2013 and then he had vanished, mysteriously,\u201d write Kai Bird and Martin J Sherwin write in their 2005 biography American Prometheus. \u201cIn Jean\u2019s eyes, it may have seemed as if ambition had trumped love.\u201dAs Nolan\u2019s film shows, Tatlock\u2019s romance with Oppenheimer overlapped with his marriage to Kitty, who is portrayed as ferocious (and mostly drunk) by Emily Blunt. Oppenheimer was married only once, but he was, in fact, Kitty\u2019s third husband. Born Katherine Puening, the daughter of an engineer in Recklinghausen, Germany, she moved with her family to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania when she was three years old. Later, Kitty dropped out of university and relocated to Paris, where she briefly attended the Sorbonne and the University of Grenoble. It was there where she met her first husband, a musician named Frank Ramsayer. The marriage was annulled only a few months later. That same year, after enrolling at the University of Wisconsin in 1933, she met Joseph Dallet, a communist organiser with whom she moved to Ohio. It was thanks to Dallet that Kitty found herself immersed in communism. When he left to fight in the Spanish Civil War, she wrote to him asking if she could join. Before she left for Europe, however, she learnt that Dallet had been killed in battle in 1937.Cillian Murphy as J Robert Oppenheimer and Emily Blunt as Kitty Oppenheimer in \u2018Oppenheimer' (Warner Bros)A year later, Kitty returned to college to study biology at the University of Pennsylvania. In 1939, she married Richard Harrison, a British doctor, and began pursuing graduate work in botany at UCLA. Around this time, she met Oppenheimer at a garden party. They began an affair. She visited his ranch in New Mexico, where they rode horses together. Kitty divorced Harrison in 1940 and married Oppenheimer the next day. They had a child, Peter, and moved to Los Alamos where Oppenheimer led the US efforts to make the first atomic bomb. There, Kitty briefly worked as a lab technician and also gave birth to their second child, a daughter named Katherine (known as Toni).Watch Apple TV+ free for 7 daysNew subscribers only. \u00a36.99/mo. after free trial.

She could be a sharp and cruel person, especially to other women.\u201d Between the isolation of new motherhood and that of Los Alamos, Kitty struggled with alcoholism \u2013 a focus, if not the focus, of her portrayal in the film. Speaking about her role, Blunt told The Washington Post, \u201cThe loneliness of life in Los Alamos must have just been extraordinary and I felt so deeply for this woman who was not a nice person and really rubbed people the wrong way.\u201dDespite their troubles, Kitty remained a close confidant of Oppenheimer\u2019s, even when security protocols dictated otherwise. When the Trinity test went off successfully that July morning in 1945, Kitty was at home totally cut out of the action. Oppenheimer managed to get word to her, however, by sending her a prearranged secret message: \u201cYou can change the sheets.\u201d The couple stayed together until Oppenheimer\u2019s death in 1967, after which Kitty spread his ashes in front of their home in St John in the Virgin Islands. She later moved in with her long-time family friend Robert Serber, before she died in 1972 from a pulmonary embolism. She had been in Panama City, a stop on her round-the-world sailing trip.Tatlock and Kitty were far from the only women in Oppenheimer\u2019s life. \u201cWhen we began our research we looked at all the women with whom Oppenheimer had relationships, some serious, some fleeting,\u201d say Klaus and Streshinsky. \u201cHis mother, whom he adored; Jane Didisheim, a schoolmate; Katy Page, an older woman with whom he shared his love of New Mexico; Natalie Raymond, a friend through Ruth Tolman; Charlotte Houtermans whom he met at G\u00f6ttingen; Ruth Tolman, his dearest friend.\u201d In the film, we glimpse the importance of the latter: Ruth Tolman, played by a blonde and fabulous Louise Lombard.Florence Pugh as Jean Tatlock in \u2018Oppenheimer' (Warner Bros)Another psychologist, Ruth and her mathematician husband Richard had been friends of Oppenheimer since he arrived in California in 1928 at the age of 24.\u00a0 \u201cRuth and Robert were deep and close friends for decades,\u201d Klaus and Streshinsky say. \u201cHe may have loved Kitty but on some level, he did not respect her; Ruth, he respected and admired. He relied on her for advice and the sort of comfort only a good friend can provide.\u201d One of Oppenheimer\u2019s secretaries claimed he always kept one of Tolman\u2019s letters in his pocket.Rumours of an affair between the two circulated \u2013 and are heavily hinted at in the film. In all their research, however, neither Klaus nor Streshinsky came across evidence to suggest their bond surpassed platonic. The writers say that the speculation was \u201cmost likely nasty gossip\u201d spread by Oppenheimer\u2019s peer, fellow physicist Ernest Lawrence who \u201cwith a long list of grievances \u2013 personal and professional \u2013 against Oppenheimer, relayed a rumour he had heard at a cocktail party that Ruth and Oppenheimer had been having an affair\u201d. That Kitty, \u201ca jealous person\u201d, had never indicated any reason to suspect her husband\u2019s friendship is another reason to disbelieve the rumours.

Over the years, the British-American filmmaker has become known for many things: looping chronology, head-scratching plots, epic sets, an infuriatingly mercurial sound mix. Writing women has never been on that list. On Friday, as the clock ticked down to the release of Oppenheimer, not one person in the cinema had likely purchased their ticket believing that the film they were about to see would feature any prolonged insight into a woman\u2019s mind.

If Barbie amasses its projected amount, the only film ahead of it in the opening weekend history books will be 2019\u2019s Avengers: Endgame.While Oppenheimer, Christopher Nolan\u2019s three-hour epic about the man who designed the atomic bomb, is settling for second, it\u2019s a surefire hit in its own right.The biographical drama has achieved a better opening weekend than most franchise films, outperforming Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny in its opening weekend last month. Its current takings are projected to sit at approximately $180m (\u00a3140m).RecommendedChristopher Nolan and Cillian Murphy on Oppenheimer: \u2018Taking that risk on behalf of us all \u2013 there\u2019s nothing bigger than that\u2019Barbie vs Oppenheimer: Both films smash expectations as box office frontrunner emergesOppenheimer review: Clever, imaginative and Christopher Nolan at his bestIn fact, Oppenheimer is Christopher Nolan\u2019s third-biggest opening to date, behind The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises.

The film\u2019s release has invigorated fan interest in Gerwig\u2019s career, which includes the Oscar-nominated coming-of-age films Lady Bird and Little Women, both starring Saoirse Ronan and Timothee Chalamet.Before she rose to greater acclaim as a director, Gerwig also acted in projects including Noah Baumbach\u2019s comedy-drama Greenberg in 2010, and in the title role of his 2013 film Frances Ha, which she co-wrote. Off the back of these critical hits, Gerwig was cast in a spinoff of the hit comedy series How I Met Your Mother, which intended to follow a woman named Sophie (Gerwig) as she recounts the story of how she met her son\u2019s dad.

It may get as bad as the infamous 1985 strike, though I hope not,\u201d he said.There were a number of Hollywood strikes in the Eighties. The most notable came in 1988, when in a fight over residual payments for TV shows broadcast in foreign countries, there was a 22-week strike by writers, the longest walkout by the WGA in film industry history.RecommendedMission: Impossible struggles at box office against record-breaking might of BarbenheimerMargot Robbie cast Rob Brydon \u2018as a priority\u2019 in BarbieTerry Crews praised for brushing off awkward Martin Brundle interview momentMartin also told fans that his \u201coverall deal with HBO was suspended\u201d on 1 June, but he still has \u201cplenty\u201d to busy himself with.He added that \u201cthese strikes are not really about name writers or producers or showrunners, most of whom are fine; we\u2019re striking for the entry-level writers, the story editors, the students hoping to break in, the actor who has four lines, the guy working his first staff job who dreams of creating his own show one day, as I did back in the Eighties\u201d.Martin reassured fans that all scripts forHouse of the Dragon season two, the hit Game of Thrones prequel series, \u201chad been finished months before the WGA strike began\u201d.\u201c[House of the Dragon] is shot mostly in London (and a little bit in Wales, Spain, and various other locations), which is why filming has continued,\u201d Martin wrote.Watch Apple TV+ free for 7 daysNew subscribers only. \u00a36.99/mo. after free trial.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeWe meet Dreaming Whilst Black\u2019s hero Kwabena in an unenviable position. He\u2019s been invited to a meeting with bigwigs in the film industry who are interested in his short film idea. Finally, he thinks, a break! This could be that thing to finally put him on the road to making his filmmaking dreams a reality\u2026 but, sadly, the meeting clashes with his soul-sucking day job. Though it keeps a roof above his head, working in recruitment feels closer to a nightmare. But what good are dreams if you can\u2019t afford to live? This six-part comedy explores the struggles of being a Black creative trying to \u201cmake it\u201d, and the practicalities of having a nine-to-five job are just one part of the battle. There are offensive microaggressions. Housing worries. Dating pitfalls. And a potent examination of how privilege and connections mean that others have a headstart, whether they have talent or not. Dreaming Whilst Black is also delightfully original and laugh-out-loud funny. The series is the brainchild of the 34-year-old Jamaican-British writer and director Adjani Salmon, who plays Kwabena. He nurtured the idea from its start as a web show, to its Bafta-winning pilot, to its now serial run on BBC Three. It\u2019s not a documentary, but according to Salmon, it might as well be. \u201cThe show kept writing itself,\u201d he explains. \u201cSometimes I\u2019m in certain conversations and I\u2019m thinking, \u2018Do you know I write a show about the industry? Why would you do this in front of me, of all people?\u2019 I feel like it very much mirrors our experience. It\u2019s the same s***! Sometimes, we\u2019re really in the twilight zone.\u201d Salmon is speaking to me with castmate Dani Moseley over Zoom, weeks before Dreaming Whilst Black finally makes its full series debut. Their excitement is palpable: this has been a long time coming. After graduating from his masters programme at west London\u2019s MetFilm School in 2015, Salmon expected to dive headfirst into a filmmaking career. He directed the short, His Father\u2019s Son, which was praised by audiences when it played at festivals. And after that\u2026 not much. \u201cNo agent, nothing,\u201d he recalls. \u201cSo then I was like, damn, I need to make another short film.\u201d But as he began figuring out how to do it, the trailer for the first season of Insecure dropped online in 2016. An adaptation of Issa Rae\u2019s popular web series Awkward Black Girl, Insecure was a proper, glossy HBO show that was about to be seen by millions.\u201cI was like, \u2018Oh! That was a web series!\u2019\u201d Along with Kayode Ewumi\u2019s meme-making YouTube show HoodDocumentary, and the much-loved web series Ackee & Saltfish by Cecile Emeke, Salmon realised that the way to creating projects that would reach people wasn\u2019t to wait on the industry to give him a chance \u2013 it was to go ahead and produce his own work. \u201cI was like, \u2018Online is the ting!\u2019\u201d Salmon says with a hearty laugh. \u201cLike, yo \u2013 I\u2019m trying to do this festival ting. Why am I knocking at the gate? These guys are online building a whole empire.\u201dRecommended\u2018Every second counts\u2019: From The Bear to Industry, why workplace culture makes for brilliant TV drama\u2018Unbeknown to him, he was narrating what was being done to him\u2019: How The Sixth Commandment brought a harrowing British case to the screenThe Great is the anti-Bridgerton \u2013 and thank God for thatThe web series Dreaming Whilst Black launched in 2018. In 2021, a TV series pilot aired on BBC Three. The following year came the Bafta Craft Award for \u201cemerging talent: fiction\u201d, along with the full series backing of A24, the production company behind Euphoria, The Idol and Beef. In one scene, a voice on a podcast says \u201cfilmmaking is a long game and you have to be resilient\u201d \u2013 a message Salmon and Moseley know deeply. As Amy, Moseley is a key part of the Dreaming Whilst Black tale, and has been since the web series. As well as helping to move Kwabena\u2019s burgeoning career forward with her low-level job at a film agency, Amy has her own dreams too \u2013 none of which involve doing the hourly tea and coffee run, or swerving the hand of an over-friendly colleague who tries to touch her hair.Having studied producing at university, Moseley also expected the road to getting a fulfilling job in film to be easier than it was. \u201cNobody told me I\u2019d have to be a runner, a receptionist, make loads of teas for years before getting to producer level,\u201d she says. \u201cThe rug was pulled from me, I was like, \u2018It\u2019s all lies!\u2019\u201d Moseley couldn\u2019t afford to work low-paid jobs in the industry until it was time to move up, so she took a job in finance despite caring little for it. Like Amy, she experienced frustration working in a corporate environment that not only flattened her creativity but tried to place her identity into ill-fitting boxes.\u201cWorking in finance, I learnt that as a Black woman, I\u2019m not [seen as] assertive. I\u2019m either passive, or aggressive. Once, someone was telling a story about something I\u2019d done, and they added in: \u2018Dani was like\u2026\u2019\u201d She makes a stereotypical motion of swishing her head from side-to-side and wagging her finger. \u201cI didn\u2019t do that!\u201d Still, her ex-colleague insisted she had, and wondered how he could\u2019ve conjured that image if not. \u201cMaybe from the TV?

To combat this, Dreaming Whilst Black has consciously made Blackness its default. Salmon printed a handy reminder at the front of every script. \u201c\u2018Unless otherwise stated, every character is Black.\u2019 Just so that everybody else knows that when we write \u2018Amy, 28\u2019, she\u2019s Black,\u201d he says firmly. \u201cIf she\u2019s white, we\u2019re gonna tell you that she\u2019s white.\u201dFor Salmon, who was born in the UK and moved to Jamaica aged five before coming back for university, that was already a given. \u201cWhen I was in Jamaica, I used to technically make \u2018Black films\u2019 \u2013 but in Jamaica, it\u2019s just a film,\u201d Salmon says. \u201cThere\u2019s an idea that in this country, we\u2019re \u2018other\u2019. But actually, that depends on the lens. For most Black people in this country, especially in London, Blackness actually is your centre.\u201d It was important for Salmon that Dreaming Whilst Black\u2019s characters didn\u2019t consider themselves a minority \u2013 Kwabena, Amy and their friends are the norm. Being on a set with this so deeply in mind was a cherished experience for Moseley. With makeup artists and hairstylists that understood the products and techniques she required, the actor automatically felt at ease. \u201cIt was the first time on set where I didn\u2019t have to worry about my hair, or my makeup,\u201d Moseley explains. \u201cI got to sit in the chair and have a chat with the other actors, and the hair and makeup people, and not have to be watching what they\u2019re doing.\u201d For once, she was able to think about the job at hand, rather than monitoring how she was going to look on camera \u2013 an extra form of labour that Black performers often face. \u201cI know I\u2019m a form of representation every time I go on to the screen, so I want to feel comfortable,\u201d Moseley continues. \u201cI want to be thinking about my emotional journey, not the fact that my hair is starting to get frizzy because someone put the wrong gel in it.\u201d Now that Dreaming Whilst Black is finally about to get the mainstream attention it deserves, Salmon and Moseley can look at the journey and share some wisdom for other dreamers in creative fields. And for both, it all comes back to resilience. \u201cWe\u2019re here because of staying power,\u201d Salmon notes. \u201cIt can\u2019t all be fast; sometimes you have to go slow. Sometimes you wake up and write one page. But it\u2019s a step forward.\u201dRecommendedWorld On Fire viewers are \u2018distraught\u2019 by an incredibly predictable \u2018twist\u2019Reporter suffers amusing technical glitch during live reportKathy Burke shuts down Gimme Gimme Gimme reboot rumours in the most Kathy Burke wayAnd a good dose of individuality doesn\u2019t hurt, either. \u201cEqually, I think it\u2019s important to find your own voice, and what you want to say,\u201d he continues. \u201cBecause no one can be better than you.

It earned $98mm at the international box office, bringing its global takings to $180m.While Oppenheimer\u2019s critical ratings have blown past Barbie with a near-perfect Rotten Tomato score, the latter, which stars Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, has surpassed the Cillian Murphy-starring biopic\u2019s box office takings.

Even in a time where intimacy coorindators are a regular presence on set, things don\u2019t always go exactly to plan.Here are some of the biggest on-set mishaps in film and TV:Margot Robbie \u2013 The Wolf of Wall Street (Appian Way/Paramount/Kobal/Shutterstock)The actor says that acting in the scene where she has sex with Leonardo DiCaprio on a bed of money was really painful in The Wolf of Wall Street. \u201cI got a million paper cuts on my back from all that money! It\u2019s not as glamorous as it sounds,\u201d she said. \u201cIf anyone is ever planning on having sex on top of a pile of cash: don\u2019t. Or maybe real money is a bit softer, but the fake money is like paper, and when I got up off the bed, I turned around to get my robe and everyone gasped. I said, \u2018What is it?\u2019 And they said, \u2018You look like you\u2019ve been whipped a million times. Your back is covered in a thousand red scratches.\u201dVarious cast \u2013 Jaws 2During the filming of the sequel to Steven Spielberg\u2019s Jaws, cast members were terrified when real hammerhead sharks started circling them in the sea. The trouble was that their screams went unheard. The crew didn\u2019t think they were in real danger to start with because it was written into the script that they yelled for help at that point.Sylvester Stallone and Dolph Lundgren \u2013 Rocky IVThe fourth in the Rocky film franchise to focus on the boxing career of the fictional Rocky Balboa, played by Sylvester Stallone, has some gripping and authentic-looking fight scenes. It\u2019s no wonder then that during filming, Stallone actually asked Dolph Lundgren, who plays his opponent, Ivan Drago, to try to knock him out for real. But Lundgren hit him with such force that he was sent to the hospital and was in intensive care for over a week.Marlon Brando \u2013 The GodfatherMarlon Brando in The Godfather  (Paramount/Kobal/Shutterstock)Brando was infamous for his bad on-set behaviour. That is one reason why Paramount was nervous about getting him involved in Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s mafia film. It didn\u2019t start well, when on the first day of shooting, the actor who played the patriarch in the family, Vito Corleone, missed his overnight flight from LA to New York. His scene was rescheduled for the next day, but it cost producers $40,000.Gucci Mane \u2013 Spring BreakersIn his autobiography, rapper Gucci Mane said he was so tired on set of Harmony Korine\u2019s crime film Spring Breakers, that he fell asleep during his big sex scene. The rapper, who plays Big Arch, a rival drug dealer of James Franco\u2019s Alien character in the film, is seen having sex with one woman, while another sucks his toes. \u201cI couldn\u2019t keep my eyes open. I was knocked out, snoring .\u2009.\u2009. Harmony kept having to wake me up for takes.\u201d In another interview, he explained why he was so exhausted. \u201cI had a concert down there in St Petersburg, Florida, one of the days I had to shoot a scene. Same night. We started shooting at 10 o\u2019clock in the evening until 1 or 2 o\u2019clock.\u201dTom Cruise \u2013 Mission: Impossible \u2013 Fallout (Paramount Pictures)The action star broke his ankle while doing his own stunt on set of the sixth Mission Impossible. The scene sees Cruise completing a fast rooftop jump from one building to another, when his foot slams into the side of the wall.

Dobrev, who plays Elena Gilbert, falls in love with the good-natured vampire Stefan Salvatore (Wesley) in the supernatural teen drama TV series. But they certainly weren\u2019t expecting any injuries at work that day.

But a misunderstanding on Russell\u2019s part led to an expensive mistake. The valuable guitar was meant to be swapped over with a replica prop when he snatched it from her. Russell had not read the memo, though, and smashed the antique guitar against a wall, while shouting \u201cMusic time is over\u201d. As a result, the Martin Museum \u2013 which called the guitar a \u201cpriceless, irreplaceable artefact\u201d \u2013 vowed never to loan guitars out to movies again.Robert Pattinson and Julianne Moore \u2013 Maps to the StarsThe Twilight and Lost City of Z actor played Jerome, a limousine driver and struggling actor, in David Cronenberg\u2019s acerbic Hollywood satire.

The model ship was, however, museum quality and according to Olmos, who had no idea at the time, it was worth roughly $200,000.Allison Janney and Michael Lerner in Life During WartimeDuring a sex scene against a wall for this 2009 comedy-drama, Allison Jamey\u2019s co-star Michael Lerner went crashing to the ground. \u201cWe had to have sex up against a wall and they started spraying us with glistening stuff to make us look sweaty, but no one seemed to realise that we were standing on a marble floor,\u201d she said. \u201cThey said \u2018Action\u2019 and he pulled me up against the wall and his feet slipped out from under him and he went crashing down on the floor.

Not just from this movie, but from every other movie I\u2019ve done.\u201dSean Connery and Lana Turner \u2013 Another Time, Another PlaceSean Connery and the American actress Lana Turner were famously filming a love scene for Another Time, Another Place when Turner\u2019s gangster boyfriend Johnny Stompanato showed up uninvited. Turner was playing an American journalist who has a love affair with a BBC war correspondent (played by Connery). But her real-life boyfriend was so jealous that he showed up with a gun in his hand, and threatened to kill Connery. Bravely, Connery grabbed the gun from his hand and twisted the boyfriend\u2019s wrist until he fled off the set. Turner\u2019s turbulent life continued when her daughter Cheryl killed Stompanato with a kitchen knife, fearing that he was going to kill her mother after he showed up at their house in the US. In the trial it was deemed as justifiable homicide.Christian Serratos and Michael Cudlitz - The Walking DeadThe long-running TV show The Walking Dead focuses more on blood and violence than sex. But during one scene between Rosita (Christian Serratos) and Abraham (Michael Cudlitz) things nearly went pear-shaped when they had to get intimate in front of 30 crew members, who were drinking coffee and eating ramen noodles. Cudlitz, who was on top of Serratos, said they were nearly naked but covered \u2013 but then as they were \u201chumping\u201d, the cover got knocked off, leaving Serratos practically naked. The actor said: \u201cThen we just started laughing, because it\u2019s ridiculous. It\u2019s two people, we barely know each other, lying on top of each other naked.\u201dMel Brooks - Blazing SaddlesMel Brooks  (2017 Invision)During the filming of Blazing Saddles, a man wandered into a scene of the film. He wasn\u2019t part of the crew or cast, but when the director Mel Brooks got the man moved on, he returned again, seemingly not understanding the request. Brooks then sent over a waiver for him to sign and left him in the movie for a laugh. He can be spotted at the end of the film wearing a jumper and standing on a sidewalk watching the action as people run out of the Warner Brothers studio front gates.Christopher Mintz-Plasse - SuperbadNot really a mishap, but it was certainly an awkward moment behind the camera for the then 17-year-old actor Christopher Mintz-Plasse, who legally had to have his mother on set for his first-ever sex scene in Suberbad. \u201cShe got there, and I had fake sexual intercourse in front of her,\u201d Mintz-Plasse said. \u201cAfterwards we didn\u2019t talk about it; we still don\u2019t speak about that moment.\u201dSylvester Stallone and Sharon Stone \u2013 The SpecialistStallone and Stone had absolutely no chemistry in the 1994 American spy thriller The Specialist, but when the Basic Instinct star refused to get naked for the shower scene, it was potentially a huge problem. Stallone admitted they had to get drunk on vodka for filming to even start. \u201cOk. Let it be known, I didn\u2019t want this scene because Sharon was not cooperating. We get to the set and she decided not to take off her robe off. The director asks only a few of the crew to remain, and she still won\u2019t take it off. I promised her I wouldn\u2019t take any liberties, so what\u2019s the problem? She said, \u2018I\u2019m just sick of nudity.\u2019 I asked her if she could get sick of it on somebody else\u2019s film. She was having none of it, so I went down to my trailer, bought back a bottle of Black Death vodka that was given to me by Michael Douglas and after half-a-dozen shots we were wet and wild.\u201dMargot Robbie and Alexander Skarsgard \u2013 The Legend of TarzanMargot Robbie and Alexander Skarsgard in \u2018The Legend of Tarzan\u2019 Apparently Robbie \u2013 who plays Jane - punched her Tarzan co-star Skarsgard after getting carried away during the filming of their climatic sex scene. The director David Yates asked them to be a little more violently passionate. \u201cI didn\u2019t injure Alexander,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t punch him in the face, at least not hard. But he\u2019s a pretty strong guy. He can take it. We just got carried away a bit.\u201dHenry Cavill \u2013 The TudorsCavill says he had to \u201capologise profusely\u201d after he got aroused on set for The Tudors, adding that \u201cIt had only happened to him once\u201d. \u201cA girl had to be on top of me, she had spectacular breasts and I hadn\u2019t rearranged my stuff into a harmless position. She\u2019s basically rubbing herself all over me and, um, it got a bit hard.\u201d He claimed there was nothing sexy about onscreen sex scenes. \u201cAll you\u2019re doing is smacking your nuts against someone and nothing is going in.\u201d But he added: \u201cIt\u2019s not great when you\u2019re in a professional acting environment and somebody gets a boner, is it?\u201dJesse Metcalfe \u2013 Desperate HousewivesIt\u2019s not just Henry Cavill who got aroused during filming a sex scene. Metcalfe, who played John Rowland, experienced the same issue during his first onscreen sex scene with Eva Longoria\u2019s Gabrielle Solis in Desperate Housewives. He said: \u201cWe were rehearsing and then the director was like, \u2018OK, get out of bed, we have to reset the set\u2019, and I was like, \u2018I need a minute.\u2019\u201c He added: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t happen that frequently\u201d because \u201dthere are a lot of people on set, and it can be very technical, but it happens from time to time.\u201dChristopher Guest and Cary Elwes \u2013 The Princess BrideCary Elwes and Robin Wright in the cult 1987 classic 'The Princess Bride' (\u00a9\u00a0Lionsgate)When you see the dashing Westley (Cary Elwes) fall to the ground unconscious during a fight scene in Rob Reiner\u2019s The Princess Bride, it really happened. Christopher Guest, who was playing Count Tyrone Rugen, knocked Elwes out by accident, when he hit him on the head with the butt of his sword. Elwes also broke his toe during the first week of filming when he was \u201cmessing around\u201d between scenes on co-star Andre the Giant\u2019s all-terrain vehicle. But the actor, who was in his first major role, hid the injury for the rest of the film as best he could. \u201cI was limping a bit, you can see it in some of the scenes \u2013 you can see that I was limping into the fire swamp (during a scene with Robin Wright).\u201dJohn Malkovich \u2013 Being John MalkovichMalkovich was filming the scene in Being John Malkovich in which he storms off, after he discovers Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) has been renting out his brain to strangers. According to the director, Spike Jonze, a drunk extra then threw a beer can from a moving car at his head while shouting \u201cHey Malkovich, think fast!\u201d Jonze liked the scene so much that he left it in the film. The extra had his day rate bumped up to $700 a day because he had a speaking role.Viggo Mortensen \u2013 The Lord of the Rings (New Line Cinema)When Aragon (Mortensen) thinks that two of the hobbits are dead in a scene in The Two Towers, he lets out a gigantic primeval cry as he kicks his helmet in anger and falls to the floor. This behaviour would seem like an appropriate response to the grief his character feels but in reality, the actor had actually broken two toes while kicking his helmet.The entire cast of RoarWhatever the mishap, nothing can surely be as bad as it was on set for director Noel Marshall\u2019s family, who were cast in his 1981 adventure comedy film Roar. During filming, his then wife Tippi Hedren, her daughter, Melanie Griffith, and Marshall\u2019s two sons, John and Jerry, were mauled by lions. Hedren suffered multiple scalp wounds while Marshall was bitten so many times, he ended up hospitalised with gangrene."}, {"_id": "64bef84551ac33362ba19bec", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/movie-accidents-set-mistakes-mishaps-b2326292.html", "primaryCategory": "News", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018I got whiplash\u2019: 30 times things went terribly wrong on set", "lead": "<p>On-set incidents can be hilarious, embarrassing, or just plain dangerous.

Even in a time where intimacy coorindators are a regular presence on set, things don\u2019t always go exactly to plan.Here are some of the biggest on-set mishaps in film and TV:Margot Robbie \u2013 The Wolf of Wall Street (Appian Way/Paramount/Kobal/Shutterstock)The actor says that acting in the scene where she has sex with Leonardo DiCaprio on a bed of money was really painful in The Wolf of Wall Street. \u201cI got a million paper cuts on my back from all that money! It\u2019s not as glamorous as it sounds,\u201d she said. \u201cIf anyone is ever planning on having sex on top of a pile of cash: don\u2019t. Or maybe real money is a bit softer, but the fake money is like paper, and when I got up off the bed, I turned around to get my robe and everyone gasped. I said, \u2018What is it?\u2019 And they said, \u2018You look like you\u2019ve been whipped a million times. Your back is covered in a thousand red scratches.\u201dVarious cast \u2013 Jaws 2During the filming of the sequel to Steven Spielberg\u2019s Jaws, cast members were terrified when real hammerhead sharks started circling them in the sea. The trouble was that their screams went unheard. The crew didn\u2019t think they were in real danger to start with because it was written into the script that they yelled for help at that point.Sylvester Stallone and Dolph Lundgren \u2013 Rocky IVThe fourth in the Rocky film franchise to focus on the boxing career of the fictional Rocky Balboa, played by Sylvester Stallone, has some gripping and authentic-looking fight scenes. It\u2019s no wonder then that during filming, Stallone actually asked Dolph Lundgren, who plays his opponent, Ivan Drago, to try to knock him out for real. But Lundgren hit him with such force that he was sent to the hospital and was in intensive care for over a week.Marlon Brando \u2013 The GodfatherMarlon Brando in The Godfather  (Paramount/Kobal/Shutterstock)Brando was infamous for his bad on-set behaviour. That is one reason why Paramount was nervous about getting him involved in Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s mafia film. It didn\u2019t start well, when on the first day of shooting, the actor who played the patriarch in the family, Vito Corleone, missed his overnight flight from LA to New York. His scene was rescheduled for the next day, but it cost producers $40,000.Gucci Mane \u2013 Spring BreakersIn his autobiography, rapper Gucci Mane said he was so tired on set of Harmony Korine\u2019s crime film Spring Breakers, that he fell asleep during his big sex scene. The rapper, who plays Big Arch, a rival drug dealer of James Franco\u2019s Alien character in the film, is seen having sex with one woman, while another sucks his toes. \u201cI couldn\u2019t keep my eyes open. I was knocked out, snoring .\u2009.\u2009. Harmony kept having to wake me up for takes.\u201d In another interview, he explained why he was so exhausted. \u201cI had a concert down there in St Petersburg, Florida, one of the days I had to shoot a scene.

He said: \u201cI knew instantly my ankle was broken and I really didn\u2019t want to do it again so just got up and carried on with the take. I said, \u2018It\u2019s broken. That\u2019s a wrap.

It was terrible, but it was one of those moments I\u2019ll never forget.\u201dRyan Reynolds and Olivia Wilde in The Change-UpRyan Reynolds starred with Olivia Wilde in \u2018The Change Up\u2019  (Getty Images)The Deadpool star was so taken aback when his co-star Olivia Wilde painted smiley faces on her underwear during a sex scene, that he completely forgot what he was doing. \u201cIn the scene, she\u2019s sitting there and I take her top off and the bra off, and she has those panties on, but she\u2019s drawn these adorable little smiley faces on them,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I forget every line. Not just from this movie, but from every other movie I\u2019ve done.\u201dSean Connery and Lana Turner \u2013 Another Time, Another PlaceSean Connery and the American actress Lana Turner were famously filming a love scene for Another Time, Another Place when Turner\u2019s gangster boyfriend Johnny Stompanato showed up uninvited. Turner was playing an American journalist who has a love affair with a BBC war correspondent (played by Connery). But her real-life boyfriend was so jealous that he showed up with a gun in his hand, and threatened to kill Connery. Bravely, Connery grabbed the gun from his hand and twisted the boyfriend\u2019s wrist until he fled off the set. Turner\u2019s turbulent life continued when her daughter Cheryl killed Stompanato with a kitchen knife, fearing that he was going to kill her mother after he showed up at their house in the US. In the trial it was deemed as justifiable homicide.Christian Serratos and Michael Cudlitz - The Walking DeadThe long-running TV show The Walking Dead focuses more on blood and violence than sex. But during one scene between Rosita (Christian Serratos) and Abraham (Michael Cudlitz) things nearly went pear-shaped when they had to get intimate in front of 30 crew members, who were drinking coffee and eating ramen noodles. Cudlitz, who was on top of Serratos, said they were nearly naked but covered \u2013 but then as they were \u201chumping\u201d, the cover got knocked off, leaving Serratos practically naked. The actor said: \u201cThen we just started laughing, because it\u2019s ridiculous. It\u2019s two people, we barely know each other, lying on top of each other naked.\u201dMel Brooks - Blazing SaddlesMel Brooks  (2017 Invision)During the filming of Blazing Saddles, a man wandered into a scene of the film. He wasn\u2019t part of the crew or cast, but when the director Mel Brooks got the man moved on, he returned again, seemingly not understanding the request. Brooks then sent over a waiver for him to sign and left him in the movie for a laugh. He can be spotted at the end of the film wearing a jumper and standing on a sidewalk watching the action as people run out of the Warner Brothers studio front gates.Christopher Mintz-Plasse - SuperbadNot really a mishap, but it was certainly an awkward moment behind the camera for the then 17-year-old actor Christopher Mintz-Plasse, who legally had to have his mother on set for his first-ever sex scene in Suberbad. \u201cShe got there, and I had fake sexual intercourse in front of her,\u201d Mintz-Plasse said. \u201cAfterwards we didn\u2019t talk about it; we still don\u2019t speak about that moment.\u201dSylvester Stallone and Sharon Stone \u2013 The SpecialistStallone and Stone had absolutely no chemistry in the 1994 American spy thriller The Specialist, but when the Basic Instinct star refused to get naked for the shower scene, it was potentially a huge problem. Stallone admitted they had to get drunk on vodka for filming to even start. \u201cOk. Let it be known, I didn\u2019t want this scene because Sharon was not cooperating. We get to the set and she decided not to take off her robe off. The director asks only a few of the crew to remain, and she still won\u2019t take it off. I promised her I wouldn\u2019t take any liberties, so what\u2019s the problem? She said, \u2018I\u2019m just sick of nudity.\u2019 I asked her if she could get sick of it on somebody else\u2019s film. She was having none of it, so I went down to my trailer, bought back a bottle of Black Death vodka that was given to me by Michael Douglas and after half-a-dozen shots we were wet and wild.\u201dMargot Robbie and Alexander Skarsgard \u2013 The Legend of TarzanMargot Robbie and Alexander Skarsgard in \u2018The Legend of Tarzan\u2019 Apparently Robbie \u2013 who plays Jane - punched her Tarzan co-star Skarsgard after getting carried away during the filming of their climatic sex scene. The director David Yates asked them to be a little more violently passionate. \u201cI didn\u2019t injure Alexander,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t punch him in the face, at least not hard. But he\u2019s a pretty strong guy. He can take it. We just got carried away a bit.\u201dHenry Cavill \u2013 The TudorsCavill says he had to \u201capologise profusely\u201d after he got aroused on set for The Tudors, adding that \u201cIt had only happened to him once\u201d. \u201cA girl had to be on top of me, she had spectacular breasts and I hadn\u2019t rearranged my stuff into a harmless position. She\u2019s basically rubbing herself all over me and, um, it got a bit hard.\u201d He claimed there was nothing sexy about onscreen sex scenes. \u201cAll you\u2019re doing is smacking your nuts against someone and nothing is going in.\u201d But he added: \u201cIt\u2019s not great when you\u2019re in a professional acting environment and somebody gets a boner, is it?\u201dJesse Metcalfe \u2013 Desperate HousewivesIt\u2019s not just Henry Cavill who got aroused during filming a sex scene. Metcalfe, who played John Rowland, experienced the same issue during his first onscreen sex scene with Eva Longoria\u2019s Gabrielle Solis in Desperate Housewives. He said: \u201cWe were rehearsing and then the director was like, \u2018OK, get out of bed, we have to reset the set\u2019, and I was like, \u2018I need a minute.\u2019\u201c He added: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t happen that frequently\u201d because \u201dthere are a lot of people on set, and it can be very technical, but it happens from time to time.\u201dChristopher Guest and Cary Elwes \u2013 The Princess BrideCary Elwes and Robin Wright in the cult 1987 classic 'The Princess Bride' (\u00a9\u00a0Lionsgate)When you see the dashing Westley (Cary Elwes) fall to the ground unconscious during a fight scene in Rob Reiner\u2019s The Princess Bride, it really happened. Christopher Guest, who was playing Count Tyrone Rugen, knocked Elwes out by accident, when he hit him on the head with the butt of his sword. Elwes also broke his toe during the first week of filming when he was \u201cmessing around\u201d between scenes on co-star Andre the Giant\u2019s all-terrain vehicle. But the actor, who was in his first major role, hid the injury for the rest of the film as best he could. \u201cI was limping a bit, you can see it in some of the scenes \u2013 you can see that I was limping into the fire swamp (during a scene with Robin Wright).\u201dJohn Malkovich \u2013 Being John MalkovichMalkovich was filming the scene in Being John Malkovich in which he storms off, after he discovers Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) has been renting out his brain to strangers. According to the director, Spike Jonze, a drunk extra then threw a beer can from a moving car at his head while shouting \u201cHey Malkovich, think fast!\u201d Jonze liked the scene so much that he left it in the film. The extra had his day rate bumped up to $700 a day because he had a speaking role.Viggo Mortensen \u2013 The Lord of the Rings (New Line Cinema)When Aragon (Mortensen) thinks that two of the hobbits are dead in a scene in The Two Towers, he lets out a gigantic primeval cry as he kicks his helmet in anger and falls to the floor. This behaviour would seem like an appropriate response to the grief his character feels but in reality, the actor had actually broken two toes while kicking his helmet.The entire cast of RoarWhatever the mishap, nothing can surely be as bad as it was on set for director Noel Marshall\u2019s family, who were cast in his 1981 adventure comedy film Roar. During filming, his then wife Tippi Hedren, her daughter, Melanie Griffith, and Marshall\u2019s two sons, John and Jerry, were mauled by lions. Hedren suffered multiple scalp wounds while Marshall was bitten so many times, he ended up hospitalised with gangrene."}, {"_id": "64bef84551ac33362ba19bed", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/terry-crews-f1-martin-brundle-interview-b2380452.html", "primaryCategory": "News", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Terry Crews praised for brushing off awkward Martin Brundle interview moment", "lead": "<p>F1 host\u2019s chat with \u2018Brooklyn Nine-Nine\u2019 star came to strangely abrupt end </p>", "author": "Jacob Stolworthy", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 05:35:09", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:16:37.265141", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-24T05:35:09+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/23/16/newFile-3.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free IndyArts newsletter for all the latest entertainment news and reviewsSign up to our free IndyArts newsletter\n\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeBritish travellers will only choose to go on holiday by train if major steps are taken by the government to \u201cwean millions of passengers off highly polluting flights\u201d, Greenpeace has said.Speaking to The Independent, the campaign group said that the \u201cheatwaves across Europe are just the latest reminder of an escalating climate crisis\u201d.But as reported last week, new analysis shows choosing to swap flying for rail travel to go on a European holiday will cost an average of four times more, with the UK among the worst countries when it comes to offering affordable train fares.Of the more than 100 routes researched, the Barcelona-London train was the most expensive, costing 10 times as much as flying \u2013 and sometimes as much as 30 times more. The report found plane tickets ranging from \u20ac12.99 to \u20ac80.60, while researchers were unable to find train tickets for less than \u20ac300.In 2019, 3.36 million people flew between Barcelona and London, making it the third most-used short-haul flight route in Europe with a rail alternative.RecommendedWhy do heatwaves in the UK feel hotter than abroad?The startling and grim discoveries unearthed by the climate crisisEarth\u2019s CO2 hits highest recorded level in human historyThe average cost of reaching the capital of Slovakia, Bratislava, from the UK was almost seven times more expensive by train than flying; it\u2019s a similar story to reach London from Marseille, or to reach Cologne from Manchester.The smallest disparity on the routes analysed was a domestic journey from Edinburgh to London, though the cost of the journey by rail was still almost twice as much as flying.Glasgow-London was the only domestic route where the train was cheaper on two out of six days analysed; on average, the train is twice as expensive as the more polluting flight.View moreGreenpeace\u2019s report describes the UK as \u201ca hotspot for climate-wrecking low-cost carriers\u201d. Even bosses at Network Rail \u2013 the public body which owns most of the UK\u2019s railway network \u2013 splashed out \u00a310,000 a week on air fares last year because it worked out cheaper than getting the train.Paul Morozzo, transport campaigner for Greenpeace UK, told The Independent that, while he understood people need to go on holiday, travellers are \u201cvirtually forced\u201d to fly due to \u201ctax breaks for aviation and overpriced trains\u201d.He said: \u201cAir passenger numbers have almost bounced back to pre-pandemic levels and greenhouse gas emissions from the aviation sector are set to soar in future years. This is the inevitable outcome of government policies that refuse to tax airlines VAT or for the energy they use, and have even slashed Air Passenger Duty on domestic flights.\u201cAirlines are getting a free pass to pollute and price-conscious consumers in a cost of living crisis are left with little choice. Meanwhile the government is losing out on an estimated \u00a34.7bn in tax revenue each year.\u201dMr Morozzo suggests banning short-haul flights where a decent rail link exists \u2013 something that France has recently attempted to introduce \u2013 and introduce what he calls a \u201cfairer tax system\u201d that \u201cstops penalising rail travel\u201d.The grounding of private jets has also been put forward, as well as a frequent-flier levy that Greenpeace UK believes would deter those who regularly fly.\u201cPeople need to get off planes and out of cars onto trains. The UK government should introduce a policy to guarantee the price of train tickets is held below that of more polluting travel options. Heatwaves across Europe are just the latest reminder of an escalating climate crisis. It\u2019s time for the government to rapidly align transport policy with its vital goal of reducing carbon emissions.\u201dAirlines UK, the trade body for UK-registered airlines, said that its members would pay nearly \u00a34bn into the Treasury this year through Air Passenger Duty, and that the removal of free allowances through the Emissions Trading Scheme from 2026 will raise up to \u00a34bn extra over the next decade, in addition to the hundreds of millions of pounds they are already paying annually.RecommendedMore rail disruption as union announces new August overtime ban for train driversMore than two million expected to head overseas for summer getaway despite heatwavePassengers only offered $12 food voucher during 30-hour flight delay\u201cCarriers are investing billions in decarbonisation projects and are fully committed to net zero emissions by 2050, through sustainable aviation fuels, hydrogen and other zero emission technologies, a fully modernised UK airspace and carbon removals,\u201d a spokesperson for Airlines UK told The Independent. \u201cPricing people out of air travel and stopping them seeing family and friends or taking a well deserved holiday is not the answer to our carbon challenge.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64bef84651ac33362ba19bf0", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/greece-fires-holidays-flights-rhodes-corfu-b2380676.html", "primaryCategory": "News &amp; Advice", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Wildfires: Is it safe to travel to Greece right now?", "lead": "<p>Travellers on package holidays enjoy better consumer protection than people who have booked flight-only deals </p>", "author": "Simon Calder", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 17:16:57", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:16:38.090600", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-24T17:16:57+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/22/21/SEI165098040.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Simon Calder\u2019s free travel email for expert advice and money-saving discountsGet Simon Calder\u2019s Travel email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeUK airlines are continuing to sell flights for immediate departure from the UK to Rhodes despite the wildfires that have seen thousands of tourists evacuated from the island. The UK\u2019s two biggest tour operators, Jet2 and Tui, have cancelled all flights and holidays to Rhodes for several days ahead. They are and offering refunds because of the fires, which have been raging on the Greek island for six days.But other airlines are continuing to offer seats on flights to Rhodes, and the travel firm Thomas Cook says most of its customers booked to travel ion Sunday and Monday are travelling as normal.From London Gatwick, easyJet has five flights to Rhodes on sale on Tuesday. But for those who no longer wish to travel, the airline is allowing free changes for passengers booked up to 29 July.Three easyJet aircraft are also flying out empty to pick up UK holidaymakers wanting to come home early.RecommendedSimon Calder: BA and easyJet still selling flights to Rhodes despite wildfiresFirst rescue flights for British holidaymakers due to arrive on fire-ravaged RhodesBritish family abandon \u00a32.5k Greek holiday over blistering 40C Cerberus heatwaveRyanair says its operations to and from Rhodes are normal and that usual conditions apply.Jet2 and Tui are dispatching aircraft with no passengers from UK airports to Rhodes to pick up holidaymakers. Both have dispatched teams to help customers.Tui customers on the island are being told: \u201cWe are aware that many of our guests are now located at evacuation centres or found temporary shelter at other hotels. We are relentlessly working on improving the situation for our guests and our teams are working closely with the local authorities.\u201cCustomers currently in Rhodes will return on their intended flight home.\u201dHolidaymakers were evacuated from their hotels and left their belongings behind  (AP)Rhodes airport is on the northwestern shore of the Greek island, close to the capital, Rhodes Town. With no imminent danger in that area, airlines are entitled to operate a \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d policy, with normal terms applying.But most are expected to provide some options to customers, with package holidaymakers benefiting from extra protection.It comes after holidaymakers were forced to flee resorts on Saturday, with some British tourists describing \u201cterrifying\u201d scenes of turmoil as power cuts caused \u201cchaos\u201d on the island. Thousands of tourists have been evacuated  (AP)In previous days the wildfire was confined to the island\u2019s mountainous centre, but aided by winds, very high temperatures and dry conditions, it spread on Saturday towards the coast on the island\u2019s central-eastern side.The Foreign Office advises travellers to contact their airline or travel operator. For 24/7 British consular assistance, UK citizens abroad can call +44 20 7008 5000.The FCDO has also sent a Rapid Deployment Team to Rhodes to support British nationals, and the Greek Foreign Affairs ministry has set up a help desk at Rhodes airport.I am in Rhodes and want to leave as soon as possible. What are my options?Many tourists are in that position. Jet2 and easyJet are operating special repatriation flights in addition to the normal schedule. The general principle is that British Airways says passengers booked to fly from Rhodes to London can switch to earlier flights without penalty \u2013 though little space may be available. The earliest BA departure with space available is on Wednesday evening.Other carriers may adopt a similar policy. But availability is scarce, with no seats on easyJet flights to the London area until late on Tuesday evening, and not before Wednesday to Manchester.Most airlines are operating their normal schedules, and are likely to continue to do so from Rhodes \u2013 though more outbound flights may be empty, as Jet2 and Tui are doing.Flights are full. Are there any other ways out from the island?Yes. Dodekanisos Seaways sails once or twice a day from Rhodes Town to Kos, where there are fairly frequent flights to the UK. The 8am sailing is usually the fastest and most reliable, taking around 2h30m. A taxi will take you from the port to the airport in about 30 minutes, with much cheaper but slower buses available.Flights on Tuesday 25 July include a Ryanair departure to London Stansted which is currently selling at just \u00a337.The ferry voyage to Marmaris in Turkey is shorter, at around one hour, but the closest airport, Dalaman, is a long way from the town \u2013 making for a 90-minute taxi journey or two hours in a bus. In addition the frontier formalities leaving Greece and arriving in Turkey will take time.I lost my travel documents in the scramble to leave the area. Can I leave the island?Yes. To help tourists who were evacuated from their accommodation in a hurry and left their passports behind, the Greek authorities are issuing emergency and temporary identification to allow them to board their flights.Ryanair says: \u201cPassengers departing from Rhodes should be advised that we will accept temporary travel documentation issued by the Greek Police.\u201dIf I am brought home early, will I get some or all of my money back?People who are anxious about being on the island but whose holidays have not been directly affected are unlikely to be offered any recompense for the lost holiday times. Package holidaymakers whose trips are curtailed because their accommodation cannot be used are due a partial refund under the Package Travel Regulations. But it may not be as much as the traveller might expect.If a two-week holiday that cost \u00a31,000 per person ends a week early, the refund will not simply be half the cost of the trip, ie \u00a3500. The holiday company is entitled to subtract the value of the flights, which might be \u00a3400 \u2013 meaning only half of the remainder will be refunded, ie \u00a3300.If you make the decision to return ahead of schedule, no compensation is due. Travel insurance may help with extra costs if you can demonstrate you spent them reasonably.I am booked to travel imminently to Rhodes. Can I cancel for a refund?If the travel firm or airline cancels your trip you can expect a full refund within two weeks. If the flight is going ahead, then your rights depend on whether you are on a proper package holiday or have booked flights and accommodation separately.Under the Package Travel Regulations, holidaymakers can cancel for a refund \u201cif unavoidable and extraordinary circumstances occur at the place of destination or its immediate vicinity which significantly affect the performance of the package or the carriage of passengers to the destination\u201d.In the case of key parts of Rhodes, this looks like reasonable grounds to cancel.These are the companies\u2019 policies for imminent departures as of 4pm on Monday.British Airways: passengers booked to Rhodes in the next week can rebook for a different date up to November 2023.easyJet: all easyJet Holidays packages up to and including Tuesday 25 July are cancelled, with full refunds offered. Flight only passengers booked to travel to or from Rhodes until 29 July can transfer for free to another date or can request a flight voucher by calling easyJet Customer Services on 0330 551 5151.Jet2: all flights and holidays that are due to depart to Rhodes up to and including 30 July have been cancelled, with full refunds offered.Ryanair: \u201cFlights to/from Rhodes Airport are currently operating as normal and unaffected by the forest fires. Please check your Ryanair app where you will be notified of any changes to your Ryanair flight.\u201dThomas Cook: the online travel agent is allowing customers due to depart to holidays in the affected areas in Kiotari and Lardos up to 31 July to cancel their holidays for a full refund. Customers booked to travel to elsewhere in Rhodes on Tuesday and Wednesday are being offered full refunds.Tui: \u201cWe have cancelled all outbound flights to Rhodes up to and including Friday 28 July, and have also cancelled all outbound flights for customers travelling to impacted hotels up to and including on Sunday 30 July. All customers due to travel on these flights will receive full refunds. Passengers due to travel to areas not affected by fires on Saturday 29 and Sunday 30 July will be offered a fee free amend to another holiday or the option to cancel for a full refund. \u201cI am booked to travel to Rhodes in August. Can I cancel?Not at this stage. Depending on events over the next few days, travel firms will make decisions on their plans for the peak summer month.The travel industry appears to be preparing the ground for a restart in tourism to some of the unaffected areas of Rhodes. A spokesperson for Abta, the travel association, said: \u201cWe understand that some of the resorts have had their evacuation order removed by the Greek authorities and people have been advised that they can return to the resorts of Lindos, Pefkos and Kalathos.\u201cTravel companies will be liaising with their accommodation providers to ensure that they are ready to receive customers and customers will be notified accordingly.\u201dWould you go to Rhodes?I sympathise with everyone who is feeling apprehensive about travelling to an island that, in places, is nothing short of a disaster area. Even though distressed and exhausted holidaymakers are still trying to return from Rhodes, some tourists have been proceeding with their trips as booked in the past few days.But I would not travel there immediately: with people still trying to get out and the infrastructure under pressure, it would be unhelpful.Looking ahead a few days, though, I believe the picture will change significantly. By tomorrow I believe the vast majority of people who understandably want to come home will have done so: large amounts of air capacity are going in as repatriation flights. Pressure on the resources will ease. And the damage to the resorts on the south east shore of Rhodes will be clear.For people who are booked to the affected area, it may be that you are offered a choice between moving to a different location or a full refund. But getting all your money back is likely to be offered only if the travel firm deems it impossible for you to have a safe and enjoyable holiday.The people of Rhodes have shown outstanding kindness and courage towards overseas tourists. In most parts of the island \u2013 and 90 per cent is unaffected \u2013 they will want to get back to work delivering great experiences for visiting holidaymakers. And, in a week or two, I would be glad to go there and meet them.Meanwhile, what is happening in Corfu?A wildfire, which some reports say was started deliberately, has led to evacuations of some villages and a few hotels in the north east of the Ionian island.A Tui spokesperson said on Monday: \u201cWe\u2019ve been working with the local authorities in Corfu following the outbreak of a wildfire in the north east of the island last night resulting in guests being evacuated from a small number of hotels.\u201cAs a precautionary measure we also stopped new arrivals into the affected hotels for Monday 24 and Tuesday 25 July. The situation is now fully under control and guests are returning to their hotels to continue their holidays as planned.\u201dThe Abta spokesperson said: \u201cThe situation in Corfu is quite different to the situation in Rhodes. The wildfire on the north east of the island of Corfu is on a much smaller scale and is affecting significantly fewer holidaymakers.\u201cSome of the resorts were evacuated as a precautionary measure and we understand that those who were initially evacuated have mostly been able to return to their resorts and their accommodation.RecommendedBrits \u2018virtually forced\u2019 to pick flights over trains due to \u2018overpriced\u2019 rail faresTourists fined \u00a31,200 each for \u2018extremely dangerous\u2019 selfie More rail disruption as union announces new August overtime ban for train drivers\u201cCorfu is a very large island.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeIn a nutshell:\u00a0A rare find where the boutique chic of a luxury hotel meets the functionality and independence of a B&B. The neighbourhood\u00a0There really is something about Naples \u2013 it\u2019s rough and ready, it\u2019s energetic, it\u2019s alive. This authentic charm is exactly why the city will have you planning your next visit before you\u2019ve even finished your first.At first glance it can seem chaotic. Mopeds speed in and out of traffic (we\u2019re told by several locals that they\u2019re actually very good drivers and never crash), barely a wall in the city isn\u2019t covered in graffiti and street art, and the nights (even mid-week) buzz with the chatter of locals and tourists alike.But it\u2019s the pull of this organised chaos that (as a former New Yorker) led me to enthusiastically proclaim the city \u201cEurope\u2019s Brooklyn\u201d. Then again, it\u2019s also so much more than that.RecommendedLe Sirenuse, Positano, review: Exclusive luxury meets the intimacy of a family vacation homeBest hotels in Europe 2023, from boho chic to Art Deco designCala di Volpe hotel review: Live like royalty on Sardinia\u2019s Costa SmeraldaWhat Naples offers is a blend of old and new that at once clashes and coexists beautifully \u2013 here, you can experience ancient history and the coolest bars, all in one place.By day, explore the old town, where every turn surprises you with another ancient church, cobbled street or historic home. Take a tour of the underground of the city and walk through tunnels trod by the Romans. Walk to the high point of Castel Sant\u2019Elmo to look down on the iconic Spaccanapoli \u2013 the straight and narrow main street that literally splits the city in two \u2013 or pay a visit to the square in the Spanish quarter, which has been transformed into a shrine to one of football\u2019s biggest legends: Maradona (to say he\u2019s idolised here would be a major understatement).Balconies overlook the historic square (House in Naples)By night, the city comes even more alive as groups of friends gather in the historic squares and at homely restaurants and effortlessly trendy bars, where people laugh, drink, smoke and eat gelato into the night. As the home of pizza, it\u2019s also a food-lover\u2019s delight. Wander the streets sampling the classic margherita and marinara pizzas, try the famous deep-fried pasta (trust me, it\u2019s worth it) and get a deli sandwich unlike any other, with the freshest meats and cheese around.Naples has the added benefit of also being considerably more budget-friendly than some of its neighbouring Italian hotspots (here, a classic margherita or marinara pizza from the city\u2019s most popular pizza places will set you back just two or three euros). So, as well as enjoying all that Naples has to offer, this makes it a great base to travel further afield during a stay in Italy \u2013 visit the historic ruins of Pompeii or Herculaneum, the MountVesuvius volcano, the lemon groves of Sorrento, the designer stores of affluent island Capri or the picturesque Amalfi Coast towns of Positano and Amalfi.The vibeThe Dante House is the latest addition to the House in Naples\u2019s fleet of four boutique B&Bs as well as apartments dotted across Naples\u2019s historic centre. The concept is all about catering to travellers who want the quality of a hotel but don\u2019t want the impersonality that can often come with it. With each location carefully handpicked and each perfectly unique and with its own character, it certainly delivers just that.Located on Piazza Dante at Port\u2019Alba, The Dante House is right by one of the historic city gates encasing the old town and also conveniently just steps away from the Dante metro stop.At first glance, when you arrive outside the The Dante House in the heart of the historic old town, you could be forgiven for thinking you\u2019re in the wrong place. Nestled between a late-night pizza spot and a casual, local bar, heavy, metal doors loom from a nondescript grey concrete building. There\u2019s no sign confirming you\u2019ve reached your destination. But step through the metal doors, and you\u2019ll find yourself inside a classic, traditional Italian palazzo building. Climb up the huge slab stone stairs to the towering wooden double doors and you\u2019ll be at The Dante House.This is where your real Neapolitan adventure begins. After all, what better way to experience the historic, vibrant city of Naples than to live like a local in a traditional Neapolitan house?Though the building may date from the 18th century, The Dante House manages to perfectly mix old and new, with its clean and modern interior renovation. It\u2019s practical while being quirky; industrial but with boutique style; chic and modern but true to its original architecture \u2013 an embodiment of Naples itself.Quirky touches such as old telephones decorate the communal space (House in Naples)When we arrived, Connie was waiting to welcome us and show us around \u2013 not to mention enthusiastically give us her own personal and fantastically comprehensive guide to the best things to see and do in the city.The overall vibe is relaxed, and staff are super helpful and friendly \u2013 with excellent communication both in the lead-up to and during our stay \u2013 but are also hands off, if you\u2019re more of an independent traveller. Basically, they\u2019re there if you want them but they\u2019ll leave you alone if you don\u2019t.The reception is only staffed up to 8pm but one of the friendly staff members will come to greet late arrivals, there\u2019s a 24/7 number for any queries and there\u2019s also the option to arrange transfers from the airport or train station.If you\u2019re someone who likes an all-inclusive hotel or a place that will plan your every holiday whim for you, this isn\u2019t the place for you. Instead, this is perfect for independent travellers who want a comfortable, relaxed place to stay that\u2019s more luxurious than your regular B&B but still acts as the perfect base from which to explore the city.Being situated in the heart of one of Naples\u2019s most prominent historic squares, The Dante House couldn\u2019t be in a better location to do exactly that. You\u2019re close to some of the best bars, restaurants and pizza joints, and within walking distance to all the historic sites.The breakfast area features plush velvet seats coupled with a laidback feel (House in Naples)Bed and bathNone of the six rooms in The Dante House\u2019s boutique B&B are the same. Some have quirky mezzanine levels, some have wrought iron balconies, some have spectacular views across the square. All have character.Seriously high wooden or frescoed ceilings give the huge rooms a decorative canopy, while light floods through the french doors. Handmade and restored vintage furniture has been reworked to embody The Dante House\u2019s style: combining old and new. Nordic-inspired furnishings and touches of plush velvet perfectly clash and complement the industrial-style lighting and functional wood panels.Rooms and suites sleep between three and six people \u2013 some have kitchenettes, so they\u2019re perfect for groups of all sizes. No matter which of the six rooms you end up in, you can be sure of one thing: character (House in Naples)We stayed in the Dante 2 family studio apartment located in the same building as The Dante House, giving us access to the staff and the communal spaces \u2013 but also the privacy and peace and quiet of our own space. For a couple, family or group of friends on a city break, this option is the perfect middle ground.The apartment itself was spacious and functional \u2013 with a bedroom area, dining table and chairs, and a large kitchenette to cook in, if you so wish. There\u2019s also a separate bathroom (complete with complimentary toiletries) and a small single bedroom, so up to four can sleep comfortably. It also has a washing machine, 32in smart TV, sheets and towels included.Decor-wise, it\u2019s clean and simple with a few quirky pieces (such as a unique towering green wardrobe), which truly sets it apart from your usual B&Bs. All in all, it leans into the charm and edginess of the city waiting outside.The one downside (if we were to be picky) is the lack of windows and natural light. But, for us, this all added to the charm and quirkiness of the apartment, with its interior-facing window to the courtyard \u2013 which also meant less noise from the lively city outside.All in all, The Dante House is a far cry from a typical B&B. It\u2019s somewhere between your home away from home and a luxury hotel.The Dante 2 studio apartment offers privacy and peace and quiet (House in Naples)Food and drinkBreakfast is a big draw at The Dante House.It\u2019s buffet-style and has clearly been carefully curated with the best-quality ingredients in the way of fresh, organic, homemade and zero km foods. From delicious homemade yoghurt and dried fruit (prepared fresh every day), freshly baked croissants and sfogliatelle pastries (a classic Italian specialty handmade in House in Naples\u2019s own bakery), to ready-made rolls with fresh cold cuts and cheeses. The breakfast area itself also perfectly matches The Dante House\u2019s vibe, with its boutique-style plush velvet seats coupled with a laidback, homely feel, as though you\u2019re sitting in a friend\u2019s home.Sip freshly squeezed orange juice and freshly roasted coffee from a window seat overlooking the historic square below. It\u2019s the perfect start to a day exploring the city.Later in the afternoon, there\u2019s also coffee and tea available \u2013 just in time for a much-needed pit stop after wandering around the city. Nab a window seat overlooking the historic square below (House in Naples)Public areasThe blend of old meets new, industrial meets luxury and functional meets quirky runs through all the spaces at The Dante House. The reception area is all tiled flooring, vibrant teal wall, wooden desk and \u2013 most intriguing \u2013 a wall covered in old telephones. As a B&B concept, it, of course, doesn\u2019t have the amenities of a hotel (though the last thing you have time for in Naples is a trip to the gym).What it does have, however, is Posca \u2013 its cafe come bistro come bar just steps from The Dante House and right in the middle of the beating heart of the city. By day, it\u2019s a hip spot for freshly roasted coffee, homemade cakes and brunch. By night, it\u2019s a quirky cocktail bar \u2013 which also brews its own beers \u2013 where friends can meet for an aperitivo.We visited on a Wednesday night and sampled the cocktails, which come in the form of twists on popular classics, drinking alfresco on the cobbled street out front among the buzz of the city. Inside the bar, the House in Naples\u2019s creators surprised us yet again with the decor \u2013 think vibrant pink floral wallpaper, pink velvet and neon signs. To make it even more appealing, guests at The Dante House can get a discount off the bar tab.Old and new mixes perfectly at this traditional 18th-century home (House in Naples)Nuts and boltsRoom count: Six rooms at The Dante House, four apartments.Freebies: Breakfast, coffee and tea bar.Wifi: Free.Extra charges: Tourist tax of \u20ac2.50 per person per day. Parking \u20ac30 per day.Disability access: Due to its many stairs and steps, it is not wheelchair accessible.Pet policy: Pets allowed, upon request.Bottom lineBest thing: The location right in the heart of the action, and the unique style. Worst thing: It can be a little noisy in the mornings, as the area is home to other businesses and local residents (though it\u2019s not a bad thing to make sure you don\u2019t miss a day of exploring).Perfect for: Families, couples and friends who want the luxury of a hotel coupled with the freedom and homeliness of a B&B.Not right for: People who like the round-the-clock service and all-inclusivity of a typical hotel.Instagram from: One of The Dante House\u2019s eight balconies overlooking the historic square below.Read more of our Italy hotel reviews:Best hotels in RomeWhere to stay in VeniceBest hotels in FlorenceRecommendedThe 10 best countries for solo travel \u2013 and top tips for travelling alone9 of the best Italy holiday destinations: When to travel and where to stay8 best cities and towns in Portugal to visit on your next holidayRead more about Italy travel:The ultimate guide to ItalyWhat to do in BolognaWhy Puglia makes for a great escape"}, {"_id": "64bef84651ac33362ba19bf2", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/inspiration/best-solo-travel-countries-b2377962.html", "primaryCategory": "Inspiration", "subCategories": "test", "title": "The 10 best countries for solo travel \u2013 and top tips for travelling alone", "lead": "<p> From welcoming Japan to adventurous Iceland, here\u2019s our pick of destinations for lone globetrotters </p>", "author": "Natalie Wilson", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 16:18:36", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:16:38.524419", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-24T16:18:36+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/19/12/iStock-1195370326.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Simon Calder\u2019s free travel email for expert advice and money-saving discountsGet Simon Calder\u2019s Travel email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeBritons have long loved to be beside the seaside. It might be the sense of freedom you find on the egde of destination. Perhaps it\u2019s the nostalgia of childhood, or the draw of a day spent swimming and sunbathing? Whatever it is, beaches continue to pull  in visitors \u2013 and especially tempting is a beach break in Europe.A recent Which?  survey explored some of these captivating factors, setting out to discover the UK\u2019s favourite European seaside destinations by asking 3,500 members to rate coastal towns and cities based on 12 factors. Its results give an insight into what makes an ideal European seaside destination in the eyes of Britons \u2013 namely a blend of attractive town centre and seafront areas, varied attractions, quality food and drink options, and good value. From ancient port cities to charming Algarve towns, Brits have recommended a diverse range of destinations; here\u2019s a deep dive into the top 10.Valencia, Spain RecommendedIndependent Traveller guide to best hotels and short breaksBest UK hotels 2022Cheap hotels in Paris 2022: Where to stay for value for moneyValencia\u2019s main square, the Plaza del Ayuntamiento  (Getty Images)The list is topped by a less -high-profile city, with Valencia gaining a \u201cdestination score\u201d of 91 per cent. It was given five stars for its beach, attractiveness, shopping, tourist attractions, peace and quiet and value for money; a testament to the city\u2019s range of things to do combined with a laid-back atmosphere that is friendlier than that of Barcelona or Madrid. It sees far fewer tourists than some other cities in Spain, but this situation likely won\u2019t stay the same for long. Read more on Europe travel:Why you should swap Lake Como for North Macedonia Europe\u2019s best road trips to try in your lifetimeBest solo holiday destinations in Europe for single travellers in 2023A tempting climate sets the tone for the city; it means that beaches are still busy on December weekends, that nights out with friends are longer, and that al fresco dining is the norm rather than a sign that the summer has arrived. Walking around the city is a joy too; from the dramatic Gothic Old Town to a stunning Art Nouveau train station, the city\u2019s architecture is an eclectic mix of local and international influences.  Centred around three main squares within 10 minutes of each other, you can take in much of the city on foot, although visits to the beaches (or the famous City of Arts and Sciences complex) might require a bike or taxi. Once you\u2019re tired of exploring on foot, you can discover the culinary scenes of one of Spain\u2019s unsung foodie cities. Where to stay in Valencia A fabulous hotel in the centre of the Old Town, Vincci Palace offers stylish and elegant accommodation. Rooms are large and have a contempoarary design, while the buffet breakfast is a particular highlight. Porto, PortugalA view over Porto from across the Don Luis I Bridge  (Getty Images/iStockphoto)Portugal\u2019s second city is blessed with a fantastic location on the banks of the Douro River, so it\u2019s no surprise that it ranked highly in the seafront and attractiveness categories. It is remarkably affordable for a major European city, with visitors and locals gathering by the waterfront in the Ribeira district for cheap wines and great value meals. As you climb the steep hills and narrow cobbled streets into different districts, you\u2019ll find even more gems, from indie boutiques to some of the city\u2019s best restaurants. To try some upmarket traditional Portuguese cuisine, visit Adega S\u00e3o Nicolau. River cruises and wine tastings are popular activities, while its selection of landmarks includes the cathedral, the Clerigos church and the Dom Luis I Bridge (worth crossing over for excellent views of the city and its colourful, russet-roofed buildings). The city\u2019s vibrant atmosphere can still be found away from the waterside, so head to the Bolhao Market to sample local produce and get a taste of how locals live their day-to-day lives. If it\u2019s the evening, Galerias de Paris street will give you an experience of the city\u2019s main nightlife area. Where to stay in Porto\u00a0Sitting in a historic building in the Ribeira district \u2013 not far from the waterfront \u2013 the Hotel Carris Porto Ribeira features slick interiors and provides excellent river views, some of which can be seen from the terraces and balconies of its rooms. Venice, ItalyA view of the Grand Canal and Basilica Santa Maria in Venice (Getty Images/iStockphoto)Its network of picturesque canals has come to define Venice. Lined with spectacular Venetian architecture and colourful facades and linked by often spectacular bridges (the Rialto is the most famous), the canals are the symbol of a breathtakingly beautiful city, with gondola trips offering an unforgettable way to travel around. Venice received high ratings for its seafront and attractiveness; in addition to the canals, it is surrounded by the Venetian Lagoon, providing sweeping views across the water from several points in the city. From St Mark\u2019s Square and Basilica to Doge\u2019s Palace, the city is home to an impressive mix of Renaissance, Gothic and Byzantine architecture, the range of which forms one of Venice\u2019s main attractions. It wouldn\u2019t be an Italian city without great food and great art, and you can find both here. The Peggy Guggenheim museum showcases the American heiress\u2019 personal collection of futurist and modernist art, while the biannual Venice Biennale showcases contemporary visual art. Where to stay in Venice\u00a0Overlooking the Grand Canal, the Hotel Carlton provides a mix of understated, 17th-century Venetian elegance blended with charming additional features, the most notable of which is an impressive roof terrace. Tavira, PortugalTavira is a historic town in the Algarve (Getty Images/iStockphoto)Tavira sits on Portugal\u2019s southern Algarve coast, not far from the border with Spain. A charming, tranquil town, it ranked five stars for value, safety, friendliness, peace and quiet and its seafront, making it a great destination for a more relaxed seaside break. Tavira has a rich history that dates back to Roman times, most visible in its Roman Bridge, medieval castle and perfectly-preserved historic centre, where cobblestone streets are lined with white-washed buildings.There are several pleasant areas in the region, from the town\u2019s waterfront to the Ria Formosa National Park, and the area contains some amazing beaches \u2013 the Ilha de Tavira, Praia do Barril and Praia de Terra Esreita are some of the best, where white sands meet clear waters. Where to stay in TaviraLocated near the river in the centre of the historic area, the architecturally mixed Vila Gale Tavira contains a vast outdoor pool, an indoor pool, fitness centre and bar, with Hispanic-style rustic interiors. Pollenca, SpainMallorca\u2019s pristine beaches and mountainous terrain are a beautiful combination  (Getty Images/iStockphoto)Britain\u2019s favourite Balearic island has dozens of seaside destinations to choose from, but the northern town of Pollenca has ranked highest, with five-star ratings for its beach, seafront and peace and quiet. Nestled between mountains and the Mediterranean, Pollenca is a historic town full of 17th- and 18th-century buildings, and home to a charming Old Town of winding streets, high-quality tapas restaurants and attractive squares. The main town lies inland, though the Port de Pollenca \u2013 where most of the beaches are \u2013 is just three miles away (the two are usually grouped together). From the port itself to beaches such as Cala Formentor, Sant Vincent and Boquer, there are several  areas to have a relaxing drink or dinner, with many places that are great for swimming (even for children) and water sports. Where to stay in Pollenca\u00a0Hotel Juma is a family-run hotel dating back to the early 1900s. It has retained period features (such as wooden beams) while adding various pieces of antique furniture to create a traditional stay in the centre of town, with a peaceful roof terrace to boot. Chania, GreeceA view over Chania\u2019s Venetian-style harbour (Getty Images/iStockphoto)An idyllic city on the northwest coast of Crete, Chania offers visitors an appealing mix of ancient history, Greek culture and natural beauty that saw it ranked highly for its seafront, attractiveness, friendliness and food and drink offerings. The city has a rich heritage, most visible in its Venetian harbour, Firkal Fortress, Grand Arsenal and the Ottoman-era Egyptian Lighthouse, Turkish baths and Mosque\u00a0of the Janissaries, many of which are contained in the Old Town. Away from the historical, the city is surrounded by natural sites such as the Samaria gorge, villages like Loutro and an array of picturesque beaches including  Balos, Balos Lagoon and Elafonisi. Though many in the area are known for their fine white sand, turquoise waters and the rugged terrain that surround them, Elafonisi is  famed for the presence of its unusual pink sand. Where to stay in ChaniaWith a great location right in the middle of the action (on the waterfront of the city\u2019s harbour) and cosy, modern rooms, Porto Veneziano is an excellent choice for a comfortable stay in Chania. Rooms have balconies with sweeping sea views, while the hotel\u2019s restaurant offers Greek breakfasts and light dinners. Rhodes, GreeceA view over Semi, on the Greek island of Rhodes (Getty Images/iStockphoto)The island of Rhodes lies northeast of Crete, near the Turquoise Coast of neighbouring Turkey. Its eponymous principal city has a similarly fascinating history to Chania: the medieval Old Town is a Unesco Heritage Site, it is home to an acropolis and ancient ruins in Lindos, and was the location of the Colossus of Rhodes, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. While the walled Old Town is a maze of pretty streets and places to dine, outside you\u2019ll find rolling hills, lush greenery and forests that are perfect for hiking, mountain biking and relaxing walks. Rhodes is also home to many spectacular sun-drenched beaches, from family-friendly coastline to secluded spots. Tsambika, Saint Paul\u2019s Bay, Ladiko and Kallithea are popular with groups and families due to their gently sloping sands and calm waters, but for more dramatic settings \u2013 either surrounded by towering cliffs, jagged rocks or verdant hills \u2013 try Apolakia, Fourni or Glyfada. Where to stay in Rhodes\u00a0For a calm, adults-only retreat just 30 minutes away from Rhodes town, opt for Casa Cook. Just 10 minutes from the beach (at the foot of the Tsambika mountain), the hotel has a large outdoor pool, with some rooms containing a terrace that provides direct access to it. Syracuse, Italy An aerial view over Syracuse  (Getty Images/iStockphoto)Situated on the eastern edge of Sicily (on the opposite side to the capital, Palermo), Syracuse is known for its historic centre (and Old Town), housed on the island of Ortigia. Home to an assortment of Baroque architecture, including a stunning cathedral and piazza, the area also contains the Archaeological Park of Neapolis, showcasing some of the best-preserved ancient architecture in the world in the form of a Greek theatre and Roman amphitheatre. The city received an \u2018n/a\u2019 rating for its beaches; even though there are places to swim in the sea, there are no wide expanses of sand in Ortigia or the city. The Marina di Siracusa offers sweeping views out to sea and an idyllic setting for sipping an aperitif before dinner, but if you\u2019re really craving golden sands, you\u2019ll have to head a few miles out of the city to beaches such as Fontane Bianche. Where to stay in Syracuse Nestled in the centre of Ortigia, Hotel Roma is housed in a superb pink palazzo-type building, set among wide, paved streets and impressive squares. This grand hotel has simple interiors, but will provide a comfortable stay at the heart of the action. Barcelona, Spain Barcelona\u2019s Placa Catalunya, the heart of the city  (Getty Images/iStockphoto)A cosmopolitan city that has retained many of its non-Spanish influences, Barcelona ranked highly for its entertainment, tourists attractions, general attractiveness and seafront areas. Anyone who has been can attest to its vast range of things to do and see, from viewing the eclectic range of buildings and the works of Picasso to strolling around the charming Gothic Quarter or Montjuic\u2019s Olympic Park.Barcelona\u2019s marina and seafront areas are a serene, attractive spot, though the impressive squares and limestone-paved streets of the labyrinthine Gothic and Born districts are far more attractive. While most tourists will stick to Barceloneta or Sant Miquel for beach trips (they\u2019re the closest to the centre), if you can spare the time and want to be surrounded by cool beach bars and buzzing paella restaurants, head to Bogatell or Llevant. Where to stay in Barcelona\u00a0One of several Barcelona hotels that\u2019s centred around its roof-terrace and pool, Hotel 1898 has an enviable location in the Gothic Quarter and panoramic views of the both the city and the sea. It has a second, indoor pool and spa area, making it a good choice for relaxation in the centre of the city. Lisbon, Portugal A view of Lisbon \u2013 this view greets you if you arrive via cruise ship (Getty Images/iStockphoto)The Portuguese capital is as blessed as Porto when it comes to its waterside location, sitting on the shores of the Atlantic Ocean. The seafront and marina are focused on eating and drinking, though they offer amazing views out to sea, as do any of this hilly city\u2019s viewpoints, from the Sao Jorge Castle or Miradouro da Gra\u00e7a viewpoint to its assortment of trendy rooftop bars. More architecturally diverse than Porto, Lisbon is home to a range of Gothic and Renaissance architecture, from the Belem Tower to the Jeronimos Monastery. . Chaido and Bairro Alto are where much of the nightlife is centred, while Alfama and Baixa are other popular neighbourhoods, whether you\u2019re looking to browse the popular Time Out Market \u2013 a food market that houses stalls run by a selection of the city\u2019s best restaurants \u2013 to a ride in one of the city\u2019s famous trams, Tram 28. There are no beaches in Lisbon, though nearby seaside resorts include Estoril, Cascais and Nazare (which is particularly well-known for surfing). Where to stay in Lisbon\u00a0Close to the Tagus River and the bustling neighbourhoods of Alfama and Bairro Alto, LX Boutique Hotel is in a great location for exploring all of what Lisbon has to offer. Inside, you\u2019ll find smart interiors and spacious rooms based on a charming blue and white colour scheme; you may be surprised to find a sushi restaurant, too.

It follows an incident in which a woman was air-lifted to hospital after being mauled by dingoes on the island, leading to one of the native animals \u2013 sometimes known by their indigenous name, wongari \u2013 being put to sleep.\u201cBoth women have made an extremely dangerous decision to interact with wongari and that\u2019s why they have been fined,\u201d said Mike Devery, compliance manager for the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service.RecommendedMore rail disruption as union announces new August overtime ban for train driversHoliday and flights advice as flights to Greece cancelled amid wildfiresEverything you need to know about July and August rail industrial action\u201cThe Queensland woman could have been bitten by the wongari, which was clearly exhibiting dominance-testing behaviour.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeDecember often brings miserable weather, from rainy overcast days to frosty mornings and even the odd sprinkling of snow. Though for many the end of the year brings the excitement of the festive period, a jam-packed social calendar and time spent with family and friends, for others the combination of cold snaps, dark evenings and the intensity of the holidays makes the final month of the year a bit of a slog. Those hoping to duck out of drawn-in nights and shiveringly chilly mornings could consider swapping sleet and snow for sun and sand on a trip to Europe. Destinations such as Crete and Malta usually bask in warmer temperatures of up to 20C, meaning you can breakfast al fresco by by the pool while your neighbours are defrosting their cars. Though the period directly either side of Christmas can be expensive, earlier dates in the month are more affordable times to travel, well outside of peak season and school holidays.

Other options for a resort stay include Los Cristianos and Playa de las Americas, both on the southwest coast of the island. The island also has an abundance of natural wonders. The centre piece is the imposing Mount Teide \u2013 the highest peak in Spain at 3,715m \u2013 and the associated National Park, where visitors can explore volcanic landscapes and hike through\u00a0hills and forest, with sensational views over the island.

Chania is home to Venetian and Ottoman influences, most visible in its charming harbour, while the historic capital of Heraklion showcases the island\u2019s rich historical heritage; the island is home to several ruins of the Minoan civilisation, and notable sites include the Palace of Knossos and the ruins of Malia.An island of rocky, rough terrain and a mix of arid and green landscapes, Crete also contains plenty of places for outdoor pursuits, from hiking the Samaria Gorge or the White Mountains to swimming in the Baloo Lagoon or enjoying the pink sands of Elafonisi.\u00a0Gran Canaria, SpainAn aerial view over Las Palmas, the main city on Gran Canaria (Getty Images)Average temperature in December: 18CAverage sunshine hours: 6Another of the perennially warm Canary Islands (Lanzarote and Fuerteventura have not made this list, but it\u2019s also worth checking them out), Gran Canaria offers an equally enviable array of potential activities.Its capital, Las Palmas, is the largest city in the Canaries and is a more cosmopolitan alternative to Santa Cruz de Tenerife. The historic Vegueta district is a good starting point, while popular museums include the Museo Canario (for a look into the pre-colonial history of the islands) and the one-time house of Christopher Columbus, that has now been turned into a museum. Other popular resort towns include Puerto Rico and Maspalomas, most famous for the vast expanse of sand dunes that leads to its beaches.Maspalomas isn\u2019t the only natural marvel on the island. Gran Canaria is covered by mountainous terrain and valleys; the\u00a0Caldera de los Marteles\u00a0and the\u00a0barrancos\u00a0(ravines) of Guayadeque and Azuaje are ideal for hiking, while the Roque Nublo (a 67-metre tall volcanic rock) is an iconic geographical landmark. There are plenty of beaches worth exploring too, including Las Canteras, Amadores and Gui Gui. Valletta, MaltaA view of Valletta\u2019s Marsamxett Harbour and Cathedral of Saint Paul (Getty Images)Average temperature in December: 14CAverage sunshine hours: 6The Maltese capital, though small, is a charming city packed with varied architecture, labyrinthine streets and heritage buildings (with average December highs of 17C to top it all off). The\u00a0entire\u00a0city is a Unesco World Heritage Site \u2013 designated for its links to the Order of St John \u2013 and contains 320 monuments in an area of just 0.21 square miles, making it one of the most concentrated historic areas in the world. A maze of Baroque, Renaissance and neoclassical buildings awaits visitors, visible in landmarks such as St John\u2019s Co-Cathedral and the Grandmaster\u2019s Palace, though you can visit the City Gate and Triton Fountain for examples of more modern influences.Valletta also boasts pretty squares such as Freedom and Triton, home to the gate and fountain; traditional local markets, like the open-air Sunday Market at the Gate; and other historical sites such as the fortifications and defensive walls. These are all punctuated by plenty of restaurants and shops selling anything from international cuisine to Maltese crafts \u2013 the island is well-known for its glass blowing, knitting, weaving and clock-making. The country\u2019s compact size makes Valletta a great base for visiting other destinations too, from Sliema to the small neighbouring isle of Gozo.Palermo, ItalyA view over the Pretoria Fountain in Palermo  (Getty Images/iStockphoto)Average temperature in December: 14CAverage sunshine hours: 5The capital of Sicily \u2013 the largest island in the Mediterranean \u2013 is less hot than other destinations on the list but is one of the the warmest places in Italy come December. This vibrant city is a hub of activity, from its street markets, including\u00a0the\u00a0Ballaro and Capo food markets and the Vucciria\u00a0bazaar, to the tourists weaving in and out of landmarks and museums such as the Palatine Chapel, the Norman Palace and the Palazzo Abatellis\u2019 Sicilian Regional Gallery.RecommendedThe hottest destinations in Europe this week \u2013 and how to stay safeEmbracing life in the slow lane on a summer holiday to the Alps8 best cities and towns in Portugal to visit on your next holidayAlongside discovering the city\u2019s Roman, Arab and Norman history, visitors can also sample local cuisine and top tier beaches.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeEvery summer, it seems, those resourceful people in the French Alps come up with more adrenalin-boosting ways of having fun in the mountains. Until earlier this year, I would have joined them. But thanks to an out-of-control skier who ploughed into me in March, I\u2019ve been hobbling around with a damaged knee. Still wanting to get a summertime mountain fix \u2013 all that lovely clean air, mind-blowing scenery and fabulous food \u2013 I decided to find ways to take things more slowly and see how people with limited mobility can get the most out of a summer Alpine holiday.I was in the Annecy Mountains, where I could combine bijoux ski resorts with one of France\u2019s most beautiful cities of the same name and the country\u2019s third-largest lake. My first base was the small village of Talloires, which, along with more than a dozen spots along Lake Annecy, has its own beach. Swimming was just what the doctor ordered, and the wooden bathing deck in front of my hotel, Abbaye des Talloires, gave easy access to the water. What a joy it was to plunge into those incredibly clear waters and give my knee a very gentle workout.Unable to join the cyclists making their way around Lake Annecy\u2019s 33km Voie Verte circuit, I took a boat ride with Florent from Blue Diamond Taxi Boat instead to get a closer look. Talloires sits on its south-eastern side under the cliffs of the Roc de Ch\u00e8re nature reserve, under which the atmospheric Smugglers\u2019 Cave was cut into the rock. Everywhere we looked there was seemingly a grassy bank, sandy stretch or bathing platform from which to launch yourself into the water.Annecy's Pont des Amours (Adam Batterbee)We motored to the southernmost tip for a waterside view of one of the lake\u2019s protected areas, the Bout du Lac nature reserve, heralded by a wall of tall reeds. I returned the following day to wander the accessible raised wooden walkways through this lush landscape of marshes, meadows and woods where two river sources, the Ire and Eau Morte, fed into the lake. The reserve\u2019s beavers didn\u2019t make an appearance, but it was a peaceful and soothing way to spend a morning.RecommendedIndependent Traveller guide to best hotels and short breaksBest UK hotels 2022Cheap hotels in Paris 2022: Where to stay for value for moneyJust up the road from the reserve was La Cuill\u00e8re \u00e0 Omble restaurant, a sublime lakeside spot to try some of the fish caught by the lake\u2019s two remaining professional fishermen. Omble (Arctic char) and f\u00e9ra (whitefish) are among the most popular, the latter ending up deliciously grilled on my plate. Normally in the Alps, this particular cheese addict would have been gorging on comt\u00e9 and the like. But I decided to make the most of Lake Annecy\u2019s gorgeous bounty before the second half of the trip higher in the mountains.Read more on France travel:The ultimate France travel guideThe best French regions to visitHow to do a family skiing holiday on the cheap in the French AlpsBefore I had to wrench myself from the lake\u2019s shimmering waters, I headed up to Annecy\u2019s Vieille Ville, as irresistible as ever. Here, the vivid blue of the lake contrasted with the turquoise waters of the tree-lined Canal du Vass\u00e9 and the green canopy of trees in the Jardins de l\u2019Europe. On this warm day, most of the population seemed to be sunning itself on the town\u2019s lakeside beaches. Everyone else was sitting on the caf\u00e9 terraces along the Canal de Thiou, leaving Annecy\u2019s most photogenic landmark \u2013 the medieval Palais de l\u2019\u00cele, on its own island \u2013 relatively quiet. It was only \u20ac3.90 to visit, so I popped in for a crash course on the rich history of the building and to see the art in its upper gallery.Bout du Lac nature reserve (Adam Batterbee)After this thoroughly enjoyable lakeside interlude, it was time to gain another 600m in altitude and follow the twisting road towards my next base at the ski resort of La Clusaz. But first there was Les Fromages du Fermier in Manigod, otherwise known as my idea of heaven. Here in this land of reblochon, tomme de Savoie, abondance and beaufort, I joined the weekly Thursday cheese tasting and tour of the cheese caves (\u20ac8). My French could just about keep up with the commentary, but my taste buds were already fluent.I soon discovered how surreal it can be to visit a place you know only when it\u2019s covered in snow. La Clusaz was at its greenest on this sunny June day, the unfrozen waters of the nearby Lac des Confins reflecting the surrounding mountains. Abondance cows ambled around the meadows, their cowbells adding music to the moos.\n\nI soon discovered how surreal it can be to visit a place you know only when it\u2019s covered in snowThe footpath\u2019s terrain was a bit too difficult for my unstable knee, but I had better luck the next day on the Col des Annes, where a handful of restaurants and cheese farms formed a mini hamlet at 1,721m. After a tartiflette lunch at La Chemin\u00e9e, I followed one of the tracks that fanned out from this mountain pass, whose moor-like landscape was dotted with the occasional herd of cows. I clocked the signpost for a four-hour hike to Lac de Lessy and added it to my wish-list for the future.Back in La Clusaz, I found a museum that paid homage to two of the region\u2019s most vital elements: cheese and skiing. In a lovely Savoyard-style chalet, Le Hameau des Alpes (\u20ac7) tells the story of reblochon on its ground floor, while its upper level explores in fascinating detail (especially old film footage) the history of skiing in the area. The museum\u2019s farm outbuildings, including an old communal bread oven and exhibits of farming life over the centuries, reminded me how rustic and rural the region still is.Mary at Col des Annes (Adam Batterbee)Rustic and rural were certainly on the menu on my final dinner at the convivial Chalet Savoyard on the Col des Aravis at 1,498m, near the border between Haute Savoie and Savoie. It was the summer solstice, and there was still a dusky light on the mountains when we emerged from the restaurant. Elsewhere in France, people were celebrating the F\u00eate de la Musique, when everyone makes music on the longest day of the year. Annecy, I was told, was where the big party was happening. But here on the empty D909, where the Tour de France would come rolling along in a few weeks\u2019 time, there was only the loud, joyous sound of cowbells, our own F\u00eate des Cloches. I didn\u2019t need an adrenalin-boosting Alpine adventure \u2013 just the midsummer magic of the mountains.The ski resort of La Clusaz has a whole different look come summer (Adam Batterbee)Travel essentialsGetting thereMary Novakovich travelled with Annecy Mountains and Le Shuttle, which has Folkestone-Calais crossings from \u00a387 each way.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThirteen months on from the start of the first national rail strikes since the 1980s, the disputes over pay, jobs and working conditions appear as intractable as ever. July has seen the resumption of industrial action aimed at more than a dozen train operators by both main rail unions, which will continue into August.The biggest rail union, the RMT, and Aslef, representing train drivers, say many of their members have not had a pay rise for four years. They are demanding no-strings increases that take into account the high level of inflation. The unions are prepared to discuss reforms, but these must be negotiated separately with commensurate boosts to pay. Train operators and ministers \u2013 who must sign off any deal \u2013 insist modernisation is essential following the collapse of rail revenue, in particular the loss of much of the \u201cbedrock\u201d of season ticket sales since the Covid pandemic.Caught in the middle: the long-suffering passenger. Since June 2022, national rail strikes and other forms of industrial action have scuppered the travel plans of tens of millions of train passengers.

The train drivers\u2019 union, Aslef, is mounting \u201caction short of a strike\u201d in the shape of Monday-to-Saturday overtime bans. Saturday 22 July is the last day of the second such action.

But routes that offer alternatives to strike-hit routes, such as Stratford, Walthamstow Central and Ealing Broadway to central London, are likely to be especially busy during the walk-outs by RMT members working for train operators and the London Underground,Why were the July and August dates chosen?Like any unions, the RMT and Aslef are seeking the biggest impact \u2013 ie to cause as much disruption as they can. With rail commuting sharply down since the Covid pandemic, the target is now leisure passengers.The RMT union\u2019s national walk-outs are targeting what are likely to be three of the busiest days of the month, with many families on the move at the start of school holidays in England, particularly to and from seaside resorts.

On RMT strike days the network will be reduced to a limited service linking London Marylebone with Aylesbury, Banbury and Oxford.West Midlands Railway: On RMT strike days the train operator says: \u201cWe will provide a limited service using management volunteers and staff who are not partaking in strike action.\u201cWe will prioritise the delivery of a very limited service on our mainline routes however, our advice to customers is to only travel if your journey is essential and you have no other means of transport available.\u201dDuring the Aslef overtime ban, services are reduced and some links are replaced by buses.Avanti West Coast: The Aslef overtime ban is not expected to have an impact. But on RMT strike days the picture is complicated by large-scale engineering work. The basic pattern to and from London Euston will be one train each hour to/from:ManchesterLiverpool (via Birmingham)Preston, with a limited service onwards to Glasgow.On 29 July there will be more trains with Birmingham and Liverpool each getting a dedicated service.North Wales, Shrewsbury, Blackpool, Stoke-on-Trent, Macclesfield and Edinburgh will have no Avanti West Coast services.\u201cThe days after industrial action are also expected to be affected \u2013 particularly due to the reduced timetable for engineering work, but trains may also start later in the morning than usual following the strike,\u201d Avanti West Coast says.Northern: \u201cDisruption is expected between 17-22 July, particularly Friday 21 July, due to industrial action called by Aslef.\u201cThere will be very limited Northern services on Thursday 20, Saturday 22 and Saturday 29 July.\u201dTransPennine Express: \u201cWe expect some services to start later and finish earlier than usual, and some journeys may be altered late or on the day of travel\u201d \u2013 that is the prediction for the Aslef overtime ban.On RMT strike days a very limited number of trains will run on the Manchester Piccadilly-Leeds-York-Scarborough route; between Preston and Manchester Airport; and between Sheffield and Cleethorpes.East Midlands Railway: A number of train cancellations are predicted during the Aslef overtime ban. On RMT strike days, the operator says: \u201cOnly travel by rail if absolutely necessary and if you do travel, expect severe disruption.\u201d But a significant service will operate hourly on these routes:London St Pancras to/from Nottingham, Sheffield and Corby.Derby and NottinghamDerby and MatlockSheffield and NottinghamLeicester and LincolnMansfield Woodhouse and NottinghamNottingham and Skegness (every two hours)LNER: During Aslef overtime ban, \u201cit is possible there will be short-notice alterations and cancellations\u201d.On RMT strike days, a regular service will run on the London-York-Newcastle-Edinburgh line, with first departures around 7am and final arrivals around 10pm.

It\u2019s likely you will need to queue and you may not be able to board your chosen service.

But main line services will operate.Stansted Airport is likely to have trains to and from London Liverpool Street every hour from around 7am until mid-evening.Will airport trains run?The Gatwick Express between the Sussex airport and London is suspended, but Southern trains are available on the London Victoria-Gatwick linkGatwick, Luton, Stansted, Southampton, Birmingham and Manchester airports will have some trains during the RMT walk-outs. Heathrow airport is unaffected by the national walk-outs: it is served by the Heathrow Express and Elizabeth Line, as well as the London Underground. But during the RMT Tube strike against Transport for London, the airport\u2019s Tube link on the Piccadilly Line is likely to be suspended \u2013 in common with almost all other Underground servicesWill Eurostar be affected?No, but connections to and from the train operator\u2019s main hub at London St Pancras International will be difficult because union members working for all three domestic train operators at the station (East Midlands Railway, Southeastern and Thameslink) serving the station will walk out. Why is the RMT striking?The RMT general secretary Mick Lynch has described the latest offer from the train operators \u2013 represented by the Rail Delivery Group (RDG) \u2013 as \u201csubstandard\u201d. He said: \u201cThis latest phase of action will show the country just how important railway staff are to the running of the rail industry.\u201dThe government continues to shackle the companies and will not allow them to put forward a package that can settle this dispute.\u201cRMT will continue its industrial campaign until we reach a negotiated settlement on pay, working conditions and job security.The RMT has staged walk-outs on 30 days in the current wave of strikes, with Aslef stopping work on 13 previous occasions.Why is Aslef taking industrial action?Mick Whelan, Aslef\u2019s general secretary, said: \u201cOnce again we find ourselves with no alternative but to take this action. We have continually come to the negotiating table in good faith, seeking to resolve the dispute.\u201cSadly, it is clear from the actions of both the train operating companies and the government that they do not want an end to the dispute. Their goals appear to be to continue industrial strife and to do down our industry.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to inconvenience the public. We just want to see our members paid fairly during a cost of living crisis when inflation is running at above 10 per cent, and to not see our terms and conditions taken away.\u201cIt\u2019s time for the government and the companies to think again and look for a resolution.\u201dWhat do the train operators say?A spokesman for the RDG said: \u201cMore strikes are totally unnecessary. After a year of industrial action all the RMT has achieved is losing their members more money than they would have received in the pay offers they refused to put to put out to a vote, despite having agreed the terms with the negotiators the room.\u201cWe have now made three offers that the RMT executive have blocked without a convincing explanation. We remain open to talks and we have said repeatedly that we want to give our people a pay rise.\u201cBut until the union leadership and executive is united in what it wants and engages in good faith with the 30 per cent shortfall in revenue the industry is continuing to grapple with post-Covid, it is difficult to move forward.\u201cSadly our staff, our customers and the communities across the country which rely on a thriving railway are the ones that are suffering as a result.\u201dWhat does the government say?A spokesperson for the Department for Transport said: \u201cThe RMT leadership\u2019s decision to call strikes targeting two iconic international sporting events, as children and families begin their summer holidays, will disrupt people\u2019s plans across the country.\u201cAfter a year of industrial action, passengers and rail workers alike are growing tired of union bosses playing politics with their lives.\u201cIt\u2019s high time the union leaders realised that strikes no longer have the impact they once did and are simply driving people away from the railway.\u201dI have a ticket booked for one of the RMT national strike days. What can I do?Passengers with Advance, Anytime or Off-Peak tickets can have their ticket refunded with no fee if the train that the ticket is booked for is cancelled, delayed or rescheduled.Train operators are likely to offer flexibility to travel on a wide range of non-strike days.Passengers with season tickets who do not travel can claim compensation for the strike dates through Delay Repay.RecommendedTrain strike day?

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThirteen months on from the start of the first national rail strikes since the 1980s, the disputes over pay, jobs and working conditions appear as intractable as ever. July has seen the resumption of industrial action aimed at more than a dozen train operators by both main rail unions, which will continue into August.The biggest rail union, the RMT, and Aslef, representing train drivers, say many of their members have not had a pay rise for four years. They are demanding no-strings increases that take into account the high level of inflation. The unions are prepared to discuss reforms, but these must be negotiated separately with commensurate boosts to pay. Train operators and ministers \u2013 who must sign off any deal \u2013 insist modernisation is essential following the collapse of rail revenue, in particular the loss of much of the \u201cbedrock\u201d of season ticket sales since the Covid pandemic.Caught in the middle: the long-suffering passenger. Since June 2022, national rail strikes and other forms of industrial action have scuppered the travel plans of tens of millions of train passengers. Stoppages have been called frequently, causing massive disruption and making advance travel planning difficult.RecommendedRow between rail unions as RMT accused of ruining dealAll the UK strike dates confirmed for July 2023Rail passengers facing further strikes from ThursdayTransport for Wales and ScotRail are not involved and will run normal services \u2013 but as some of the affected operators usually run trains in Wales and Scotland, services on strike days may be more crowded than normal.These are the key questions and answers.Who is taking industrial action, and when?The biggest rail union, the RMT, called` 20,000 of its members out on strike on Thursday 20, Saturday 22 and Saturday 29 July.

Both have dispatched teams to help customers.Tui customers on the island are being told: \u201cWe are aware that many of our guests are now located at evacuation centres or found temporary shelter at other hotels. We are relentlessly working on improving the situation for our guests and our teams are working closely with the local authorities.\u201cCustomers currently in Rhodes will return on their intended flight home.\u201dHolidaymakers were evacuated from their hotels and left their belongings behind  (AP)Rhodes airport is on the northwestern shore of the Greek island, close to the capital, Rhodes Town. With no imminent danger in that area, airlines are entitled to operate a \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d policy, with normal terms applying.But most are expected to provide some options to customers, with package holidaymakers benefiting from extra protection.It comes after holidaymakers were forced to flee resorts on Saturday, with some British tourists describing \u201cterrifying\u201d scenes of turmoil as power cuts caused \u201cchaos\u201d on the island. Thousands of tourists have been evacuated  (AP)In previous days the wildfire was confined to the island\u2019s mountainous centre, but aided by winds, very high temperatures and dry conditions, it spread on Saturday towards the coast on the island\u2019s central-eastern side.The Foreign Office advises travellers to contact their airline or travel operator. For 24/7 British consular assistance, UK citizens abroad can call +44 20 7008 5000.The FCDO has also sent a Rapid Deployment Team to Rhodes to support British nationals, and the Greek Foreign Affairs ministry has set up a help desk at Rhodes airport.I am in Rhodes and want to leave as soon as possible. What are my options?Many tourists are in that position. Jet2 and easyJet are operating special repatriation flights in addition to the normal schedule. The general principle is that British Airways says passengers booked to fly from Rhodes to London can switch to earlier flights without penalty \u2013 though little space may be available. The earliest BA departure with space available is on Wednesday evening.Other carriers may adopt a similar policy. But availability is scarce, with no seats on easyJet flights to the London area until late on Tuesday evening, and not before Wednesday to Manchester.Most airlines are operating their normal schedules, and are likely to continue to do so from Rhodes \u2013 though more outbound flights may be empty, as Jet2 and Tui are doing.Flights are full. Are there any other ways out from the island?Yes. Dodekanisos Seaways sails once or twice a day from Rhodes Town to Kos, where there are fairly frequent flights to the UK. The 8am sailing is usually the fastest and most reliable, taking around 2h30m. A taxi will take you from the port to the airport in about 30 minutes, with much cheaper but slower buses available.Flights on Tuesday 25 July include a Ryanair departure to London Stansted which is currently selling at just \u00a337.The ferry voyage to Marmaris in Turkey is shorter, at around one hour, but the closest airport, Dalaman, is a long way from the town \u2013 making for a 90-minute taxi journey or two hours in a bus. In addition the frontier formalities leaving Greece and arriving in Turkey will take time.I lost my travel documents in the scramble to leave the area. Can I leave the island?Yes. To help tourists who were evacuated from their accommodation in a hurry and left their passports behind, the Greek authorities are issuing emergency and temporary identification to allow them to board their flights.Ryanair says: \u201cPassengers departing from Rhodes should be advised that we will accept temporary travel documentation issued by the Greek Police.\u201dIf I am brought home early, will I get some or all of my money back?People who are anxious about being on the island but whose holidays have not been directly affected are unlikely to be offered any recompense for the lost holiday times. Package holidaymakers whose trips are curtailed because their accommodation cannot be used are due a partial refund under the Package Travel Regulations. But it may not be as much as the traveller might expect.If a two-week holiday that cost \u00a31,000 per person ends a week early, the refund will not simply be half the cost of the trip, ie \u00a3500. The holiday company is entitled to subtract the value of the flights, which might be \u00a3400 \u2013 meaning only half of the remainder will be refunded, ie \u00a3300.If you make the decision to return ahead of schedule, no compensation is due. Travel insurance may help with extra costs if you can demonstrate you spent them reasonably.I am booked to travel imminently to Rhodes. Can I cancel for a refund?If the travel firm or airline cancels your trip you can expect a full refund within two weeks. If the flight is going ahead, then your rights depend on whether you are on a proper package holiday or have booked flights and accommodation separately.Under the Package Travel Regulations, holidaymakers can cancel for a refund \u201cif unavoidable and extraordinary circumstances occur at the place of destination or its immediate vicinity which significantly affect the performance of the package or the carriage of passengers to the destination\u201d.In the case of key parts of Rhodes, this looks like reasonable grounds to cancel.These are the companies\u2019 policies for imminent departures as of 4pm on Monday.British Airways: passengers booked to Rhodes in the next week can rebook for a different date up to November 2023.easyJet: all easyJet Holidays packages up to and including Tuesday 25 July are cancelled, with full refunds offered. Flight only passengers booked to travel to or from Rhodes until 29 July can transfer for free to another date or can request a flight voucher by calling easyJet Customer Services on 0330 551 5151.Jet2: all flights and holidays that are due to depart to Rhodes up to and including 30 July have been cancelled, with full refunds offered.Ryanair: \u201cFlights to/from Rhodes Airport are currently operating as normal and unaffected by the forest fires. Please check your Ryanair app where you will be notified of any changes to your Ryanair flight.\u201dThomas Cook: the online travel agent is allowing customers due to depart to holidays in the affected areas in Kiotari and Lardos up to 31 July to cancel their holidays for a full refund. Customers booked to travel to elsewhere in Rhodes on Tuesday and Wednesday are being offered full refunds.Tui: \u201cWe have cancelled all outbound flights to Rhodes up to and including Friday 28 July, and have also cancelled all outbound flights for customers travelling to impacted hotels up to and including on Sunday 30 July. All customers due to travel on these flights will receive full refunds. Passengers due to travel to areas not affected by fires on Saturday 29 and Sunday 30 July will be offered a fee free amend to another holiday or the option to cancel for a full refund. \u201cI am booked to travel to Rhodes in August. Can I cancel?Not at this stage. Depending on events over the next few days, travel firms will make decisions on their plans for the peak summer month.The travel industry appears to be preparing the ground for a restart in tourism to some of the unaffected areas of Rhodes. A spokesperson for Abta, the travel association, said: \u201cWe understand that some of the resorts have had their evacuation order removed by the Greek authorities and people have been advised that they can return to the resorts of Lindos, Pefkos and Kalathos.\u201cTravel companies will be liaising with their accommodation providers to ensure that they are ready to receive customers and customers will be notified accordingly.\u201dWould you go to Rhodes?I sympathise with everyone who is feeling apprehensive about travelling to an island that, in places, is nothing short of a disaster area. Even though distressed and exhausted holidaymakers are still trying to return from Rhodes, some tourists have been proceeding with their trips as booked in the past few days.But I would not travel there immediately: with people still trying to get out and the infrastructure under pressure, it would be unhelpful.Looking ahead a few days, though, I believe the picture will change significantly. By tomorrow I believe the vast majority of people who understandably want to come home will have done so: large amounts of air capacity are going in as repatriation flights. Pressure on the resources will ease. And the damage to the resorts on the south east shore of Rhodes will be clear.For people who are booked to the affected area, it may be that you are offered a choice between moving to a different location or a full refund. But getting all your money back is likely to be offered only if the travel firm deems it impossible for you to have a safe and enjoyable holiday.The people of Rhodes have shown outstanding kindness and courage towards overseas tourists. In most parts of the island \u2013 and 90 per cent is unaffected \u2013 they will want to get back to work delivering great experiences for visiting holidaymakers. And, in a week or two, I would be glad to go there and meet them.Meanwhile, what is happening in Corfu?A wildfire, which some reports say was started deliberately, has led to evacuations of some villages and a few hotels in the north east of the Ionian island.A Tui spokesperson said on Monday: \u201cWe\u2019ve been working with the local authorities in Corfu following the outbreak of a wildfire in the north east of the island last night resulting in guests being evacuated from a small number of hotels.\u201cAs a precautionary measure we also stopped new arrivals into the affected hotels for Monday 24 and Tuesday 25 July. The situation is now fully under control and guests are returning to their hotels to continue their holidays as planned.\u201dThe Abta spokesperson said: \u201cThe situation in Corfu is quite different to the situation in Rhodes. The wildfire on the north east of the island of Corfu is on a much smaller scale and is affecting significantly fewer holidaymakers.\u201cSome of the resorts were evacuated as a precautionary measure and we understand that those who were initially evacuated have mostly been able to return to their resorts and their accommodation.RecommendedBrits \u2018virtually forced\u2019 to pick flights over trains due to \u2018overpriced\u2019 rail faresTourists fined \u00a31,200 each for \u2018extremely dangerous\u2019 selfie More rail disruption as union announces new August overtime ban for train drivers\u201cCorfu is a very large island.

During the conversation, Tyson went on to reveal her pronouns, while noting that the spelling of her name has gone from \u201cChris\u201d to \u201cKris\u201d.\u201cI am a woman! She/her,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve never said that publicly, but I\u2019ve been fully confident in that decision for over a year now.\u201dTyson said that, while she made changes to her appearance eight months ago, such as growing out her hair, she wasn\u2019t sure how to describe her gender at the time. However, she said she still knew that she \u201cwas not cisgender\u201d and \u201cneeded the freedom to figure out\u201d who she was and \u201cexpress\u201d herself.She recalled that, after she questioned what masculinity means, she realised that she felt defined by being the \u201cguy\u201d in MrBeast\u2019s videos.RecommendedMrBeast claims he turned down trip on Titanic submarine days before fatal disasterDeaf people like me deserve better than MrBeast\u2019s latest piece of \u2018inspiration porn\u2019\u2018This is getting absurd\u2019: MrBeast hits out at transphobic backlash against his friend\u2019s hormone therapy\u201cFor a while, I was trying gender fluid. I was like, \u2018What is making me feel like I\u2019m bi-gender? What is tying me to this masculinity?\u2019\u201d Tyson explained. \u201cAfter a lot of talking with a therapist and a lot of self-reflection, I realised it was really just this societal pressure of, \u2018You\u2019re Chris from MrBeast. You\u2019re the guy that starts the fires. You\u2019re the guy that builds the stuff.\u2019 My whole life I\u2019ve enjoyed doing those things, but I\u2019ve never really felt like \u2018the guy.\u2019\u201dTyson then recalled how she first publicly shared in April that she\u2019s been doing hormone replacement therapy (HRT), which is when people take hormones as part of their \u201cgender transition to help their bodies and appearance align with their gender identity,\u201d according to Planned Parenthood.As she expressed how \u201cfreeing\u201d it was for her to officially come out in her interview with Padilla, she also described how the HRT allowed her to \u201caccept [herself] and be able to look in the mirror and say, \u2018Yes, you are a woman.\u2019\u201dShe went on to recall the \u201cvivid dreams\u201d she had about being a woman, during a point where she didn\u2019t feel \u201cconnected\u201d to herself. However, according to Tyson, that ultimately changed when she started taking her hormones.\u201cI would wake up in the morning and it was just like getting ripped out of a reality that I didn\u2019t want to be taken out of,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were times where I would just sleep all day because it was more fun or more enjoyable to do that because the real world. I didn\u2019t feel connected to it. I really never felt connected to my body until I started taking HRT.\u201dShe noted that, after two to three weeks of taking HRT, she had a \u201cmental clarity\u201d in which she felt like \u201ca fog that had been around [her]\u201d had \u201cjust went away\u201d.\u201cI could see things clearly, I felt confident in who I was. I knew who I was finally, surely, truly without a shadow of a doubt and that is what really saved my life,\u201d she said.Following her interview with Padilla, Tyson also shared a post on Twitter on Friday about coming out as a transgender woman. \u201cNew pronouns just dropped,\u201d she tweeted.On Saturday, she also shared a screenshot of an April tweet from MrBeast, in which he defended her against a YouTube video, titled: \u201cWhy Chris will be a nightmare for MrBeast.\u201dIn response to the title, the YouTube star \u2013 whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson \u2013 expressed that he supported Tyson\u2019s decision to undergo HRT. \u201cYeah this is getting absurd.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeAmerica Ferrera\u2019s monologue in Barbie has been praised by viewers for highlighting the real difficulties of being a woman.The live-action Barbie film directed by Greta Gerwig, who also co-wrote the movie alongside partner Noah Baumbach, debuted in cinemas on 21 July. The movie has since earned a whopping $155m (\u00a3120m) in US box offices during opening weekend alone.Spoilers ahead.The Warner Bros movie follows the iconic Barbie doll, dubbed Stereotypical Barbie, as she ventures out of Barbieland into the real world to repair a rift between the two universes. However, as Barbie, played by Margot Robbie, confronts ideas of patriarchy and sexism in the real world, she embarks on a journey of self-discovery as a human.The film has since been lauded by critics as a \u201cnear-miraculous achievement,\u201d but perhaps it\u2019s one monologue delivered by actor America Ferrera that steals the show.RecommendedBarbie smashes box-office records and nearly doubles Oppenheimer\u2019s earnings \u2013 latest movie newsMargot Robbie\u2019s friends outraged she didn\u2019t kiss Ryan Gosling in Barbie: \u2018What\u2019s wrong with you?\u2019Greta Gerwig explains Barbie\u2019s \u2018mic-drop\u2019 ending: \u2018I knew I wanted to end on a joke\u2019Ferrera \u2013 known for her roles in Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants and the comedy series Ugly Betty \u2013 plays Gloria in the Barbie film.

But it\u2019s Ferrera\u2019s poignant monologue that gets Robbie\u2019s character out of her funk, and which touched the thousands of women who saw the Barbie movie on opening weekend.\u201cIt is literally impossible to be a woman,\u201d Gloria tells Barbie. \u201cYou are so beautiful, and so smart, and it kills me that you don\u2019t think you\u2019re good enough. Like, we always have to be extraordinary, but somehow we\u2019re always doing it wrong.\u201d\u201cYou have to be thin, but not too thin,\u201d she continues. \u201cAnd you can never say you want to be thin. You have to say you want to be healthy, but also you have to be thin. You have to have money, but you can\u2019t ask for money because that\u2019s crass. You have to be a boss, but you can\u2019t be mean ... You\u2019re supposed to love being a mother, but don\u2019t talk about your kids all the damn time. You have to be a career woman, but also always be looking out for other people. You have to answer for men\u2019s bad behaviour, which is insane, but if you point that out, you\u2019re accused of complaining. You\u2019re supposed to stay pretty for men, but not so pretty that you tempt them too much or that you threaten other women because you\u2019re supposed to be a part of the sisterhood. But always stand out and always be grateful. But never forget that the system is rigged. So find a way to acknowledge that but also always be grateful.\u201cYou have to never get old, never be rude, never show off, never be selfish, never fall down, never fail, never show fear, never get out of line. It\u2019s too hard! It\u2019s too contradictory and nobody gives you a medal or says thank you! And it turns out in fact that not only are you doing everything wrong, but also everything is your fault.\u201dIn the scene, Gloria then admits that she\u2019s \u201cso tired\u201d of watching herself and \u201cevery single other woman tie herself into knots so that people will like us\u201d. \u201cAnd if all of that is also true for a doll just representing women, then I don\u2019t even know,\u201d she concluded.The Barbie monologue highlighted the many double standards and contradictions that women face in a patriarchal society, which is why thousands of fans took to Twitter to praise the powerful message.\u201cReading America Ferrera\u2019s monologue in #Barbie before I go to bed every night like it\u2019s my Bible,\u201d said one user on Twitter.\u201cMade me cry,\u201d another viewer said of the scene.\u201cActually shed tears during this part! It is impossible to be a woman!\u201d a third user wrote, while someone else said: \u201cPeople in my movie theatre started clapping when she was finished and I thought that was beautiful.\u201d Others took the moment to applaud Ferrera\u2019s Oscar-worthy delivery of the monologue, as well as screenwriter Greta Gerwig\u2019s ability to create a heart-wrenching, standout moment across her three films: Lady Bird, Little Women, and now, Barbie.\u201cWoke up thinking about America Ferrera\u2019s monologue in Barbie,\u201d tweeted one fan. \u201cWill go down as one of the best scenes of the year!\u201d\u201cThanks Greta, for saying what we all feel but do not have the courage to say it,\u201d another wrote.\u201cGreta Gerwig really knows how to pull off that big third act monologue about being a woman that makes you cry and hits you right in the feelings because she\u2019s somehow speaking to very common experiences we rarely utter out loud - and I love her for that,\u201d said someone else.Despite the high praise, some critics believed that the Barbie monologue was basic and surface-level, with one viewer comparing its messaging to \u201cintro level feminism\u201d. Still, fans pointed out the importance of witnessing such a truthful representation of womanhood on their screens.\u201cI\u2019ve seen criticism that this is \u2018intro level feminism\u2019 and yeah, maybe, but it felt so affirming to have it said out loud in a major blockbuster film,\u201d one person said. \u201cI loved #Barbie, and this stays with me.\u201dSpeaking to VanityFair, America Ferrera revealed that it took \u201c30 to 50\u201d takes to film her impassioned speech. \u201cWe shot it over two days,\u201d the Barbie star told the outlet. \u201cIt\u2019s one part of a much bigger scene with lots of characters in it. I had to do it many, many times for other people\u2019s coverage and to get through the whole scene and over the course of two days.\u201d\u201cIt was probably 30 to 50 full runs of it, top to bottom,\u201d Ferrera said, before adding that Ariana Greenblatt had the monologue memorised because of \u201chow many times\u201d she ran through the lines.The 39-year-old actor also praised Gerwig for giving her \u201cso much freedom\u201d with the monologue.RecommendedAmerica Ferrera points out \u2018revolutionary\u2019 detail in original Barbie DreamhouseAmerica Ferrera reveals her guilty pleasure is \u2018not showering for a few days\u2019MrBeast\u2019s Kris Tyson comes out as transgender\u201cThere were moments in shooting the movie where Greta really had written something in a very specific way that she heard a very specific way in her head with particular cadence in a particular speed or a particular inflection,\u201d Ferrera said. \u201cI thought maybe this would be like that, but it was the opposite. She wanted me to completely make it my own and find it as we did it.\u201dFollowing Barbie\u2019s theatrical release, Greta Gerwig film broke the domestic box office record for biggest opening weekend ever for a female director. The film is estimated to amass more than $300m (\u00a3233m) internationally, making it the most successful opening of an original non-superhero film ever."}, {"_id": "64bef84a51ac33362ba19bff", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/love-island-usa-worker-lawsuit-b2379931.html", "primaryCategory": "Lifestyle", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Love Island USA producers sued by former staffers", "lead": "<p>Two crew members allege contestant mistreatment and a California employment law violation </p>", "author": "Kaleigh Werner", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 20:53:37", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:16:42.189501", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-24T20:53:37+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2022/09/07/14/love_island_sr8_01.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Stay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletterStay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticePrevious Love Island USA staffers have filed a lawsuit against two of the show\u2019s producers for serious mistreatment and for violating California employment laws during the fourth season. A filing obtained by People confirms previous Villaworkers Jasmine Crestwell and Alex Rinks are suing the Love Island USA producers ITV and NBCUniversal. Allegedly, individuals from the Love Island UK franchise were brought on the show to help boost ratings even though there had been previous reports of \u201cracism and abusive practices\u201d by UK crew members, leading to negative impacts on the Islanders\u2019 mental health. According to Crestwell and Rink's complaint, the executive producers were pressuring female contestants \u201cto engage in sexual relationships without regard for their personal preferences or genuine consent,\u201d which contributed to their alleged \u201cflippant\u201d ideas on sexual consent. In addition, the filing claimed that the producers \u201copenly commented on video feeds of female Islanders showering and having sex, creating a deeply uncomfortable work environment for women on set\u201d.Serenti Springs was specifically named in the lawsuit as \u201cone of the few women of colour on the show,\u201d who was allegedly severely mistreated compared to the other contestants. Specifically, producers would purposefully hinder \u201cher ability to forge connections with male cast members, thus sabotaging her chances on the show,\u201d the lawsuit said.Crestwell claimed she told producer Sophie Bush about Springs\u2019 mistreatment, to which Bush allegedly replied: \u201cWe are protecting her because we know none of the boys on the show like her, and we would hate to see her get rejected.\u201dRecommendedLove Island star landed role in Barbie movie thanks to dating-show superfan Margot RobbieLove Island: Rita Ora to surprise islanders with private performanceThe filing also addresses complaints Rink brought about the Villa\u2019s conditions during the fourth season. She said not only was the Villa still under construction but the place had \u201cunsafe and unsanitary conditions in the show\u2019s supposedly luxe \u2018villa\u2019 - in reality, a ramshackle, dilapidated ranch with inadequate plumbing and inoperable bathrooms\u201d. Due to the alleged construction still going on, contestants were apparently \u201crestricted to specific portable toilets connected to their rooms\u201d.Following Crestwell and Rink\u2019s complaints made to the producers, the team set up a time to meet in a \u201csafe space\u201d to address their concerns, but Crestwell and Rink say that the discussion was really a \u201ctrap\u201d for the producers to fire them. According to the lawsuit, Crestwell and Rink\u2019s termination violated the California employment law. The specific violation falls under the written law that states, \u201cretaliation against employees who make legally protected complaints of discrimination and OSHA violations\u201d.A spokesperson from ITV America denied the claims outlined in the lawsuit in a statement to The Independent. \u201cThis is a frivolous attack at an opportunistic moment, timed to the season five debut, made by two former employees who were terminated for cause, purely in relation to their job performance,\u201d the spokesperson said. The statement continued: \u201cThese characterisations are false. Love Island USA\u2019s commitment to diversity and proven track record speaks for itself. We categorically deny the allegations and look forward to defending against these claims in a court of law.\u201d RecommendedMolly-Mae Hague and Tommy Fury announce engagement four years after Love IslandMontana Brown opens up about struggle to conceive before son\u2019s birthMargot Robbie has fangirl moment over Love Island stars Ekin-Su, Davide and LibertyThe Independent has requested a comment from NBCUniversal.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe internet is roasting Ben Shapiro after he watched the Barbie movie wearing an outfit that was almost identical to the one Ryan Gosling wears as Ken.On 21 July, the conservative commentator tweeted a photo of himself inside a movie theatre where he attended a screening of the new Barbie film, which stars Margot Robbie as the titular Barbie doll and Ryan Gosling as her paramour, Ken.\u201cMy producers dragged me to see \u2018Barbie\u2019 and it was one of the most woke movies I have ever seen,\u201d Shapiro wrote on Twitter, alongside a photo of himself wearing a black T-shirt tucked into a pair of black pants with a matching black belt. \u201cMy full review of this flaming garbage heap of a film will be out on my YouTube channel tomorrow at 10am ET.\u201dUnsurprisingly, it didn\u2019t take long for many Barbie fans to point out that Shapiro was seemingly wearing the exact outfit that Gosling wears as Ken during the film\u2019s musical performance of \u201cI\u2019m Just Ken\u201d.\u201cYou hated it so much you cosplayed as a Ken,\u201d replied one user on Twitter.RecommendedBen Shapiro mocked for posting 43-minute video rant about Barbie movie as he sets fire to dollBarbie on track to earn biggest ever box office opening for non-superhero filmWith \u2018Barbie,\u2019 Greta Gerwig breaks a box office record for female directors\u201cMy brother in Christ, you are wearing a Ken cosplay,\u201d another person joked. \u201cI hated it so much I had to dress like ken and get a cute outfit photo with the movie poster,\u201d a third person said, while someone else wrote: \u201cKen Shapiro out here pretending he was \u2018dragged\u2019 to this movie while giving full Kenergy.\u201dDespite his accidental Ken fashion moment, Ben Shapiro proceeded to post a 43-minute scathing review about the \u201cwoke\u201d Warner Bros film. \u201cWell, folks, wasting two hours of my precious time, two hours I will never get back, two hours around my deathbed I will wish that I had not spent that time doing. It makes me viscerally angry,\u201d he said, waving a notepad at the viewers and setting fire to a Barbie doll in the clip.Shapiro condemned Gosling\u2019s portrayal of Ken as \u201cannoying and ridiculous\u201d and criticised the film for including a transgender Barbie character, played by actor Hari Nef. The conservative commentator argued that many parts of the film are too mature for a younger audience, as he claimed that his theatre was full of \u201cyoungish and middle-aged moms\u201d with their \u201csix, seven and eight-year-old girls\u201d.He also refuted that the real world in the film has a patriarchal system, and pointed to the women-centric cast and crew of Barbie. \u201cI mean, Greta Gerwig is a lady. She\u2019s making a good living off of this,\u201d Shapiro said. \u201cMargot Robbie is playing the lead. In fact, the entire cast aside from basically Ryan Gosling is women, so it seems like women are doing okay.\u201dBen Shapiro isn\u2019t the only conservative to share their Barbie hot takes. Last week, Republican congressman Matt Gaetz and his wife Ginger Gaetz attended the red carpet premiere of Barbie at the British Embassy in Washington, DC. After the Barbie screening, his wife took to Twitter to share her list of critiques, including that the film \u201cneglects to address any notion of faith or family\u201d and that it contained \u201cdisappointingly low T from Ken\u201d.\u201cThinking about watching the Barbie movie? I\u2019d recommend sticking to getting outfit inspiration and skipping the theater,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cHere\u2019s why: The Barbie I grew up with was a representation of limitless possibilities, embracing diverse careers and feminine empowerment. The 2023 Barbie movie, unfortunately, neglects to address any notion of faith or family, and tries to normalize the idea that men and women can\u2019t collaborate positively (yuck).\u201dRecommendedWoman goes viral with custom-made \u2018Barbenheimer\u2019 outfit for double-featureAmerica Ferrera points out \u2018revolutionary\u2019 detail in original Barbie DreamhouseAmerica Ferrera reveals her guilty pleasure is \u2018not showering for a few days\u2019Ginger Gaetz concluded her Barbie review by listing what she felt were the pros and cons of the movie. \u201cPros: Margot Robbie\u2019s performance, Stunning costume design, Amazing soundtrack,\u201d she wrote. \u201cCons: Unfortunate portrayal of big dreams causing anxiety instead of inspiration, Disappointingly low T from Ken, Unfair treatment of pregnant Barbie Midge.\u201dDespite Barbie\u2019s negative reviews from conservative commentators calling the newly-released film \u201cwoke\u201d, the live-action movie is estimated to amass more than $300m (\u00a3233m) internationally, making it the most successful opening of an original non-superhero film ever."}, {"_id": "64bef84b51ac33362ba19c06", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/joints-holding-you-back-this-potent-turmeric-supplement-is-the-secret-to-mobility-b2355969.html", "primaryCategory": "Lifestyle", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Joints holding you back?

Since then, fans have continued to criticise the American team, with claims that they were a \u201cdisgrace\u201d for \u201crefusing\u201d to sing.When asked about her thoughts on the online controversy at Monday\u2019s press conference, Girma expressed that each player can decide if they want to sing the anthem at the game or not.\u201cI think when we\u2019re out there we\u2019re preparing for the game, and that isn\u2019t the focus,\u201d she said, referring to the song. \u201cSo ultimately, every player has the choice.\u201dRecommendedWomen\u2019s World Cup 2023 LIVE: Italy and Germany win as Brazil begin campaign with victory over PanamaUS women\u2019s national player Naomi Girma pays tribute to late friend Katie Meyer ahead of World CupAre the United States still the team to beat at the Women\u2019s World Cup?Over the weekend, many people were quick to question the American players for their silence during the anthem, with claims that they weren\u2019t representing their country at the Women\u2019s World Cup.\u201cCan someone teach @USWNT the words to the \u2018Star Spangled Banner?\u2019\u201d one tweeted. \u201cTheir silence was deafening.\u201d\u201cNo one should be allowed to wear the American flag, and represent the US if they don\u2019t believe in it.

An international embarrassment,\u201d former New York City Police Commissioner, Bernard Bailey Kerik, added.Meanwhile, other people applauded the players for staying silent, with one tweeting: \u201cGrateful to live in a country where you aren\u2019t forced to sing or have a hand on your heart. Makes it so much more meaningful when you do it. I see the choice not to just as patriotic because of that.\u201dThis isn\u2019t the first time that a football team has opted not to sing their country\u2019s national anthem. In November 2022, Iran\u2019s football team maintained their silence throughout the anthem in their opening World Cup game against England. During the event, some Iranian fans mocked the team, while others held up signs saying, \u201cWoman, Life, Freedom\u201d.The players\u2019 decision came in support of anti-government protests in Iran at the time, sparked by the death of Mahsa Amini in police custody in September 2022. Amini, 22, had been detained by morality police for allegedly breaking the strict rules around head coverings.Meanwhile, American football star Megan Rapinoe has been vocal about why she chose not to sing during the national anthem. In September 2016, she made headlines for following in NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick\u2019s example by taking a knee during the national anthem, to help raise awareness of racial inequality and police brutality. One month later, she wrote an essay for The Players Tribune to explain the decision.\u201cI haven\u2019t experienced over-policing, racial profiling, police brutality or the sight of a family member\u2019s body lying dead in the street,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBut I cannot stand idly by while there are people in this country who have had to deal with that kind of heartache.\u201dRecommendedUS women\u2019s national player Naomi Girma pays tribute to late friend Katie MeyerEverything to know about Megan Rapinoe and Sue Bird\u2019s relationshipFans praise French Women\u2019s World Cup ad for its \u2018genius\u2019 twistShe continued: \u201cThere is no perfect way to protest.

Ahead of opening weekend, many fans affectionately nicknamed the double-billing as \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d and shared their plans to see one movie right after the other.Such was the case for one fan, who went viral on Twitter after she shared her two-in-one look, fitting for both the pink-filled Greta Gerwig movie and the Christopher Nolan biopic. The Twitter user \u2013 who goes by Danielle \u2013 posted a video of herself standing in front of an Oppenheimer movie poster, dressed in a black sleeveless jumpsuit with a black studded belt.As she strutted through the movie theatre lobby, she then ripped off the belt and unclasped the black jumpsuit to reveal a hot pink outfit underneath, complete with a Western-inspired tassel neckline. Danielle spun around before hopping into a life-size Barbie box that was on display in the corner of the theatre for photos. Danielle\u2019s \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d look received nearly 150,000 views on Twitter, where fans praised the designer for the ultimate double-feature outfit.RecommendedBarbie vs Oppenheimer: Greta Gerwig makes history with biggest box office opening for a female directorBarbie on track to earn biggest ever box office opening for non-superhero filmWhat order should you watch Barbie and Oppenheimer in?\u201cFlawless,\u201d one user replied, while another person wrote: \u201cAte and left no crumbs\u201d\u201cWe can all stop, this is the best post.

I pulled an all-nighter and constructed the entire garment the night before my Saturday double feature, but bought the fabrics and supplies a week before.\u201dDanielle also shared that she watched Oppenheimer, starring Cillian Murphy, before the Margot Robbie comedy. \u201cWe saw Oppenheimer first. Wanted to end the day with some laughs since Oppenheimer is so intense,\u201d she said.Fellow \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d viewers have wondered what order to view both Barbie and Oppenheimer, considering their radically different tones. Some have argued that the lighter tone of Barbie would make it a good pallette cleanser after the intensity of Oppenheimer, like Barbie star Issa Rae.\u201cI want to have mimosas and drinks and cocktails after Barbie, I don\u2019t want to, like, sulk,\u201d she said during a red carpet interview.West Side Story star Rachel Zegler agreed, writing on Twitter: \u201cI think it\u2019ll be Barbie first because I think Oppenheimer will hurt my brain and I would rather not be thinking about it during Barbie.\u201dRecommendedBen Shapiro mocked for dressing like Ken amid furious rants against Barbie movieAmerica Ferrera points out \u2018revolutionary\u2019 detail in original Barbie DreamhouseAmerica Ferrera reveals her guilty pleasure is \u2018not showering for a few days\u2019Others have claimed that the heavy content of Nolan\u2019s film would overshadow the levity of Barbie.

In the video, the reality star-turned-influencer could be seen trying on the $869 shoes in the store, before telling viewers: \u201cThese are coming home with me\u201d.However, Frankel realised that the shoes were likely fake after a TikToker named Jack Savoie stitched her TikTok and informed her that the heels were knockoffs.In Savoie\u2019s clip, he began: \u201cWait, Bethenny babe, those are fake Manolos.

I used to sell Manolos. I know this,\u201d the TikToker continued, before concluding: \u201cBethenny, I think you need to go return those shoes. These are fake.

First, they are only $1,000 retail. That\u2019s a scam to begin with. Second! I JUST ordered the real ones online and will compare,\u201d she wrote in the comments under the video.In the comments, the reality star also noted that it was \u201cweird\u201d that the size 40 fit her \u201cperfectly\u201d when she is typically a size 39.On Bergdorf Goodman\u2019s website, the Manolo Blahnik Hangisimu Satin Crystal Buckle Mules retail for $1,095.Over the weekend, Frankel addressed the situation in a follow-up video, where she described it as the \u201cmost effed-up thing yet\u201d.\u201cThis is the most effed-up thing yet. Okay, follow Jack Savoie.

There will be an $1,800 bag retail and they\u2019ll have it for $1,500. Sometimes I like the item, I\u2019m in there. The psychology is to feel like it\u2019s a treasure hunt, so you\u2019re finding something. And I love the store,\u201d she continued, before noting that \u201cnever did [she] think that there could be a fake product\u201d.In the video, Frankel then revealed that she reached out to TJ Maxx and showed the retailer Savoie\u2019s video, and that, in response, the company told her that it \u201cdid not purchase this particular shoe\u201d.\u201cIt\u2019s something that rarely happens, with a counterfeit return,\u201d Frankel continued, while noting that Savoie is \u201camazing\u201d for pointing out the flaws with the fake version of the heels.According to Frankel, the store asked her to provide her receipt, which she said she didn\u2019t have because she doesn\u2019t \u201creturn things to TJ Maxx for the most part,\u201d and that the company said it would refund her the money she\u2019d paid.\u201cBy the way, the shoes are $1,000 at Bergdorf\u2019s and it was weird that a 40 did fit me,\u201d she said.As for her response to the company\u2019s response, she told viewers: \u201cI effectively, without cursing, said to them: \u2018Eff that. No. A, I don\u2019t have the receipt and next, you\u2019re going to send me a larger check.\u2019\u201dAfter reiterating that she\u2019s already purchased an authentic pair of the heels from Bergdorf Goodman for $1,000, Frankel revealed that she would be keeping the counterfeit shoes.\u201cI\u2019m going to wear these fake counterfeit shoes with pride because I own them now, but do not buy luxury goods at TJ Maxx,\u201d she concluded, before noting that the \u201coriginal retailer is the safest\u201d.In the comments under her video, Frankel\u2019s followers shared their appreciation for her clarification, and for candidly calling out the retailer.\u201cThat\u2019s wild, I would never even think to check stuff from there is real,\u201d one person commented, while another said: \u201cThank you for always sharing and your honesty in calling someone out when needed!\u201dIn a statement to Insider, a spokesperson for TJ Maxx said the company \u201cstands behind the merchandise\u201d it sells before noting that it \u201csincerely regrets\u201d Frankel\u2019s recent experience.RecommendedSchoolboy almost dies from swallowing magnets for TikTok challengeWoman shares honest review of New York City apartment TikTok mom slammed after making 5-year-old son run in 104 degree heat\u201cWe believe that this may have been an instance of return fraud, in which an individual returned an item to our store that was not purchased at one of our stores.

The 36-year-old music legend, whose real name is Aubrey Drake Graham, isn\u2019t opposed to marriage, but he\u2019s not itching to get hitched either. \u201cIt seems like a thing of ancient times,\u201d he told Bobbi Althoff, 25, on Really Good podcast during his 20 July appearance. Drake lay in bed, drink in hand, next to Althoff as he told her he does see himself getting married to a non-celebrity one day. However, right now, he\u2019s not able to fully give his entire self to someone else. \u201cYou asked me why I haven\u2019t gotten married. The truth? I don\u2019t think I can offer somebody what they\u2019d be looking for right now,\u201d he honestly admitted. Drake noted that the commitment to marriage, emotionally and physically, wouldn\u2019t work with his music-focused schedule. To him, the \u201cconsistency\u201d that comes with a lifelong relationship does not coincide with his focus on his art. \u201cI think my work is my priority, so I wouldn\u2019t want to not contribute as a partner,\u201d the father of one remarked. After Althoff referred to him as a \u201ct**t\u201d who preferred hookup culture more than relationships, he noted he wasn\u2019t \u201cAmish\u201d. Drake\u2019s comment reportedly wasn\u2019t meant in an offensive manner, but to offer a contrasting argument to the podcast host\u2019s claim. The \u201cOne Dance\u201d rapper expressed concern over the potential of being with someone who was with him for his money only. Although he worries about that in a future partner, he hasn\u2019t necessarily experienced that with his former loves. He told Althoff that \u201cthe nicest thing a girl has ever done for him\u201d was create a leather-bound book filled with their memories.

The Canada-born star met Brussaux in 2017 and were spotted together in Amsterdam when he was supposedly dating Jennifer Lopez. Brussaux is a talented painter who was formerly going by the stage name \u201cRosee Divine.\u201d That same year, the 33-year-old artist gave birth to Adonis Mahbed Graham. Both parents are no longer in a relationship, but a source speaking to US Weekly three years ago confirmed that their co-parenting was working well, and their 5-year-old was \u201ca very happy boy.\u201d On the Rap Radar podcast in 2019, Drake reiterated his refusal to be in a long-term relationship with someone. \u201cI love my space, I love my work, and I love my routine and for me to break that for somebody, It would just have to be a really special person that fits into that puzzle, and that is supportive of the things I\u2019m doing,\u201d he told Elliot Wilson and Brian \u2018B. \u201cHave to be somebody that has taste in music.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeOne mother\u2019s restaurant hack for toddlers has the internet divided over whether it\u2019s ever appropriate to bring a meal from home. On 19 May, Karlie Smith (@unbreakablemomma) shared her tip for other moms who face the same difficulties with bringing their children to restaurants. For the single mom, she\u2019s found it\u2019s easier to pack her two-year-old food from home, so she doesn\u2019t get stuck paying for a menu item that he\u2019ll toss on the floor. \u201cCall me cheap, call me whatever, but if we\u2019re going out to a restaurant, I\u2019m packing my kid a meal,\u201d she proclaimed. \u201cI do this for many reasons. For one, you want me to pay $6.99 for chicken tenders and fries that my son is going to throw half of it on the floor? You\u2019re crazy.\u201dSmith went on to explain that she and her family usually get together for dinner on Friday nights, and this night, they were meeting at a restaurant. Rather than ordering the children\u2019s option she knew would go to waste, the 21-year-old mom opted for a homemade alternative: one peanut butter and jelly sandwich with sliced bananas, a chocolate Lara bar, and cheddar cheese cubes. Not only would the prepped meal save Smith money, but it would also save her a tantrum, she explained. \u201cAlso, when we get to a restaurant, my child is not waiting for anyone to take his order - he wants to eat now,\u201d the TikTok mom said. \u201cI can just hand him this and let him go to town. Also, my child is not opinionated. He does not care what he eats; he just wants to eat.\u201d RecommendedWoman goes viral for cooking \u2018perpetual stew\u2019 for 40 days straightWoman praised for response to airline employee who asked her to swap first class seat with childArgument on who should cover a $4,600 dinner bill goes viral, who should pay it?Although Smith likes to come prepared, she\u2019s not opposed to ordering her son something from the menu that he likes. In fact, she said that if he does want something from the restaurant, she will order it for him. Oftentimes, he will finish his packed meal and start on pieces from her plate. \u201cAlso, I usually get him chocolate milk because that\u2019s his little takeout treat,\u201d she added. Her candid video admission resulted in a viral debate, with fellow parents weighing in on the \u201chack\u201d.\u201cSeems like you are teaching him that he will always be catered to immediately. No patience. Maybe teach him table manners and he has to wait,\u201d one viewer wrote, while another noted: \u201cNo ma\u2019am we don\u2019t do this. I work ... to give my kids whatever they want especially when it comes to going out to eat.\u201d \u201cThis is so wrong,\u201d another follower commented. One TikTok user thought Smith shouldn\u2019t bring her son to a restaurant if she felt like she needed to bring his own food. Restaurant servers jumped in the conversation to point out that carrying in food from the outside may violate the establishment\u2019s allergy policy too.However, a few viewers noticed the benefit in Smith\u2019s restaurant hack. \u201cWe go out to dinner once a month as a treat and I let my three year old get something from the restaurant. I also bring puffs for her to snack on,\u201d one viewer said, while another remarked: \u201cListen, my child would much rather have Lunchables than anything on that menu.\u201d \u201cAs a mother to an autistic toddler who only eats select foods, I love this,\u201d someone else noted.Speaking with Today, Smith expressed shock over the number of viewers who didn\u2019t agree with her tactic, and said she couldn\u2019t believe people were accusing her of being \u201cabusive\u201d to her child over the concept.\u201cSome people said I was \u2018abusive\u2019 to my child. I would understand this better if he were 10,\u201d the mother of two admitted. \u201cI have always dealt with online mom-shaming and unsolicited advice for the most outrageous reasons. It\u2019s like dealing with a bunch of grandmas who say: \u2018Why isn\u2019t your baby wearing socks?\u2019\u201d\u201cFor some reason, parenting can be a big competition, as if people have something to prove in the comments section,\u201d she continued. \u201cAll the hate, disrespect and anger is unacceptable. You can agree to disagree.\u201d Because Smith noticed her son would toss restaurant food on the floor, she said she thought it was a smart idea to bring options she knew he liked from home. In sharing her hack, she hoped it would help other parents with children who display aversions to certain meals. Additionally, as a mother to both her two-year-old and a newborn, Smith is cognisant of children\u2019s needs to eat at certain times, and her son happens to be hungry as soon as they sit down to eat when they are out. \u201cI can feed my child from the moment we sit down at a table - which is when he wants to eat - instead of waiting for drink and entr\u00e9e orders,\u201d Smith explained.

According to the father, who\u2019s Reddit account u/throwR-7746 has since been suspended, his family\u2019s culture dictates that he and Peggy\u2019s father \u201cshare the costs for [the] wedding\u201d.He explained that he didn\u2019t want to follow through with the budget that Peggy\u2019s father recommended.\u201cPeggy\u2019s father said we should provide $10,000 each, a total $20,000 budget,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI could afford this, sure, but this seems insane and extravagant to me. I said I would give $5,000 and he could give whatever he wanted. Peggy\u2019s father also put up $5,000.\u201dThe former Reddit user explained that when he told his son about the $10,000 being contributed, the 23-year-old told him that \u201cit wasn\u2019t going to be enough\u201d for the wedding.

He outlined some prices and said the cheapest venue he could find was $5,000, and food alone was going to be $2,500.\u201dThe father explained that, while his son thanked him for \u201cgiving them money for the wedding,\u201d the 57-year-old still \u201cfelt hurt\u201d that his son \u201cthought [they] were not giving enough\u201d money. He also asked his son what services were needed for the wedding, such as the food and photographer. When the father questioned how the cost of the food could come out to $2,500, his son informed him that each plate was $25 per person. \u201cI suggested ordering pizzas or sub sandwiches but he looked at me like I was crazy,\u201d the father wrote. \u201cI said okay well we can just offer less for the photographer and decorator and he said that isn\u2019t how things are done.\u201dThe father added: \u201cMaybe if Peggy and him weren\u2019t so spoiled and expecting the best of the best for everything then $10,000 would be plenty.\u201dIn response, his son closed his eyes, thanked his father for the money, and \u201cbasically\u201d told him to \u201cget out\u201d.

You calling them spoiled was out of line and you should apologise.\u201dSome people explained how they\u2019ve seen wedding prices go up over the years, with one writing: \u201cI got married in 2012. I paid $50 per head for the venue and food. It was the cheapest venue in the area. That same venue now charges $150 per head for the exact same thing. Also don\u2019t even think about getting a photographer for under $1,000.\u201d According to The Knot\u2019s 2022 Real Weddings Study, which examined about 12,000 couples who were married last year in the US, the cost of hosting a wedding has significantly increased. For example, the study found that the \u201caverage cost of a wedding is $30,000, which is a $2,000 increase from last year\u2019s national average\u201d.The publication also found that, on average, the cost of a reception venue is $11,200, a live band costs $3,900, and the cost of DJ is $1,500.RecommendedHusband exposed for reaction to learning his wife is pregnant againPeople are divided over mother\u2019s restaurant hack for toddlers: \u2018We don\u2019t do this\u2019Woman praised for refusing to switch first class seat on plane with childAs noted by Brides Magazine, while there\u2019s no set rule for who pays for a wedding, the bride\u2019s family is \u201ctraditionally\u201d responsible for \u201cmost costs associated with the event\u201d.

Others poor planning is not your fault.\u201d \u201cNope, cause as a mom, it is a parent\u2019s responsibility to plan ahead. Just travelled to Europe for one and a half months with my toddler and no one had to move,\u201d another viewer said, while someone else agreed: \u201cAs a parent, you didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t even bring myself to ask someone to please get up so that I can use the loo, but there are literally people out there who ask to trade seats?\u201d one person asked. \u201cWorst part is the kid is usually like 12 and perfectly capable of being on their own for the flight,\u201d a viewer noted. The TikTok user\u2019s post comes after the CEO of global jewellery brand CONQUERing recorded a similar incident. Tammy Nelson was flying on Delta Airlines from Cincinnati, Ohio, to San Jose, California, when she was asked to swap seats with a woman who wanted to sit next to her two children. Nelson told Newsweek that she thought she may have been looking at the wrong window seat, but her ticket confirmed the mother was sitting in her place. \u201cWhen I confirmed I was looking at the correct seat, I thought she must have just mistakenly sat in the wrong seat. So I said, \u2018I\u2019m sorry but it seems you\u2019re in my seat\u2019, thinking she would realise it and move,\u201d she told Newsweek. The woman did not proceed to get up and explained she thought she could sit in Nelson\u2019s seat since she was with her children. Nelson didn\u2019t want to be difficult, but she confessed to her followers that she tends to get sick on flights and window seats help ease the nausea by allowing her to sleep. Just like they did with Dr Sabra, people commended Nelson for not giving up the spot she had booked. \u201cThe amount of families who aren\u2019t paying to select their seats together is mindblowing! You were 100 per cent right to not give up your seat,\u201d one follower said. The two influencers aren\u2019t the only passengers to experience a request for a seat swap as there\u2019s been a recent uptick in the number of people sharing their own stories on social media. Most individuals admit they refused to move, and, according to a travel etiquette expert, they are valid in doing so. Diane Gottsman, a national etiquette expert and founder of The Protocol School of Texas, spoke to The Independent about the one appropriate instance in which someone can request another passenger to switch their seat after having prebooked it. If a parent had tried their absolute hardest to find seats next to their children, but was unable to secure them, only then is it acceptable to ask if they can take someone\u2019s spot on the plane, train, bus, or any other mode of transportation.

In the clip, Dr Melillo revealed that he received a response from his DoorDash driver saying \u201cnice house\u201d after he\u2019d given them a \u201cgenerous tip\u201d.\u201cHas this ever happened to you with DoorDash? When you give someone a generous tip and they say \u2018nice house, thanks for the $5 for a 20-minute ride,\u2019\u201d the TikToker asked, while showing a screenshot of the message he\u2019d received from his delivery driver.In the video, Dr Melillo then added that, for reference, he lives in Rhode Island, where a \u201c10 to 20 minute ride is very common\u201d because the state \u201cprobably has the slowest speed limits in the country\u201d.The TikToker then showed viewers what he\u2019d ordered, with Dr Melillo revealing that he\u2019d ordered a falafel meal over rice with a side of extra sauce and a Snapple lemon iced tea.RecommendedPeople rally around DoorDash driver who was removed from app after confronting customer\u2018It\u2019s a bait and switch\u2019: Behind the \u2018fake\u2019 Uber Eats and DoorDash restaurants that are making customers furiousAccording to the receipt shared by the TikToker, the total cost of the meal ended up being $15.64, and that he\u2019d then added a $5 tip.\u201cThe total cost of my meal came to $15 so I thought a 30 per cent tip was pretty generous, and I\u2019m usually the type of person that tips when I even pick up food,\u201d Dr Melillo said, before adding: \u201cSo let me know, how much should I be tipping on a DoorDash order?\u201dIn the caption of the video, which has since been viewed more than 100,000 times, the TikToker wrote: \u201c@DoorDash tipping going too far?\u201dThe video has sparked a debate in the comments, with many assuring the TikToker that his tip was more than generous, and that the driver can see the tip amount before they agree to accept the order.\u201cI work for DoorDash and that is very generous,\u201d one person commented, while another said: \u201cYour tip was fine!\u201d\u201cThat message he sent you after a 30 per cent tip is crazy,\u201d someone else wrote.In the comments, Dr Melillo also revealed that he tries to \u201cgive more\u201d since he has experience working in the food industry. \u201cHaving worked in the food industry before entering the pharmacy world I know how hard others work so I try to give more since I\u2019ve been there,\u201d he wrote.However, others suggested that the TikToker\u2019s tip was not enough because it may not have been based on the distance that the driver had to drive to deliver the food.According to multiple viewers, \u201cit\u2019s more about the distance than the total of your food\u201d when it comes to leaving an adequate tip.\u201cI always do $1 a mile with $5 being the lowest. They use their gas, their mileage and have a higher insurance rate since they do delivery,\u201d one person commented.Another said: \u201cI usually recommend tipping two times the amount of miles to the restaurant. 5 miles = $10 tip.\u201d\u201c$1 per mile is the most fair. You\u2019re not tipping on the food, you\u2019re paying for delivery if that makes any sense,\u201d someone else wrote, while another revealed that they \u201cnever tip less than $10\u201d.The debate about tipping comes after a DoorDash driver was allegedly fired for cursing at a customer who tipped $5 on a $20 order. Earlier this month, TikTok user Lacey Purciful uploaded a video from a doorbell camera showing a delivery driver handing her a pizza box before telling her: \u201cI just want to say it\u2019s a nice house for a $5 tip.\u201dAfter the TikToker told the driver: \u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d he responded: \u201cF*** you.\u201d In the comments under the video, Purciful revealed that she had been in contact with DoorDash about the incident, and that the driver had been fired.RecommendedSchoolboy almost dies from swallowing magnets for TikTok challengeWoman shares honest review of New York City apartment TikTok mom slammed after making 5-year-old son run in 104 degree heatAt the time, a representative for DoorDash told Insider: \u201cRespectfully asking for a tip is acceptable but abusing or harassing someone is never acceptable.\u201dThe Independent has contacted Dr Melillo and DoorDash for comment."}, {"_id": "64bef84f51ac33362ba19c14", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/airline-passengers-seats-plane-rows-b2380124.html", "primaryCategory": "Lifestyle", "subCategories": "test", "title": "People are sharing photos of airline passengers who don\u2019t exit by row: \u2018Biggest pet peeve\u2019", "lead": "<p>\u2018Bad airplane etiquette continues,\u2019 one traveller writes</p>", "author": "Amber Raiken", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 15:13:27", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:16:47.071079", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-24T15:13:27+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/21/15/tiktok-plane-seats.png?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Stay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletterStay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Speaking to The Washington Post, former flight attendant Abbie Unger explained that, while it isn\u2019t an issue for people to stand up in the seating row after the flight lands, they shouldn\u2019t attempt to leave the plane before those sitting ahead of them.\u201cWhen the seat belt sign turns off everybody tries to stand up \u2060- which I get because you\u2019ve been sitting for a long time.

That\u2019s before there\u2019s any mention of the amount of waste each used cartridge can amount to.That\u2019s where the Epson EcoTank ET-2820 All-in-One Wireless Inkjet Printer (Was \u00a3209.99, now \u00a3179.99, Currys.co.uk) comes in. Featuring Epson\u2019s EcoTank technology, The et-2820 replaces proprietary plastic cartridges with refillable ink tanks that can have a serious saving on your printing costs while still being able to print, all without the added hassle of cartridge reloads.Save up to 90 per cent on your printing costsRefilling printer ink can be a fiddly and messy process, not to mention the added difficulty of where to responsibly dispose used cartridges once they have been depleted. EcoTank technology means that each tank can be individually topped up from a bottle, which not only saves on the amount of plastic used per refill but also significantly reduces the cost of ink. It\u2019s no small bonus that as an inkjet, EcoTank has a positive impact on your energy bills as well, particularly compared to more energy-intensive laser printers.Each printer comes bundled with four refillable bottles \u2013 one for each tank \u2013 which provides up to three years worth of printing, or 7,500 colour pages to be more precise. Ink levels are also clearly displayed in transparent containers at the front of the printer, so there\u2019s no need for second guessing when the ink might run dry midway through a printing job.When you do eventually make it through each bottle, they can simply be disposed of with household recycling, so there\u2019s no need to plan a trip to your local recycling point or feel a pang of guilt for throwing it out with your household waste.No more messy cartridges (Currys)The \u201cjust fill and chill\u201d mentality, courtesy of none other than Usain Bolt, Epson\u2019s brand ambassador, is central to the EcoTank experience that places convenience and affordability at its centre, while still able to print up to ten pages per minute.It\u2019s why the ET-2820 is designed with the busy household in mind. Whether that\u2019s transferring documents from your hybrid office or printing off homework assignments, its all-in-one scanning, printing and copying capabilities make it well suited to a variety of different tasks all around the home, from the comfort of your smart device or the printer\u2019s 3.7cm LCD display.The Epson Smart Panel app enables you to control your printer with great ease.

That\u2019s why it\u2019s the ideal time to pick up a new Xbox console to make the most of what those new titles have to offer.But investing in a new gaming device can be a costly endeavour, having to pay upfront for a console before any new games can be factored into that equation means that it can get prohibitively expensive.But picking up a new Xbox no longer has to be a daunting purchase, as customers can spread the cost through Xbox All Access at GAME.Xbox All Access allows new players to pick up either an Xbox Series X (\u00a3449.99, Game.co.uk) or an Xbox Series S (\u00a3249.99, Game.co.uk) from \u00a320.99 a month over 24 months, with zero per cent APR, no upfront cost and no additional cost compared to purchasing equivalent products outright.Not only that, it also includes a Game Pass Ultimate subscription (worth \u00a310.99 a month) for the duration of the 24 months period, Game.co.uk. Xbox Game Pass works much like a typical subscription service but instead of streaming films and shows, it allows players to play over 100 titles ranging from reimagined classics such as Halo: The Master Chief Collection to popular new releases like Minecraft Legends that the whole family can enjoy, all at no extra cost.Other Microsoft-exclusive titles, such as Forza Horizon 5 and the upcoming sci-fi role-playing game Starfield, are also regularly added to the service as soon as they are released, meaning that there\u2019s always new titles to play on a monthly basis. Those games aren\u2019t limited to your new Xbox either. Select titles can also be played across PC, console, mobile and tablet devices as well.So which console is right for you?

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeEight habits that could help people live more than 20 years longer have been identified by researchers.While it\u2019s long been known that certain lifestyle factors can influence lifespan, the American study isolated the eight factors that have the biggest impact \u2013 being physically active, being free from opioid addiction, not smoking, managing stress, having a good diet, not regularly binge drinking, having good sleep hygiene, and having positive social relationships.The research was presented at Nutrition 2023, the annual meeting of the American Society for Nutrition, and used data from 719,147 people enrolled in the Veterans Affairs Million Veteran Program.It found low physical activity, opioid use and smoking were associated with around a 30-45% higher risk of death, while stress, binge drinking, poor diet, and poor sleep hygiene were each associated with around a 20% increase, and lack of positive social relationships was linked with a 5% increased risk of dying.Men who had all eight habits at age 40 were predicted to live an average 24 years longer than men with none of the habits, according to the findings, and women with all eight habits in middle age were predicted to live an extra 21 years, compared with women with none of the habits.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveXuan-Mai Nguyen, health science specialist at the Department of Veterans Affairs, said: \u201cWe were really surprised by just how much could be gained with the adoption of one, two, three, or all eight lifestyle factors. Our research findings suggest that adopting a healthy lifestyle is important for both public health and personal wellness. The earlier the better, but even if you only make a small change in your 40s, 50s, or 60s, it still is beneficial.\u201dThe researchers say the findings highlight how lifestyle factors contribute to chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease, which are associated with premature disability and death.How to embrace the eight healthy habits\u00a0Inspired to give your own lifestyle a boost?\u00a0\u201cIf making these small but mighty adjustments could help you to live for an extra 20 years, maybe it\u2019s time to make those changes,\u201d says life and wellbeing coach, Natalie Trice. She shares the following insights and tips\u20261. Do more exerciseRegular exercise can help prevent a wide range of major diseases \u2013 plus it\u2019s great for keeping stress levels in check. \u201cGoing for a walk, having a swim, running with friends, even just a good old dance-off in the kitchen can get your heartbeat up and those feel-good endorphins pumping \u2013 so get your trainers on and start moving,\u201d says Trice.2. Manage stressTrice suggests adopting simple stress-busting practices such as mindfulness meditation, and enjoying hobbies and sports. \u201cThese can profoundly impact overall wellbeing, as you bring your stress levels down,\u201d she says. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about pretending everything\u2019s great, but rather looking at easy habits you can adopt that will take down the stress, which can lead to anxiety and burnout.\u201d3. Don\u2019t smokeQuitting smoking is an essential step in improving health and potentially adding years to your life. Trice points out that while some people may think reaching for a cigarette takes the edge off their stress, there are healthier ways to cope.\u201cMaybe going running or taking up yoga could be the release and focus you need, and one that will help you live longer, smell fresher and feel better,\u201d she suggests. \u201cAlso, with the cost of cigarettes going up all the time, giving up will free up cash for the things in life that really need to be paid for.\u201dIf you are struggling to quit smoking, talk to your GP about options available to help.4. Don\u2019t binge drink\u201cBy cutting down on booze, you\u2019re doing your body and brain a massive favour,\u201d says Trice. \u201cDrinking every night will impact your body and could affect your sleep and work performance. Enjoy life, but if you want to enjoy it for longer, then keep tabs on your drinking.\u201dOfficial guidelines suggest drinking no more than 14 units of alcohol a week (equivalent to six medium glasses of wine of six pints of beer), spread across at least three days.5. Eat healthilyGenerally speaking, a balanced diet that\u2019s rich in fibre, whole grains, fruit and veg and lean protein, with heavily processed and sugary foods kept to a minimum,\u00a0 is linked with better health.\u201cWe all know about eating five-a-day but doing this can be tough if you\u2019re busy with family and work. If you can start to do this, you\u2019ll feel better,\u201d says Trice. \u201cFocus on eating regularly and thinking about what you put in your body, so that it works for you, not against you.\u201d6. Don\u2019t take drugsRecreational drugs can harm health in a number of ways. Trice suggests those affected start by speaking to a trusted friend or their GP, and \u201clook at the support which could not only extend your life, but save it\u201d.7. Try to get good sleepTrice says: \u201cIt\u2019s vital that we look at getting a decent night\u2019s sleep, as this can help you feel so much better. Making sure you have a sleep routine in place can be helpful and can be as easy as having no screens in the bedroom, having a bath or shower before you hit the sack, as well as making sure the temperature is right and you have curtains to keep the light out in the mornings.\u201dRecommendedGeorge Alagiah: What are the signs of bowel cancer?Carol Vorderman says she no longer sunbathes after health scareCarol Vorderman: Why my skin cancer scare means I no longer sunbathe8. Nurture positive social relationshipsTrice observes: \u201cIf you\u2019re able to nurture a supportive network of friends, colleagues and family, this can lead to improved mental and emotional wellbeing and a longer life.\u201dLacking social connections? Look at local volunteering opportunities and community walks and groups. Making friends can take time, but even finding ways to regularly spend time and interact with others can help."}, {"_id": "64bef85051ac33362ba19c1a", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/royal-family/meghan-harry-breakup-rumours-fans-b2380639.html", "primaryCategory": "Royal Family", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Fans defend Prince Harry and Meghan Markle amid breakup rumours", "lead": "<p>The royal couple sparked breakup rumours after their Spotify deal fell through </p>", "author": "Kaleigh Werner", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 12:47:04", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:16:48.336800", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-24T12:47:04+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/16/15/Spotify-Harry-Meghan_37737.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Stay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletterStay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

According to Entertainment Tonight, reports circulated that the 38-year-old Duke of Sussex had gotten a hotel room for space and time away from his wife. On 18 July, RadarOnline reported on Harry and Meghan\u2019s rocky patch, claiming the two are \u201ctaking time apart\u201d.

Meanwhile, Harry wanted to bring on Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, and Mark Zuckerberg, but executives weren\u2019t up for it.However, a separate source told Page Six that the duo is still together and happily married.

It\u2019s further alienated him from his friends and his family and I think, inevitably, that has put a strain on them.\u201dWhile the false narratives continue to surround the married pair, fans are shooting down the speculation on social media. One royal fan tweeted: \u201cPlease know that I\u2018m a big fan of Meghan since her Suits time and of Prince Harry since his early years. My mother was a fan of his mom as I am.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeBBC presenter George Alagiah has died at the age of 67, after nearly a decade of living with bowel cancer.The newsreader was first diagnosed in 2014. He underwent several rounds of treatment after the cancer returned and spread over the last few years.In a statement, his agent Mary Greenham said: \u201cGeorge fought until the bitter end but sadly that battle ended earlier today. George was deeply loved by everybody who knew him, whether it was a friend, a colleague or a member of the public.\u201cHe simply was a wonderful human being. My thoughts are with Fran, the boys and his wider family.\u201dEarlier this year, Alagiah opened up about a symptom he wished he had caught earlier: blood in his stools. He was taking part in an NHS campaign to encourage the wider public to take up its bowel cancer screening program.RecommendedGeorge Alagiah death: BBC newsreader dies aged 67 after bowel cancer diagnosis\u2018One of the best and bravest\u2019: George Alagiah obituary as long-serving BBC newsreader passes away\u2018It\u2019s not the doom and gloom you might think\u2019: Jonnie Irwin details experience with palliative hospice careHe urged people who have received a free test kit from the health service \u201cnot to ignore it\u201d because it \u201ccould save your life\u201d.\u201cHad I been screened, I could have been picked up. I would have been screened at least three times and possibly four by the time I was 58 and this would have been caught at the stage of a little polyp: snip, snip,\u201d he said at the time.Alagiah received his diagnosis after speaking to doctors about finding blood in his stools. He underwent 17 rounds of chemotherapy and five operations to treat the disease, which eventually spread to his liver and lymph nodes.He supported a campaign by Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer to make cancer screening available to everyone in England from the age of 50. Currently, screening is available to everyone aged 60 to 74, but the NHS is expanding to include everyone aged 50 to 59 years old.George Alagiah (Macmillan Cancer Support/PA) (PA Media)Around 42,000 people are diagnosed with bowel cancer every year in the UK, with 90 per cent of diagnoses made in people over the age of 50. It the fourth most common cancer and the second biggest cancer killer, leading to around 16,800 deaths every year.The three main symptoms of bowel cancer include having persistent blood in the stools; an ondoing change in bowel habits, such as needing to go more often or having diarrhoea; and persistent lower abdominal pain, bloating or discomfort.Some patients may also experience a loss of appetite, or significant, unintentional weight loss. According to Cancer Research UK, another potential symptom is tenesmus, which is the feeling of having to defecate without having stools, or experiencing pain upon defecation.Studies have found that several factors could potentially increase the risk of bowel cancer, although they cannot explain every case.These include a diet high in red or processed meats and low in fibre; being overweight or obese; not exercising often enough; and drinking too much alcohol.Smoking and having a family history of the disease can also increase the risk. Some people with long-term conditions like extensive ulcerative colitis or Crohn\u2019s disease may also have an increased risk of bowel cancer.Bowel cancer can be treated with surgery, which may be paired with chemotherapy, radiotherapy or biological treatments. Catching the cancer at an early stage greatly improves chances of survival.However, the NHS states that if a cancerous tumour cannot be removed completely through surgery, then a cure may not be possible.For more information about treatment for bowel cancer, visit the NHS\u00a0here\u00a0and Cancer Research UK\u00a0here.RecommendedGeorge Alagiah: What are the signs of bowel cancer?Carol Vorderman says she no longer sunbathes after health scareJonnie Irwin details experience with palliative hospice careTo speak to a Cancer Research UK nurse, you can call 0808 800 4040.

10 \u201cin a matter of weeks\u201d and thought she was pregnant in 2020, but her GP reassured her that it was constipation.After trying strong doses of laxatives and having two catheters fitted, nothing improved, and she was eventually diagnosed with an ovarian cyst which doctors were able to remove successfully.However doctors then found an extremely rare 19cm by 17cm tumour and Summer was diagnosed with stage one ovarian cancer.Summer had keyhole surgery to remove it, which was a success, but she also found out she had a rare gene, DICER1, which meant she was more susceptible to other types of cancer.RecommendedJonnie Irwin details experience with palliative hospice careCarol Vorderman shares warning to sunbathers after skin cancer scareThis is how often you should actually change your razorSix members of her family have since been diagnosed with the gene, including her 16-year-old cousin who now has lung cancer, but Summer says she is a \u201cfighter\u201d.Since Summer was diagnosed with cancer she has been training as a student nurse, which is something she has \u201calways\u201d wanted to do.In May 2020, at the age of 18, while working in a hospital as a healthcare assistant, Summer began to notice her stomach was getting rounder, but put it down to eating a few extra treats at work.She said: \u201cMy mum was convinced I was pregnant, and I began to believe it, but I took a pregnancy test and it came back negative.\u201cI went from a size six to size 10 in a matter of weeks, and one day I was in the garden in a bikini and my mum said that she thought something was really wrong because my stomach was really round.\u201dTo reassure her mum, Summer went to her GP and was prescribed a strong dose of laxatives, as they thought she was constipated.But after two weeks of taking the medication nothing changed, so Summer was called in to her GP surgery.Summer said: \u201cThe doctor felt my stomach and they said something was not right, but I didn\u2019t think much of it.\u201dSummer also had blood tests, and spotted that her blood was being run for a CA-125 test, a tumour marker for ovarian cancer, and a few days later was asked to have an\u00a0 internal ultrasound, where she was told her bladder was \u201ccompletely full\u201d with more than a litre of urine.Doctors told Summer there was \u201cnothing they could do at that point\u201d so, after asking her doctor friend for advice, she went straight to A&E and had a catheter fitted.She said: \u201cI was devastated, I was only 18 and I really didn\u2019t want to be walking around with a catheter strapped to my leg or be signed off work for 12 weeks.\u201dAfter a few days of being catheterised, Summer continued urinating as usual, so she returned to the hospital and had another fitted.But the following day she began experiencing a great deal of pain.She said: \u201cIt was weird, I went to the toilet and I noticed a lot of blood in the bag, and I was still weeing.\u201cI was taken into hospital \u2013 at this point, I was screaming in pain.\u201dSummer then had a CT scan, and it was found that her bladder was never full \u2013 instead, she had a large ovarian cyst which was successfully removed with surgery.But two weeks later Summer went for her post-operation check-up and was told she had a 19cm by 17cm tumour.She said: \u201cThey told me I had a Sertoli-Leydig cell tumour, which was really rare.\u201cThey told me there was only one other person in the UK that had it at that point and my blood tests came back fine on the CA-125 marker because it causes a boost in testosterone so didn\u2019t show as a marker.\u201cIt didn\u2019t sink in at all, and the first thing I did was take my sick note to work \u2013 I was gutted I couldn\u2019t work.\u201cWhen I told people there, they cried, so I did too, but it didn\u2019t hit me for a while.\u201dOn July 1 2020 Summer had a hospital appointment to find out more about her tumour, and to her devastation she found out she had ovarian cancer.She said: \u201cThey explained more about my tumour, and that there have not been any clinical trials for it because it\u2019s so rare.\u201cI put it bluntly and asked them if I had cancer and they said yes.\u201cMy mum was upset about it more than me \u2013 I think it\u2019s more scary for those around you.\u201dAbout two weeks later Summer had keyhole surgery to remove the tumour, which was a success.She said: \u201cI was so relieved, and in my post-op review they asked me if I wanted preventive chemotherapy and I said no, as the pros outweigh the cons for me.\u201cI\u2019d rather live my life now and deal with chemotherapy in the future if it ever comes back.\u201dSince then Summer has had internal ultrasounds every three months, which will continue for the next ten years.She has also been genetically tested, and she was diagnosed with DICER1 syndrome \u2013 an inherited disorder that increases the risk of cancerous tumours, most commonly in the lungs, kidneys, ovaries and thyroid.Summer said: \u201cI now know that if I have kids, they will probably have the gene, and I\u2019ve looked into IVF and PGD (preimplantation genetic diagnosis) but there is no licence to test for DICER1, I\u2019d have to go and ask for one to be made.\u201cI know that I\u2019m probably more likely to get another type of cancer in the future too.\u201dSummer\u2019s immediate family tested negative for the gene, but when Summer\u2019s aunt came to one of her appointments with her, she believed her daughter, Summer\u2019s 16-year-old cousin, had the gene.Summer said: \u201cAfter tests, my aunt and five of her children have the gene, and one of them has lung cancer but she\u2019s a fighter.\u201dNow Summer is a student nurse \u2013 she has \u201calways wanted\u201d to work in healthcare, and has been doing so since she was 17, but when she received her cancer diagnosis it pushed her to apply for university.She said: \u201cMy

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeA teenager who thought she was pregnant after her stomach unexpectedly became rounder, and who was told it was constipation by her GP, was later diagnosed with ovarian cancer and is now a student nurse after realising \u201clife is too short\u201d.Summer Edwards, 22, a student nurse at the University of the West of England, from Bristol, went from a size six to size 10 \u201cin a matter of weeks\u201d and thought she was pregnant in 2020, but her GP reassured her that it was constipation.After trying strong doses of laxatives and having two catheters fitted, nothing improved, and she was eventually diagnosed with an ovarian cyst which doctors were able to remove successfully.However doctors then found an extremely rare 19cm by 17cm tumour and Summer was diagnosed with stage one ovarian cancer.Summer had keyhole surgery to remove it, which was a success, but she also found out she had a rare gene, DICER1, which meant she was more susceptible to other types of cancer.RecommendedJonnie Irwin details experience with palliative hospice careCarol Vorderman shares warning to sunbathers after skin cancer scareThis is how often you should actually change your razorSix members of her family have since been diagnosed with the gene, including her 16-year-old cousin who now has lung cancer, but Summer says she is a \u201cfighter\u201d.Since Summer was diagnosed with cancer she has been training as a student nurse, which is something she has \u201calways\u201d wanted to do.In May 2020, at the age of 18, while working in a hospital as a healthcare assistant, Summer began to notice her stomach was getting rounder, but put it down to eating a few extra treats at work.She said: \u201cMy mum was convinced I was pregnant, and I began to believe it, but I took a pregnancy test and it came back negative.\u201cI went from a size six to size 10 in a matter of weeks, and one day I was in the garden in a bikini and my mum said that she thought something was really wrong because my stomach was really round.\u201dTo reassure her mum, Summer went to her GP and was prescribed a strong dose of laxatives, as they thought she was constipated.But after two weeks of taking the medication nothing changed, so Summer was called in to her GP surgery.Summer said: \u201cThe doctor felt my stomach and they said something was not right, but I didn\u2019t think much of it.\u201dSummer also had blood tests, and spotted that her blood was being run for a CA-125 test, a tumour marker for ovarian cancer, and a few days later was asked to have an\u00a0 internal ultrasound, where she was told her bladder was \u201ccompletely full\u201d with more than a litre of urine.Doctors told Summer there was \u201cnothing they could do at that

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeA woman has been praised for her refusal to switch her first-class seat on a plane with a child. On Thursday (20 July), TikTok user Dr Sabra (@lifewithdrsabra) took to TikTok to share the experience she had on her recent flight.She posted a video of herself seated in the first-class section of a plane along with a caption that read: \u201cPOV: Flight agent asks me if I want to give up my 1A seat so a child sits with their family.\u201d The big smile on her face indicated she was pleased with her decision to stick with the ticket she originally paid for. \u201cThat\u2019s a no from me dawg, would you have given up your seat? Also they ended up finding a solution so no, I am not a terrible human being. Also the child was like 13,\u201d she wrote in the caption of the video, which has since been viewed more than 3m times.The TikToker\u2019s viewers agreed that there was no need for her to switch, especially because of the position of her seat. As one viewer pointed out, her 1A position would not have another seat directly next to it. Dr Sabra confirmed they were right, but the family would\u2019ve still been across the aisle from each other had she switched. RecommendedBarbie vs Oppenheimer: Greta Gerwig makes history with biggest box office opening for a female directorRachel Riley opens up about marriage woes with husband Pasha KovalevMolly-Mae Hague and Tommy Fury announce engagement four years after meeting on Love IslandHowever, Dr Sabra claimed it was not the family\u2019s fault they weren\u2019t sat together, but the airline\u2019s, after one supporter commented: \u201cNever switch unless it is an upgrade. Others poor planning is not your fault.\u201d \u201cNope, cause as a mom, it is a parent\u2019s responsibility to plan ahead. Just travelled to Europe for one and a half months with my toddler and no one had to move,\u201d another viewer said, while someone else agreed: \u201cAs a parent, you didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t even bring myself to ask someone to please get up so that I can use the loo, but there are literally people out there who ask to trade seats?\u201d one person asked. \u201cWorst part is the kid is usually like 12 and perfectly capable of being on their own for the flight,\u201d a viewer noted. The TikTok user\u2019s post comes after the CEO of global jewellery brand CONQUERing recorded a similar incident. Tammy Nelson was flying on Delta Airlines from Cincinnati, Ohio, to San Jose, California, when she was asked to swap seats with a woman who wanted to sit next to her two children. Nelson told Newsweek that she thought she may have been looking at the wrong window seat, but her ticket confirmed the mother was sitting in her place. \u201cWhen I confirmed I was looking at the correct seat, I thought she must have just mistakenly sat in the wrong seat. So I said, \u2018I\u2019m sorry but it seems you\u2019re in my seat\u2019, thinking she would realise it and move,\u201d she told Newsweek. The woman did not proceed to get up and explained she thought she could sit in Nelson\u2019s seat since she was with her children. Nelson didn\u2019t want to be difficult, but she confessed to her followers that she tends to get sick on flights and window seats help ease the nausea by allowing her to sleep. Just like they did with Dr Sabra, people commended Nelson for not giving up the spot she had booked. \u201cThe amount of families who aren\u2019t paying to select their seats together is mindblowing! You were 100 per cent right to not give up your seat,\u201d one follower said. The two influencers aren\u2019t the only passengers to experience a request for a seat swap as there\u2019s been a recent uptick in the number of people sharing their own stories on social media. Most individuals admit they refused to move, and, according to a travel etiquette expert, they are valid in doing so. Diane Gottsman, a national etiquette expert and founder of The Protocol School of Texas, spoke to The Independent about the one appropriate instance in which someone can request another passenger to switch their seat after having prebooked it. If a parent had tried their absolute hardest to find seats next to their children, but was unable to secure them, only then is it acceptable to ask if they can take someone\u2019s spot on the plane, train, bus, or any other mode of transportation.

That\u2019s what makes the chicken green curry below so packed full of goodness by the time it hits the barbecue. The same goes for the grilled tiger prawns and citrus som tam salad. A widely eaten salad in Asia, the som tam\u2019s clementine adds a natural sweetness to the juices of the grilled prawns, making this a stand out dish. When cooked over an open fire, aubergine has an amazing ability to transform into a smoky, soft bombshell of flavour. The smoky aubergine, pickled cucumber and sesame salad with runny duck eggs is the perfect accompaniment to a barbecue, and also delicious served with steamed rice as a main.RecommendedHi Barbie! Nine cocktails inspired by the doll\u2019s most iconic outfitsThe National Portrait Gallery\u2019s new restaurant is fabulous upgradeThe dish that defines me: Alex Outhwaite\u2019s Vietnamese bun chaBarbecue chicken green curryWhen cooking chicken over a fierce heat such as a barbecue, it\u2019s always best to marinate or brine it first. Now, you can honestly spend a lifetime researching the brining process and some people do, however we don\u2019t have time for that! Suffice to say that by leaving raw meat in contact with salt and/or sugar and moisture before cooking, you allow it to take on flavour. This recipe uses the green curry paste to marinate the chicken, meaning it\u2019s packed full of goodness by the time it hits the barbecue.Serves: 2Ingredients:20g coconut oil (vegetable oil can also be used instead)100g green curry Payst3g kaffir lime leaves, torn a little to release their flavour10ml fish sauce (if using Payst no seasoning is necessary as it is pre-seasoned)10-15g palm sugar (if using Payst no seasoning is necessary as it is pre-seasoned)200ml chicken stock1 tin coconut cream4 free-range chicken thighs on the bone (400-600g total weight)100g new potatoes, sliced in half80g baby sweetcorn, sliced at an angle80g green beans, sliced in half lengthways10g krachai wild ginger, peeled and julienned (if you can\u2019t find this, use the larger, more common ginger)10g Thai sweet basilA piece of wood for smoking on the BBQ (my favourite is hickory)Method:Heat the coconut oil in a large saucepan over a high heat, then add the green curry paste and kaffir lime leaves and stir regularly until the paste begins to split like scrambled eggs \u2013 this will take a few minutes. You will notice that the smell of the ingredients changes from raw to fragrant. At this point, add 10ml fish sauce and allow it to cook into the paste for 1 minute (don\u2019t add too much as it is strong and you can always add, but never take away). Next, add the sugar and cook for a minute or so until melted and beginning to caramelise \u2013 this is noticeable as the paste begins to darken.Now it\u2019s time to loosen the curry with liquids. Add half the chicken stock and 100ml of the coconut cream to the pan, then remove from the heat and allow to cool. When cool, use a little of the curry to marinate the chicken thighs; use enough to coat them, then refrigerate the chicken to allow the flavours to infuse for a minimum of 2 hours, but ideally overnight.Light the barbecue and wait for the coals to glow red. Place the piece of wood onto the coals and allow to set alight and begin to smoke. At this point, add the chicken thighs skin-side up and cook for 3-4 minutes on one side, lowering the BBQ lid so that the meat is engulfed by the smoke. Turn the chicken pieces over and repeat the process until the skin is crispy and golden brown and the chicken is piping hot.Next, return the remaining green curry to the pan and bring back to a simmer. Add any excess from the marinated chicken, then add the remaining stock. Add the potatoes and cook for about 8 minutes until they begin to soften. Add the sweetcorn and green beans and cook for a further 5 minutes until all the vegetables are softened but still retain a little bite. Add the hot chicken thighs, the remaining coconut cream and the krachai and basil. Check you are happy with the seasoning, add a little more fish sauce, sugar or coconut milk if needed and serve immediately. This dish is best served with steamed jasmine rice.Grilled tiger prawns and citrus som tam saladThis version is one Holmes created for Farang  (Sebby Holmes)Som tam has fast become one of the most widely eaten and popular salads to come out of Asia. It originates from Lao, but now has many well-known variations from all over. This version is one I created for Farang. The use of clementine, which adds a natural sweetness, along with the juices of the grilled prawns, makes it a stand out dish. Try it with some sticky rice and some of our ginger and green sweet chilli dipping sauce for a proper feed.Serves: 2Ingredients:8-10 prawns, cleaned, deveined and outer shells removed1 tsp fish sauce1 tsp vegetable oil4 garlic cloves, peeled2 tsp dried shrimpA pinch of Maldon sea salt1 tbsp peanuts, fried or roasted3 red bird\u2019s-eye chillies (more if you like it spicy)10g green beans, chopped in 230g cherry tomatoes200g shredded green papaya (can be found in most Asian supermarkets)10-15g palm sugar20ml thick tamarind waterJuice of 2 limes\u00bd lime, chopped with the zest onJuice of 1 clementinesMethod:Coat the prawns in the fish sauce and oil, then place them on a hot grill for 2-3 minutes until the side in contact with the heat has turned pink. Turn the prawns over and repeat on the other side until they are hot throughout. Remove from the heat and set aside.Pound the garlic and dried shrimp in a mortar and pestle, using the salt as an abrasive. Then pound in the peanuts to break them up just enough to mix through the salad; be careful not to over-pound them or they will turn into peanut butter.Next, one by one, add the chillies, green beans, tomatoes, grilled prawns and papaya to the mortar, bruising them as you go to distribute the flavours.Add the palm sugar, tamarind water, lime juice, chopped lime and the juice of 1 clementine. Give the salad a final bruising to ensure that all ingredients are packed full of the flavoursome dressing, making sure that the palm sugar has completely dissolved in the dressing, otherwise someone will get an unexpected sweet mouthful. Taste the dressing to check that it suits your tastes \u2013 it should be sweet, salty, sour and spicy with a hint of bitterness from the lime zest. Adjust the seasoning if necessary, then serve.Smoky aubergines, pickled cucumber and sesame salad with runny duck eggsThis salad is the perfect accompaniment to a barbecue  (Sebby Holmes)When cooked over an open fire, aubergine has an amazing ability to transform into a smoky, soft bombshell of flavour. This salad, a perfect accompaniment to a barbecue and also delicious served with steamed jasmine rice as a main, uses a runny egg to contribute to the dressing. I\u2019ve used Thai purple aubergines, which are thinner and easier to grill evenly in a short time. You can also use ordinary aubergines, but they may need a little longer on the fire. Serve drizzled in our burnt chilli dipping sauce to add an extra level of flavour.Serves: 2Ingredients:4 Thai purple aubergines (these can be found in most Asian supermarket, however, the larger, more popular, aubergines can be used instead)2 duck eggs10g jasmine rice10g mint, torn10g coriander10g Thai shallots, peeled and thinly sliced (banana shallots can be used)1 tsp toasted sesame seedsFor the pickle:2 tbsp caster sugar\u00bd tsp table salt50ml distilled white vinegar\u00bc cucumber, thinly slicedFor the dressing:Juice of 3 limesJuice of 2 clementine2 tsp fish sauce (seaweed sauce can be used as a vegetarian substitute)\u00bd tsp chilli powder (a little less if you don\u2019t like things too spicy)2 tsp caster sugar3 tsp tamarind waterMethod:Light the barbecue and place the whole aubergines directly onto the hot coals, or near the hottest part of the grill if you\u2019re using a gas barbecue. Keep a close eye on them and turn them over frequently, ensuring that the heat from the coals is distributed evenly. The aubergines are ready when they are soft to the touch, with charred and blistered skins. When cool enough to handle, peel off the skin. If you are not using a barbecue, crank the oven right up to full blast and bake the aubergines until the skins are charred and the flesh is soft \u2013 this will take 20-25 minutes.Meanwhile, soft-boil then peel the duck eggs. An average-sized egg takes 6-7 minutes to cook on a rolling boil. I cook mine in salted water, then transfer them into ice-cold water with a splash of olive oil. If you peel the eggs in the water, the oil gets between the shell and the flesh, making them easier to peel. Once peeled, set aside at room temperature.Put the rice in a dry frying pan and lightly toast on a medium heat, shaking the pan constantly until the grains have turned golden brown and release a lovely aroma. Pound the rice into a powder in a granite mortar and pestle, or use a spice grinder. Make sure to grind the rice to a powder as it will be used to add texture to the salad; it will be crunchy if the grains are too coarse.Next, make the pickle. In a medium saucepan, gently heat the sugar, salt and vinegar together with 50ml cold water until the sugar has dissolved. Be sure to keep stirring so that the sugar dissolves without heating the water too much. Remove from the heat and add the cucumber, then refrigerate.Recommended3 TikTok-approved recipes for picnic seasonImad Alarnab: In Calais\u2019 Jungle refugee camp, food restored our faithIt\u2019s easier to make baklava at home than you might thinkMake the dressing. In a bowl, mix the lime and clementine juices, the fish sauce, chilli powder, sugar and tamarind water. Taste and adjust the dressing to cater to your own taste buds: it should be sweet, salty, sour and hot, with an edge towards the salt and citrus. When you\u2019re happy with the flavour, add the aubergines, mint, coriander, shallots and the pickled cucumber (straining any pickling juices before adding), then gently fold together, leaving the aubergines whole if you can be delicate enough.Put the aubergines on a serving plate and place the duck eggs on top. Using the tip of a knife, pierce a hole in the eggs and break them open with your fingers, releasing the runny yolks so that they ooze into the salad. Sprinkle the salad with the rice and sesame seeds and add a tiny pinch of salt onto the runny egg yolks as a surprise burst of flavour. Serve with steamed jasmine rice for an extra fill."}, {"_id": "64bef85351ac33362ba19c26", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/carol-vorderman-research-macmillan-cancer-support-boots-spf-b2380717.html", "primaryCategory": "Health &amp; Families", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Carol Vorderman: Why my skin cancer scare means I no longer sunbathe", "lead": "The presenter talks to Prudence Wade about the importance of sun safety, as skin cancer cases hit a record high.", "author": "Prudence Wade", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 08:08:53", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:16:51.230623", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-24T08:08:53+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/24/09/20154710-30aed715-f2d4-4184-8172-cefc12bf3adc.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Stay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletterStay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

So solo diners who book within 24 to 48 hours of their required booking time could be able to swerve the minimum spend depending on whether those tables are available at the time.Nonetheless, the initiative sparked outrage on Twitter, with commenters quick to point out the joys of dining alone, and how solo diners are often stigmatised. \u201cF*** the Hotel Caf\u00e9 Royal then\u2026 Solo dining is one of life\u2019s great pleasures,\u201d tweeted one person.\u201cOh great news.

We\u2019ve all done it, wondering how long we can actually use one, as we whip it out again and again.Well, it may not be worth the risk to your health, according to dermatologist and Dove expert, Dr Cristina Soma. So, how often should you change your razor?\u201cMore people cling on to their razors for much longer than is advised, and are surprised when we recommend that a razor is changed every five to seven shaves,\u201d says Soma.\u201cThe frequency of change also depends on other factors, such as how frequently and how many areas you shave, your hair thickness and type, the quality of your blade, and whether you are good at washing it off afterwards and looking after your blade.\u201dRecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveWhat happens if you don\u2019t?\u201cMost of us own a dull blade full of skin cells, soap and hair debris. In the worst cases, you can also see rust on the blade,\u201d Soma says.\u201cWhen all this grime accumulates and the blade dulls, you are less likely to get a close, smooth shave, and more likely to cut yourself. Bacteria can accumulate on the blade and have some serious consequences, too.\u201cUsing a dull razor blade can result in shaving rash and bumps, ingrown hairs, and inflamed or traumatised skin. More seriously, it can result in cuts and possibly lead to infections,\u201d she explains.Infections\u201cYou could get any kind of infection from using an old, unsharp razor. After a while of using the same blade, bacteria starts to grow, which will create irritation on your underarms,\u201d she explains.Shaving armpits, pubic hair and legs may cause real issues.\u201cThe most common form of infection would be a bacterial skin infection, with symptoms including redness, swelling, pain or pus. Treatment for this would be an antibiotic ointment.\u201cTo really care for your underarms, you need to change your razor frequently, use a shaving cream or gel, shave in the direction of hair growth and rinse the blade thoroughly, then store it in a clean, dry place.\u201cFurthermore, the underarm area is very delicate, so take care in choosing a deodorant that supports the skin barrier,\u201d explains Soma.Resistance and irritationIf you feel any resistance when shaving with an old razor, it could cause an issue.\u201cIf you can feel your razor tugging at your hair, rather than gliding over it smoothly, it\u2019s likely blunt and will cause skin irritation, razor burn and ingrown hairs,\u201d says Dr Tim Clayton, consultant dermatologist at Pall Mall Medical in Manchester.\u201cIngrown hairs can lead to bacterial infections, hyperpigmentation and keloids [a type of raised scar] so it\u2019s important to avoid these where possible,\u201d he says.RustIf you see a hint of orange on there, it isn\u2019t worth using.\u201cTetanus can be spread via a wound caused by a rusty object, but it isn\u2019t the rust that will cause tetanus \u2013 it\u2019s the bacteria on the razor.\u201cIf you\u2019re concerned about contracting tetanus, make sure you\u2019re up to date with your tetanus vaccinations,\u201d says Clayton.Concerns about costIn a 2021 International Journal of Women\u2019s Dermatology study, women\u2019s four-blade razors were priced 66% higher than men\u2019s, who may be less inclined to shave their bodies.So, if changing your razor is costly, it may be worth considering your relationship with your body hair.RecommendedAre we working out too hard?How to perk up urban balcony gardens and window boxesSadiq Khan and Romesh Ranganathan: Women still aren\u2019t equal in politics and comedy\u201cThere is no hygiene benefit to shaving your body hair.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThere\u2019s a reason high-intensity interval training (HIIT) is so popular \u2013 it\u2019s designed to give you a killer workout in a short amount of time.HIIT classes are short, sharp bursts of exercises where you\u2019re working out above 85% of your maximum heart rate, and Sean Johnson, regional fitness manager at Orangetheory Fitness, can see why they\u2019re \u201ctempting\u201d.\u201cA lot of people are pressed for time and seek a \u2018quick fix\u2019. To many people, the assumption is \u2018no pain, no gain\u2019 and so therefore seek out a hard-hitting, pulse-shattering workout to undo the unhealthy habits they may have gotten themselves into,\u201d he says.\u201cA hard workout can feel very rewarding when you move fast and blast around for a short time.\u201dPlus, there are benefits to HIIT training, with Johnson saying: \u201cA shorter, more intense workout does have the ability to elicit a longer afterburn compared to a less intense longer workout.\u201dRecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveBut is there a chance we\u2019re overdoing it, in a bid to \u2018get the most\u2019 out of our workouts? There\u2019s a growing trend for lower intensity exercise \u2013 often using a heart rate monitor so you can track where you\u2019re at \u2013 which might provide a whole host of benefits, without making you feel a bit sick.Signs you might be overdoing it\u201cWorking at a maximal heart rate can sometimes cause people to feel lightheaded, dizzy, faint and nauseous. This isn\u2019t very fun and can also deter people from coming back,\u201d suggests Francesca Sills, exercise physiologist at Pure Sports Medicine.Johnson agrees: \u201cWorking out for too long at an intensity that is too high can put numerous stresses on the body such as fainting, vomiting and even serious cardiovascular and respiratory health issues.\u201dA heart rate monitor can help you track how hard you\u2019re pushing yourself, but if you don\u2019t have one, Johnson recommends going by \u201cfeeling\u201d. Orangetheory uses three terms to define your perceived exertion: \u201cBase pace is a \u2018challenging, but doable\u2019 feeling, push pace is an \u2018uncomfortable feeling\u2019 and all out is an \u2018empty the tank feeling\u2019,\u201d Johnson explains.He doesn\u2019t recommend spending more than a minute in the \u2018all out\u2019 section, and other signs you might be overdoing it include \u201cfatiguing earlier than you normally do, dizziness, light headed, you get injured or have joint and muscle pain regularly\u201d.Downsides to HIIT?Sills suggests there aren\u2019t necessarily downsides to HIIT, just \u201cthings to be wary of\u201d. She says: \u201cIf you\u2019re working very hard for a long time or for longer than you are used to, it\u2019s possible that you\u2019ll finish the session feeling unwell rather than energised.\u201dJohnson says there is the risk of overtraining with regular HIIT classes. \u201cIn the shorter term, working out at an intensity too high can stress your adrenal glands and stimulate the release of cortisol (the stress hormone). In turn, this can have numerous side effects such as increased blood pressure, increased heart rate, encourage fatigue and ultimately hinder recovery.\u201cIf your body cannot recover properly, you will find it hard to get into a regular routine with your fitness and will see a lack of results.\u201dThe benefits of slowing downJohnson suggests incorporating lower-intensity exercise into your routine can improve your everyday life. \u201cDoing workouts that don\u2019t raise your heart rate to the extremes can help reduce the risk of injury (and risk of falls and trips), reduce fatigue and pain, elevate your mood, improve sleep quality, while still helping to burn calories,\u201d he says.Sills mentions how \u2018zone two\u2019 workouts are a \u201chot topic\u201d in the fitness world recently \u2013 this is a type of low-intensity, sustained exercise where you\u2019re working at around 65-75% of your maximum \u2013 for example, going for a gentle jog where you can still hold a conversation.She says these types of workouts are gaining popularity because of the \u201clarge amount of benefit it brings to the health and efficiency of your cardiovascular and metabolic systems\u201d.If you\u2019re used to leaving it all on the floor with an intense workout every time you hit the gym, it can be tricky to know how to slow down. Johnson recommends using the \u2018FITT principle\u2019 to adjust your exercise routine:Frequency: Instead of doing your four workouts next week try doing only threeIntensity: Do your normal four workouts, but take it down a notch in each one.Time: Instead of doing four x 90 minute workouts next week, maybe try doing four x one hour workouts.Type: Switch it up and use different equipment or style of workout.Johnson adds: \u201cHaving slower days will enable you to focus more on the form and technique, which transfers over to the high intensity days as well.\u201dDoing HIIT safelyWhile it\u2019s a good idea to mix up your workouts with different intensities, there are a few things you can do to make sure you don\u2019t overdo it in HIIT. Sills recommends ensuring \u201cyou are eating well to fuel your body for performance\u201d, and \u201cget on top of your sleep routine to allow your body to rest and repair\u201d.RecommendedHow to perk up urban balcony gardens and window boxesSadiq Khan and Romesh Ranganathan: Women still aren\u2019t equal in politics and comedySPF cocktailing: Why you should steer clear of the buzzy TikTok trendIf you\u2019re a newbie to exercise, she wouldn\u2019t necessarily recommend a HIIT class immediately: \u201cIf you haven\u2019t done much training before, it\u2019s important to learn how to do things right and build a good base level of strength and fitness before going in and smashing yourself. If you aren\u2019t sure how to perform exercises well when you\u2019re fresh, you aren\u2019t setting yourself up for success when you\u2019re fatigued.\u201dAnd finally, she says: \u201cIt\u2019s important to work within your own limits. Often these classes are busy, loud and intense and people can be encouraged to continue to do more weight, more reps, etc. Issues arise when people push too far beyond what they can manage. Instead of working at a 10/10 all the time, drop it back to an eight to nine.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64bef85451ac33362ba19c2a", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/london-herbs-tiktok-italy-plants-b2380667.html", "primaryCategory": "Lifestyle", "subCategories": "test", "title": "How to perk up urban balcony gardens and window boxes", "lead": "An urban gardener and influencer offers tips and tricks.

You can grow them in a window box, or transform a windowsill indoors into a herb garden,\u201d he says.Herbs which will thrive in window boxes with a sunny outlook include rosemary, thyme, mint, parsley and basil. Chillies also love the heat of a sunny window box.Make a medicinal window boxHe has a window box filled with drought-loving flowers like dwarf lavender and calendula, which have medicinal flowers to make infused oil, skin salves and other fragrant concoctions.Think about watering\u201cAlways put trays under pots on a balcony, so you don\u2019t have water dripping down and causing disturbance to your neighbours. Water your plants, wait for the run-off of water into the tray, then use that water on other plants,\u201d he suggests.Position your plants carefullyEven if your balcony is south-facing with plenty of sun, place your plants in containers, so you can move them about depending on where the sun hits, but you can also bring them inside in winter. \u201cPlace the smallest and lowest pots at the front of the taller ones, to allow maximum sunlight for all,\u201d he advises.Plants which could go in full sun include chillies, tomatoes and aubergines. You could use tall tomato plants as shading agents for lettuce. If you have shade, try planting lettuce, which doesn\u2019t mind semi-shade and in the hottest part of the summer they won\u2019t bolt, he adds.Start small and simple\u201cMany people go into a garden centre and go a bit crazy, buying different plants. Then it\u2019s difficult to take care of them. Understand how to grow a particular plant and how it reacts to temperature and other conditions before you scale up. Go for simple plants \u2013 don\u2019t overcomplicate it \u2013 like herbs, strawberries, tomatoes and courgettes, beans and lettuce,\u201d he suggests.Large pots are great for growing chillies and peppers, or have a go with carrots and Swiss chard in containers.Ask neighboursYour neighbour may be growing their own veg \u2013 see what they\u2019ve had success with and you may want to follow suit.Help pollinationIf you live on the 10th floor of a block of flats, you may have to manually pollinate your plants by using a brush to move pollen from one flower to the other, ensuring you don\u2019t do it using different plant varieties or you may end up with cross pollination, he advises.RecommendedSadiq Khan and Romesh Ranganathan: Women still aren\u2019t equal in politics and comedySPF cocktailing: Why you should steer clear of the buzzy TikTok trend8 sensational summer scents for men\u201cAnother trick is to shake the flowers with your fingers, which helps to release the pollen and potentially you\u2019ll have a better percentage of pollination.\u201dRebel Gardening by Alessandro Vitale is published by Watkins, priced \u00a318.99.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeFans have come to the defense of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle amid rumours the royal pair split up.Following the release of the Prince Harry\u2019s memoir Spare, speculation started that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex \u2013 who tied the knot in 2018 \u2013 may not be as solid as they once were. According to Entertainment Tonight, reports circulated that the 38-year-old Duke of Sussex had gotten a hotel room for space and time away from his wife. On 18 July, RadarOnline reported on Harry and Meghan\u2019s rocky patch, claiming the two are \u201ctaking time apart\u201d. An insider alleged to the outlet: \u201cThey\u2019re trying to figure out what hit them. Harry doesn\u2019t fit in Meghan\u2019s tacky Tinseltown world.\u201d When Harry and Meghan\u2019s $20m deal with Spotify came to an end last month, the rumours circulated once more. Bloomberg reported on Meghan\u2019s difficulty in choosing guests to come on the show. Meanwhile, Harry wanted to bring on Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, and Mark Zuckerberg, but executives weren\u2019t up for it.However, a separate source told Page Six that the duo is still together and happily married. Kati Nicholl, author of The New Royals, told ET: \u201cMy experience with Harry and Meghan \u2013 whenever I\u2019ve been with them as a couple, who are very, very close \u2013 [have] a sort of spark between them that always struck me as being very authentic.\u201d RecommendedPrince Harry and Meghan weren\u2019t allowed to fly Air Force One with Biden after Queen\u2019s funeral, report saysMeghan Markle pictured in rare photo with Princess Lilibet during LA outingPrince Harry misses wedding of friend Jack Mann, his \u2018unofficial best man\u2019\u201cHowever, there have been rumours circulating in recent months that the fallout from Spare, which is pretty epic for Prince Harry who had Britain really turned against him, his home country; he\u2019s really not welcomed here,\u201d she said. \u201c[The book has] left a bad taste in people\u2019s mouths. It\u2019s further alienated him from his friends and his family and I think, inevitably, that has put a strain on them.\u201dWhile the false narratives continue to surround the married pair, fans are shooting down the speculation on social media. One royal fan tweeted: \u201cPlease know that I\u2018m a big fan of Meghan since her Suits time and of Prince Harry since his early years. My mother was a fan of his mom as I am. I joined Twitter only in January bc I was looking for a way to defend and support them.
