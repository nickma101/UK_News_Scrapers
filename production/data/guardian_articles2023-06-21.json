You are all, quite frankly, on your own for this one, and probably all the better for it too, as I can\u2019t recall having the winner since Showboat bolted up in 1999 and it isn\u2019t something you tend to forget. A few potentially key pieces of form to consider, though, include: the Victoria Cup over the last seven furlongs of the straight course in May, which featured Perotto, today\u2019s favourite, in seventh; the Hambleton Handicap at York\u2019s Dante meeting which Astro King, Blue For You, Point Lynas and Isla Kai were all runners, and also the Emerald Mile at the Curragh (video from 3m40sec) where Dunum put up the latest of several fine performances in big field to finish a close second. For me, this annual, confidence-sapping ritual came down to Dunum and Blue For You and I plumped for the former, who has been backed from 16-1 yesterday down to no bigger than 10-1 third-favourite at the time of writing - so be sure to have a bit on Blue For You before he duly romps home. SELECTION: DUNUM 1 Mostahdaf 10/1 2 Luxembourg 2/1 f And they\u2019re off \u2026 Classic Causeway is expected to lead \u2026 and he\u2019s out fast but Luxembourg and Ryan Moore are determined to be at the front \u2026 Adayar is in third \u2026 My Prospero is poised \u2026 Luxembourg goes for home \u2026but here comes Mostahdaf and he\u2019s a very impressive winner from Luxembourg.

Three of them \u2013 Bay Bridge, Adayar and My Prospero \u2013 were separated by less than a length in the Champion Stakes over today\u2019s course and distance on Champions day last year, when Bay Bridge battled on bravely on good-to-soft ground to win by half a length with My Prospero finishing strongly after being caught a little flat-footed inside the final two. It is entirely plausible that My Prospero could improve past the pair of them today as William Haggas\u2019s runner has only seven runs behind him to date. Luxembourg, though, seems sure to start favourite, not least as Aidan O\u2019Brien and Ryan Moore were on a real roll on Tuesday, and last year\u2019s Irish Champion Stakes winner is also narrowly in front on the ratings. He also beat Bay Bridge in the Tattersalls Gold Cup at the Curragh last month, showing versatility as he did so by winning from the front, and he too has scope for improvement this season with only nine starts to his name. SELECTION: LUXEMBOURG 1 Rogue Millennium 10/1 2 Random Harvest 22/1 3 Prosperous Voyage 100/30 jt-fav And they\u2019re off \u2026 Prosperous Voyage and Random Harvest are in the lead in the early stages with Lightship at the back \u2026 Random Harvest takes a clear lead \u2026 Jumbly is in midfield \u2026 Prosperous Voyage makes a challenge \u2026 Jumbly and Rogue Millennium come there and the latter gets up in the final furlong to win. Frankie couldn\u2019t have been too happy after yesterday \u2026 and now we have proof. Villanova Queen\u2019s victory in the Kensington Palace Stakes was a particularly popular one given the trainer\u2019s health issues in recent times. Jumbly 3/1 Prosperous Voyage 7/2 Grande Dame 9/2 Honey Girl 9/1 Queen Aminatu 10/1 Rogue Millennium 10/1 Potapova 18/1 Random Harvest 22/1 Internationalangel 33/1 Lightship 150/1 Full betting via Oddschecker A more manageable field of 10 for the third of the day\u2019s races for fillies and mares, and another Joseph O\u2019Brien-trained runner at the top of the betting in Jumbly. She has a win at the track to her name in last season\u2019s Valiant Stakes, although that was on the round course rather than today\u2019s straight mile, and looks the type to keep improving at four. The same, though, is very much true of John and Thady Gosden\u2019s Grande Dame, who is making her seasonal debut here after a progressive three-year-old campaign which culminated in a strong third-place finish in the Group One Sun Chariot Stakes. Top-rated on Timeform\u2019s numbers, meanwhile, is the Group One-winning Prosperous Voyage, with Frankie Dettori holding the reins, and the firm\u2019s ratings also suggest that Potapova, available at around 20-1, could be in the mix on her best form, although her two runs so far this season have been disappointing.

O\u2019Brien, twice a Derby winner as a jockey, has been training since 2016 and only turned 30 \u2013 not that you\u2019d know it to look at him \u2013 last month, and has already won the Melbourne Cup twice, an Irish Derby and bagged two winners at the Breeders\u2019 Cup. His Royal Ascot record, however, is a little underwhelming, with just one winner \u2013 State Of Rest in last year\u2019s Prince Of Wales\u2019s Stakes \u2013 from 51 starters. His two runners here \u2013 Yerwanthere and Adelaise - top the betting, however, at 9-2 and 11-2 respectively, and both have obvious claims after things did not go their way on their latest outings. Yerwanthere was short of room in a Listed race at Naas last month and makes her handicap debut off 93, while Adelaise, who has more big-field experience, responded well to the fitting of a hood to finish a close third of 20 at the Curragh, on her first start for eight months. Tarrabb, in a first-time tongue tie after a decent return to action at Chelmsford on 4 May, is another to consider, along with Ralph Beckett\u2019s Tamarama, the mount of Frankie Dettori, who was back to winning form in a well-run race at Kempton earlier this month.

He has yet to decide whether he will appeal a nine-day ban which is due to run from 4-12 July, meaning he will be unable to ride likely favourite Emily Upjohn in the Coral-Eclipse at Sandown on 8 July. \u201cI\u2019ve got to consult my legal team and we\u2019ll decide whether I\u2019m going to appeal or not,\u201d Dettori told ITV\u2019s The Opening Show. \u201cI\u2019m glad that nobody got hurt. It\u2019s one of those things, the bend comes very quickly after the start and it can get very congested at that point in the race, but I haven\u2019t had chance to go through it properly yet. I\u2019ll talk to my lawyers today.\u201d A fiendish puzzle to start proceedings on day two, with 27 fillies \u2013 in the absence of Tiger Belle \u2013 sprinting down the straight five furlongs. Nine are unbeaten so far, 13 won on their most recent start and it is difficult to know where to start. The bookies make Beautiful Diamond, an impressive winner of her only start at Nottingham earlier this month, the favourite at around 7-2, and Karl Burke, her trainer, knows what it takes to land this race as he saddled Dramatised to win 12 months ago. But there are a whole host of rivals that would not need to find much improvement to figure, including Relief Rally, Born To Rock and Got To Love A Grey, all of whom are also currently unbeaten. They also all have double-figure draws, like nine of the last 10 winners of this race, and in the final reckoning, that stat draws me ever-so-slightly towards the US-trained challenger, Crimson Advocate, close to the near-side rail in 28. She showed the gate speed and early pace you would expect from an American-trained runner when successful in the Royal Palm at Gulfstream Park \u2013 a \u201cwin-and-you\u2019re-in\u201d for today\u2019s contest \u2013 when she covered the first quarter in 21.83sec, and was not stopping when she hit the wire.

The artists featured are Lara Robinson, Jessica Hills, Clementine St John Webster and Michelle McCullagh. Racegoers are arriving at the track for the second day of the meeting. Frankie Dettori had a shocker yesterday and will be desperate for a winner this week, at his final Royal Ascot in the saddle. He has decent chances including an obvious one in Gregory, who lines up in the Queen\u2019s Vase at 5.35pm. Highfield Princess, who ran an excellent race in defeat in the King\u2019s Stand yesterday, will be lining up again on Saturday in the QEII Jubilee Stakes. Chris Stickels, who got some stick yesterday (see tweet from pro-punter Eddie Fremantle below), has weighed in with the latest information. The going for day two is: Good on the straight course and Good, Good to Soft in places on the round course. GoingStick readings at 8am (the higher the stick reading the faster the ground): Stands side: 7.7 Centre: 7.5 Far side: 7.5 Round: 6.6 Good morning and welcome to Ascot racecourse, where day two of the 2023 royal meeting will get under way at 2.30pm with Frankie Dettori still looking for his first winner of the week and hoping that things don\u2019t go from bad to worse. Tuesday was set up to be Dettori\u2019s day, with several fancied rides and an obvious opportunity to get the meeting off to a flyer. He ended up with three second-place finishes, a late non-runner and, most embarrassingly, a nine-day ban for causing significant interference on Saga \u2013 the King\u2019s only runner on the day \u2013 which rules him out of the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown next month. With the obvious exception of Saga, Dettori did not really do a great deal wrong on Tuesday, but his mounts were not quite good enough. When you are the most high-profile jockey of the last 30 years, however, and you announced back at Christmas that this season would be your last, a bad first day at the royal meeting can take on a life of its own. Dettori has four rides on today\u2019s card, three of which are likely to set off at single-figure odds. Tamarama is one of the favourites for the Kensington Palace Fillies\u2019 Handicap at 3.05pm, Prosperous Voyage is around 11-4 for the Duke Of Cambridge Stakes and Gregory is a very warm order for the Queen\u2019s Vase. His other ride, meanwhile, is Reach For The Moon in the Royal Hunt Cup, another runner in the King\u2019s colours and a bitter disappointment when odds-on for the Hampton Court Stakes here last year. But he does not have a mount in the feature event, the Prince of Wales\u2019s Stakes, while Ryan Moore, who is one win behind him in the all-time list at the royal meeting after a treble on Tuesday, has a full book of seven rides, including Luxembourg, the favourite, in the big one. The all-important ground, meanwhile, is currently riding good on the straight course and good, good-to-soft in place on the round. It was a dry night and the forecast is for a possible shower or two during the afternoon, but nothing to be too concerned about. Some thoughts on the seven races on today\u2019s card are here, and the action is under way at 2.30pm with the Queen Mary Stakes \u2013 unless you include the royal procession at 2pm, of course. The Duke of Wellington, no less, popped up in the first carriage yesterday. Is there still a Lord Nelson somewhere who can be tracked down for day two?"}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db4f4", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/law/live/2023/jun/21/samuel-alito-gifts-supreme-court-trump-biden-latest-news", "primaryCategory": "law", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Supreme court justice Samuel Alito facing ethics questions over undeclared gifts from billionaire \u2013 live ", "lead": "Alito reportedly accepted seat on private plane owned by Paul Singer; expert says he should have recused himself from Singer cases before the court", "author": "Maya Yang; Gloria Oladipo (earlier)", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 15:40:47", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.988558", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/920ba101bd5d94992458efd6ac29d36c67fe81cc/0_0_4053_2432/500.jpg", "body": "The Democratic National Committee will raise pro-choice abortion billboards across key voting states as the country gears up for the 2024 presidential election. The billboard campaign will begin on Thursday in New York City\u2019s Times Square and will also feature in Atlanta, Phoenix, Milwaukee, Tallahassee, and Raleigh, CBS reports. The billboards will highlight the contrast between Democrats and Republicans over their efforts at protecting and banning abortions, a DNC official told CBS. With the one-year anniversary of Roe vs Wade\u2019s overturn coming on Saturday, the DNC will also run social media campaigns this week on Facebook and Instagram, as well as CTV ads across Wisconsin, North Carolina, Florida, Georgia and Arizona. According to CBS, the DNC also plans to deploy officials and surrogates across multiple states to discuss abortion rights across the country this week. Christine Arena, a former public relations executive at the firm Edelman who now works in social impact film-making, testified second. She drew comparisons between the fossil fuel industry\u2019s decades-long misinformation campaign and that helmed by the tobacco industry to cover up the harms of smoking. \u201cJust like the tobacco executives before them, [fossil fuel executives] characterize peer-reviewed science and investigative journalism that illustrates the extent of their deceptions as biased or inconclusive,\u201d said Arena, who was invited to testify by committee chair Sheldon Whitehouse. Richard Painter, a professor of corporate law at University of Minnesota Law School who was the chief White House ethics lawyer in the George W Bush administration, later testified that he is a political independent, and that Americans should get on board with the push to end climate misinformation no matter where they fall on the political spectrum. \u201cThis is not a partisan issue. This is not about being a Democrat or Republican, or an independent,\u201d said Painter, who was also invited by Whitehouse. \u201cThis is about caring, and doing something about a grave threat to the human race.\u201d Painter was followed by two witnesses invited by Republican Senators. The first was Dr Roger Pielke Jr, professor of environmental studies University of Colorado Boulder. He said in 2015, he testified in Congress about climate science, and in response, a member of Congress suggested that he may have been the recipient of undisclosed funding from fossil fuel companies. His university investigated him and found the accusations were not true, he said.\u201cHowever, the very public accusation was enough to derail my work and upset my career in ways that continue today,\u201d he said. Pielke said he believes climate change is real, human-caused and dangerous, but that the Democrats\u2019 concerns are overblown. \u201cOne important role of us experts is to call things as we see them,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes research results are inconvenient or uncomfortable to certain interests, and that includes political interest.\u201d Scott Walker, president of conservative non-profit organization Capital Research Center who also served in the George W Bush administration as special assistant to the president for domestic policy, claimed that the subject of the hearing \u2013 dark money \u2013 is not a major problem in American politics. Further, he insisted, the political left takes more money than the right. To say that a group uses dark money is like saying the group uses telephones. It\u2019s a universal technology,\u201d he said. Senate budget committee chair Sheldon Whitehouse kicked off Wednesday\u2019s hearing. \u201cWe\u2019re here today because fossil fuel funded climate disinformation and obstruction is directly causing systemic financial risks to the economy and to the federal budget,\u201d he said. He explained the well-documented misinformation campaign that fossil fuel companies and their allies have waged on the American public. \u201cBeginning as early as the 1950s, industry scientists became aware of climate change, measuring and predicting it decades before it became a public issue,\u201d he said. \u201cThey knew their products were responsible for it\u2026 but industry management and CEOs spent decades promoting climate misinformation.\u201d Ranking member Senator Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, pushed back on the need for such a hearing, saying it constituted a \u201cmissed opportunity to work together on a responsible budget\u201d. \u201cDemocrats have claimed that climate change will cause catastrophic economic collapse due to devastating natural disasters. They have also attributed a Republican rejection of extreme climate policy to win alleged fossil fuel disinformation conspiracy to defraud the public,\u201d said Grassley. \u201cThis premise either insults the integrity or the intelligence of Republican legislators that diligently serve their constituents, as well as our constituents.\u201d The first witness to testify was Harvard history of science professor Naomi Oreskes, who has written several books on oil industry misinformation and who was invited by committee chair Whitehouse. \u201cClimate change is a market failure, and market failures require government action to address,\u201d she said. Fossil fuel companies\u2019 and their front groups\u2019 concerted efforts to disrupt climate policies have come at great expense to America, including not only financial costs, but also human suffering and lives lost, she said. Samuel Alito joins other conservative justices in facing ethics questions for not disclosing multiple gifts he received from billionaire Paul Singer. In April, conservative justice Clarence Thomas came under fire from watchdogs and Democratic lawmakers after ProPublica revealed that he had accepted luxury trips from Harlan Crow, a Republican real estate developer and megadonor. In its investigation, ProPublica found that Crow has donated over $10m in publicly disclosed political contributions. He has also donated to groups that conceal their donors and once said: \u201cI don\u2019t disclose what I\u2019m not required to disclose.\u201d Recent reports also revealed that conservative justice Neil Gorsuch reportedly failed to disclose the buyer of a $1.8m Colorado property which he co-owned in 2021. The buyer was eventually revealed by Politico to be a chief executive of Greenberg Traurig, one of the country\u2019s largest law firms which has made multiple appearances in front of the supreme court. The disclosure failures from multiple conservative justices have prompted widespread criticism among Democrats, who have since been calling for ethics reforms across the court. \u201cIt is not going to be easy,\u201d Rhode Island\u2019s Democratic senator Sheldon Whitehouse told NBC in May. \u201cThe work that we\u2019re doing on ethics in the court ought to be easy. And yet it\u2019s not. It\u2019s partisan also. \u201cSo I think that the first step is going to be for the judicial conference, the other judges, to put some constraints around the supreme court\u2019s behavior and treat the supreme court the way all other federal judges are treated.\u201d Democratic representative Lisa Blunt Rochester has announced her bid to run for senator. In a campaign video released on Wednesday, Rochester said: \u201cIt\u2019s been the greatest honor of my life to represent Delaware, to protect our seniors, our environment, our small businesses and women\u2019s reproductive rights. But we\u2019ve got so much more to do.\u201d Rochester went on to talk about the January 6, 2021 Capitol Hill riots, saying: \u201cPeople ask me if January 6 was my worst day. It was but it was also one of my proudest moments. Because we walked back in that House chamber and we completed our work. The forces of fear did not win and democracy prevailed.\u201d Currently, the Delaware Senate seat is occupied by Democratic senator Thomas Carper, who announced last month that he will not seek re-election after 2025. Carper has indicated his support for Rochester, who used to intern for him when he served in the US House of Representatives. In May, Carper announced his endorsement for Rochester, saying: \u201cWe love Lisa, and I spoke with her this morning and I said you\u2019ve been patiently waiting for me to get out the way, and I\u2019m gonna get out of the way, and I hope you run, and I hope you will let me support you and support you in that mission,\u201d CNN reports. The Senate budget committee will hold a hearing on Wednesday morning, scrutinizing the role of oil and gas-linked \u201cdark money\u201d in delaying climate action \u2013 and tearing through local and federal budgets. The fossil fuel sector has spent billions on a decades-long campaign to sow doubt about climate science and policies, despite its own findings from as early as the 1950s that emissions from oil and gas warm the planet. Some of that funding has been anonymized through trade associations and other groups, research shows. The hearing will be led by Rhode Island senator Sheldon Whitehouse, who chairs the committee and who has given nearly 300 speeches about the climate crisis on the Senate floor. \u201cAs chairman of the budget committee, I am shining a light on the massive, well-documented economic risks of climate change,\u201d said Whitehouse. \u201cThese are risks that have the potential to cascade across our entire economy and trigger widespread financial hardship and calamity.\u201d It will feature five witnesses: Harvard history of science professor Naomi Oreskes, who has long studied climate misinformation; Christine Arena, former public relations executive at the firm Edelman who now works in social impact filmmaking; Richard Painter, a professor of corporate law at University of Minnesota Law School who was the chief White House ethics lawyer in the George W Bush administration; Dr Roger Pielke Jr, professor of environmental studies University of Colorado Boulder; and Scott Walker, president of conservative non-profit organization Capital Research Center who also served in the George W Bush administration as special assistant to the president for domestic policy. The hearing follows one launched by Democrats in 2021 on what was then called the House oversight and reform committee, which focused on big oil\u2019s alleged efforts to mislead the public about the climate crisis. Kyle Herrig, the president of the watchdog Accountable.US, calls out Leonard Leo and John Roberts in a statement this morning about ProPublica\u2019s blockbuster story about Samuel Alito and the billionaire Paul Singer. Herrig said: \u201cAs the supreme court corruption crisis grows with yet another apparent violation of the court\u2019s bare minimum ethics code, it\u2019s no surprise that Leonard Leo is right in the middle. He\u2019s the corrupting influence responsible for the rot.\u201d Leo is a rightwing activist who has done much to shape conservative dominance of federal courts including the supreme court, and who recently received $1.6bn to further his work. He accompanied Alito and Singer to Alaska on the fishing trip at the heart of the ProPublica report. Leo told ProPublica: \u201cNo objective and well-informed observer of the judiciary honestly could believe that they decide cases in order to cull favour with friends, or in return for a free plane seat or fishing trip.\u201d Herrig continued: \u201cAs long as Chief Justice Roberts continues to dodge responsibility by refusing to take action, public trust in our court will continue to plummet. We need reform now.\u201d Roberts has rebuffed calls to testify in Congress \u2013 over previous ProPublica reports about Clarence Thomas, another hardline rightwing justice, and his relationship with another rightwing billionaire, Harlan Crow. As quoted in the ProPublica story, Dick Durbin, the Illinois Democrat who chairs the Senate judiciary committee, has recently said: \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t tolerate this [Thomas\u2019s behaviour] from a city council member or an alderman. And yet the supreme court won\u2019t even acknowledge it\u2019s a problem.\u201d More: Alito published a Wall Street Journal op-ed in response to ProPublica\u2019s reporting, but declined to answer direct questions from ProPublica. In the op-ed published hours before ProPublica\u2019s report, Alito said that he did not know Singer was connected to cases heard before the court. Alito also claimed to have spoken to Singer \u201con no more than a handful of occasions\u201d, including during the aforementioned fishing trip. From the Wall Street Journal: On no occasion have we discussed the activities of his businesses, and we have never talked about any case or issue before the Court\u2026 It was and is my judgment that these facts would not cause a reasonable and unbiased person to doubt my ability to decide the matters in question impartially\u2026 \u2026When I reviewed the cases in question to determine whether I was required to recuse, I was not aware and had no good reason to be aware that Mr. Singer had an interest in any party\u2026 But experts have pushed back against Alito\u2019s defenses, telling ProPublica that they could not recall an instance of a justice ruling on a case after receiving a gift from a donor. \u201cIf you were good friends, what were you doing ruling on his case?\u201d said Charles Geyh, an Indiana University law professor and expert on recusals to ProPublica. \u201cAnd if you weren\u2019t good friends, what were you doing accepting this?\u201d said Geyh, referring to the flight on the private jet. Alito is facing ethics questions related to a 2008 fishing trip the supreme court justice took with Republican billionaire Paul Singer, first reported by ProPublica. On 8 July 2008, Alito flew on Singer\u2019s private jet to Alaska, where the pair stayed at King Salmon Lodge, a fishing resort that costs more than $1,000 a day. The private plane to Alaska would have cost Alito more than $100,000 if he had chartered it himself, ProPublica reported. In the years after the trip, Singer\u2019s hedge fund was involved in cases presented before the court at least 10 times. In 2014, the court resolved a key question stemming from a decades-long battle between Singer\u2019s hedge fund and Argentina. Alito voted in Singer\u2019s favor, in a 7-1 majority. The hedge fund ultimately received $2.4bn. Good morning, Supreme court justice Samuel Alito is facing questions for not declaring several gifts received from conservative billionaire Paul Singer, and for not recusing himself when Singer had cases presented before the court. The latest report questioning the ethics of supreme court justices came from ProPublica, which recently published several articles on the relationship between justice Clarence Thomas and Republican billionaire Harlan Crow. According to the ProPublica report published on Tuesday night, Alito accepted a seat on a private plane owned by Singer and flew to Alaska for a luxury fishing trip at the King Salmon Lodge, which costs $1,000 a night. Abbe Smith, a Georgetown law professor, told ProPublica Alito should have recused himself because of the gift from Singer. If she were representing a client in such a case and \u201cfound out [about the gift] after the fact\u201d, Smith said, \u201cI\u2019d be outraged on behalf of my client. And, frankly, I\u2019d be outraged on behalf of the legal system.\u201d Alito did not respond to ProPublica\u2019s questions for the piece. Instead, the justice published a Wall Street Journal op-ed about the trip, several hours before the Propublica piece published. Here\u2019s what else is on today: Joe Biden will host India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, at the White House on Wednesday evening. Several democrats are calling on Biden to question Modi on his human rights\u2019 record."}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db4f5", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/jun/21/rishi-sunak-inflation-pmqs-keir-starmer-covid-inquiry-jeremy-hunt-boris-johnson-uk-politics-live", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Jeremy Hunt tells Covid inquiry quarantining people sooner \u2018might have avoided\u2019 first lockdown \u2013 UK politics live", "lead": "Former health secretary says understanding important of early quarantining could have helped prevent disease spreading", "author": "Rachel Hall (now) and Andrew Sparrow (earlier)", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 15:39:39", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.988583", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/749e28d84c54cef39ece3777200048d0f56c7b9a/192_213_2071_1241/500.jpg", "body": "Former health secretary Jeremy Hunt said quarantining people sooner \u201cmight have avoided\u201d the first coronavirus lockdown. He said: If there was one thing that could have slowed the progress of Covid when it actually arrived, it was to understand the importance of early quarantining to stop the disease spreading, and to understand there are types of pandemic where it is worth putting a massive amount of effort into slowing the spread. One of the very first (questions) we should have been asking ourselves is, \u2018is this one of those pandemics that you can actually slow and save lives early on or not?\u2019 And I don\u2019t think we had asked those questions. The Chancellor added that lockdown in the UK didn\u2019t happen until May 2020, adding: In that period, transmission had increased to about 5,000 a day, and then it was inevitable that you were going to have to use a lockdown. Had we got on the case much earlier with that approach, we might have avoided that. The UK did not sufficiently learn from the experiences of Asian nations which had dealt with virus outbreaks, the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, told the Covid-19 inquiry. Hunt said: I think there was a groupthink that we knew this stuff best and there was a sense, with perhaps the exception of the United States, that there wasn\u2019t an enormous amount we could learn from other countries. And certainly, this is with the benefit of hindsight, I don\u2019t think people were really registering particularly Korea as a place we could learn from. I think it is very notable that Korea did not have a lockdown in the first year of the pandemic. They avoided a lockdown at all. And what I think is interesting is that the reason they had that superb response \u2014 in the second half of the pandemic, quite a lot of east Asian countries didn\u2019t do very well because they didn\u2019t get their vaccines out as quickly as we did here \u2014 but in that first year I don\u2019t think there was any doubt that places like Taiwan and Korea did incredibly well. Speaking at the Covid-19 public inquiry, Jeremy Hunt suggested the government had \u201ctoo narrow a focus\u201d when preparing for a pandemic as part of Exercise Cygnus in 2016. Speaking about the exercise, Hunt, who was health secretary between 2012 and 2018, told the inquiry\u2019s lead counsel, Hugo Keith KC: We didn\u2019t ask the other question which was: what can we do to stop it getting to that point where 200-400,000 people have died? I don\u2019t think we were asking the right questions. What we should have done is thought much more widely about the question. I think that operation had a very narrow focus, a too narrow focus. He added that there was not \u201cnearly enough thought\u201d put into preparing Britain for a pandemic not based on flu. He said: There was another assumption that we were very good at dealing with pandemics. We all thought it. By the way, it wasn\u2019t just us. Johns Hopkins University in America said that the UK was the second-best prepared country in the world in the global health security index in 2019. They had subcategories and one of their subcategories was which countries were best prepared for preventing the spread of a virus and scaling up treatment quickly, and we were top. We weren\u2019t second best, we were top. And so there was I think a completely wrong assumption and I think the truth is we were very well prepared for pandemic flu because we had put a lot of thinking into it. Exercise Cygnus was a huge thing. But we hadn\u2019t given nearly enough thought to other types of pandemic that might emerge and that was, with the benefit of hindsight, a wholly mistaken assumption. The Guardian\u2019s social affairs correspondent, Robert Booth, has the full report on this morning at the Covid-19 public inquiry: David Cameron\u2019s chief scientific adviser warned him in 2013 that the UK\u2019s assessment of risks, including from pandemics, was not being used properly to prevent and mitigate dangers and was being kept too secret, the inquiry has heard. Professor Sir Mark Walport, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser until 2017, wrote to the then PM about his concerns, and told the inquiry that the national risk assessment \u201cwas locked in departmental safes most of the time and I felt that that wasn\u2019t the most effective way\u201d. \u201cThe whole point of [a] risk assessment is that you will be able to use it to see if you can stop something happening in the first place,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it is going to happen \u2013 to mitigate your numbers, reduce its effects.\u201d Walport, a member of the prime minister\u2019s council for science and technology until 2020, backed calls from Oliver Letwin, the former Cabinet Office minister, for the creation of a new post of minister for resilience. Labour has insisted it still wants to abolish the House of Lords despite planning to swell its size with new peers in order to push through policy if it forms a government. PA reports: Keir Starmer\u2019s spokesman said he was standing by the pledge to get rid of the upper house in the first term of a Labour administration, but said there could be \u201cinterim reforms\u201d. Under the current makeup, Labour would need 90 more peers to surpass the Tories\u2019 263 members and become the largest party in the upper house. The party conceded that it may take more than one term to shift the balance but said it still wants to replace the \u201cindefensible\u201d Lords with a new elected chamber in a first term. Starmer\u2019s spokesman said: Every government when they first come into power do not have a majority within the House of Lords because of the nature of the appointments process. And every government as a matter of custom and practice looks to make appointments to the House of Lords but it\u2019s not something that\u2019s done in one fell swoop, it\u2019s something that takes time and often takes more than a term in government for that to happen. That reform of the House of Lords will be in the first term of a Labour government. He said new Labour peers would be expected to back abolition, with the full details of the policy to be set out ahead of the next general election. There\u2019s more from the Covid-19 inquiry today as Jeremy Hunt makes his appearance. The chancellor said that Exercise Cygnus, which was designed to assess the UK\u2019s preparedness and response to an influenza pandemic, should have focused more on prevention, rather than assuming that \u201cyou pretty much couldn\u2019t stop it\u201d. Hunt, who was health secretary between 2012 and 2018, said the cross-government exercise in October 2016 was not to examine the UK\u2019s preparedness but to \u201cestablish how well the UK would cope in a situation in which pandemic influenza had already taken hold\u201d. He told the inquiry\u2019s lead counsel, Hugo Keith KC: I know you may well want to talk about the issue of groupthink, but I think this was the first example. Looking back with the benefit of hindsight \u2013 this was not what I thought at the time and I, with retrospect of course \u2013 I wish I had challenged at the time. But there were no questions asked at any stage as to how do we stop it getting to the stage of 200-400,000 fatalities. It was an assumption that if there was pandemic flu, it would spread, using layman\u2019s terms \u2018like wildfire\u2019, and you pretty much couldn\u2019t stop it. Suella Braverman has rejected calls to move responsibility for the Windrush compensation scheme from the Home Office, saying it would cause \u201cdelay and needless bureaucracy\u201d. PA reports: The scheme, set up in the wake of a scandal in which many British citizens were wrongly detained or deported, has been criticised, while the process of handling claims and offering payouts has been branded slow and inefficient. But the home secretary said changes had been made to simplify the scheme for users, and maintained it should be kept under the Home Office remit. In an interview with ITV News as Britain prepares to mark the Windrush 75th anniversary, she said: It\u2019s right that the Home Office maintain ownership over the scheme because to do otherwise would cause delay and needless bureaucracy. Campaigners and a lawyer who has helped claimants over the years have argued that people do not have faith in the Home Office, and said it is inappropriate to have the \u201cperpetrators\u201d of the scandal running the compensation scheme. Meanwhile, Age UK has said the scheme is letting down older people with \u201cincreasing numbers dying before ever receiving the compensation they are due\u201d. The government has accused peers of trying to delay strike reforms that unions fear will make it easier to sack workers. The House of Lords had made a series of amendments to the strikes (minimum service levels) bill aimed at protecting workers and trade unions, requiring the government to consult further and conduct an impact assessment on the changes. But today, the House of Commons overturned the amendments after pleas from the government frontbench to allow the bill to become law. The bill would allow ministers to impose minimum levels of service during industrial action by ambulance staff, firefighters, railway workers and those in other sectors deemed essential. The Trades Union Congress (TUC) has called for an \u201curgent rethink\u201d by ministers and warned that the bill, if not amended, will mean that workers who lawfully vote to strike could be forced to attend work or be sacked if they do not comply. Peers have been trying to amend the bill to ensure workers cannot be sacked if they fail to comply with a work notice on strike days. But MPs rejected the Lords amendment aimed at ensuring this protection 277 to 209, majority 68. Peers\u2019 attempts to ensure the government consult further on the bill and conduct an impact assessment were rejected by MPs 283 to 205, majority 78. A series of amendments from the Lords aimed at ensuring unions are not tasked with ensuring their members obey work notices were also overturned. MPs rejected them 280 to 214, majority 66. Business minister Kevin Hollinrake said the amendments from peers were not a \u201cmeaningful attempt\u201d to reach agreement, adding: I fear we are having a somewhat repetitive debate which is delaying us from getting on with the important business of minimising disruption to the public during periods of strike action. Justin Madders, Labour\u2019s shadow business minister, said the Lords were attempting to make the bill \u201cslightly less draconian\u201d, adding that Labour opposes the legislation as a whole. He said: This bill is the act of a weak government that has lost the authority and the will to govern for everyone, a government that prefers legislation to negotiation, prefers diversion to resolution and prefers confrontation to consultation. The proposals are currently in the stage of the parliamentary process known as ping-pong, in which the unelected Lords and the Commons send the bill back and forth until they can agree the final wording. James Cleverly, the foreign secretary, has said the UK would be \u201cvery supportive\u201d of Ukraine being allowed to skip part of the process for joining Nato. Speaking at a press conference at the Ukraine recovery conference in London, he said: We have seen Ukraine evolve, and evolve incredibly quickly. Jens Stoltenberg at the Nato informal foreign ministers (summit) said that actually, many of the requirements of membership action plan are actually being delivered. The reform of their armed forces is happening while engaged in conflict. I think the UK\u2019s position would be very, very supportive if we moved on from the membership action plan recognising that the offer to both Sweden and Finland didn\u2019t require that and Ukrainians have demonstrated their commitment to reform the military for requirement of Nato membership through their actions on the battlefield. And I think all Nato allies recognise that. Also unveiled at the conference was a pledge from the UK to offer new virtual-reality (VR) training for at-sea Ukrainian cadets as part of a new package of support. The government said the training would be provided through VR headsets to help participants practise for real-life scenarios. Ukrainians will also be sponsored to take part in three-year cadetships to UK container ships and other large vessels. The Department for Transport will also support secondments for Ukraine\u2019s air traffic controllers to train in the UK, with the latest funding following on from \u00a310m previously announced to help repair Ukraine\u2019s rail infrastructure. Oliver Dowden, the deputy prime minister, has said he was reassured during his time in the Cabinet Office that the UK was in a \u201cpretty strong state of preparedness\u201d for any future pandemic. Speaking to the Covid-19 inquiry, he said that preparations for a no-deal Brexit put the country in a \u201cstrong position\u201d to respond to other challenges. Dowden, who was minister for the Cabinet Office from July 2019 to February 2020 and had previously worked in the department, said he had taken an interest in planning, including for a possible flu pandemic. He said: I asked for further specific briefing on that \u2013 received that briefing \u2013 and indeed, throughout my time as a minister, received further briefings, all of which were consistent with advice that we were broadly in a pretty strong state of preparedness. Hugo Keith KC, counsel to the inquiry, asked Dowden about a 2019 memo about the national security council THRC \u2013 threats, hazards and resilience contingencies programmes \u2013 which suggested that work on pandemic influenza was expected to be affected by the \u201cstep-up in planning for a no-deal exit from the European Union\u201d. Dowden said: We had to ensure that we allocated resources according to where the greatest risk lay. Now, it was the case at that time that \u2018no deal\u2019 was the default position of the government, so \u2013 and this is worth remembering the kind of frankly, apocryphal warnings that were being delivered about the consequences of no-deal Brexit, for example in relation to medicine supplies and elsewhere \u2013 it was appropriate that \u2026 we shifted the resilience function to deal with this. He added that there was a \u201cflip side\u201d to the preparations for a no-deal Brexit \u2013 known as Operation Yellowhammer \u2013 which made the UK \u201cmatch-fit\u201d for the pandemic. Dowden\u2019s evidence contrasts with that from the government\u2019s former chief scientific adviser, who also gave evidence in the morning. Professor Sir Mark Walport, who held the post from 2013-2017, said the UK was \u201cnot operationally prepared\u201d for a pandemic. He said: I think that focus in richer countries had moved away from infectious diseases after the second world war. With the rise of chronic inflammatory diseases, cardiac disease, hypertension, diabetes, there was much more of a focus on those and away from infection. The Liberal Democrats are blaming the government\u2019s \u201cchaotic mismanagement of the economy\u201d for the \u201csavage cuts\u201d that homeowners are facing to their disposable incomes due to rising mortgage rates and are calling for ministers to provide support. Responding to the Institute for Fiscal Studies report showing that interest rate hikes could mean that 1.4 million people lose 20% of their disposable income, Sarah Olney, the Lib Dem\u2019s Treasury spokesperson, said: These stark figures show struggling homeowners are facing savage cuts to their incomes as mortgage rates go through the roof. The blame for this lies squarely with this Conservative government and their chaotic mismanagement of the economy. Jeremy Hunt has totally failed to get inflation under control and millions of families are paying the price through a crippling Conservative mortgage penalty. It is shocking that the government is still refusing to help struggling households despite being responsible for this cost of living catastrophe. Rachel Hall here taking over from Andrew Sparrow for the rest of the day. If there\u2019s anything we\u2019ve missed, do drop me a line. Downing Street claims the government is still on course to meet its target of halving inflation by the end of the year. At the time Rishi Sunak made the promise in January, inflation was running at 10.1%. At the post-PMQs lobby briefing, asked if Sunak was on course to fulfil his pledge, the PM\u2019s spokersperson said: \u201cThat remains the target.\u201d Asked of the government was on track to meet it, the spokesperson said: Yes. Despite some of the coverage at the time [of the announcement of the pledge] this was never something that was straightforward. It was rightly an ambitious target that we remain committed to and it can only be achieved with fiscal discipline. That is all from me for today. My colleague Rachel Hall is now taking over. Ireland will consider taking legal action against the UK if parliament passes the Northern Ireland Troubles (legacy and reconciliation) bill, Leo Varadkar, the taoiseach (Irish PM) said today. Speaking in the D\u00e1il in response to the question from Mary Lou McDonald, the Sinn F\u00e9in leader, who asked what the Irish government would do if the bill were passed, Varadkar said: The bill has not yet been enacted, and certainly if it is enacted, if it does become law, we will then at that point give consideration to whether an interstate case is appropriate, so we certainly don\u2019t rule that out. An interstate case would involve Ireland taking the UK to the European court of human rights on the grounds that the bill breached the European convention on human rights because the convention obliges the UK to ensure Troubles-related deaths are properly investigated. Explaining why Ireland opposed the bill, Varadkar said: I just want to reiterate and restate the government\u2019s opposition to this legacy bill. We think it\u2019s entirely the wrong approach to give former army servicemen, former IRA and paramilitary terrorists immunity from prosecution. We owe it to the victims to make sure that we all do everything we can to make sure that any information that can be given to the police is given to the police and that those people are prosecuted if at all possible. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re very much against this legacy bill and I\u2019ve made that very clear to the prime minister, as has the t\u00e1naiste [Miche\u00e1l Martin] with his counterparts. It\u2019s been discussed with the US president, and is discussed at European level as well. Unionists in Northern Ireland also oppose the bill. See 11.06am. Downing Street has declined to say whether Shaun Bailey, the former London mayoral candidate for the Conservatives, should take up the peerage given to him in Boris Johnson\u2019s resignation honours, PA Media reports. PA says: Bailey has come under pressure to turn down his peerage after a video emerged of a mid-lockdown Christmas party at Conservative headquarters thrown by his campaign. Asked whether he should take up his seat in the Lords, the prime minister\u2019s press secretary said: \u201cThat is a matter for the individual.\u201d If he did take his place in the upper chamber, it would be \u201ca matter for the whips\u201d whether he sits as a Conservative. The press secretary insisted Rishi Sunak had merely been following the precedent in allowing Johnson to recommend honours for his supporters. More than 1m households across Britain are expected to lose at least 20% of their disposable incomes thanks to the surge in mortgage costs expected before the next election, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has warned. Richard Partington has the story here. The IFS paper is here. Here is an extract from the IFS report. In March 2022, households with a mortgage were spending an average of \u00a3670 per month on mortgage payments, \u00a3230 of which was on interest payments. Figure 1 shows how those figures will change if mortgage interest rates remain at their current level, relative to a situation where the March 2022 interest rates persisted. On average those in mortgage-holding households will pay almost \u00a3280 more each month, with 30 to 39-year-olds paying almost \u00a3360 more. This will be a significant hit to mortgagors\u2019 disposable incomes (i.e. incomes after mortgage payments) at a time that families are already under strain \u2013 on average disposable incomes will fall by 8.3%, with those aged 30-39 again seeing the biggest hit (almost 11%). For some the rise will be substantially larger: almost 1.4 million \u2013 690,000 of whom are under 40 \u2013 will see their disposable incomes fall by over 20%. And here is the IFS chart illustrating these figures. It was obvious that Keir Starmer won those exchanges when Rishi Sunak started his final answer with the words: \u201cNo amount of personal attacks and petty point-scoring will disguise the fact that [Starmer] does not have a plan for this country.\u201d Complaining about \u201cpersonal attacks and petty point-scoring\u201d at PMQs is a serious category error; it is a bit like playing football and then moaning about your opponents only being interested in kicking the ball into the back of your net. PMQs is an environment where leaders have to combine clear, broad-brush strategic messaging with sly digs that undermine the standing and authority of their rivals. It is a hard trick to pull off; too high-minded, and you look naive; too personal, and you just look nasty. Starmer gets the balance just about right, and today his jibes against Sunak were considerably more effective than anything coming in the opposite direction. In his second question, he mocked Sunak\u2019s novel explanation for why he was not answering questions about the privileges committee\u2019s report. I realise the prime minister spent all week saying he doesn\u2019t want to influence anyone or anything. He is certainly keeping to that with his answer. Later Starmer delivering a cutting joke about Sunak\u2019s interest in the California mortgage market, and there was a slightly less funny, but perhaps equally potent, sneer about Sunak\u2019s use of helicopters. Increasingly, Sunak\u2019s flight habits may be creating, or exacerbating, an image problem, because they reinforce the view that he is not like ordinary people. Caring for ordinary people, and understanding their problems, are two areas where Starmer has the biggest advantage. But jokes will get you nowhere without an argument, and Starmer was on very strong ground today because he devoted all his questions to what he called the Tory \u201cmortgage catastrophe\u201d. As is often the case, a story about an individual conveyed the political argument most effectively. This morning I spoke to James in Selby. He\u2019s a police officer, working hard to keep people safe every day. The Tory mortgage penalty is going to cost him and his family \u00a3400 more each and every month. That\u2019s nearly \u00a35,000. He told me this morning that they\u2019ve decided to sell their house, to downsize and he\u2019s just told his children they\u2019re going to have to start sharing bedrooms. Why should James and his family pay the cost of the prime minister\u2019s failure? Sunak was never likely to have a brilliant comeback on this issue. His responses were a mixture of: 1) it\u2019s a global problem; 2) we have a plan, and we are taking action; and 3) Labour would make it worse. None of these points sounded as if were likely to be very persuasive to James in Selby. Sunak also did not seem to have resolved whether or not the Tories are attacking Labour for not having a plan for the economy, or for having a plan for the economy which is flawed. At various points he deployed both arguments. Either would have worked; combined, they don\u2019t. The one surprise, perhaps, was that Starmer did not say more about the privileges committee debate, and Sunak\u2019s abject failure to take a stance on it. Given that real life (ie mortgages) can and should trump the Westminster personality pantomime, Starmer\u2019s decision to mostly leave this issue was probably the right one. But when Labour\u2019s Kevin Brennan raised it later, and challenged Sunak to respond to the claim that he had been \u201cweak\u201d (see 12.24pm), his response was particularly underwhelming. Starmer could probably have scored a clear hit on this topic too. Tim Farron (Lib Dem) says 3.5 million people live in radiotherapy deserts. His constituents need to do a three-and-a-half hour round trip to get this treatment. Sunak says he is aware of the problem. The NHS is rolling out local diagnostic centres, he says. Deidre Brock (SNP) says with Boris Johnson finally exposed as a liar, and more and more evidence coming out about the damage of Brexit, will Sunak apologise for backing it. Sunak says the UK has grown faster than France and Italy since it left the single market. Steve McCabe (Lab) asks if any of the papers the government is trying to withhold from the Covid inquiry relate to the \u201ceat out to help out\u201d scheme promoted by Sunak when he was chancellor. Sunak does not answer directly, but says more than 55,000 documents have been handed over. David Davis (Con) asks about British universities helping the Iranians with research that might have a military function. Sunak says these allegations are being investigated. Andrew Slaughter (Lab) asks if the government is still committed to finishing new hospitals in his constituency by 2030. Sunak says the hospital-building programme has been expanded, but schemes in cohort four will be in construction by 2030. Kevin Brennan (Lab) asks if the word \u201cweak\u201d describes the PM\u2019s performance this week. Sunak says what is weak is Labour\u2019s unwillingness to stand up to the unions that fund them. Asked by Dame Meg Hillier (Lab) if a law breaker should be allowed to become a law maker, Sunak says he has just followed precedent on honours. That was a reference to Shaun Bailey, who was made a peer in Boris Johnson\u2019s honours list, and who attended a Tory party where lockdown rules were ignored. Anne Marie Morris (Con) says nearly half of people have been somewhere where cash is not accepted. Will the PM ensure that any entity providing a public service have to accept cash. Sunak says, as technology changes, organisations should be able to decide what forms of cash they accept. Liam Fox (Con) says the UK is performing better than EU countries in some respects. Sunak says Fox is right to highlight the improvement in the economic outlook. Unlike Labour, the government won\u2019t talk Britain down, he says. Stephen Farry (Alliance) says there is still no executive in Northern Ireland. Will the PM work on a financial package for a restored executive. Sunak says he shares Farry\u2019s frustrations on this. He wants the executive restored. Over \u00a37bn has been given to Northern Ireland since 2014, on top of Barnett funding. He says the government is considering what more is needed. Stephen Flynn, the SNP\u2019s leader at Westminster, quotes some of Sunak\u2019s comments about improving economic performance, and says Sunak has taken honesty lessons from Boris Johnson. Sunak says the government is on track to reduce inflation. Flynn says Ireland, and the eurozone area, have better inflation records. Will Sunak admit that Brexit broke the economy? Sunak says the rise in inflation and interest rates is a global phenomenon. Government involves difficult decisions. The SNP won\u2019t do that, he says. Philip Davies (Con) asks Sunak to commit to new oil and gas production in the UK. Sunak says that is an excellent point. A block on North Sea oil and gas investment would mean dependence on imports would rise. Starmer says things may look fine from the vantage point of Sunak\u2019s helicopter. With the honours list, the Tories are rewarding those guilty of economic vandalism. Sunak says Starmer is making petty points. But he cannot disguise the fact he does not have a plan. Labour is all talk; the government is delivering, he says. Starmer says over the next two years 7.5 million people will be in the same boat. Repossessions are up. What is the PM doing about that? Sunak says the mortgage interest scheme is more generous. Borrowers are being allowed to extend their terms, or switch to interest-only payments. He says repossessions are still at a level below the level pre-pandemic, and three times below the level inherited by the Tories. Starmer says Sunak may have a keen interest in the mortgage market in California, but he is talking about the UK. He says he spoke to someone this morning who is having to move to a smaller home because his mortgage was going up \u00a35,000 a year. Sunak says Labour\u2019s policy would make things worse. He says the IFS says Labour\u2019s plans would put up interest rates. The IMF has said what the government is doing is right. Starmer says the cost of the Tory mortgage penalty is an extra \u00a32,900 a year. How is that delivering for home owners? The question [Sunak] refuses to answer, he actually knows the answer to this question, is \u00a32,900 extra. That\u2019s the cost to the average family of the Tory mortgage penalty. Now he was warned by experts about this as long ago as autumn last year, but he either didn\u2019t get it, didn\u2019t believe it or didn\u2019t care because he certainly didn\u2019t do anything, and when I raised this a couple of months ago, he had the gall to stand at that despatch box and say he was delivering for homeowners. How is an extra \u00a32,900 a year on repayment delivering for homeowners? Sunak says interest rates are at similar levels in Canada and the US and Australia and New Zealand. The government has a plan to reduce inflation. Labour borrowing would make the situation worse, as would banning new exploration in the North Sea, and giving in to unions. Labour polices \u201care dangerous, inflationary and working people would pay the price\u201d. Perhaps [Starmer] could explain why interest rates are at similar levels in the US, in Canada, in Australia and New Zealand, why they\u2019re at the highest level in Europe that they\u2019ve been for two decades. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important that we have a plan to reduce inflation, but in contrast what do we hear from [him]. He wants to borrow an extra \u00a328bn a year, that would make the situation worse \u2026. He doesn\u2019t have many policies, but the few that he does have all have the same thing in common, they\u2019re dangerous, inflationary and working people would pay the price. Starmer says Sunak has spent the week saying he does not want to influence people; that answer shows he is still doing it, he suggests. He says Tory economic failure is to blame. How much will this cost householders? Sunak says the government is getting on with the job. Keir Starmer pays tribute to the Windrush generation. And he says the passing of Glenda Jackson leaves a space in our cultural and political life that cannot be filled. Does the PM agree with his MP who said Britain faces a mortgage catastrophe? Sunak says the government needs to help people with mortgages. That is why the government wants to halve inflation. He said that was important before he got that job. The IMF backs that. Mark Menzies (Con) asks about support for the nuclear fuel industry. Sunak says the government is supporting the industry. The domestic nuclear fuel sector has a critical role to play, he says. Patricia Gibson (SNP) asks how much living standards have fallen since Sunak has been in office. Sunak says the government has done much to support people with the cost of living. Rishi Sunak starts by talking about the Ukraine recovery conference. And he pays tribute to the contribution of the Windrush generation on the 75th anniversary of the boat\u2019s arrival. We may get a lot of economics at PMQs today. Graeme Wearden has all the latest on his business live blog. PMQs is about to start. Here is the list of MPs down to ask a question. In the Commons Chris Heaton-Harris, the Northern Ireland secretary, is taking questions. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the DUP leader, tells Heaton-Harris that his party wants the government to legislate to ensure that the Northern Ireland protocol does not constrain trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. Heaton-Harris says the government is willing to provide these assurances in legislation, but he says he also wants the DUP to say when it is willing to lift its boycott of power sharing at Stormont. This is from Damian Lyons Lowe, head of the polling firm Survation, on Rishi Sunak\u2019s pledge to halve inflation, and his company\u2019s research as to what people think it means. (See 9.40am and 10.31am.) On the subject of maths (see 10.31am), this is from Chris Giles, the Financial Times\u2019 economics editor, on the difficulty Rishi Sunak now faces in meeting his inflation pledge. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the DUP leader, has written to Rishi Sunak urging him to scrap controversial legislation to address the legacy of Northern Ireland\u2019s Troubles, PA Media reports. PA says: Donaldson said that an \u201camnesty for terrorists is not only an affront to justice but a gateway to further attempts to rewrite and airbrush the past\u201d. The Northern Ireland Troubles (legacy and reconciliation) bill proposes an effective offer of immunity from prosecution for perpetrators of crimes during the Troubles who cooperate with a truth-recovery body. It would also halt future civil cases and inquests linked to killings during the conflict. While the government introduced a number of amendments to the bill earlier this month, the Stormont parties, Irish government and victims\u2019 groups remain opposed to it. The bill has gone through the Commons and is close to finishing its passage through the Lords, where its report stage debate starts this afternoon. Donaldson said: I have urged Rishi Sunak to recognise that imposing this bill against the express wishes of communities and political parties in Northern Ireland would be a retrograde step. Reconciliation will not be achieved by sacrificing justice. Access to justice must be preserved and the principle of everyone be equal under the law should be protected. The bill must be scrapped and for good. The number of pupils in England issued with a special needs support plan has more than doubled in the last eight years to 180 a day, driving up deficits in local authority budgets to \u201cunmanageable levels\u201d, Sally Weale reports. Here is another finding from the Survation poll showing how many people do not understand inflation, and what Rishi Sunak\u2019s pledge to halve inflation would actually mean in practice. (See 9.40am.) It suggests only around a third of people can accurately say what a 5% annual inflation rate would do to the cost of a \u00a31 loaf. One consolation for Sunak is that at least this does vindicate his call for more maths and economics teaching. At the Ukraine recovery conference this morning Rishi Sunak gave a speech saying \u201cRussia must pay for the destruction that they\u2019ve inflicted\u201d. Alexandra Topping has full coverage on our Ukraine live blog. Good morning. Inflation figures are out today, and they are worse than expected. Richard Partington has the story here. And Graeme Wearden has more on his business live blog. This is certain to be come up at PMQs later. Rishi Sunak used to work in finance before becoming an MP (his first job was at Goldman Sachs) and he is something of an economic geek. In some respects that makes him well qualified to lead the country at a time of economic difficulty. But geeks don\u2019t always have a good grasp of how the public at large thinks, and this morning Survation has published some fascinating polling about Sunak\u2019s pledge to halve inflation by the end of the year. The obvious problem with the pledge is that, although it looked easy to achieve at the start of the year, now economists are less certain about that. But potentially a more serious problem is that the pledge has created unrealistic expectations. Halving inflation will not mean that prices go down. But when Survation asked people what it would mean in practice, most people wrongly said that the pledge would either mean prices going down (32%) or staying the same (31%). Only 23% said that this still meant prices would go up. That suggests many people may end up being disappointed when they realise Sunak\u2019s economic promises aren\u2019t delivering quite what they expected. Here is the agenda for the day. 9am: Rishi Sunak speaks at the Ukraine Recovery conference. Noon: Sunak faces Keir Starmer at PMQs. After 12.45pm: MPs debate Lords amendments to first the strikes (minimum service levels) bill, and then to the retained EU law (revocation and reform) bill. Mid afternoon: MPs debate a Labour motion that would set aside government Commons business on 12 July to allow time for the animal welfare (kept animals) bill, which has been dropped by the government, to be passed. 2pm: Oliver Dowden, the deputy PM, gives evidence to the Covid inquiry. He will be followed by Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor. The current hearings are about preparedness, and so they will be questioned about the government jobs they did before 2020 (Cabinet Office minister and health secretary respectively).

Kyiv has accused Moscow of \u201cecocide\u201d by blowing up the Soviet-era dam on the Dnipro River, while Russia has blamed Ukraine. The Ukrainian prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, has said the \u201cpreliminary estimates\u201d of $1.5bn in environmental damages following the dam breach do not include \u201closses to agriculture, infrastructure, housing, and the cost of rebuilding the plant itself\u201d. We have some updates on the new sanctions the EU has agreed to be taken against Russia (See post at 15:16). The new package forbids transit via Russia of an expanded list of goods and technology which might aid Russia\u2019s military or security sector. The EU package also extends the suspension of EU broadcasting licences of five Russian state-controlled media, Reuters reports. To curb the practice of ships loading Russian crude oil or petroleum products at sea, the package bans access to EU ports for ships which engage in ship-to-ship transfers if there is cause to suspect the cargo was of Russian origin. The package adds a further 71 persons and 33 entities to those banned from the EU and with EU assets frozen. The deal, in the making since April, had been held up by objections from Hungary and Greece over the listing by Ukraine of some of their companies as sponsors of war, because they did business with Russia or in other ways contributed to Moscow\u2019s war effort, according to Reuters. The EU has agreed an 11th package of sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, AFP reports. Sweden said the new measures were approved at a meeting of EU ambassadors in Brussels. Nato leaders are expected to endorse Ukraine\u2019s membership aspiration at a summit in July, but the alliance is wary of letting the country in during a war, according to reports. The UK foreign secretary, James Cleverly, on Wednesday indicated the UK would be \u201cvery supportive\u201d if Ukraine was able to go through a simplified process for joining Nato. Vladimir Putin reportedly said Moscow had seen a \u201clull\u201d in the Ukrainian counteroffensive, and that Kyiv had suffered heavy losses in attacks in the south. The Russian president said on Wednesday that Russia\u2019s new generation of Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missiles would soon be deployed for combat duty. Russia\u2019s top investigator reportedly claimed that over 30 Ukrainians had been given long jail terms in Russian-held Ukraine for committing what he described as serious crimes such as killing civilians. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said battlefield progress in Kyiv\u2019s counteroffensive against Russian forces had been \u201cslower than desired\u201d, the BBC reported on Wednesday. Ukraine\u2019s president has said that his county has made the west, including the EU, more united than ever before, in an address by video link to more than 1,000 businesses and foreign ministers at a two-day Ukraine Recovery conference in London. Zelenskiy also urged western leaders to help rebuild his war-torn country, as he hailed the reconstruction project as a crucial part of its fight for freedom. Rishi Sunak outlined how Ukraine must be supported to fast-track recovery and support this \u201chelp Ukraine unleash its potential\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s clear Russia must pay for the destruction that they\u2019ve inflicted. So we\u2019re working with allies to explore lawful routes to use Russian assets,\u201d the prime minister said at the conference. Two drones have been intercepted on their approach to military warehouses in the Moscow region, Andrei Vorobyov, the governor of the area, has said, according to Reuters. Latvia\u2019s prime minister, Kri\u0161j\u0101nis Kari\u0146\u0161, has been cited by the Kyiv Independent as having said at the Ukraine Recovery Conference that his country is completing the transfer of all of its helicopters to Ukraine. The EU on Wednesday agreed an 11th package of sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, AFP reports. Sweden, which holds the bloc\u2019s rotating presidency, said the new measures were approved at a meeting of EU ambassadors in Brussels. As part of the package, the bloc has put three Hong Kong-based companies on a list of firms to which the EU restricts exports of sensitive technologies, a document seen by AFP showed. Five companies from mainland China included in an earlier proposal were dropped from the list, a diplomat said, after Beijing pushed Brussels to take them off. Since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine last February, the EU has adopted 10 sanctions packages against Russian individuals and companies, inflicting economic and making financing the war more difficult. The UK foreign secretary, James Cleverly, indicated the UK would be \u201cvery supportive\u201d if Ukraine was able to go through a simplified process for joining Nato. He suggested the UK would back suggestions Ukraine would not be required to go through the membership action plan (Map) stage of joining the military alliance. The Map process sees candidate countries receive assessments and advice as they take steps to meet Nato criteria on defence and other matters. If Ukraine effectively skipped this, it would put them in a category with new member Finland. By contrast, North Macedonia took part in a 20-year Map programme before its 2020 entry. Speaking at a press conference at the Ukraine Recovery Conference in London, Cleverly said: \u201cWe have seen Ukraine evolve, and evolve incredibly quickly. \u201cJens Stoltenberg at the Nato informal foreign ministers (summit) said that actually, many of the requirements of membership action plan are actually being delivered. \u201cThe reform of their armed forces is happening whilst engaged in conflict. \u201cI think the UK\u2019s position would be very, very supportive if we moved on from the membership action plan recognising that the offer to both Sweden and Finland didn\u2019t require that and Ukrainians have demonstrated their commitment to reform the military for requirement of Nato membership through their actions on the battlefield. \u201cAnd I think all Nato allies recognise that.\u201d The UK has pledged to offer new virtual reality (VR) training for at-sea Ukrainian cadets as part of a new package of support. The UK government said the training would be provided through VR headsets to help participants practise for real-life scenarios. Ukrainians will also be sponsored to take part in three-year cadetships to UK container ships and other large vessels, with the new package confirmed as the transport secretary, Mark Harper, appeared at the Ukraine Recovery Conference. He said: Our support for Ukraine and its people is unwavering, and we\u2019re not going to let Russia\u2019s abhorrent actions sink Ukraine\u2019s great reputation in areas like seafaring By sharing the UK\u2019s world-renowned expertise in aviation and seafaring, we are steadfast in our commitment to ensuring Ukraine\u2019s transport system recovers from Putin\u2019s illegal invasion. The Department for Transport will also support secondments for Ukraine\u2019s air traffic controllers to train in the UK, with the latest funding following on from \u00a310m previously announced to help repair Ukraine\u2019s rail infrastructure. Harper joined other UK ministers in appearing at the conference, which was opened by the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, and addressed via video-link by the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Vladimir Putin said in remarks shown on Russian state television on Wednesday that Moscow had seen a \u201clull\u201d in the Ukrainian counteroffensive, and that Kyiv had suffered heavy losses in attacks in the south. The Russian president also said that although Ukraine retained offensive potential, Kyiv already understood that it had \u201cno chance\u201d in its counteroffensive, Reuters reports. Kyiv\u2019s forces have had \u201cpartial success\u201d in the last day and are digging in and attacking on the southern front, while weathering a big Russian assault in the east, a senior Ukrainian defence official said on Wednesday. None of these claims could immediately be independently verified. Ursula von der Leyen has said she proposed to EU members states to cover 45% of all the financial needs of Ukraine until 2027. Speaking at the Ukraine Recovery International Conference in London, the European Commission president said: Until 2027, Ukraine\u2019s remaining fiscal gap is about 60 billion euros. The needs for fast recovery are about 50 billion euros. That makes in total \u20ac110bn until 2027 that are not covered. Therefore, yesterday I proposed to EU member states to cover 45% of this gap \u2013 this is in total \u20ac50bn for Ukraine. The EU pumped \u20ac30bn (\u00a326bn) into Ukraine in the last year, diverting cash from energy and cohesion funds to respond to the crisis. On Tuesday it pledged a further \u20ac50bn in loans and grants, with the UK and the US following suit with a promise of $3bn and $1.3bn respectively in financial supports. My colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll has looked at the financial pledges western countries have made to Ukraine, considering whether it is enough to finance the huge recovery needed to rebuild the war-ravaged country. You can read her analysis here: Japan will host a conference to encourage companies to invest into Ukraine some time between the end of the year and early 2024, foreign minister, Yoshimasa Hayashi, was quoted by Reuters as saying. Japan was also planning to support Ukraine through projects focused on mine clearance, basic infrastructure such as electricity, agriculture and strengthening democracy, Hayashi told the Ukraine Recovery Conference in London. Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that Russia\u2019s new generation of Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missiles, which are capable of carrying 10 or more nuclear warheads, would soon be deployed for combat duty, Reuters reports. In a speech to new graduates of military academies, Putin stressed the importance of Russia\u2019s \u201ctriad\u201d of nuclear forces that can be launched from land, sea or air. \u201cThe most important task here is the development of the nuclear triad, which is a key guarantee of Russia\u2019s military security and global stability,\u201d he said. \u201cAlready about half of the units and formations of the Strategic Missile Forces are equipped with the latest Yars systems, and the troops are being re-equipped with modern missile systems with the Avangard hypersonic warhead.\u201d The first Sarmat launchers would be put on combat duty \u201cin the near future\u201d, the Russian president added. Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, meanwhile, has told graduating military academy students that the \u201ccollective West\u201d was waging a \u201creal war\u201d against Russia. A UN official said on Wednesday that the mines dislodged by the flood waters from Kakhovka dam in Ukraine could float downstream and reach as far as Black Sea beaches, Reuters reports. Paul Heslop, head of UN Mine Action at the United Nations Development Programme in Ukraine, told reporters in Geneva that PMF-1 mines, also known as \u201cbutterfly\u201d mines, were light enough to float downstream for a large distance. He said: I would not be surprised to see that those mines have either got down as far as the sea or over the coming months, as the water is continuing to flow, will be transported down there. Unfortunately, we could see anti-personnel pressure mines washing up on beaches around the Black Sea. The collapse of the Russian-held dam on 6 June unleashed floodwaters across southern Ukraine and Russian-occupied areas of the Kherson region, killing more than 50 people and destroying homes and farmland. Poland\u2019s ministry of foreign affairs has tweeted that it has prepared a law enabling the extension of insurance coverage for the transport of goods to and from Ukraine, as well as investment activities. Britain, the US and the EU pledged billions of dollars of extra help to rebuild Ukraine on Wednesday. European Commission chiefs want Hungary to answer urgent questions over claims that Ukrainian prisoners of war were transferred there from Russia without the involvement of Kyiv. Viktor Orban, the Hungarian prime minister, has forged strong political and economic ties with Moscow and said earlier this month that Budapest had received a group of 11 Ukrainian prisoners of war from Russia. Ukraine repatriated three of them on Tuesday and is demanding access to the remainder accusing Orban of a publicity stunt. Hungarian and international media quoted Orban\u2019s chief-of-staff, Gergely Gulyas, as saying the soldiers arrived in Hungary of \u201ctheir own free will\u201d and that Kyiv was informed after their transfer. \u201cIt\u2019s very important that they relevant Hungarian authorities explain to their Ukrainian counterparts. We are seeking asnwers,\u201d said a spokesperson for the European commission. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said battlefield progress in Kyiv\u2019s counteroffensive against Russian forces had been \u201cslower than desired\u201d, the BBC reported on Wednesday. \u201cSome people believe this is a Hollywood movie and expect results now. It\u2019s not,\u201d it quoted the Ukrainian president as saying in an interview. Ukraine has reported recapturing eight villages in the south in the last two weeks. Though small, the advances are the biggest by its forces since November as they push into heavily fortified and mined Russian-held areas. Rishi Sunak met Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, as well as Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, at the Ukraine Recovery Conference in London. A Downing Street spokesperson said: The prime minister met with the president of the European commission, president of Estonia, prime ministers of Latvia and Ukraine, and the US secretary of state this morning. The prime minister thanked the leaders for attending the Ukraine Recovery Conference in London and for their strong and ongoing support to Ukraine. Reflecting on the work that had already begun in Ukraine to recover and rebuild, the Prime Minister said it is inspiring to see that progress happening at the same time as the armed forces of Ukraine pushed back Russian forces. Discussing the important role of the private sector in the rebuild of Ukraine, the prime minister said it was fantastic to see so many companies and businesses attend the London summit. Officials and business leaders at the Ukraine Recovery Conference should ensure that any \u201cMarshall Plan\u201d for the war-ravaged country includes ensuring children are not separated from their families, Disability Rights International, Hope and Homes for Children, Human Rights Watch and Lumos say. The groups said replacing Ukraine\u2019s institutional care system with modern social services, that strengthen families to help keep them together, should be a key feature to the reconstruction plans. Mark Waddington, CEO of Hope and Homes for Children, said: There\u2019s a hidden humanitarian crisis playing out in Ukraine, where millions of families are displaced, social services are in tatters, unemployment is growing, food prices are rocketing, daily air raids are the norm and trauma from Russian occupation is widespread. As a result, many parents are struggling to cope, and thousands of children are at risk of being placed in harmful institutions. Now, at a time of war, children need loving and comforting families more than ever. The Ukraine Recovery Conference offers an incredible opportunity to talk about physical reconstruction of buildings, roads and infrastructure, but it must also address social reconstruction that directly serves families and children. This must include a commitment to closing every last children\u2019s institution in Ukraine, and creating a modern care system that helps to keep families together. Families are the future of Ukraine, and leaders at the recovery conference must not ignore this. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said that Ukraine has succeeded in making the EU as united \u201cas it has never been before\u201d, with his country \u201cactivating the moral force of Nato\u201d. Ukraine\u2019s president is pushing for Ukraine to join Nato and the EU. Russia\u2019s top investigator has said that more than 30 Ukrainians had been given long jail terms in Russian-held Ukraine for committing what he described as serious crimes such as killing civilians, Reuters reports. The comments were made by Alexander Bastrykin, head of the Investigative Committee, Russia\u2019s equivalent of the FBI in the US. He was reported as saying the courts operating on territory in parts of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions controlled by Russian forces had been working hard to jail people who had fought on the Ukrainian side against Russia. \u201cAfter the liberation of Mariupol and other settlements, many Ukrainian nationalists surrendered. In the course of further work, we began to establish their involvement in crimes against peace and human security, including the killing of civilians,\u201d Bastrykin told Russia\u2019s Tass news agency. He said 90 criminal cases had been sent to courts. \u201cBased on the evidence gathered, courts have already convicted more than 30 defendants, sentencing them to long terms of imprisonment and some to life imprisonment,\u201d Bastrykin added. The alleged war crimes referred to by Bastrykin could not immediately be independently verified. Russia is itself under pressure for alleged war crimes, with the international criminal court having issued an arrest warrant in March against Vladimir Putin, accusing him of the war crime of illegally deporting hundreds of children from Ukraine. The Kremlin has rejected the allegation as false. The French foreign minister, Catherine Colonna, has set out a new war insurance mechanism to support Ukraine\u2019s recovery, Reuters reports. \u201cI\u2019m announcing today the establishment of an insurance mechanism to cover investments in Ukraine against war-related risks via the French public investment bank,\u201d Colonna said at the Ukraine Recovery Conference in London on Wednesday. She added that the French government\u2019s plan was consistent with the insurance mechanism proposed by Britain and Ukraine. The comments come as the UK is introducing new laws that will allow ministers to maintain Russian sanctions until compensation is paid to Ukraine, thus introducing a way for frozen Russian assets to be donated to Ukrainian reconstruction. Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged western leaders to help rebuild his war-torn country, as he hailed the reconstruction project as a crucial part of its fight for freedom. The Ukrainian president addressed the Ukraine Recovery Conference in London via video-link on Wednesday, as Rishi Sunak and the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, reiterated their support for the country. Sunak outlined how Ukraine must be supported to fast track recovery and support this \u201chelp Ukraine unleash its potential\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s clear Russia must pay for the destruction that they\u2019ve inflicted. So we\u2019re working with allies to explore lawful routes to use Russian assets,\u201d the prime minister said at the conference. Two drones have been intercepted on their approach to military warehouses in the Moscow region, Andrei Vorobyov, the governor of the area, has said, according to Reuters. Ukrainian forces are \u201cvery actively destroying the enemy, physically clearing Ukraine,\u201d President Zelenskiy said in his latest evening address. Hello everyone, this is Yohannes Lowe. I\u2019ll be running the blog until 7pm (UK time). Please do feel free to get in touch on Twitter if you have any story tips. Speaking after Zelenskiy, the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said she had \u201cno doubt\u201d that Ukraine would join the EU. Addressing the conference, she praised the progress and speed of reform in the country, she said Europe could never match the country\u2019s sacrifice but did stand united behind it. She spoke about a recent visit to Ukraine: I saw a country that does everything possible to rise from the ashes of the war. Everything they are fighting for, and what they are dying for. They show it on the battlefield. They show it on the streets. They show it in the classrooms. They are fighting for their future. Setting out her hopes for the future of Ukraine, Von der Leyen said it would become a \u201ccountry that attracts foreign investment, a country that is master of its future, a country that is a member of the European Union\u201d. She added: Together we gather here to tell Ukrainians that their dream is also our dream [\u2026] Ukrainians tell us, when they imagine their future, they see Europe\u2019s flag flying over their cities. I have no doubt that Ukraine will be part of our union. Zelenskiy ends his speech with an impassioned please to political and business leaders, stressing that the future of Ukraine is also the future of the world. We are building much more than one country. We are building a world, as it will be during the lifetime of our generation and after us. Will it be peaceful? Will it be stable?Will it be democratic? It depends on each and every one of us. After thanking Sunak \u2013 who he mentions he has not seen in \u201cquite a while\u201d \u2013 and the UK, he ends with \u201cSlava Ukraine\u201d. Zelenskiy moves onto to talking about the importance of Ukraine in strengthening democracy throughout the world. Russia invaded Ukraine, not only to steal our land, resources and people, without Ukraine that can be no Russian plan. [\u2026] Russian bosses are very, very afraid of our democracy. Why? Because democracy paves the way for the rule of law [and] getting rid of corruption. Under the key principle of our countries, every person matters. This is very important. And of course, democracy is in the nature of Ukrainians, and we will do it anyway, no matter what they think, or do in Russia. But we all have to realise that the more democracy we have, the greater is the strength in our entire region. The more rule of law we have, the more law will work here on the eastern flank of Europe. The Ukrainian president argues that the war is showing the rest of the world the weaknesses that other countries have to address, from the transformation of energy to modern warfare including the threat of cyber attacks. We are doing all these in Ukraine. We need the experience of our partners in all these. We build security together and thus may convince the world that democracies can be defended. Zelenskiy stresses the huge need for reconstruction in Ukraine. There is currently no place in the world where there is a need to construct and rebuild as many objects as in Ukraine. Every new day of Russian agrression, brings new ruins. Thousands, thousands and thousands of destroyed houses, devastated industries, burned lives. He accuses Russia of committing \u201cthe largest crime of ecocide in Europe\u201d by destroying the Nova Kakhovka dam. Zelenskiy says he sees no alternative to the green transformation of the economy, and that the war has proved the extent to which energy is a key security issue. It is green energy that guarantees real energy stability. Ukraine can be and will be one of the key suppliers of clean electricity and green hydrogen to ensure that. The potential of this interest here alone is about $400bn. Zelenskiy says his country is developing strong bilateral alliances with leaders of democratic world, including the U K, the US, Canada, Japan, Australia all the EU members. These alliances provide new power in defence, the economy and global prospects for democracy, he says. He points out that political and economic stability in Ukraine benefits the whole globe, saying that at least 600 million consumers around the world directly depend on Ukraine\u2019s agricultural production. Zelenskiy says that when the country underwent a blockage by Russia, the world was threatened by price rises and social collapse. He says Ukraine has now partially restored movement of agriculture which is bringing stability and economic benefits around the world. Zelenskiy thanks the nations supporting Ukraine and says he hopes the conference will come up with concrete projects. He says Ukraine has succeeded in uniting the European Union like never before, which is reflected in \u201cmany political economic sanction and humanitarian decisions\u201d. He adds: Ukraine has activated all the power of solidarity for which the EU was configured. The moral leadership in protecting peace \u201cis only possible with Ukraine\u201d, he says. Moving onto to Nato, he says: We are already defending the common space of freedom in the alliance and are only waiting for the alliance leaders to recognise this [political\u2019] reality.\u201d Zelenskiy says growth and strong investments must be preceded by trust and the plan for Ukraine must be \u201cpreceded by confidence that that\u2019s what has been rebuilt will not fall\u201d. He argues that while no one has the power to eradicate evil, it can be overcome. He says the world is watching to see if normal life can be restored in Ukraine. If it is, that will be an \u201cideological blow\u201d to the aggressor, he adds. And it\u2019s not about bricks, but about life in general. The world is abandoned with ruins reminding us of the wars of the past. And politics in different regions, unfortunately, is abandoned with sick ideas of hate, rage and resentment which point to possible wars in the future. [\u2026] No one has the power to cleanse the depths of human nature from the evil that some sometimes rises to the surface and destroys and kills. But given time, and right now, we are able to protect lives and overcome their ruins. [\u2026] The eyes of the world are looking at us and at whether we will defeat Russian aggression exactly as freedom deserves to win \u2013 that is without compromising our values. Also the world is watching to see if we will restore normal life in such a way that our transformation will land an ideological defeat on the aggressor. We protect Ukraine and thus we protect freedom. And when we build Ukraine we will build freedom, country, region, continent, world. It\u2019s a global task. Ukraine president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, is now addressing the conference. He says: Mr Prime Minister, thank you for your kind words about Ukraine and our soldiers. And thanks for your leadership and the support the UK provides to Ukraine. Thank you that we are really united in defending freedom. Dear leaders of politics, business and public opinion. Dear presidents, prime ministers, ministers, heads of international organisations, and of course, dear journalists, when we are talking about recovery we are talking about millions of jobs, billions in corporate profits and GDP. And not only for Ukraine but for all our countries mine and yours. Countries that want, and will, live freely. Sunak ends his address with a message of hope, telling the story of a Ukrainian soldier. He says: He was stationed in an empty house, not far from the frontline, surrounded by the destruction of war. When he could snatch a moment of free time, he used it to plant seeds. He was trying to create a plot of vegetables, hoping that by the time the homeowners returned, they would have begun to grow. What a profound expression of hope. And, you know, from that house to this hall, we\u2019re doing the same thing. We\u2019re planting the seeds of Ukraine\u2019s future. Today, we can water them and in time the Ukrainian people will harvest them. Sunak goes on to say the business, governments and financial institutions must partner to invest and shore up the country. He says: To make this happen. The British government will continue to play its full part. And I\u2019m proud that today we\u2019re announcing a multi year commitment to support Ukraine\u2019s economy. Over three years, we will provide loan guarantees worth $3bn we\u2019re also launching a new UK Ukraine tech bridge to foster investment and talent, along with support for green energy and more all part of a vast collective effort from allies and partners around the world, including significant new support from the EU, which is also being announced this week. Financial institutions are playing their part. The IMF is putting $15bn into Ukraine over the next four years as part of a $115bn commitment by the G7 and its partners and institutions like the EBRD providing seed capital to support private sector led growth. Because above all, we must build a platform for business. Only they can truly crowd in the innovation and investment that Ukraine needs. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re launching the Ukraine business compact for the private sector to pledge their support for Ukraine\u2019s recovery and reconstruction. And I am delighted to announce today that over 400 businesses from 38 countries with a combined market cap of $4.9tn has now signed up the City of London has a huge amount to offer. And that deepened liquid capital markets and world class finance expertise. So there is no better place to announce today the New London conference framework for war risk insurance. This is a huge step forward towards helping insurers to underwrite the investments into Ukraine, removing one of the biggest barriers and giving investors the confidence they need to act. Sunak outlines how Ukraine must be supported to fast track recovery and support this \u201chelp Ukraine unleash its potential\u201d. He says Russia must pay for the violence it has inflicted on the country. Sunak says: It\u2019s clear Russia must pay for the destruction that they\u2019ve inflicted. So we\u2019re working with allies to explore lawful routes to use Russian assets. And on Monday, we publish new legislation to allow us to keep sanctions in place until Russia pays up. The UK\u2019s prime minister, Rishi Sunak, is now speaking at the Ukraine Recovery Conference, saying the conference is \u201cplanting the seeds of Ukraine\u2019s future\u201d. We covered the trail of his speech below (see 7.47), but here is some more: Sunak says: Before this terrible war Ukraine\u2019s economy was becoming a huge investment opportunity. It was the breadbasket of Europe, exporting millions of tonnes of food and grain each month. Top five exporter of iron ore and steel, a leader in energy, pushing forward renewables hydrogen and electric vehicles, and the startup nation, which helped spark names like PayPal, WhatsApp and revolute with a thriving tech sector, which actually had a record year in 2022. Because the truth is that opportunity is still there today. In fact, the war has only proved how much Ukraine has to offer. When I visited Kyiv, last November, I saw this for myself. I saw Ukraine\u2019s incredible spirit, a spirit yes of strength and defiance. But also of ingenuity and innovation. In a converted office block, I met tech experts, civilian and military, who were working together to find new ways to bolster the country\u2019s defences. They were networking mobile phones, so that people across Ukraine could download an app, which would allow their phone to pick up the sound of the showerhead drone feedback the location so that Ukrainian air defence could track them and shoot them down during the winter Russia tried to destroy Ukraine\u2019s energy grid. By February over 40% of power generation was down. But now because of that incredible ingenuity and defiance, Ukraine has got the grid back online, and they\u2019re even able to start exporting electricity back to Europe. As we\u2019ve seen in backwards and Mariupol. What Russia cannot take, it will seek to destroy. They want to do the same to Ukraine\u2019s economy. And the scale of the challenge is real. The war brought a 29% Fall in Ukraine\u2019s GDP last year. [more follows] The Ukraine Recovery Conference has started in London this morning. The foreign secretary, James Cleverly, is addressing the conference. He says: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome. There are over 1,000 public and private sector decision-makers here. Governments representing 61 states, 33 international organisations, over 400 businesses and 130 civil society organisations. After nearly 18 months of Ukraine withstanding the Russian full scale invasion, the international community is coming together today with a shared belief and confidence in Ukraine\u2019s future. Russia\u2019s full scale invasion has caused untold suffering, but Ukraine is rebuilding now. Recovery offers an opportunity not only to repair what was lost, but stride forward and to rebuild an economy that is more modern, more open, greener and more resilient. When I visited Kyiv recently, I could see the construction equipment from JCB already visible everywhere. This you are see is about unlocking Ukraine\u2019s potential, supporting Ukraine\u2019s immediate recovery needs and unlocking a private sector led recovery. After the sacrifices and suffering of the war, Ukrainians are planning for a better future. And it is in the interests of the world, that the country they rebuild should be stronger than ever, integrated into global markets, and self reliant. Ukrainian forces are reinforcing positions they have reached in areas of the southern front line after having \u201cpartial success\u201d fighting Russian forces, a military spokesperson said today. Reuters reports: Ukrainian forces are conducting offensive operations in the direction of the Russian-occupied cities of Melitopol and Berdiansk in the Zaporizhzhia region, general staff spokesperson Andriy Kovalev said, listing names of southeastern villages. \u201cThey had partial success in the directions of Novodanilivka \u2013 Robotyne, Mala Tokmachka \u2013 Verbove, Vilne Pole \u2013 Makarivka, they are consolidating at the achieved boundaries,\u201d he was quoted as saying by the Ukraine military media centre. Ukraine is also fighting to hold back an advance of Russian troops in the east, with \u201cespecially heavy fighting\u201d taking place along near Lyman in the Donetsk region, he said. Ukraine said on Monday it had recaptured eight villages in two weeks of counteroffensive operations in the occupied south but that the Kremlin\u2019s forces were trying to regain the initiative in the east by stepping up attacks. The UK Ministry of Defence has issued its update on the situation in Ukraine: Intense fighting continues in sectors of southern Ukraine. However, over recent weeks, Russia has continued to expend significant effort building defensive lines deep in rear areas, especially on the approaches to occupied Crimea. This includes an extensive zone of defences of 9 km in length, 3.5 km north of the town Armyansk, on the narrow bridge of land connecting Crimea to the Kherson region. These elaborate defences highlight the Russian command\u2019s assessment that Ukrainian forces are capable of directly assaulting Crimea. Russia continues to see maintaining control of the peninsula as a top political priority. Russia\u2019s defence ministry said its forces thwarted a Ukrainian drone attack on the Moscow region, and that three drones had been shot down. The UK has backed $3bn of World Bank loan guarantees to shore up Ukraine\u2019s economic stability, the government announced today. In what the government is calling the support \u201cthe first bilateral package of multi-year fiscal assistance to be set out by a G7 country\u201d. At a two-day Ukraine recovery conference in London today, Sunak will outline a package which will also include \u00a3240m ($306m) of bilateral assistance and an expansion of British International Investment in Ukraine. The UK\u2019s support is backed by the Ukraine Business Compact which consists of more than 400 companies from 38 countries, with a combined annual revenue of over $1.6tn, who today pledge to back Ukraine\u2019s recovery and reconstruction. Virgin, Sanofi, Philips, Hyundai Engineering and Citi are among the companies involved. The compact will, according to the government, trade, investment, peer-to-peer expertise sharing and responsible business practice in Ukraine, ensuring it can rebuild as a resilient, agile and prosperous economy. The UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, said: As we\u2019ve seen in Bakhmut and Mariupol, what Russia cannot take it will seek to destroy. They want to do the same to Ukraine\u2019s economy. The scale of the challenge is real, the war brought a 29% fall in Ukraine\u2019s GDP last year, but just look at the streets of Kyiv, despite the threat of attack, people are getting on with their lives \u2013 and getting on with business. [\u2026] I\u2019m proud that today we\u2019re announcing a multiyear commitment to support Ukraine\u2019s economy, and over the next three years, we will provide loan guarantees worth $3 billion. President of the World Bank Group, Ajay Banga, said: The UK government\u2019s generous guarantees to the World Bank Group will support the people of Ukraine at a critical moment. The World Bank Group is designed to do hard things like helping people rebuild their lives after devastation. With this support, we will keep delivering on that mission and help Ukrainians imagine a life after the war. After more than a year of war in Ukraine, the package is designed to encourage the private sector to use its resources to help speed Ukraine\u2019s reconstruction. To deal with the issue of insurance against war damage and destruction, the prime minister will also launch a framework a range of measures designed to \u201cde-risk\u201d Ukraine to increase investor confidence, including providing guarantees and insurance for reconstruction projects now while the conflict is ongoing through the Multilateral Investment Guarantees Agency. He will also launch the London Conference Framework for War Risk Insurance at the summit and that some major companies had already signed up to the Ukraine Business Compact, a statement of support for Ukraine\u2019s recovery. In addition Sunak is announcing up to \u00a3250m of new capital for the UK\u2019s Development Finance Institution - British International Investment (BII) \u2013 to support infrastructure projects, energy markets, financial services and agriculture. Ahead of the conference, a senior Ukrainian official said Ukraine is seeking up to $40bn to fund the first part of a \u201cGreen Marshall Plan\u201d to rebuild its economy, including developing a coal-free steel industry. The total reconstruction bill is likely to be huge, with Ukraine, the World Bank, the European Commission and the United Nations estimating in March that the cost was at $411bn for the first year of the war. It could easily reach more than $1tn. Ukrainian forces are gaining some ground towards Melitopol and Berdiansk in the southern Zaporizhzhia region, Andriy Kovalev, a spokesman for the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, has said according to Reuters. \u201cThey had partial success, they are gaining ground,\u201d Kovalev was quoted as saying in a post on the Ukraine Military Media Center\u2019s Telegram channel, adding that the gains were near the settlements of Mala Tokmachka and Robotyne, among others. Ukraine continues to hold back the advance of Russian troops in the east of the country, with \u201cespecially heavy fighting\u201d taking place along near Lyman in the Donetsk region, he added. \u201cIntense fighting\u201d is continuing in southern Ukraine, the UK\u2019s Ministry of Defence says in its latest update on the conflict. It reports that Russia has recently spent \u201csignificant effort building defensive lines deep in rear areas, especially on the approaches to occupied Crimea\u201d, highlighting Moscow\u2019s \u201cassessment that Ukrainian forces are capable of directly assaulting Crimea\u201d. \u201cRussia continues to see maintaining control of the peninsula as a top political priority,\u201d it says. Back to the drones reportedly intercepted in Russia. The country\u2019s Tass news agency has reported, citing unnamed law enforcement sources, that another drone was shot down near Lukino village in Moscow region, according to Reuters. Tass also reported two of the drones were intercepted on their way to the Taman Division of Russia\u2019s Ground Forces. The division is based in Kalininets, some 60km (37 miles) from the Kremlin. Reuters could not independently verify the reports. It was not immediately known who launched the drones. In May, drones struck wealthy districts of Moscow, in what Russia said was a Ukrainian attack and one politician called the most dangerous attack on the capital since World War Two. Ukraine almost never publicly claims responsibility for attacks inside Russia or on Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine. More from the ISW analysis, which reports that the Belarusian General Staff has confirmed that Belarus has amended the language of its constitution to renounce its neutrality and non-nuclear status. Deputy Head of the Faculty of the Belarusian General Staff Colonel Andrey Bogodel stated on June 20 that in order to respond to \u201cexternal challenges and threats,\u201d Belarus has made requisite changes to its constitution renouncing its neutrality and removing the wording on its non-nuclear status. The move comes after Russian president Vladimir Putin last week said the first tactical nuclear weapons to be stationed in Belarus had arrived. Responding to the announcement, US president Joe Biden said the threat that Russia could use tactical nuclear weapons was \u201creal\u201d. The Institute for the Study of War highlights Russia\u2019s efforts to expand its military recruitment pool in its latest assessment, noting that it has lowered its eligibility requirements once again. It points to a report by Tass newswire which says that the Duma on Tuesday adopted the third and final reading of a law which will allow citizens with criminal records and those deemed \u201cpartially fit\u201d for military service to sign contracts with the military during wartime. The Russian Ministry of Defence has already recruited about 15,000 prisoners since February, according to the Russian human rights organisation Rus Sidyashchaya, the ISW writes. The wires have sent through a series of images from the Without Limits clinic in Kyiv, which helps people learn to walk again using prosthetic limbs. The clinic says it has seen a massive increase in demand since the Russian invasion began in February 2022 and estimates 80% of its patients are former soldiers. Two drones have been intercepted on their approach to military warehouses in the Moscow region, Andrei Vorobyov, the governor of the area, has said according to Reuters. \u201cDebris was found, no damage or casualties,\u201d Vorobyov said, adding that the drones fell near the village of Kalininets. Russia\u2019s channels on the Telegram messaging app, including one with links to the security services, said at least one more drone was intercepted near the village of Lukino. Ukrainian forces are \u201cvery actively destroying the enemy, physically clearing Ukraine,\u201d president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said in his latest evening address. \u201cProtection against terror means the destruction of terrorists. And it is a guarantee that the evil state will never again have the opportunity to bring evil to Ukraine,\u201d he continued. Ukraine is now more than two weeks into its counteroffensive and has made small advances. General Oleksander Syrskyi, Ukraine\u2019s commander of land forces, said on Telegram on Tuesday that his troops were making progress on the flanks of the shattered eastern city of Bakhmut, which fell to Russian mercenaries last month after months of fighting, Reuters reported. Ukrainian troops, he said, were repelling increasingly intense Russian attacks near Kupiansk in the northeast. Deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said Ukrainian forces in the south were \u201cgradually, in small steps, but very confidently, making advances. We could even use the allegory that we are carving up every metre of land from the enemy.\u201d Leaders and representatives from more than 60 countries are expected in London from Wednesday for a two-day conference to secure funding to help Ukraine recover from the ravages of war. The EU will provide Ukraine with $54.58bn in aid for 2024-27, the bloc\u2019s president, Ursula von der Leyen said ahead of the summit, while the British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, is set to unveil a major package, including $3bn of additional guarantees to unlock World Bank lending, according to his office. More from AFP: The International Ukraine Recovery Conference 2023, hosted by UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, is the second to be held since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February last year. The first, in Lugano, Switzerland, in July last year saw Kyiv\u2019s allies commit to supporting Ukraine through what is expected to be an eye-wateringly expensive and decades-long recovery. Ukraine\u2018s Prime Minister Denys Shmygal told them rebuilding could cost at least $750 billion. The World Bank has since put an estimate of $14 billion on Ukraine\u2018s immediate needs for repairing the damage caused by the bitter fighting. But a recent study by the World Bank, the UN, the European Union and the Ukrainian government said the wider recovery of the economy would cost $441 billion. Whatever the final amount, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has likened it to the amount of money needed for the US-led Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe after World War II. Hello and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the war in Ukraine with me, Helen Livingstone. Ukrainian forces in the south and east are \u201cactively destroying the enemy\u201d, president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said in his latest evening address, more than two weeks into Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive. Ahead of a major conference in London at which the UK and EU are set to pledge billions of dollars in aid for the rebuilding of Ukraine, Zelenskiy also assured his international partners that \u201cUkraine uses every weapon and every shell as efficiently as possible and always to protect lives\u201d. He said Ukraine\u2019s recovery \u201cwill become not only construction projects, but also a global project of protection\u201d. \u201cA rebuilt Ukraine, a transformed Ukraine, a strengthened Ukraine is a carrier of security and a guarantor of security, it is protection against any form of Russian terror and protection against any repetition of Russian aggression,\u201d he said. In other developments: Ahead of the conference, a senior Ukraine official said the country would struggle to absorb the expected billions of western private and public sector aid for its recovery not due to corruption, but a simple lack of capacity to process and invest such huge sums. \u201cHistorically the largest amount of money we have been capable of working with was $6bn a year in 2014,\u201d said Mustafa Nayyem, the head of the Ukraine State Agency for Restoration and Infrastructure Development. Russia has threatened strikes on Kyiv\u2019s \u201cdecision-making centres\u201d if Ukraine uses western-supplied missiles against the occupied peninsula of Crimea. Sergei Shoigu, the Russian defence minister, said the potential use of US-supplied Himars and UK-supplied Storm Shadow missiles against targets in Crimea would mark the west\u2019s \u201cfull involvement in the conflict and would entail immediate strikes upon decision-making centres in Ukrainian territory\u201d. Ukraine\u2019s military intelligence chief has accused Russia of \u201cmining\u201d the cooling pond used to keep the reactors cool at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine\u2019s south. \u201cMost terrifying is that the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant was additionally mined during that time \u2026 namely the cooling pond was mined,\u201d Kyrylo Budanov, head of the GUR agency, said on television, without providing evidence. The Pentagon says that it overestimated the value of the weapons it has sent to Ukraine by $6.2bn over the past two years \u2013 about double early estimates \u2013 resulting in a surplus that will be used for future security packages. Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh said a detailed review of the accounting found an error of $3.6bn in the current fiscal year and $2.6bn in the 2022 fiscal year, which ended on 30 September. The UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, has called for an acceleration of Black Sea grain shipments from Ukrainian ports under a deal allowing safe wartime exports, a UN spokesperson said as Russia threatens to quit the pact which is due for renewal on 17 July. Guterres was disappointed by a slowing pace of ship inspections, spokesperson Farhan Haq said, and the exclusion of Pivdennyi (Yuzhny) port \u2013 one of three Ukrainian ports covered by the Black Sea export deal. Kyiv has repatriated three Ukrainian prisoners of war from Hungary where they were transferred from Russia without coordination with Kyiv, said Ukrainian foreign ministry spokesperson Oleg Nikolenko, who had previously accused Hunary of ignoring Kyiv\u2019s requests for access to the PoWs. Ukrainian diplomats and other relevant Ukrainian authorities were working to try to bring back the remaining prisoners of war, Nikolenko said. Prosecutors said they had served a notice of suspicion to Kyiv\u2019s head of municipal security after three people died in a Russian air attack when they were unable to get into a bomb shelter. The deaths on 1 June caused public outrage and prompted the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to vow a harsh response. The destruction of the vast Kakhovka hydroelectric dam has caused \u20ac1.2bn euros of damage, the Ukrainian environment minister Ruslan Strilets has told his EU counterparts. He also warned that mines unearthed by flooding could wash on to other European countries\u2019 shores and that \u201cthere are things that we can never restore. These are the ecosystems that were washed away into the Black Sea.\u201d The Ukrainian kickboxing champion Maksym Bordus has been killed fighting Russian forces, according to a website that lists athletes killed in the war. Bordus was killed on 11 June in \u201cfierce fighting against Russian invaders\u201d, according to Sport Angels, a Ukrainian website set up with the assistance of the Sports Committee, which brings together NGOs and federations from non-Olympic sports."}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db4f7", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/jun/21/titanic-sub-live-updates-search-us-coast-guard-submarine-submersible", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Titanic sub live updates: vessel may have less than 20 hours of oxygen left, says US Coast Guard, as search continues", "lead": "R Adm John Mauger says figure is based on initial estimate of 96-hour supply; search operation will continue \u2018as long as there\u2019s an opportunity for survival\u2019", "author": "L\u00e9onie Chao-Fong (now) and Jon Henley (earlier)", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 15:27:01", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.988626", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/c9f8f8e53946228332638d5631252f1e538063a6/0_0_1600_960/500.jpg", "body": "Here\u2019s more from Rear Adm John Mauger, of the US coast guard, who said rescue efforts are prioritising both surface and sub-surface searches for the missing sub. Mauger, speaking to BBC News, said: This has been a very complex and difficult case for all of us but as we continue to actively search for the submersible and the people onboard our thoughts are with the crew members and their families who, I can imagine, are having a very difficult time at this point. He added: We have two vessels, two remote-operated vessels, a remote-operated vehicle conducting a sub-surface search, and we have an aircraft and surface vessels which are conducting the surface search at this moment. The crew of the submersible Titan may have less than 20 hours of breathable air remaining, if they are still alive, a US Coast Guard official has said. R Adm John Mauger, speaking to BBC News, said it is hard to determine exactly how long they have, due to various factors. The 20 hour estimate is based on an initial estimate that said the vessel had a 96-hour supply of oxygen. The veteran Titanic diver Joe MacInnis has just been speaking on CNN about the banging heard from the Titan search site overnight. He says it\u2019s a \u201csign of hope\u201d: It\u2019s an indication, possibly, of human activity that is coordinated. And this is the kind of thing that we hope [for]. We\u2019re all engaged in this kind of collective imagination, what\u2019s going on down there? We\u2019re beset with fear and sadness and hope and uncertainty. But these sounds have given us a sense of hope. And let\u2019s hope that we can solve this problem before the oxygen runs out. We haven\u2019t got much time left. The Canadian explorer MacInnis is one of the biggest and most respected names in Titanic folklore, having been an integral part of Robert Ballard\u2019s 1985 expedition that discovered the wreck of the doomed ocean liner 12,500ft below the surface of the Atlantic. Earlier this week he spoke to the Guardian\u2019s Leyland Cecco about the search operation for the missing submersible Titan. Read the interview here: The US coast guard has released an updated weather on scene in the Titan sub search area, where gusty winds of up to 23mph and wave heights up to 7ft are possible. The French ship Atalante, carrying a robot that can dive to 20,000ft (6,000 metres) underwater, is expected to arrive late today to join the search operation for the missing sub. The unmanned robot, called Victor 6000, can dive deeper than other equipment now at the site in the North Atlantic and has arms that can be remotely controlled to cut cables or perform other manoeuvres to release a stuck vessel, Reuters reported, citing the robot\u2019s operator, Ifremer. Victor \u201cis not capable of lifting the submarine on its own\u201d but it can help hook the Titan sub to a ship with the capacity to lift it to the surface, Ifremer\u2019s head of naval operations, Olivier Lefort, said. Victor is able to do visual exploration with all the video equipment it has. It is also equipped with manipulating arms which could be used to extricate the sub, such as by sectioning cables or things that would be blocking it at the bottom. He said the 25-strong crew required to operate the robot \u201ccan work non-stop for up to 72 hours\u201d once it reaches the site. He added: We don\u2019t know what happened. The noises that were heard give us hope the submarine is on the seabed and that people are still alive, but other scenarios are possible. Even if hope is slim, we\u2019ll go all the way. Magellan, an international exploration company that digitally mapped the Titanic wreckage last year, has said it is \u201cready to support\u201d the search for the missing submersible. The British firm, which specialises in deep ocean investigations and recovery operations, said on its website that it was contacted by the sub\u2019s operator, OceanGate, on Monday and \u201cimmediately offered our knowledge of the specific site and also our expertise operating at depth considerably in advance of what is required for this incident\u201d. A statement by Magellan said: We have been working full-time with UK and US agencies to secure the necessary air support to move our specialist equipment and support crew. It was previously reported that US authorities had failed to give Magellan the necessary permits to participate in the search. The Telegraph reported that a team of deepwater specialists had been waiting to leave an airport in the Channel Islands since Monday evening, but that US officials had indicated that they would prefer to use a New York-based vessel instead. When asked for comment about these reports, Magellan told ABC News it \u201cdoes not wish to comment on any specific media report\u201d. The five passengers on board the missing submersible have less than 24 hours of air supply left \u2013 if they are still alive. The Titan vessel has 96 hours of air supply, according to its specifications. On Tuesday at about 17.00 GMT, the US Coast Guard said the Titan sub had enough air for 41 hours, which would mean a deadline of roughly 10.00 GMT on Thursday. Those inside the sub will be \u201cresting, breathing as little as possible, and trying to keep calm\u201d in order to conserve energy, Joe MacInnis, who has made two trips to the wreck of the Titanic, told CNN earlier today. OceanGate, the company that operates the sub, has not commented on conditions and provisions on the Titan, the BBC reports. But based on the accounts of those who have previously been inside the vessel, there will have been food and water available. Mike Reiss, a producer and writer for The Simpsons, boarded the Titan vessel last summer. Sandwiches and water were available on the sub, but he recalled being told that many passengers did not eat during the journey, and that the rudimentary toilet on board had never been used, the New York Times reported. CBS News correspondent David Pogue went on the OceanGate Titan in November, and compared the sub to being in a \u201cminivan without seats\u201d. In an interview with NPR, Pogue said: There really is no safety gear in there except for a fire extinguisher and fire masks, which we practised putting on and taking off. That\u2019s pretty much it, because there\u2019s not much you can do if something goes wrong. Images from OceanGate show a vessel measuring 6.7 x 2.8 x 2.5 metres, where only one passenger can stretch their legs out at one time. As the Guardian\u2019s science editor Ian Sample points out, if the Titan has surfaced, the danger for the crew is not over: the hatch appears to be bolted from the outside, meaning those inside will still need to rely on emergency oxygen to breathe. Three vessels have arrived on the scene to join the rescue operation, the US Coast Guard has said. Among them are the Canadian Coast Guard\u2019s scientific research vessel, the John Cabot, which has sonar search capabilities, the Canadian Atlantic Merlin and subsea support vessel Skandi Vinland. Shortly after sunrise on Friday, a hulking icebreaker departed the protected waters of St John\u2019s, Newfoundland, and ventured into the unpredictable vastness of the north Atlantic Ocean. Onboard the ship was an array of scientific monitoring equipment, cameras and a sleek, 22ft-long submersible, named Titan. The passengers onboard the chartered Polar Prince vessel were excited at the prospect of reaching the final resting site of the RMS Titanic, even if it meant cramming themselves inside the hollow body of Titan. But the small carbon fibre craft disappeared on Sunday, nearly two hours after it dipped below the surface, en route to the remains of the sunken ocean liner. The disappearance has prompted a frantic international search, with both Canada and the US marshalling all available resources in a race against time. The Titanic never reached its destination of New York City. But along the east coast of Canada, the legacy of the doomed ship still looms large more than a century after it sank. More than 120 victims of the disaster are buried in the Fairview cemetery in Halifax, Nova Scotia, at the time the city nearest to the sinking with rail and shipping connections. The city\u2019s Museum of the Atlantic showcases artefacts from the ship, including a deck chair, personal effects and wreckage, as well as the white canvas mortuary bags used for the victims. St John\u2019s, Canada\u2019s easternmost city in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, remains the closest city to the liner\u2019s final resting place and has become the launching site for expeditions travelling to the wreck site, nearly 400 miles (650km) away \u2013 and more than 12,000 feet (3,800 meters) below the surface of the ocean. On Tuesday, the city, known for its brightly coloured \u201cbiscuit box\u201d houses, was blanketed in a thick haze of fog and rain as residents made sense of the news. Read the full story by Leyland Cecco and Spoorthy Raman here: History has shown that attempts to rescue stricken submarines do not always end well, nonetheless those trying save the crew and passengers on board OceanGate\u2019s Titan sub may take inspiration from the successful rescue of two British submariners 50 years ago, whose tiny vessel was raised from the depths of nearly 1,600ft, 150 miles off Ireland. The two men were aboard the Pisces III, a 6ft-diameter deep-sea submersible that had been laying transatlantic telephone cable on the Atlantic seabed, off the coast of Cork. Having got into difficulties, the Pisces III plunged nearly 1,600ft (500 metres), where it lay for three days. Above it, a desperate sea rescue operation was in full swing to get to pilot Roger Chapman and engineer/pilot Roger Mallinson in time. The rescuers got to the men just as the sub had 12 minutes of oxygen left in its cylinders. The mission to save the two submariners captivated the world, here\u2019s how the Observer covered the successful conclusion to the rescue in September 1973. Sabrina Dawood, whose brother Shahzada Dawood is aboard the Titan sub with his 19-year-old son Suleman, has said the family\u2019s \u201csole focus\u201d is on the search and rescue efforts. In a statement to Sky News, she said: May Shahzada and Suleman return to us safe and sound. We are sure they would be as moved as we are by the support of the global community during this period of difficulty. She asked that the family would be granted privacy \u201cas we deal with this crisis\u201d. Reports that rescuers searching for the Titan have detected noises in the area where it went missing could suggest the submersible is at the surface, a submarine search and rescue expert has said. Frank Owen said his \u201cconfidence went up by an order of magnitude\u201d when he heard reports of banging being detected by floating sound detectors. He told the BBC: There\u2019s a couple of reasons for that. Firstly, onboard this craft is a retired French navy diver. He would know the protocol for trying to alert searching forces \u2026 on the hour and the half hour you bang like hell for three minutes. The sound signal being picked up by a buoy close to the surface could mean the sub itself is near or at the surface, he added. Below about 180 metres, the water temperature drops very rapidly. That creates a layer that the [sonar signal] bounces off. But if you\u2019re in the same depth water it tends to go quite straight. Our video team has compiled a report on the latest footage and Coast Guard information from the search: Reuters has published a timeline of the Titan\u2019s voyage, starting on Friday when it set off: Friday: expedition sets off from St John\u2019s, Newfoundland, Canada. Saturday: British billionaire and adventurer Hamish Harding, one of those onboard the submersible, posts on Facebook: \u201cDue to the worst winter in Newfoundland in 40 years, this mission is likely to be the first and only manned mission to the Titanic in 2023. A weather window has just opened up and we are going to attempt a dive tomorrow.\u201d Sunday 08.00 GMT: Time the submersible originally aimed to start its descent, according to a post by Harding on Instagram. It actually started its descent later, according to the US Coast Guard. 12.00 GMT: The submersible starts what should be a two-hour descent to the Titanic wreck, nearly 4,000 metres down, according to the US Coast Guard. 13.45 GMT: Communications between the submersible and the surface vessel are lost 1 hour and 45 minutes after starting its descent. 19.00 GMT: Titan is scheduled to return to the surface, the US Coast Guard says but fails to appear. 21.40 GMT: Coast Guard receives report about an overdue submersible from the research vessel Polar Prince about 900 nautical miles east of Cape Cod on the US coast. Monday: US and Canadian ships and planes are swarming the area, some dropping sonar buoys that can monitor to a depth of almost 4,000 metres, US Coast Guard R Adm John Mauger says. Officials have also asked commercial vessels for help. Tuesday: 14.50 GMT France says it will help with search by deploying Atalante, a ship equipped with a deep-sea diving vessel. It is expected to arrive late on Wednesday. During the day: Sounds detected over several hours by Canadian Lockheed P-3 Orion aircraft, equipped with gear to trace submarines. CNN and Rolling Stone magazine report banging sounds at 30-minute intervals had been detected. Wednesday: US Coast Guard, US Navy, Canadian Coast Guard and OceanGate Expeditions establish a unified command to handle the search. 06.00 GMT: US Coast Guard confirms Canadian P-3 aircraft detected underwater noises. It says remotely operated vehicle (ROV) searches are directed to the area of the sounds and the data is also sent to US Navy experts for analysis. Thursday: 10.00 GMT: Approximate deadline for when the air in the submersible will run out, based on the US Coast Guard\u2019s estimate that the Titan could have up to 96 hours of air supply from the time it was sealed. Detecting the Titan\u2019s exact location will be a \u201csignificant challenge\u201d, Dr Jamie Pringle, a reader in forensic geosciences at Keele University, has told Sky News. Pringle said the area of the Atlantic floor is \u201creally remote\u201d and the submersible is very small. \u201cIt might be nice and flat and be sitting proudly on top, which would be great,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could be partially submerged, and of course, there\u2019s lots of submarine canyons and submarine seamounts \u2026 Those issues are very difficult.\u201d He added that the vessel\u2019s loss of contact suggested there had been an electrical problem, so it would probably be \u201cvery cold [and] very dark\u201d inside the craft. \u201cThey were only meant to be going down for eight hours, I believe \u2013 this many days is going to be difficult,\u201d he said. R Adm John Mauger of the US Coast Guard, who is heading the search for the Titan, has told CBS News it is a complex operation and an international effort. Mauger confirmed an aircraft had detected noise in the water picked up by sonar buoys on Tuesday, but said: \u201cWe don\u2019t know the source of that noise.\u201d He said there were a lot of metal objects at the site of the Titanic wreck, which could be where the noise was coming from. Mauger added that the search operation would continue \u201cas long as there\u2019s an opportunity for survival\u201d and that more vessels would be arriving at the site to join it, the BBC reported. The latest official update on the search operation was several hours ago. The US Coast Guard tweeted that a Canadian P-3 aircraft had \u201cdetected underwater noises in the search area\u201d and that ROV (remote operated vehicle) operations had been \u201crelocated in an attempt to explore the origin of the noises\u201d. Those ROV searches had \u201cyielded negative results but continue\u201d, the coastguard said, adding that the data from the aircraft had been \u201cshared with US Navy experts for further analysis which will be considered in future search plans\u201d. Estimates suggest as little as a day\u2019s worth of oxygen could be left if the vessel is still functioning. It is unclear whether or how rescue teams could reach the submersible if it is on the ocean floor. However, some experts have suggested the fact that a sonar buoy relatively close to the sea\u2019s surface picked up the banging noises could mean the Titan is not too deep. Joe MacInnis, who has made two trips to the wreck of the Titanic, has said Paul-Henri Nargeolet, one of the five onboard the submersible, is an \u201cextraordinary leader\u201d in a crisis. \u201cHe\u2019s been in all kinds of problematic situations and he\u2019s resolved them \u2026 He\u2019s the guy you want next to your side in this kind of situation,\u201d MacInnis told CNN. He said the five would be: \u2026 conserving energy. Resting, breathing as little as possible, and trying to keep calm. That is the most important thing.\u201d The three biggest risks for a deep ocean dive were fire, hull failure and getting entangled in a wreck, MacInnis said, adding that news that a Canadian plane had detected banging noises was heartening: We\u2019re all caught in this swirl of emotions from sadness to hope, fear, uncertainty \u2026 There\u2019s some possible promise in what we\u2019ve just heard. Here are some undated photographs of the Titan submersible and its interior provided by its operator, OceanGate Expeditions: At least five vessels are now at the Titanic wreck site, Sky News has reported, with four more underway but unlikely to reach the area on Wednesday. Sky said marine tracking data showed the research vessel Polar Prince, the Titan submersible\u2019s \u201cmother ship\u201d, was at the site, along with a Bahamian pipe-laying vessel, Deep Energy, and a commercial Vessel, Skandi Vinland. The Canadian coastguard vessels John Cabot and Atlantic Merlin arrived overnight, while the French research craft L\u2019Atalante \u2013 carrying a deep-sea diving robot submersible \u2013 should reach the scene in the evening. Four others, including two more Canadian coastguard vessels, a Canadian navy ship and a private offshore support vessel, looked unlikely to arrive until Thursday, Sky said. An oceanographer has told the BBC the underwater noises give hope that those on board are still alive. \u201cThere are plenty of sound sources in the ocean, but it does give hope,\u201d Simon Boxall, a senior lecturer in oceanography at the University of Southampton, told the World Service. \u201cI think one of the scenarios that everyone feared was that the submersible had basically imploded. So it does give some hope that this is still a rescue operation, rather than just a recovery operation.\u201d Here is the latest on the search from the Associated Press: A Canadian military surveillance aircraft detected underwater noises as a massive search continued on Wednesday in a remote part of the North Atlantic for a submersible that vanished while taking five people down to the wreck of the Titanic. A statement from the US Coast Guard did not elaborate on what rescuers believed the noises could be, though it offered a glimmer of hope for those lost abroad the Titan as estimates suggest as little as a day\u2019s worth of oxygen could be left if the vessel is still functioning. Meanwhile, questions remain about how teams could reach the lost submersible, which could be as deep as about 12,500ft (3,800 metres) below the surface. Newly uncovered allegations also suggest there had been significant warnings made about vessel safety during its development. The Coast Guard said a Canadian P-3 Orion had \u201cdetected underwater noises in the search area\u201d. Searchers then moved an underwater robot to that area to search. However, those searches \u201chave yielded negative results but continue\u201d. \u201cThe data from the P-3 aircraft has been shared with our US Navy experts for further analysis which will be considered in future search plans,\u201d the Coast Guard said. Rolling Stone magazine, citing what it described as internal US Department of Homeland Security emails on the search, said that teams heard \u201cbanging sounds in the area every 30 minutes\u201d. Underwater sounds can come from a variety of sources but the reports have sparked hope in some, including Richard Garriott de Cayeux, the president of the Explorers Club who said it had \u201cmuch greater confidence\u201d now after speaking to officials in Congress, the US military and the White House. OceanGate has described the Titan as \u201cthe largest of any deep diving submersible\u201d with an \u201cunparalleled safety feature\u201d that assesses the integrity of the hull throughout every dive. Made of titanium and filament wound carbon fiber, the sub is less than 7 metres long and weighs 9,072kg in the air but is ballasted to be neutrally buoyant once it reaches the seafloor, the company says. It is capable of diving 4km (2.4 miles) \u201cwith a comfortable safety margin\u201d, according to court documents filed by the company in April. The Titan is intended to only hold five people for a one-day expedition: two hours to reach the Titanic, a few hours exploring the wreck, then a two-hour trip back up. Video recorded last year by CBS shows a small chamber with about as much space inside as a minivan, no seating, and passengers sitting on the floor. Two Britons who have visited the wreck of the Titanic have expressed confidence in the submersible\u2019s crew and said there is a chance they will be recovered. Dik Barton, the first British diver to see the Titanic wreck, told ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain it a \u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201chostile\u201d place to be and he \u201c100%\u201d felt in danger during previous expeditions. \u201cThere\u2019s a local ebb and current of water which moves around, it\u2019s not consistent,\u201d Barton said. \u201cThe strength of the submersible is relatively limited. The thrusters are quite strong but, at the end of the day, you have to conserve your power because it\u2019s your life support system and navigation system.\u201d Barton said he was with Paul-Henry Nargeolet, reported to be on board the Titan, calling him \u201can extremely capable submersible operator pilot\u201d who had been down to the wreck 37 times. \u201cI have enormous respect for him and his ability, and, quite frankly, if there\u2019s anybody I\u2019d ever want to be in a position, God forbid, in this circumstance then it would be [Paul-Henry]. Oisin Fanning told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme he had also been on the submersible with Nargeolet and OceanGate\u2019s chief executive and founder Stockton Rush. \u201cThe two guys on the sub currently, so Paul and Stockton, are both consummate professionals,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, to be honest, if I was in trouble, I\u2019d want to be on a sub with them.\u201d He added: \u201cThey will be conserving energy from day one. So I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the oxygen lasts a lot longer because they\u2019ll know exactly what to do \u2026 I think there is a very good chance they will be found. These are not fly-by-nighters, these are very highly professional people.\u201d A major search and rescue operation is under way for the Titan. Here is what we know so far: The US Coast Guard, US Navy and Canadian Coast Guard are coordinating the search with input from OceanGate, the submersible\u2019s operator. Deep Energy, a pipe-laying vessel with underwater capabilities, and Polar Prince, the vessel the Titan launched from, are on the scene. Other craft, including a Canadian vessel with a mobile decompression chamber and the French research ship Atalante, which has an underwater robot that can descend to 4,000 metres, are en route. The US Navy is sending a Flyaway Deep Ocean Salvage System, designed to recover heavy undersea objects such as aircraft or small vessels, and the US military is sending unspecified assets. Two US C-130 aircraft are providing air support and carrying out search and rescue flights, as well as two Canadian planes. ROVs (remote operated underwater vehicles) from the British company Magellan, which specialises in deep ocean investigations, imaging and recovery operations, have been offered but are mostly in Europe so would take time to reach the area. Here are brief profiles of the five people onboard the Titan, courtesy of the Associated Press: Stockton Rush founded OceanGate Inc in 2009 to provide crewed submersibles for undersea researchers and explorers. He is the vessel\u2019s pilot and has a background in aerospace and technology. In an interview with CBS last year, Rush defended the safety of his sub but said nothing is without risk. \u201cWhat I worry about most are things that will stop me from being able to get to the surface \u2013 overhangs, fish nets, entanglement hazard,\u201d he said. Described as \u201ca real pioneer\u201d and \u201ca risk-taker\u201d by friends, at 19 Rush became the youngest jet transport rated pilot in the world in 1981, and flew commercial jets in college, according to his company biography. Hamish Harding lives in Dubai in the UAE. He is a billionaire adventurer who holds three Guinness world records, including the longest duration at full ocean depth by a crewed vessel. In March 2021, he and ocean explorer Victor Vescovo dived to the lowest depth of the Mariana Trench. In June 2022, he went into space on Blue Origin\u2019s New Shepard rocket. In a Facebook post on Saturday, Harding said he was \u201cproud\u201d to be part of the Titan mission to the Titanic. Shahzada and Suleman Dawood, father and son, are members of one of Pakistan\u2019s most prominent families. Their firm, Dawood Hercules Corp, based in Karachi, is involved in agriculture, petrochemicals and telecommunication infrastructure. Shahzada Dawood also is on the board of trustees for the California-based SETI Institute, which searches for extraterrestrial intelligence, and a member of the global advisory board at the Prince\u2019s Trust International, founded by King Charles III to address youth unemployment. Paul-Henri Nargeolet is a former French navy officer who is considered a Titanic expert after making multiple trips to the wreckage over several decades. He is director of underwater research for E/M Group and RMS Titanic Inc, has completed 37 dives to the wreck and supervised the recovery of 5,000 artefacts, according to his company profile. He led the first recovery expedition to the Titanic in 1987 while with the French Institute for Research and Exploitation of the Sea, and was expedition leader on the most technologically advanced dive to wreck in 2010, using high-resolution sonar and 3D optical imaging. The Titan could be in extremely deep water: the wreck of the Titanic, where the submersible with its five passengers was heading, has lain on the seabed at a depth of 3,800 metres since the liner struck an iceberg and sank in 1912. Search teams have detected underwater sounds, the US Coast Guard has said, as the clock ticked down to the last 24 hours of the craft\u2019s presumed oxygen supply. Canadian aircraft detected the sounds, the Coast Guard said. Robotic undersea search operations have been diverted to the area but there was still no tangible sign of the Titan, it added. OceanGate Expeditions, which operates the Titan, was repeatedly warned that there might be catastrophic safety problems posed by the way it was developed, the Associated Press has reported. The undersea exploration company, based in Everett, Washington, has been making yearly voyages to the Titanic since 2021. David Lochridge, OceanGate\u2019s director of marine operations, wrote an engineering report in 2018 that said the craft under development needed more testing and that passengers might be endangered when it reached \u201cextreme depths,\u201d according to a lawsuit filed that year in the US district court in Seattle. OceanGate sued Lochridge that year, accusing him of breaching a non-disclosure agreement, and he filed a counterclaim alleging that he was wrongfully fired for raising questions about testing and safety. The case settled on undisclosed terms several months after it was filed. Lochridge\u2019s concerns mainly focused on the company\u2019s decision to rely on sensitive acoustic monitoring \u2013 cracking or popping sounds made by the hull under pressure \u2013 to detect flaws, rather than a scan of the hull. Lochridge said the company told him no equipment existed that could perform such a test on the 5in-thick (12.7cm-thick) carbon-fiber hull. \u201cThis was problematic because this type of acoustic analysis would only show when a component is about to fail \u2013 often milliseconds before an implosion \u2013 and would not detect any existing flaws prior to putting pressure on to the hull,\u201d Lochridge\u2019s counterclaim said. Further, the craft was designed to reach depths of 4,000 meters (13,123ft), where the Titanic rested. But, according to Lochridge, the passenger viewport was only certified for depths of up to 1,300 metres (4,265ft), and OceanGate would not pay for the manufacturer to build a viewport certified for 4,000 metres. OceanGate\u2019s choices would \u201csubject passengers to potential extreme danger in an experimental submersible,\u201d the counterclaim said. However, the company said in its complaint that Lochridge \u201cis not an engineer and was not hired or asked to perform engineering services on the Titan\u201d. Here\u2019s a recap of developments overnight: Underwater noises have been detected by a Canadian aircraft in the search area for the missing submersible, according to the US Coast Guard. Searches yielded negative results but will continue. The data has been shared with the US Navy experts for further analysis, the Coast Guard said. Search crews have heard banging sounds at 30-minute intervals, according to US media. CNN and Rolling Stone cited internal government memos saying banging had been detected, and reported that after additional devices were deployed four hours later, noises were still heard. The memos did not clarify when on Tuesday the banging was heard, or for how long. The Explorers Club, of which two passengers in the missing sub are members, says there is \u201ccause for hope\u201d based on field data, asserting that \u201clikely signs of life have been detected at the site\u201d. The submersible\u2019s hatch appears to be bolted from the outside. So even if the sub has surfaced and is spotted by search operations, the danger is not over, as the crew inside would still need to rely on emergency oxygen to breathe until the hatch is opened by rescue teams. The Titan crew is estimated to be down to about 30 hours of breathable air. Ten hours ago, Coast Guard officials said the crew of the missing submersible had about 40 hours of breathable air left. So far, more than 25,900 sq km of sea has been searched by aircraft for the missing vessel \u2013 part of a unified command of aircraft and ships of the US Coast Guard, US Navy, Canadian Coast Guard and OceanGate Expedition. Hello and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the search for the submersible vessel Titan that went missing during a voyage to the wreck of the Titanic with five people onboard. Rescue teams are continuing the search for the OceanGate Expeditions tourist submersible, which was reported overdue on Sunday evening about 435 miles south of St John\u2019s, Newfoundland. Those onboard Titan are believed to be British billionaire Hamish Harding, 58; Pakistani-born businessman Shahzada Dawood, 48, with his 19-year-old son Suleman, who are both British citizens; French explorer Paul-Henri Nargeolet, 77; and Stockton Rush, founder and CEO of OceanGate Expeditions. Authorities have not confirmed the identity of any passenger. On Tuesday, officials estimated the five people onboard had about 40 hours of breathable air remaining. We\u2019ll bring you updates on the search as they happen."}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db4f8", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/21/man-arrested-after-reports-of-stabbing-at-london-central-middlesex-hospital", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Man arrested after two people stabbed at London hospital", "lead": "Police say one victim of attack at Central Middlesex hospital in life-threatening condition and suspect treated for self-inflicted injuries", "author": "Jamie Grierson, Denis Campbell and Matthew Weaver", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 15:04:26", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.988646", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/f1403ff071922b42b0246d357f3be22a08319d49/181_181_3545_2126/500.jpg", "body": "A man has been arrested after two people were stabbed at a London hospital, with one of the victims in a life-threatening condition, police have said. The two stabbing victims are thought to be NHS staff members who work at Central Middlesex hospital, sources have told the Guardian. The suspect was arrested outside the hospital and was receiving treatment for life-threatening and self-inflicted injuries, the Metropolitan police said. One of the victims had life-threatening injuries, while the other did not, the force added. A source said both were being treated at St Mary\u2019s hospital in Paddington, west London, which is the regional trauma centre for the area of the capital that inccudes Central Middlesex hospital. At this time the incident was not being treated as terror-related, the Met said. The hospital was temporarily locked down but had reopened and would be operating services as normal, the force added. \u201cThe situation is under control and the two injured are receiving treatment,\u201d a source said. Armed officers were seen running into Central Middlesex hospital just after 2pm . Footage on social media showed the officers swooping on the unit and shouting at passersby to move out of the way. The hospital is in the centre of the Park Royal business estate, on the border of two London boroughs, Brent and Ealing. It is managed by the London North West University healthcare NHS trust. A spokesperson for the hospital trust said: \u201cWe can confirm an incident took place at Central Middlesex Hospital this afternoon.

The Bank of England might need to spark a recession to finally get price rises under control, an economist who advises Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has warned, as inflation remained persistently high in May. Karen Ward, chief market strategist EMEA at JP Morgan Asset Management, told Radio 4\u2019s Today Programme that the BoE must fight against a wage-price spiral taking hold in the UK. Ward said: \u201cThe difficulty for the Bank of England \u2013 I mean, no-one envies them their job at the moment \u2013 is they have to therefore create a recession,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have to create uncertainty and frailty, because it\u2019s only when companies feel nervous about the future that they will think \u2018Well, maybe I won\u2019t put through that price rise\u2019, or workers, when they\u2019re a little bit less confident about their job, think \u2018Oh, I won\u2019t push my boss for that higher pay\u2019. \u201cIt\u2019s that weakness in activity which eventually gets rid of inflation.\u201d Ward was speaking after inflation in the UK unexpectedly remained stuck at 8.7% in May, adding to the pressure on households suffering a surge in mortgage costs. The Office for National Statistics reported that good inflation slowed, but services inflation accelerated at a faster pace in May. Core inflation, closely watched by the BoE jumped to a 31-year high. The money markets are now predicting that UK interest rates will have hit 6% by around the end of 2023. The Bank sets UK interest rates tomorrow \u2013 a hike is nailed-on, with some economists suggesting it could lift borrowing costs by half-a-percent, to 5%. The majority expect a smaller, quarter-point, increase to 4.75%. Mortgage holders are being hit by higher rates \u2013 Moneyfacts reported that the average two-year fixed-term mortgage now costs 6.15%, up from 6.07% on Tuesday. More than 1 million households across Britain are expected to lose at least 20% of their disposable incomes thanks to the surge in mortgage costs expected before the next election, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has warned. Tenants are also suffering, with rents rising at the fastest pace for 7 years. And the boss of Berkeley Group has said the property market will remain \u201cchoppy\u201d until interest rates settle, as the housebuilder forecast a 20% drop in sales this year. In other news\u2026. UK government debt has surpassed GDP for first time in 62 years Some of the UK\u2019s best known retailers including WH Smith, Marks &amp; Spencer, Argos and LloydsPharmacy are among more than 200 companies collectively fined \u00a37m for failing to pay the legal minimum wage. The TransPennine Express train service has got \u201cworse rather than better\u201d since transferring to the state-owned operator of last resort (OLR), according to the rail minister, Huw Merriman. Matt Moulding, the founder and chief executive of the online retail platform THG, has finally given up his \u201cgolden\u201d share allowing him to block any attempt to takeover the company. Our Politics Liveblog are covering the Westminster reaction to today\u2019s inflationo report, here: With UK inflation so sticky, Rishi Sunak\u2019s pledge to halve the UK\u2019s rate of inflation is looking trickier than when he made it. My colleague Phillip Inman explains: May\u2019s data shows that most of the price rises are in areas of discretionary spending, like holidays, recreation and entertainment. Britons have always demanded foreign holidays. And after three years of uncertainty and long periods of restrictions on travel, the sale of flights has rocketed. No one seems to mind that the airlines are hoping to recover some of their pandemic losses with much higher ticket prices. Sunak could still score a victory. He has six months to go. Some of the biggest increases in energy and food prices happened last summer and these will not be repeated over the coming few months, which should mean inflation drops to 5% quite quickly. Still, he thought it was going to be his easiest win and now it looks like being a Johnsonian gamble. He seems to have misread the UK economy, or at least the capacity of businesses to keep increasing prices without much justification. In that, he is not alone. Our Money editor, Hilary Osborne, has examined why the UK property market is so reliant on short-term fixed mortgages, not the long-dates type popular in other countries. She explains: As well as borrowers\u2019 desire for the cheapest deal possible, one industry source suggests that brokers have a role in keeping the market short-termist as they receive fees when a new deal is taken out, and have no incentive to tie in their customers for the long haul. Concern about keeping options open also seems to be a factor. Although many mortgage lenders now allow overpayments and for customers to \u201cport\u201d their loan if they move home, borrowers think short term equals flexibility. Neal Hudson, a UK housing market analyst at the consultancy BuiltPlace, said people might have been put off paying more for a longer-term deal because of expectations that prices would continue to rise and rates would continue to go down. He said: \u201cThe general experience over the past 40 years has been that \u2013 there may have been some short-term pain but in the medium term people have always ended up all right. \u201cThe market has clearly bottomed out now, so will we see a change? Maybe a long-term fix does become more appealing.\u201d More here: Housing analyst Neal Hudson has crunched the numbers on how house prices could fall as mortgage rates rise higher: NatWest is raising the interest rates on some mortgage tomorrow, as lenders continue to ratchet up borrowing costs. NatWest has told brokers it is lifting the rate on selected two-and five year fixed-rate deals by 30 basis points (or 0.3 of a percentage point). This will cover home purchase mortgages, remortgaging products, and those aimed at first-time buyers. This follows today\u2019s market reaction to May\u2019s inflation report, with UK interest rates expected to hit 6% at the turn of the year. PA Media have written a handy explainer about the UK\u2019s inflation problem: Q: What is inflation? Inflation is the term used for the rate at which prices increase over time. If the price of something rises from \u00a310 to \u00a311 over a year, then that would represent annual inflation of 10%. Every month, the ONS reports the annual increases on a raft of items and services, including everything from computer games to a loaf bread. Q: Why is it currently so high? In May inflation struck 8.7%, as it continues to slow from the 11.1% peak it hit late last year. Prices rocketed last year after the Russian invasion of Ukraine in late February 2022 caused the price of energy to shoot higher, adding to pressure from supply disruption. It contributed to higher costs for firms making products or offering services, while labour costs also started to rise. Since then, higher food and drink prices are a key reason why inflation has failed to fall as fast as hoped. Olive oil, eggs and cheese are among items to see the sharpest increases over the past year. Q: Why has there been a negative response to flat inflation for last month? Firstly, it is important to highlight that flat inflation does not mean that prices have stayed the same. It means that the rate of price increases is the same as it was in the previous month. In April, the rate of inflation dropped to 8.7% from 10.1% in March. Economists and politicians had hoped that this rate would continue to drop, with expectations it would fall to 8.4% for last month. Inflation flatlining at 8.7% for May could indicate that it will take longer than hoped for inflation to drop to more normal levels, keeping pressure on household budgets. Q: What does it mean for interest rates? The Bank of England has a target to try to get the rate of inflation to around 2%. In order to drag inflation down quickly, the most commonly used policy tool used by the central bank is increasing the base interest rate. Increases to interest rates \u2013 which currently sit at a 14-year high of 4.5% \u2013 are designed to reduce demand from people to borrow money, because of the higher charges they will face, and encourage people to save their cash. It is hoped that lower spending and increased saving will encourage firms to reduce prices to keep customers purchasing products or services, helping to reduce the rate of inflation. How will this affect my mortgage? Some variable rate mortgage deals directly track the Bank of England base interest rate and they automatically increase in line with the base rate. Borrowers can also end up on a standard variable rate (SVR) when their initial mortgage deal ends. The SVR is set by lenders individually but it can often roughly follow movements in the base rate. The bulk of mortgaged UK homeowners tend to take out fixed-rate deals. Swap rates underpin the pricing of fixed-rate mortgages and these have been rising amid expectations around inflation, as it has turned out to be more \u201csticky\u201d than some had expected. Fixed-rate mortgage rates have been on an upwards march in recent days, with the average two-year fixed-rate residential mortgage now sitting at around 6%. Q: When will we see respite from the cost-of-living crisis? Despite the latest setback, inflation is still widely expected to continue to fall. Last month, the Bank of England predicted that inflation would fall to 5.1% in the fourth quarter of 2023. Q: What does it mean for the Government\u2019s pledge to halve inflation? The Government pledged to halve inflation annually from a rate of 10.7% at the start of the year, as part of five promises by Rishi Sunak\u2019s Government. At the time, economists had forecast inflation was on track to drop to around 2.9% by the last quarter of 2023, but have reduced this to 5.1%, raising concerns the pledge could be at risk. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said in response that the target was \u201cstill absolutely deliverable\u201d but stressed that there is still a long way to go to achieve this. Jim Reid, market strategist at Deutsche Bank, reckons we live in a financial era where \u201cinflation is always with us\u201d, even if there are periods where it can be more dormant for several years. In a new research note today, Reid argues that the main cause is \u201cfiat money\u201d \u2013 cash directly printed and issued by governments that isn\u2019t pegged to an underlying commodity. Since the world effectively moved to fiat money in 1971, there is no country in the world that has averaged inflation below 2%. It is too easy to create money and run deficits, and the temptation to do that rather than take harder decisions will always be there when the inevitable and fairly regular economic and financial shocks hit. The UK and the US are a bit more likely to have this bias than the EU due to their respective central bank mandates and stricter deficit rules, but the latter is not immune. So even if inflation eventually mean reverts to the central bank targets this cycle, the probabilities are high that it will average above it for the rest of your careers unless you think we have a great reset at some point where markets refuse to buy any more government bonds. Even at that point central banks may simply take up even more slack. Core inflation in the UK could remain higher than in the US or euro area until late next year, Capital Economics fears. Ruth Gregory, their deputy chief UK economist, explains: Inflation in the UK has stayed higher than elsewhere as the UK has endured the worst of both worlds \u2013 a big energy shock (like the euro-zone) and labour shortages (even worse than the US). Admittedly, the upward influence of the energy supply shock is fading. But the tighter labour market will probably mean that UK core inflation stays higher than in the US and the euro-zone until late-2024. America\u2019s central bank chief has warned that interest rates in the US will head higher. Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve paused (or possibly skipped) an interest rate, by voting to leave its benchmark rate on hold. But today, Jerome Powell told Congress that most policymakers on the Federal Reserve\u2019s FOMC committee expect to push rates higher at future meetings. In prepared remarks for the House Financial Services Committee, Powell says: \u201cNearly all FOMC participants expect that it will be appropriate to raise interest rates somewhat further by the end of the year. Powell also says the Fed is \u201csquarely focused\u201d on its dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices, adding\": My colleagues and I understand the hardship that high inflation is causing, and we remain strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal. Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve, and without it, the economy does not work for anyone. In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. The pound has lost ground today, reflecting concerns that higher interest rates will trigger a recession. Sterling has lost half a cent against the US dollar, dropping below $1.27 for the first time since last Thursday. That suggests that the possibility of higher borrowing costs, and possibly a bumper half-point hike on Thursday, is worrying traders. As Kit Juckes, chief global FX strategist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, explains: The risk of a 50bp rate hike tomorrow has increased, the risk of a deeper slowdown has increased even more. Today\u2019s upward inflation surprise increases the pressure on the Bank of England and raises the risk of a return to an oversized hike at tomorrow\u2019s meeting, say the Markets 360 team at BNP Paribas. But, their base case is for a quarter-point increase, accompanied by \u201cmore decisive language\u201d in the minutes of this month\u2019s meeting, or other post-meeting communications. They predict interest rates will peak at 5.5%, a whole percentage point above today\u2019s levels: The bottom line, regardless of the size of tomorrow\u2019s move, is that the MPC has a lot more work to do to bring underlying inflation under control \u2013 we stick to our terminal rate call of 5.50%. Downing Street has insisted Rishi Sunak is still sticking with his pledge to halve inflation by the end of the year, despite inflation remaining stickily high. The Prime Minister\u2019s official spokesman told reporters: \u201cThat remains the target.\u201d Asked if they are on track to fulfil the promise, the spokesman said the government was (despite inflation coming in above target for the last few months): \u201cYes. Despite some of the coverage at the time (of the announcement of the pledge) this was never something that was straightforward. \u201cIt was rightly an ambitious target that we remain committed to and it can only be achieved with fiscal discipline.\u201d Here are more details from the IFS\u2019s new report into the financial hit from rising mortgage payments, which warns that 1.4m mortgage holders will lose 20% of their disposable income to rising borrowing costs. Newsflash: Millions of households across Britain are expected to lose at least 20% of their disposable incomes thanks to the surge in mortgage costs expected before the next election, the UK\u2019s leading economics thinktank has warned. Sounding the alarm as mortgage costs reach the highest levels since the 2008 financial crisis, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said that almost 1.4m mortgage holders would see at least a fifth of their disposable income erased. It warned the heaviest blow was reserved for those under the age of 40 with larger mortgages, with the biggest financial hit for households in London and the south east of England where property prices are typically higher than the national average. The biggest rise is for those in their 30s, for whom payments will jump by \u00a3360 per month, or 11% of disposable income. On average, mortgage holders will see their mortgage payments rise by \u00a3280 per month \u2013 equivalent to 8.3% of their disposable income (i.e. income after mortgage payments). Tom Wernham, a Research Economist at IFS, explains that many borrowers face a serious shock when they remortgage. \u201cMany families bought homes \u2013 often with sizable mortgages \u2013 when interest rates were very low. As people\u2019s fixed term offers come to an end they are going to be exposed to much higher interest rates. For many, the increase in monthly repayments is going to come as a serious shock \u2013 on average it will be equivalent to seeing their disposable income fall by around 8.3%. And for 1.4 million mortgage holders \u2013 half of whom are under 40 \u2013 mortgage payments are set to rise by an eyewatering 20% of disposable income or more. Given the cost of living pressures people are already facing due to high food and energy price inflation, these significant increases in mortgage costs could not come at a worse time.\u201d Back in parliament, Rishi Sunak has said it is vitally important that savers are treated fairly, following concerns that savings rates have not risen in line with borrowing costs. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt will discuss this matter when he meets with UK banks on Friday, the PM added. Martin Lewis of MoneySavingExpert.com says he was called to an \u201curgent private meeting\u201d with Jeremy Hunt today to discuss mortgages. Lewis says he explained that banks should offer \u201cproper forbearance\u201d to struggling mortgage-holders, and not ramp up their profit margins: Duncan Robinson of The Economist questions which of the pair are actually in control\u2026. Our economics correspondent, Richard Partington, spots some interesting detail in the UK inflation report: Over in parliament, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has asked prime minister Rishi Sunak if he agrees that Britain is facing \u201ca mortgage catastrophe\u201d (as Conservative MP Lucy Allan warned last weekend). Sunak replies that \u201cit is right\u201d to help those with mortgages, which is why the right priority is to halve inflation. Sunak says; Inflation is what is driving interest rates up. Inflation is what erodes people\u2019s savings and pushes up prices, and ultimately makes them poorer. Sunak adds that he highlighted the importance of tackling inflation before he became PM, and adds that the IMF have backed the government\u2019s approach. An unimpressed Starmer replies that Britain is suffering from 13 years of economic failure and last autumn\u2019s \u2018kamikaze\u2019 budget. Q: How much will the Tory mortgage penalty cost the average homeowner? Sunak claims Starmer isn\u2019t aware of the \u2018global macroeconomic situation\u2019 (earning much heckling). Sunak says the government has taken steps to protect borrowers, including lifting support for the UK\u2019s mortgage interest scheme (details here), the new protections agreed with the FCA, and tens of billions of costs of living support. Starmer gives him the answer \u2013 \u00a32,900 per year, for those who need to remortgage from 2024 (that\u2019s according to Resolution Foundation). Sunak shoots back that interest rates have risen in other countries, such as the US, Australia, Canada and New Zealand, and a two-decade high in the eurozone. Our Politics Liveblog has all the action: Chancellor Jeremy Hunt says he wants to ensure UK banks are \u201cliving up\u201d to commitments made to help struggling borrowers. Hunt has held a meeting with consumer champion Martin Lewis today, a day after Lewis said the mortgage \u201cticking timebomb\u201d he warned the UK government about last December has \u201cexploded\u201d. Speaking after today\u2019s meeting, Hunt says he knows many people are worried about their mortgage repayments. He adds: Today I spoke to @MartinSLewis ahead of my meeting with lenders on Friday. I want to ensure banks are living up to the commitments we agreed in December, and what more they can do to help. The FCA\u2019s finalised guidance include options such as extending the term of a mortgage, or letting borrowers make reduced monthly payments for a temporary period. Large increases in UK interest rates used to be rare. When the Bank of England lifted base rate by 50 basis points (half a percent) last August, it was the biggest rise in 27 years (since 1995). That was followed by half-point hikes in September, December and February, with a monster 75-basis point rise thown in at the November meeting, before the Bank returned to smaller quarter-point hikes in March and May (up to 4.5%). The sustained strength in UK inflation in May \u201ccements the case\u201d for the Bank of England to deliver further tightening at its meeting tomorrow, says Gurpreet Gill, macro strategist for Global Fixed Income at Goldman Sachs Asset Management. Gill, who predicts rates will peak at 5.25%, says a half-point rise tomorrow can\u2019t be ruled out: \u201cWhile our base case is for a 0.25% rate hike at this week\u2019s meeting, the data opens the door to an increased pace of a 0.5% rate rise. \u201cCore and services inflation, alongside food prices, continue to diverge from moderating trends observed in other advanced economies like the US, complicating the path towards the Bank\u2019s target. \u201cWe see upside risks to our terminal rate forecast of 5.25%. However, downside growth risks may exert disinflationary pressure later this year.\u201d Here\u2019s Sky News\u2019s Paul Kelso on the financial market reaction to the UK May inflation report: UK exporters have been hit by falling exports this month, but price pressures appear to be easing too. The Confederation of British Industry (CBI)\u2018s monthly healthcheck of UK factories has found that order books recoveedred last month. However, the export order balance fell again to -29 from -26, the weakest since February 2021. And on inflation\u2026.UK manufacturers expect to raise prices by the smallest amount since February 2021 over the next three months. The CBI\u2019s monthly index of manufacturers\u2019 average selling price expectations slowed to +19 in June from +21 in May, its lowest in more than two years but well above its long-run average of +7. CBI deputy chief economist Anna Leach said: \u201cTotal order books have improved a touch in recent months, but they remain fairly soft. And although output expectations have turned positive again, growth is expected to be quite weak in the three months to September.\u201d Rising interest rates, and rising prices, are both hurting the budgets of low-income families. New research from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation this morning show that the numbers of low-income households going without essentials or in arrears has not improved for over a year. JRF senior economist Rachelle Earwaker warns that 5.5 million low-income households have had to cut down on or skip meals because they can\u2019t afford food. Four million reported going hungry, and 2.7 million have reported having a poor diet because of the cost of living crisis. Earwaker adds: Low-income households are struggling to afford their bills, with 4.5 million in arrears, and 2.6 million holding high cost credit loans with loan sharks, doorstep lenders, payday lenders or pawnshops. The JRF are calling for the Government to implement an Essentials Guarantee, to ensure that the basic rate of Universal Credit will at least always covers life\u2019s essentials. UK inflation surprised to the upside today, for the fourth month in a row, reports Berenberg Economics. They have now lifted their forecasts for UK interest rates \u2013 predicting Bank Rate will have risen to 5.25% (was 5.0%) at the end of 2023 and 4.0% (was 3.5%) one year later. Berenberg warns that UK inflation is changing its nature, and becoming more domestically driven, saying: By and large, imported inflation caused by last year\u2019s spike in energy and food prices is receding on trend as energy prices correct and the 2022 surge in these prices washes out of the yoy comparison. The yoy rate for goods prices eased to 9.7% from 10.0% despite higher prices for used cars. However, the more domestically driven increase of services prices advanced from 6.9% to 7.4%. Many services are labour intensive and thus affected by strong wage gains. As reported last week, the rise in weekly average earnings (ex-bonus) accelerated to 7.5% in April from 7.1% in March. Helped by resilient gains in employment (1.2% yoy in April), most households continue to open their wallets despite the gradually building headwind from higher mortgage rates. Resolution Foundation\u2019s chief executive, Torsten Bell, points out that there are winners from higher interest rates: But he\u2019s not impressed by claims that Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng are somehow vindicated over last year\u2019s mini-budget debacle: Sticky inflation is extending the cost-of-living crisis for everyone in Britain, and hardening the mortgage crunch for the seven million households who have a mortgage. That\u2019s the warning from the Resolution Foundation today. James Smith, Resolution\u2019s research director, \u201cThe latest data will reinforce market expectations of how high interest rates will go, and put more pressure on the Bank. This is bad news for anyone with a mortgage, who will be looking out for more positive signals before their current deal comes to an end.\u201d Resolution have calculated that mortgage repayments are set to rise by \u00a315.8bn a year by 2026, meaning an average hit of \u00a32,900 for households remortgaging. Three-quarters of that \u00a315.8bn hit will fall on the richest 40% of households, they add, as higher-income households are more likely to have a mortgage. But rising prices hit poorer households more. They add: Inflation rates for the poorest tenth of households are 25 per cent higher than those for the richest tenth of households as they spend more of their income on food and energy bills. Ben Franklin, research director at the Centre for Progressive Policy says the UK\u2019s high food price inflation, and stubbornly high core inflation, are \u2018particularly devastating\u2019 news. Although food price inflation slowed last month, to 18.3% per year from 19%, there were still some sharp increases in the prices of staples compared with last year. The annual rate of inflation fell for eggs, potatoes, meat, bread, butter and coffee, for example: Eggs: April 37.0%, May 28.8% Low-fat milk: April 33.5%, May 28.5% Yogurt: April 24.0%, May 23.4% Potatoes: April 24.8%, May 22.4% Fruit and vegetable juices: April 21.1%, May 18.0% Ready meals: April 20.8%, May 16.8% Meat: April 17.2%, May 16.3% Bread: April 18.6%, May 15.3% Margarine and other vegetable fats: April 19.0%, May 15.2% Tea: April 19.1%, May 14.6% Butter: April 20.1%, May 14.1% Chocolate: April 14.9%, May 11.7% Pizza and quiche: April 11.9%, May 9.4% Coffee: April 15.3%, May 9.2% But shoppers were hit by rising inflation on other products: Sugar: April 47.4%, May 49.8% Olive oil: April 46.4%, May 46.9% Sauces, condiments, salt, spices and culinary herbs: April 33.9%, May 35.1% Cheese and curd: April 30.6%, May 33.4% Pasta and couscous: April 27.7%, May 28.5% Jams, marmalades and honey: April 17.9%, May 22.9% Crisps: April 14.5%, May 17.8% Fish: April 14.2%, May 16.6% Rice: April 14.9%, May 16.1% Breakfast cereals and other cereal products: April 8.1%, May 12.3% Fruit: April 10.8%, May 11.2% Dried fruit and nuts: April 7.2%, May 10.3% UK tenants were hit by the fastest increase in rents in at least seven years last month. Private rental prices paid by tenants in the UK increased by 5.0% in the 12 months to May 2023, the Office for National Statistics reports. That is the largest annual percentage change since the data series began in January 2016. The ONS reports that rental prices in London grew at the fastest rate in a decade, saying: In the 12 months to May 2023, rental prices for the UK (excluding London) increased by 4.9%, up from an increase of 4.8% in the 12 months to April 2023. Private rental prices in London increased by 5.1% in the 12 months to May 2023, up from an increase of 5.0% in the 12 months to April 2023. This is the highest annual percentage change in London since October 2012. Yesterday, property portal Zoopla reported that the average UK tenant now spends more than 28% of their pay before tax on rent, the highest in a decade. House price inflation slowed in April, new official data shows. The Office for National Statistics reports that average UK house prices increased by 3.5% in the 12 months to April, down from 4.1% in the year to March. The average UK house price was \u00a3286,489 in April, which is \u00a39,000 higher than 12 months ago, but \u00a37,000 below the recent peak in September 2022. It was slightly higher than the \u00a3285,057 recorded in March. Average house prices increased over the 12 months to \u00a3306,000 in England (3.7%), \u00a3213,000 in Wales (2.0%), \u00a3187,000 in Scotland (2.0%) and \u00a3172,000 in Northern Ireland (5.0%). The North East saw the highest annual percentage change of all English regions in the 12 months to April (5.5%), while London saw the lowest (2.4%). The Bank of England must \u201ccreate a recession\u201d to curb inflation, according to Karen Ward, chief market strategist EMEA at JP Morgan Asset Management. Ward, who is also a member of chancellor Jeremy Hunt\u2019s economic advisory council, told Radio 4\u2019s Today programme there are \u201ccertainly signs\u201d that a price-wage spiral is emerging, which the central bank \u201chas to nip in the bud\u201d. Speaking after inflation remained stubbornly high at 8.7% in May, Ward explained: \u201cThe difficulty for the Bank of England \u2013 I mean, no-one envies them their job at the moment \u2013 is they have to therefore create a recession. \u201cThey have to create uncertainty and frailty, because it\u2019s only when companies feel nervous about the future that they will think \u2018Well, maybe I won\u2019t put through that price rise\u2019, or workers, when they\u2019re a little bit less confident about their job, think \u2018Oh, I won\u2019t push my boss for that higher pay\u2019. \u201cIt\u2019s that weakness in activity which eventually gets rid of inflation.\u201d Ward is also a member of The Times\u2019s shadow monetary policy committee, a group of experts who are today calling for the actual MPC to raise interest rates by half a point tomorrow, to 5%. Ward argued that the Bank of England\u2019s \u201cearlier hesitancy\u201d has put it in an uncomfortable spot. With her shadow MPC hat on, Ward told The Times: It hoped for too long that inflation would go away on its own accord and underestimated the second-round effects now evident in accelerating wage growth. It did not adhere to the \u201cstitch in time saves nine\u201d principle and now will have to raise rates by more and cause a deeper downturn to bring inflation back to target. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the price moves that kept UK inflation disappointingly high in May, at 8.7%: Food and non-alcoholic beverages: up by 18.3% over the last year, down from 19% in April Alcoholic beverages and tobacco: up by 9.3% over the last year, down from 9.1% in April Clothing and footwear: up by 7.1% over the last year, up from 6.8% in April Housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels: up by 12.1% over the last year, down from 12.3% in April Furniture, household equipment and maintenance: up by 7.5% over the last year, matching April\u2019s reading Health: up by 8.3% over the last year, up from 7% in April Transport: up by 1.2% over the last year, down from 1.5% in April Communication: up by 9.1% over the last year, up from 7.9% in April Recreation and culture: up by 6.7% over the last year, up from 6.3% in April Education: up by 3.2% over the last year, matching April\u2019s reading Restaurants and hotels: up by 10.3% over the last year, up from 10.2% in April Miscellaneous goods and services: up by 6.8% over the last year, matching April\u2019s reading Buy-to-let mortgages have also become pricier. Moneyfacts reports: The average 2-year buy-to-let residential mortgage rate today is 6.44%. This is up from an average rate of 6.40% on the previous working day. The average 5-year buy-to-let residential mortgage rate today is 6.31%. This is up from an average rate of 6.29% on the previous working day. There are currently 2,456 buy-to-let mortgage products available. This is down from a total of 2,525 on the previous working day. Just in: UK fixed-term mortgage rates have climbed again, which will add to concerns about a \u2018timebomb\u2019 in the housing market. The average 2-year fixed residential mortgage rate has risen to 6.15% today, data provider Moneyfacts reports, up from 6.07% on Tuesday. At the start of May, two-year fixed mortgages were averaging 5.26%, before starting to climb as the financial markets realised UK inflation was looking worryingly sticky. The average 5-year fixed residential mortgage rate jumped too, to 5.79%, up from 5.72% yesterday. Almost 150 mortgage products were pulled from the market since yesterday, as lenders rushh to reprice deals. There are currently 4,498 residential mortgage products available, Moneyfacts reports, down from 4,641 on Tuesday. The surge in mortgage rates is splitting, some of whom want ministers should intervene to defuse Britain\u2019s mortgage timebomb, by reintroducing tax relief on mortgage interest. Yesterday Jake Berry, the influential chair of the the Northern Research Group of Tory MPs, told chancellor Jeremy Hunt: \u201cPeople are very concerned about what is being described as the mortgage bomb about to go off. If we don\u2019t help families now, all the other money that we have spent to help them will have been wasted if they lose their home.\u201d The UK\u2019s debt pile reached more than 100% of economic output for the first time since 1961 as government borrowing more than doubled in May, according to official figures this morning The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said net debt reached \u00a32.6 trillion as of the end of May, estimated at 100.1% of gross domestic product (GDP). It is the first time the debt-to-GDP ratio has risen above 100% since March 1961, except for during the pandemic, but this was later revised lower due to stronger GDP figures. It came as government borrowing soared year-on-year to \u00a320bn in May, pushed higher by the cost of energy support schemes, inflation-linked benefit payments and interest payments on debt. May\u2019s borrowing figure was \u00a33bn lower than in April but \u00a310.7bn higher than a year ago and the second-highest May borrowing since monthly records began in 1993. Economists had predicted borrowing of \u00a319.5bn for May. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said the Government has been taking \u201cdifficult decisions\u201d to balance the books following the pandemic and Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Hunt said: \u201cWe rightly spent billions to protect families and businesses from the worst impacts of the pandemic and Putin\u2019s energy crisis. \u201cBut it would be manifestly unfair to leave future generations with a tab they cannot repay. \u201cThat\u2019s why we have taken difficult but necessary decisions to balance the books in order to halve inflation this year, grow the economy and reduce debt.\u201d Today\u2019s inflation figure of 8.7% is \u201ca shocker\u201d, says Professor Costas Milas of the University of Liverpool\u2019s Management School. He believes it will prompt the Bank of England (BoE) into raising interest rate by half a percentage point tomorrow, to 5%, telling us: The BoE predicted, only last month, an inflation rate of 8.22% for the second quarter of 2023. For this to materialize, inflation needs to increase by 7.3% in June. This huge drop from the current 8.7% rate is almost unlikely to happen. To defend its credibility, I sense the MPC will most likely feel \u201cobliged\u201d to raise tomorrow it\u2019s base rate by 0.5 percentage points and assess the very effect in August\u2019s Monetary Policy Report (and next decision). There is no interest rate decision in July\u2026. At 8.7%, inflation remains higher in the UK than in many other advanced economies. In the eurozone, CPI inflation fell to 6.1% in May, down from 7.0% in April. Within the bloc, French inflation dropped to 6% from 6.9%, while in Germany it dropped to 6.3% from 7.6%. In the US, inflation dropped to 4% from 4.9% in April, meaning prices are rising just half as fast on that side of the Atlantic. Price pressures in the UK are being fuelled by a jobs market that is struggling to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic, Brexit visa rules and the decision by many older workers to quit the employment scene. My colleague Phillip Inman reports: In France, the rate of worker participation is higher than before the pandemic. That is to say, a higher proportion of working age people have a job or have registered to work. In the UK, the participation rate has declined, driving up wages and maintaining the pressure on prices. The UK also imports more than 50% of its food, mostly from the EU, which has proved to be badly affected by rising raw materials costs. Food prices have risen at more than 18% for most of the year, pushing the overall UK inflation rate above those of rival economies. In a new blow to mortgage holders, the cost of UK government short-term borrowing has jumped this morning. The yield, or interest rates, on two-year British government bonds has jumped as high as 5.1% \u2013 a new 15-year high \u2013 up from 4.93% last night. Two-year bond yields are sensitive to interest rate speculation, and are used by lenders to price mortgage rates. City economists say that another interest rate rise tomorrow is a done deal \u2013 the only question is whether the Bank of England plumps for a quarter-point rise in rates, to 4.75%, or goes big with a half-point rise to 5%. The Bank has already raised interest rates 12 times since December 2021, but will not be happy that inflation is still so high. Capital Economics are now predicting that the Bank will go for the half-point rise, to 5%, due to this morning\u2019s inflation report. They cite the increase in core inflation, saying: A lot of attention has focussed on the fact that inflation failed to fall in line with expectations last month and was instead unchanged at 8.7%. But the bigger concern in our view is that core inflation rose yet again, hitting a 31-year high of 7.1%. This marks the UK out from other advanced economies, including the euro-zone and the US, where core inflation has started to fall. There are several factors at play, but an important one is that inflation appears to have infected the labour market and wage setting to a greater extent in the UK than elsewhere. While tomorrow\u2019s MPC meeting is finely balanced, we think that a 50bps increase in Bank rate is now slightly more likely than a 25bps. The consensus remains for a smaller increase, but the markets are pricing in a 50% chance of larger move. Accordingly, a failure to deliver could cause financial conditions to loosen and the pound to weaken, which is the last thing that policymakers at the Bank need right now. Analysts at ING say the Bank of England faces a very difficult dilemma, but suspect rates won\u2019t reach 6%, as the markets are now pricing in. Headline inflation should come down more noticeably over the next couple of months, owing to some pretty hefty base effects. Last June saw a near 10% spike in petrol prices, whereas prices are currently falling, and of course in July we\u2019ll see a material fall in household electricity/gas bills. Core inflation we think should come lower too, though to a much lesser degree and mainly because of further renewed downward pressure from certain goods categories. Headline CPI, we think, will be just below 7% by July and around 4.5% by year-end. Core inflation will probably end the year above 5%. All of this makes life even harder for the Bank of England. We think the bar for another 50bp hike is set pretty high, but a 25bp hike is basically guaranteed, as is another in August. But markets are now fully pricing a 6% peak for the Bank rate, which implies six more rate hikes from current levels. That seems excessive, and we suspect the Bank of England would privately agree. Shares in housebuilders are falling in early trading in London. Berkeley, Persimmon and Barratt Development are all down over 2%, among the biggest fallers on the FTSE 100 index. That suggests traders are expecting further increases in UK interest rates, making mortgages more expensive and dampening demand for new homes. Berkeley reported this morning that it is still seeing \u201cgood levels of enquiry for well-located homes built to a high standard of design and quality\u201d. But it admitted that the housing market is \u201clikely to lack urgency\u201d until consumers have a better idea of how mortgage rates will change over the coming months. There is a sliver of positive news in this morning\u2019s data. UK producers, such as factories, benefited from a drop in input costs last month, giving them breathing room to slow their price rises. Producer input prices rose by 0.5% in the year to May, down from a rise of 4.2% in the year to April, thanks to a fall in crude oil costs. And output price inflation \u2013 what is charged at the factory gate \u2013 rose by 2.9% in the year to May 2023, down from +5.2% in April. On a monthly basis, producer input prices fell by 1.5% and output prices dropped by 0.5% in May. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has said the Government would \u201cstick to its guns\u201d, after inflation remained higher than hoped in May He told broadcasters: \u201cToday\u2019s figures strengthen the case for the Government to stick to its guns. \u201cNo matter what the pressure from left, right or centre, we won\u2019t be pushed off course. \u201cBecause if we are going to help families, if we are going to relieve the pressure on people with mortgages, on businesses, we need to squeeze every last drop of high inflation out of the economy.\u201d Hunt has also called for patience, while rising interest rates have their effect on prices, saying: \u201cIf you look at what\u2019s happening in other countries, you can see that rises in interest rates do bring down inflation over time. \u201cThat will happen here but we need to be patient, we need to stick to the course and then we\u2019ll get to the other side.\u201d City investors are ratching up their expectations for Bank of England interest rate rises, following the shock rise in core inflation. The markets are pricing in that UK interest rates will hit 6% by December, up from 4.5% today. Traders are concluding that the BoE will be very concerned that underlying inflation, and service sector inflation, both rose in May. The odds of a half-point increase tomorrow, when the Bank next sets interest rates, has now jumped to over 40%, according to the price of interest rate swaps. Before the inflation data was released, such a 50-basis point hike tomorrow was seen as a 25% chance. Jake Finney, economist at PwC says: UK inflation has once again come in higher than expected at 8.7% in May. This is higher than the 8.5% consensus and the Bank of England\u2019s forecast of 8.3% in May. More troublingly, core CPI - which is considered to be indicative of underlying inflation pressures - unexpectedly increased to 7.1%. The primary culprit for the higher headline figure was services inflation, which increased from 6.9% to 7.4% due to upward pressure from cultural services. It now seems likely that services inflation will take longer to come down than the time it took to come up, especially with wage growth remaining strong. Higher inflation means that the squeeze on household incomes isn\u2019t over yet, despite strong wage growth. It also cements a rate hike from the Bank of England tomorrow and means an August rate hike is now more likely than not. Today\u2019s inflation numbers are \u201ctruly unfortunate\u201d and show the UK has a \u201cserious inflation problem\u201d, reports Melissa Davies, chief econonomist at Redburn. Davies explains: Inflation in the UK remains \u2018hot\u2019 across the board, with both consumer goods and services keeping up the pressure on prices. One of the reasons US inflation is so much lower, for example, is that durable goods inflation has dropped to zero, but not so for the UK, where core goods and services CPI are both running in the high single-digits. The lagged effects of energy price changes are worth around one percentage point on the headline rate now, which will largely come through in July, but this still leaves the economy with a serious inflation issue (the contribution from fuel prices is already negative). Davies adds that there is \u201ca long way to go to rein UK inflation to heel.\u201d Food price inflation has eased in May, but products still cost much more than a year ago. The inflation rate for food and non-alcoholic beverages dropped to 18.3% in the year to May, down from 19% in April. During May alone, food and non-alcoholic drink prices rose by 0.9% between April and May 2023, compared with a larger 1.5% increase between the same two months a year ago. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, says: \u201cIt is a really positive sign that food inflation has fallen for the second consecutive month, the first time this has happened since the Ukraine war began. While some prices continue to rise, we are now seeing regular news reports of falling prices on many essential products, such as loo rolls and vegetable oil. It has been good to see larger drops in inflation rates for flour, milk and eggs as retailers continue to invest heavily in lower prices for the future and locking the price of many essentials, helping the UK to deliver some of the cheapest groceries in Europe. Elsewhere, consumers will find themselves under pressure from increased health and communication costs, as inflation rates in both categories rose in May. Grant Fitzner, the chief economist at the Office for National Statistics, says rising wages are fuelling the worrying increase in core inflation in May, to 7.1%. Speaking on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Fitzner confirms that headline inflation rate was unchanged in May at 8.7%, but adds: In terms of what\u2019s under the bonnet, something that may cause some concern is the continuing rise in core inflation. That excludes food, energy, alcohol and tobacco, which has risen to 7.1%, the highest annual rate in core inflation since March 1992. Fitzner explains that while goods inflation has been heading downwards, prices in the services sector \u2013 such as at cafes, restaurants and hotels \u2013 are rising at a faster pace. That lifted services sector inflation to 7.4% (from 6.9% in April), which is the highest rate \u201cin quite a while\u201d. This increase is probably driven at least in part by increases in wages, Fitzner suggests. [data last week showed regular pay increased by 7.2% in the three months to April, a 20-year high]. Falling prices for motor fuel led to the largest downward contribution to monthly inflation in May. Today\u2019s inflation report shows that motor fuel prices fell by 13.1% in the year to May 2023, compared with a fall of 8.9% in April. Average petrol and diesel prices stood at 144.4p and 154.6p per litre respectively in May, down from 165.9p and 179.7p per litre a year ago. Petrol prices fell by 1.4 pence per litre between April and May 2023, compared with a rise of 4.1 pence per litre between the same two months a year ago. Similarly, diesel prices fell by 7.8 pence per litre this year, compared with a rise of 3.6 pence per litre a year ago. On a monthly basis, consumer prices rose by 0.7% in May alone, keeping the annual rate at 8.7%. The ONS says that \u201crising prices for air travel, recreational and cultural goods and services, and second-hand cars\u201d made the largest upward contributions to the monthly inflation. This chart shows how inflation stuck painfully high at 8.7% last month, having soared during 2022. The inflation rate for goods in the UK has eased a little, from 10.0% per year to 9.7%. But that was wiped out by a rise in service sector inflation, where the annual rate rose from 6.9% to 7.4%. Worryingly, core inflation in the UK has risen. If you strip out volatile factors such as food and energy, underlying inflation increased to 7.1% per year in May, up from 6.8% in April, and higher than expected. That\u2019s highest rate of core inflation since March 1992, which will alarm the Bank of England. Newsflash: UK inflation was unchanged last month, bringing little relief to struggling households. The Consumer Prices Index shows prices rose by 8.7% in the year to May, matching the 8.7% recorded in April, the Office for National Statistics has reported. That is higher than the 8.4% inflation rate forecast by City economists, and adds more pressure onto the Bank of England to keep raising interest rates. Since peaking at 11.1% in October, inflation has dropped a little \u2013 but remains over four times above the BoE\u2019s 25 target. The data comes as the government is under growing pressure to intervene to help millions of households facing a \u201cticking timebomb\u201d of higher mortgage payments ahead of the next election. Pay awards by British employers remained the highest in more than 30 years in the three months to May, keeping pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates again on Thursday. Human resources data firm XpertHR said the median basic pay settlement in the March-May quarter remained at 6%. That matches the record increases seen in the five rolling quarters before but well below inflation which stood at 8.7% in April (we\u2019ll find out May\u2019s inflation rate in just a moment\u2026..) Wednesday\u2019s data includes pay awards agreed in April, a key month for pay deals between employers and workers. Sheila Attwood, senior content manager at XpertHR, explains: \u201cAlthough inflation is beginning to fall as we enter the second half of this year, it still lies far ahead of pay rises, meaning employees will remain grappling with the effects of a real-terms pay cut.\u201d Analysts at RBC Capital Markets predict inflation will drop to 8.4% in May, but could remain sticky. They say: However, with most of the downward contributions coming from fuels and food the risk is that even as headline inflation falls, services inflation (one of the indicators that the MPC have told us they are looking at for signs of persistent inflationary pressures) rises further from last month\u2019s estimate of 6.9% y/y. Ahead of this data, market pricing for tomorrow\u2019s MPC decision is slightly more toward a 50bp move (32bp priced) than the unanimous expectation of 25bp amongst economists. Today is \u201ccrunch time\u201d, says our economics editor Larry Elliott, who believes today\u2019s inflation bulletin could be the most significant piece of government data published this year. Larry explains: It is crunch time for Rishi Sunak and Jeremy Hunt, who want voters to judge the government by the progress it makes in tackling inflation and calming the markets. Halving inflation during 2023 was one of the five new year pledges made by the prime minister in January, but the decline so far has been slower than expected. To have any hope of winning the next election, Sunak and Hunt need interest rates to come down fast. It is crunch time for the Bank, which has the job of hitting the government\u2019s 2% inflation target and is now facing mounting criticism. So far the brickbats have tended to come from those who say the Bank was too slow to respond to price pressures and has allowed inflation to become embedded. But there are also those who say because interest rates work with a lag, the Bank risks driving Britain into a deep recession. Wednesday is also crunch time for the UK\u2019s housing market and the millions of people paying mortgages. The ONS says 57% of those who took out fixed rate home loans did so when rates were below 2%. Those whose deals expire in the coming months will be refinancing at three times those rates. Good morning. One of the most eagerly anticipated pieces of UK economic data in recent years will be released shortly. May\u2019s inflation report, due at 7am, will show if the cost of living crisis eased last month, and influence how high UK interest rates will be raised to slow the economy. Economists expect the annual pace of inflation eased last month, to 8.4% in the year to May. That would be a small, but welcome, drop on April\u2019s 8.7% inflation rate. But it would still mean a painful squeeze on household budgets. Mortgage-holders will be desperate to see inflation fall, as borrowing costs have risen sharply in recent months. Yesterday, the average rate on a two-year fixed mortgage rose to 6.07%, Moneyfacts reporter, the highest since November. Policymakers at the Bank of England are equally keen to see a slowdown in consumer price rises. The BoE\u2019s target is to keep inflation at 2%, so it is forecast to raise interest rates for the 13th time in a row on Thursday, probably from 4.5% to 4.75%. The BoE will also be looking at the latest figures for core inflation (stripping out food and energy), which is expected to stick at an annual rate of 6.8%. The money markets have indicated UK interest rates could hit 6% by early next year. Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell, thinks 6% could be unlikely, though: \u201cThursday\u2019s rate rise looks nailed on but what is beginning to filter through to markets is uncertainty about what comes next. The chancellor might have ruled out government help for mortgage holders facing a horrifying cliff edge but there\u2019s little doubt that what\u2019s happening in the mortgage market is deeply destabilising to the economy. \u201cThe UK might have skirted recession up until now but suck thousands of pounds out of the pockets of middle earners and all those retailers, hospitality businesses and other service sector companies are likely to take a hit, and the uptick in GDP the country enjoyed in April might not be forthcoming in the months ahead. \u201cAnd that will be the possibility being weighed up by members of the MPC ahead of their decision this week, but also the words they will use when discussing the outlook. The government will also be crossing their fingers and hoping that inflation comes down soon, given Rishi Sunak\u2019s target of halving it (to 5%) by the end of the year\u2026.

Surely nothing can stop the Tartan Army\u2019s march towards world domination, not even acts of God? The summery element to the clock was misleading because all the south side of Glasgow had been hit by torrential rain, leaving a waterlogged pitch. Not that Scotland minded. They showed the world a brand of football they could never know: thrashing the ball through puddles. Callum McGregor gave them an early lead in the sixth minute before referee Istv\u00e1n Vad tooted and took the teams off to dry themselves in the changing rooms while sturdy men \u2013 and the ball boys \u2013 came on to play their role of 12th man with various instruments to push surface water off the pitch with gusto for 90 minutes. While the hard work was being done outside, Georgia were, allegedly, telling officials they did not fancy playing in a bit of drizzle. \u201cWe\u2019re stuck, we\u2019re stuck, we\u2019re stuck,\u201d they cried from the Hampden foyer while pointing at the rain. Eventually they were pushed out on to the pitch by Uefa suits to continue their drubbing by the conditions and a force of nature (a second goal from Scott McTominay). Even Serie A\u2019s leading light Khvicha Kvaratskhelia had no answer for the Scots, whacking a late penalty over to ensure Georgia could not even muster a consolation. Scotland have now beaten Spain, Erling Haaland\u2019s Norway and Cyprus on their way to heading the group. Stevey\u2019s Tartan Army are on the march. Skipper Andy Robertson is very much in favour of the STOP FOOTBALL campaign, mind, especially with pre-season around the corner. \u201cWe don\u2019t want the season going any further by playing [on Wednesday] or whatever, it wouldn\u2019t have been ideal,\u201d Robertson chirped. \u201cPeople have plans or holidays to go on, it wouldn\u2019t have been great.\u201d Enjoy the sun-beds, lads, there will be no rest next summer when you go to Germany to shake things up and win the cup.

FOOTBALL DAILY LETTERS The references to The Decemberists\u2019 \u2018June Hymn\u2019 in Monday\u2019s opening and last line reminded me of \u2018The Rake\u2019s Song\u2019, a (thoroughly disturbing) tale of a man who enters into a partnership, expands that partnership, resents the lack of freedom and so destroys what he has created. It\u2019s probably a stretch to see this as a metaphor for wealthy outsiders targeting football, expanding it for their benefit, getting bored/unhappy and then tearing down what they have created. After all, that would surely never happen with certain owners of certain clubs, who definitely want to be a long-term, supportive partner, and want to put the needs of football and football supporters before their own\u201d \u2013 Will Reddie. Re: Monday\u2019s Football Daily. I hope you will not ignore that rather than England, who are for whatever reason the focus of the article, it was the likes of the Scottish FA and Football Association of Ireland that were the driving forces behind expanding the European Championship from 16 to 24 teams. You\u2019ll be shocked to learn those bodies also supported Fifa expanding its World Cup to 48 teams. Personally, I miss the previous 16-team European tournament, when qualifying had some jeopardy, even if it meant England missing out in 2008. At least the women\u2019s tournament still has that format to enjoy\u201d \u2013 James Baker-Smith. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.

Sarah Finch is challenging Surrey county council\u2019s decision to extend permission for a well at Horse Hill, near Gatwick airport in the Surrey countryside, which taps a subterranean reservoir developers believe may contain millions of barrels of oil. The case turns on the interpretation of rules surrounding planners\u2019 drafting of environmental impact assessments. The campaigners argue that the planning committee that granted permission for the drilling erred because it only accounted for emissions arising from the drilling site itself, rather than those from the oils\u2019 end use, when it is burned and most of the emissions produced. She has already lost in the high court and the court of appeal. On Wednesday morning, five supreme court justices, Lord Kitchin, Lord Sales, Lord Leggatt, Lady Rose, and Lord Richards, began hearing the case. A victory would have serious implications for future plans for oil and gas wells and coalmines in the UK, forcing planners to take into account the total emissions from any fossil fuels extracted, rather than merely the emissions from the extraction. Ahead of the case, Finch said: \u201cThe biggest climate impact from fossil fuel projects occurs when the fuel they produce is eventually burned. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable that these \u2018downstream\u2019 GHG [greenhouse gas] emissions are ignored when planning decisions are made. I hope that the supreme court will give a clear ruling and end the dangerous lack of clarity on this point.\u201d The proposed expansion of the Horse Hill site would include five drilling cellars, four hydrocarbon production wells, four gas-to-power generators, a process, storage and tanker loading area, seven 1,300-barrel oil tanks, and a 37-metre drill rig. Altogether, they would allow for the large-scale production of up to 3.3m tonnes of crude oil, for sale and use as transport fuel for the next 20 years. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to overstate the importance of this case,\u201d said Rowan Smith, a solicitor with Leigh Day, who is representing Finch. \u201cThe supreme court will rule conclusively on whether or not the climate change impact of fossil fuel development in the UK must be taken into account before planning permissions are granted. There is a huge amount at stake for the future of the planet and the UK\u2019s ability to meet its carbon reduction targets.\u201d Lawyers for Surrey county council dispute Finch\u2019s claim, arguing her approach to the interpretation of environmental impact requirements was \u201cmisguided\u201d. Mr Justice Holgate considered the case in 2020 and dismissed Finch\u2019s claim for a judicial review of planning permission granted by Surrey county council. Lord Justice Lewison, Sir Keith Lindblom and Lord Justice Moylan dismissed Finch\u2019s appeal in 2022. Such is the significance of the case, West Cumbria mining, the company behind plans for a controversial new coalmine in Cumbria, has submitted its own intervention. The outcome of Finch\u2019s case could seriously affect the future of the proposed mine, which as yet does not include downstream emissions in its impact assessment. Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace and the Office for Environmental Protection have also intervened, on Finch\u2019s behalf. Outside the supreme court on Wednesday, Danny Gross, a climate campaigner with Friends of the Earth, said the case was part of a long struggle to hold the fossil fuel industry to account. \u201cIt will set a crucial precedent that before any fossil fuel project goes ahead the full climate impacts need to be taken into account, because the emissions from extracting the fossil fuels are tiny in comparison to the emissions from burning them,\u201d he said."}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db4fc", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jun/21/die-on-stage-nathan-lane-josette-simon-", "primaryCategory": "stage", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018God, I really need a pint after that\u2019: actors on the toll of dying on stage night after night", "lead": "What\u2019s it like to expire every evening, often in devastating, drawn-out scenes?

But for actors, it can be a regular occurrence. On stage, their character\u2019s demise may come with a sudden gunshot or be devastatingly drawn out and come with a rousing speech. But how does it feel to die night after night after night in such roles? In the National Theatre\u2019s 2017 production of Tony Kushner\u2019s Angels in America, Nathan Lane played Roy Cohn, the real-life political fixer who denied his diagnosis of Aids until the very end. \u201cHe thinks he\u2019s indestructible,\u201d says Lane, who faced a double challenge. In the play, Cohn attempts to get the last laugh by faking his own death, before the real one comes along. Lane was required to lie in a hospital bed on stage. \u201cI pulled out an IV,\u201d he recalls, \u201cand this blood would spurt out. And I had to have these body tremors. It has an effect on you psychologically. There\u2019s something about lying in a hospital bed and gown. You do start to feel sick.\u201d Playing Richard III for the Royal Shakespeare Company last year, Arthur Hughes found himself hyperventilating from the \u201cheadrush\u201d of his death scene, surrounded by the ghosts of men he has murdered. \u201cThe end is a real acceleration,\u201d Hughes says. \u201cI was barefoot, covered in armour, ranting, raving, running, fighting. It ratchets up and up until he\u2019s dead \u2013 and then it just stops.\u201d Later, the play\u2019s abrupt ending would catch up with him. \u201cSome nights we\u2019d go to the Dirty Duck, the pub over the road, and I\u2019d be like, \u2018God, I really need a pint after that.\u2019 But I soon found out that wasn\u2019t the thing to do.\u201d His head was too noisy. \u201cI\u2019d never played a character where I needed to \u2018de-role\u2019 before, but I had to create a ritual to take it all off.\u201d He would sit on a cushion repeating gentle mantras to himself, shedding the angst that builds to Richard\u2019s death. \u201cI just needed some stillness. I found that if I didn\u2019t do that, I wouldn\u2019t sleep well.\u201d Patrick Vaill has been dying nightly, on and off, for 16 years. Death haunts Jud Fry, the lonesome outsider he plays in Daniel Fish\u2019s illuminating revival of Oklahoma!, currently playing in London\u2019s West End. It\u2019s a role Vaill first took in 2007 at college. In one scene, Curly taunts him with the idea that, in death, Jud will have what he has always wanted: to be loved. \u201cDeath is presented to him almost in a romantic way,\u201d Vaill explains. \u201cIt comes as a sort of softening.\u201d When death finally arrives, it is staged somewhat abstractly. \u201cWe don\u2019t do a literal, \u2018I\u2019m dying, I\u2019m bleeding, slow collapse.\u2019 What we shoot for is the emotional reality, the intellectual reality.\u201d Once on the floor, he lets his body relax. \u201cIt\u2019s an almost meditative moment of taking care of yourself, which is oddly similar to what death is presented as, to Jud.\u201d The sense of peace doesn\u2019t last long. \u201cHalfway through the Broadway run, I started to feel the weight of doing this every single day,\u201d says Vaill. \u201cEverything was tight, so I talked to a physical therapist.\u201d The physio made a clear connection between the emotional performance and the physical consequences. \u201cI was reminded by this doctor that, yes, your brain knows that this is fake, you\u2019re not dead, this is your job, this is a story. However, your body hears a bang every night; your body is crying; your body is simulating fear.\u201d Can it be that in an intensive performance of death, the body starts to believe it\u2019s real? Like Hughes, Vaill had to find ways of coping. He showers straight after the show. \u201cFirst of all,\u201d he laughs, \u201cit washes off the blood. But a hot shower reminds your body: this is fake, these are your friends, you love doing this, and at the end of the day, you\u2019re playing.\u201d Theatre may be an ephemeral art form but the physical and mental repercussions of performing over a long period can last. If you were doing the same performance for a film or a TV programme, says Vaill, you could \u201cwreck yourself\u201d, but that simply isn\u2019t possible in theatre. \u201cYou have to do it eight times a week, hopefully for months and months.\u201d As a result, you can\u2019t let the intensity of it all affect your home life. The aftercare of performance is critical, he says, to reassure your mind and body that you are safe. \u201cThat kind of stuff becomes as important as doing your vocal warm-up before the show.\u201d For Josette Simon, getting into the role of Cleopatra at the RSC in 2017 was a far longer and more involved process than getting out of it: she found her mindset would change daily at around 3pm. Cleopatra takes her own life with a poisonous asp. \u201cShe\u2019s right in the middle of the line,\u201d Simon says. \u201cSo I thought she should die with her eyes open.\u201d Doing so upright in her throne, directly facing the audience, was not the easiest dramatic choice. \u201cI made a rod for my own back,\u201d she admits, \u201cbecause I then had to spend the whole of Charmian\u2019s speech with my eyes open, not blinking.\u201d In rehearsal, her eyes would start streaming in seconds. \u201cBut I trained the muscles around my eyes. Every day, I would sit incrementally longer with my eyes like that. Occasionally in production I would feel a tear coming and I\u2019d think, \u2018Come on Charmian, get on with the speech!\u2019\u201d Today, Simon says with a sly smile, she believes she could still win any staring contest. \u201cI\u2019ve got it down to a fine art.\u201d Describing the way she would get into the character, Simon sees no separation between herself and the role. But in that moment of death, when there are no more thoughts in the character\u2019s head for her to imagine, she would drift back to herself. She found it vaguely meditative, focusing on her breathing after the storm she had just delivered. \u201cI was usually quite tired by this point, too,\u201d she laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s three hours and 15 minutes on the stage with extremely long speeches.\u201d Unlike Vaill and Hughes, Simon didn\u2019t have a nightly ritual to shake off the part and her death. For her, she says, \u201cthe character ends at the curtain call. It\u2019s the end of that page and every night is a new page, as if you\u2019ve never done it before.\u201d Although Simon would like to think a theatrical performance engaged with death might spark meaningful conversations off stage, she doesn\u2019t really believe this happened. \u201cWe as a culture are terrible at talking about death,\u201d she says. \u201cWe can\u2019t even say the word. We can\u2019t take the terror out of it.\u201d This fear of death took centre stage in Victoria Melody\u2019s 2017 show Ugly Chief. When Melody\u2019s father, Mike, was misdiagnosed with a terminal illness, he asked her to organise his funeral. She went one step further and trained to become a funeral director. Together they turned the surreal experience of planning your own sendoff into an anarchic show that aimed to open up a conversation about death. Indeed, a funeral \u201cis like a sad theatre show\u201d, Melody says. \u201cA lot of pomp and creativity goes into making it a dramatic experience.\u201d In making the show together, they dug up topics they had avoided for years. He scrapped the initial eulogy she wrote for him because it made him into a saint, when in fact he\u2019d been, she realised, a \u201cchain-smoking, angry, depressed man who played Football Manager all day, so I left home at 16\u201d. Instead, they wrote his eulogy together. \u201cWe had people write to us after the show,\u201d Melody remembers. \u201cWe had a dad who said it made him get in touch with his estranged son and mend their relationship, and we had an email from the son saying thank you.\u201d The act of creating the show was transformational for her own dad, too. \u201cHe\u2019d been an alcoholic my whole life,\u201d she says matter-of-factly. \u201cAfter that tour, he stopped drinking. I don\u2019t think it changed his attitude to death, but I do think it made him want to live longer.\u201d On Broadway, Nathan Lane recently performed opposite Zo\u00eb Wanamaker in Pictures from Home, a play based on photographer Larry Sultan\u2019s moving book about his ageing parents. Does taking part in another show about grief make Lane think more about his own mortality? \u201cSure,\u201d he shrugs, \u201cbut I don\u2019t need a play to do that. I think about death all the time. The more you see contemporaries die, you really think, boy, you just have to appreciate every moment.\u201d He points to one of Wanamaker\u2019s lines in Pictures from Home: \u201cOf course I\u2019m terrified of it, but we\u2019re all going to die. Hopefully, you do it well.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db4fd", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/21/titanic-sub-timeline-titan-submersible-missing-vessel", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Titan submersible: timeline of missing vessel\u2019s voyage", "lead": "As rescue vessels arrive at the search site off Newfoundland, here\u2019s the Titan\u2019s voyage, starting on Friday, when it set off for the Titanic", "author": "Guardian staff and agency", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 14:29:15", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.988740", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/5ab82b84e4d3689d058732da63ec882cebebae05/0_111_2200_1320/500.jpg", "body": "The search for the missing Titan submersible is continuing on Wednesday amid concerns over dwindling oxygen supply on the vessel.

Given the frequent tone changes for the series \u2013 this one boasts an obvious Game of Thrones influence and a mature age rating \u2013 it\u2019s an open question, but fans come back for more than just chocobos and moogles. For me, Final Fantasy is more of a mood. Other fans can rest easy \u2013 there is still much of the series\u2019 DNA in Final Fantasy XVI, and that is ultimately what helps the game in its weaker moments. The game radiates a sense of care, in its themes and in the way characters treat one another. Like Final Fantasy VII, it reminds us that we have one planet to live on and that we should treat one another with kindness. Sure there is swearing and violence, but they are genuine expressions of desperation and surprise, and they feel earned. Who wouldn\u2019t swear at seeing a monster the size of a mountain raze everything in its path? FFXVI is also full of gratifying little nods to the series\u2019 history \u2013 the victory fanfare is back and it is glorious, seeing fan-favourite monsters become serious opponents is as exciting as it was in Final Fantasy VII Remake, and this game\u2019s Cid is the best Cid since Final Fantasy VII, if not ever. At 15, protagonist Clive Rosfield is a guard to his brother Joshua. Even though Clive is older, Joshua is set to inherit his family\u2019s throne because he is a Dominant, a person who can control powerful monsters called Eikons, and even transform into one. As the Dominant of Fire, Joshua can use devastating magic; Clive, who can only throw a few puny fireballs, is worse than useless to his scheming mother. People like him, called Bearers, are usually enslaved from birth, all for the crime of being able to use magic without the aid of a crystal. But during a mission gone wrong, Joshua is killed by a mysterious second Dominant of Fire who by all accounts shouldn\u2019t exist and their kingdom is taken over. Thirteen years later, Clive, now enslaved, is on a mission to avenge his brother. Final Fantasy XVI is a story of nations clashing over territory and resources, a recurring theme for the series. The crystals and their magic lead to questions of ecological sustainability and free will, both of which have been at the heart of FF since its inception. However, the tone-change masks that FFXVI is the kind of story the series has told several times before \u2013 and gets told in similar ways in many western games besides. Realistic high fantasy may be new territory for Final Fantasy, but not necessarily for its players. And it\u2019s sad that in the pursuit of \u201crealistic\u201d fantasy, the FF team has erased people of colour from their own history of slavery \u2013 they are absent from the game. Worse, there is a desert region, complete with some stereotypical oriental music, occupied by lightly tanned characters with clearly western features. It feels as if the amount of care taken with other aspects of the game wasn\u2019t extended to people of colour, and that stings. Where it took FFXV a film, a game, several expansions and a few books to piece its world together, here characters constantly put events into context, share anecdotes or react to changes that you bring about. You have a historian, a strategist and something called Active Time Lore at your disposal \u2013 the last one is akin to Amazon Prime Video\u2019s X-ray feature, and lets you look up information about characters, locations and concepts during cutscenes. It\u2019s a dream for fans of in-game lore, but the amount of ground there is to cover also results in uneven pacing. Even short gameplay sequences are regularly bracketed by drawn out cutscenes in which characters pore over a map. These scenes had me itching to pick the controller up again, and they spend a long time telling you how urgent the situation is, which feels ironic. But as a result, Clive, who may come across as taciturn at first, is probably the most well-rounded, loving and emotive character since FFX\u2019s Tidus, with the difference that this time around players may actually like him. Final Fantasy thrives on likable protagonists and their relationships with each other, and Clive, who makes a lot of friends over the course of the game, is the perfect mix of cool and affable. The combat feels like the final form of the free-roaming hack and slash battles Square Enix has experimented with ever since Final Fantasy XIII. You have a ranged magic attack, sword attacks, two special attacks that use the power of an Eikon and commands for your faithful hound, Torgal. Most attacks can be charged for more damage, and eventually Clive acquires a limit break that makes him even more powerful for a short period of time. It\u2019s thanks to combat design veteran Ryota Suzuki, who worked on games such as Devil May Cry 5 and Dragon\u2019s Dogma, that juggling all of these options feels smooth, and well-timed strings of combos turn smaller enemies into defenceless ragdolls. However, unless you are the kind of player that enjoys experimenting with attacks and trying to achieve flawless combos, the novelty inevitably wears off. Devil May Cry is great but it\u2019s also not 40 hours long. While Clive learns some additional skills and attacks to make new combos with, you end up executing the same attacks and patterns a lot, especially since bosses have ridiculously capacious health bars. The stagger system from Final Fantasy VII Remake is vital to make it through \u2013 if you continuously attack enemies so that they can\u2019t retaliate, they end up \u201cstaggered\u201d, taking increased damage while completely unable to fight. Still, you spend a lot of time bashing nonsense numbers out of big monsters and battles feel overly long. This criticism could of course apply to any game above a certain length, but fights in Final Fantasy XVI can easily devolve into an onslaught of magical explosions and heavy, persistent motion blur that is unclear and unpleasant on the eye. Battles are frequently ridiculously bombastic, even for a Final Fantasy. If you don\u2019t believe that there can be too much action, too big an enemy, too many phases to a battle, this game might change your mind. The dichotomy between this excess and the naturalistic Game of Thrones approach to the world and characters is jarring, and it might have benefited the game to rein things in a bit. Level design is not Final Fantasy XVI\u2019s strong point. Impressive-looking castles turn out to be linear tunnels while large, open swathes of field or marsh or desert extend between them. While towns are now higher in number and hold more people than in Final Fantasy XV, they are little more than hubs in which quest givers patiently wait for you to rescue them, and the outside world remains devoid of life. See a tower in the distance? The door is closed. Found treasure? It\u2019s almost always an item for the barebones crafting system. Unlike in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, for instance, there are no secrets that you can organically uncover, and side quests are a simple matter of following an objective marker, taking out whatever monster awaits you at your destination, and then fast-travelling back. As much as Square Enix clearly tried to get me invested in the side quests by offering little narrative arcs, most of these stories aren\u2019t engaging, and where tedious quests meet minor rewards, disappointment is inevitable. Final Fantasy needed surprise encounters and real incentives for players to explore its wider world, but you\u2019re back to swathes of empty land. Side quests that unlock something special, such as upgraded curatives, do exist, but they are marked with their own symbol, another item to tick off the list. Final Fantasy XVI is the series at its most spectacular, for good and bad. However, Square Enix has taken a lot of the criticism aimed at previous games into account, and the battles offer more freedom, the characters are fleshed out, and thanks to detailed world-building, you finally get the sense again that there is a world out there that needs saving. \u2022 Final Fantasy XVI is released on 22 June, \u00a364.99."}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db500", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/21/david-cameron-was-warned-2013-uk-risk-assessment-too-secret", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "David Cameron was warned in 2013 UK risk assessment \u2018too secret\u2019", "lead": "Former chief scientific adviser tells Covid inquiry national risk strategy was not being used to \u2018prevent and mitigate dangers\u2019", "author": "Robert Booth Social affairs correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 14:01:58", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.988796", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/ddf8622c2a4723a222721e2db07da5c5c6867bf6/0_45_3000_1800/500.jpg", "body": "David Cameron\u2019s chief scientific adviser warned him in 2013 that the UK\u2019s assessment of risks, including from pandemics, was not being used properly to prevent and mitigate dangers and was being kept too secret, the Covid-19 public inquiry has heard. Sir Mark Walport, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser until 2017, raised the concern with the then PM in a letter, and told the inquiry that the national risk assessment (NRA) \u201cwas locked in departmental safes most of the time and I felt that that wasn\u2019t the most effective way\u201d. \u201cThe whole point of [a] risk assessment is that you will be able to use it to see if you can stop something happening in the first place,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it is going to happen \u2013 to mitigate your numbers, reduce its effects.\u201d The public inquiry into the UK\u2019s Covid response has heard claims that too much stress was placed on planning for a flu pandemic and that the UK was badly unprepared for the different virus that struck in early 2020. Walport told the inquiry that not enough was done across government to build broader national resilience against risks. He said he raised this with Cameron in 2013 and again with the Cabinet Office\u2019s civil contingencies directorate a year later, saying he sounded like \u201ca broken record\u201d. Walport, a member of the prime minister\u2019s council for science and technology until 2020, backed calls from Oliver Letwin, the former Cabinet Office minister, for the creation of a new post of minister for resilience. On Tuesday, Letwin told the inquiry\u2019s investigation into the UK\u2019s preparedness for Covid-19 that Britain\u2019s critical national infrastructure remained \u201cwildly under-resilient\u201d. Walport described the NRA as \u201cstill a work in progress\u201d. On Monday, Cameron said it was a mistake that \u201cmore time and more questions\u201d were not focused on tackling what turned out to be a \u201chighly infectious, asymptomatic\u201d pandemic. The NRA placed pandemic flu as the highest risk with a medium to high likelihood of a catastrophic or significant impact in a reasonable worst-case scenario. Walport said: \u201cRather than focusing solely on influenza, it ought to have recognised the fact that pandemics come in many different forms.\u201d The assessment on emerging infectious diseases was a medium to high likelihood of a moderate impact. But there was \u201clow confidence in the overall assessment based on a relatively small body of knowledge\u201d. Walport said this was because these diseases had not existed before. He defended the decision for the nation\u2019s preparedness to be focused on a specific pandemic risk rather than a range of options as has been proposed by others. But he said it was important to build more national resilience not just for biological and medical risks, but also in relation to infrastructure. \u201cAs we have become more efficient, we have become less resilient, and you can have cascading failures very, very quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cSo for example, when the supertanker got stuck in the Suez Canal, suddenly supply lines were disrupted.\u201d He called for a greater public health workforce \u201cthat could help with screening for hypertension, diabetes, heart disease \u2026 [which could then be] repurposed for the purposes of vaccination, and things like testing [in a pandemic].\u201d The inquiry continues."}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db501", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jun/21/iranian-women-farnaz-damnabis-best-photograph", "primaryCategory": "artanddesign", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Iranian women asleep on a bus \u2026 Farnaz Damnabi\u2019s best photograph", "lead": "\u2018As you can tell by their closed eyes, all the women around me that day were exhausted.

I took this on my way home from work after a tiring day. I work for one of Iran\u2019s news agencies, where my duties include editing other photographers\u2019 reportage and shooting on assignment. On the bus that day, the women around me, as you can tell by their closed eyes, were also exhausted. I took it discreetly with my iPhone, and I knew straight away that it was a powerful image. It speaks to a sense of loneliness \u2013 the isolation that comes with working in the capital, an issue for all workers regardless of gender. The black and white accentuates that feeling. Its formal composition, the sense of movement and strong diagonals also make it striking. Behind is the Chamran Expressway against the Alborz mountain range and the Milad Tower \u2013 one of the city\u2019s most recognisable landmarks. The tallest tower in Iran and the sixth tallest telecommunication tower in the world, it has become a symbol of Tehran. Although initial construction plans began in the mid-70s under the last Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, it wasn\u2019t built until long after the 1979 revolution, when Iran became an \u201cIslamic republic\u201d. Since the revolution, it has been mandatory for women to wear the hijab in public. Religious women wear the chador, a full body-length veil, but even if you are not religious, all women over the age of nine are required to cover their hair with a veil. The law is enforced by the government and morality police. My photography attempts to give Iranian women visibility. It is likely that many of the women on the bus are civil servants or clerical workers, but also wives and mothers. This shot signifies the central presence, yet alienation, of women in Iranian society. The weight of their situation can be read on their faces. I truly believe women in my country must be superheroes to overcome some of the rules and restrictions they face every day at home and beyond. Unveiled, my first European solo exhibition, brings together photographs of women and girls across Iran, in private and public spaces. It includes works from my series Lost Paradise, taken in the holy Shia city of Mashhad, one of the most conservative religious sites in the country, where most women can only be photographed if their faces aren\u2019t shown. I captured women of that region from behind in patterned chadors standing before intricately designed Persian rugs. They appear to merge into the tapestries behind them \u2013 a metaphor that signifies women\u2019s presence yet invisibility in Iranian society. The show\u2019s title alludes to the wearing \u2013 or not wearing \u2013 of the hijab in public, but also my attempts to expose a different side of life in Iran, at a time when the country is becoming more insular and veiled from the outside world. My primary concern is not to be controversial but rather to represent the varied experiences of women in my country, to pay homage to them. Iran is a beautiful country with a rich and diverse cultural and historical heritage. I am so proud of my roots. But to be a woman and also a street photographer here isn\u2019t easy, and since the civil unrest and protests last year, photographing in public comes with even more difficulties. Even Iranian news agencies must follow government policy \u2013 few photojournalists have permission to photograph in public, let alone the protests. I have some permissions as a photojournalist but, to be discreet in my personal work, I often photograph on my iPhone rather than use a larger camera. Questioning what it means to be a woman in Iran is what first encouraged me to pick up a camera aged 16. It gave me permission to observe the world in a more profound way, and to make sense of my position within it. I had the courage to become a photographer because of the positive feedback and support of my friends, in particular, my female friends who recognised my talent. Women should support and help each other to be heard in the world. My mother, who is also an artist, has always supported my ambitions. I am always struggling with my fears, yet she always has my back. Since last year I have been living alone, which is not commonplace for women before marriage. But she has supported my decision to be independent and to put my work first \u2013 an opportunity she wasn\u2019t afforded by her parents. She understands what I\u2019m trying to achieve, to show that photography is about a deeper sensitivity with the world around you, whether you are capturing cities or the remarkable individuals who shape those places. \u2022 Farnaz Damnabi: Unveiled is at 29 Arts in Progress Gallery, Milan, until 30 September, and also online in a viewing room of the show Farnaz Damnabi\u2019s CV Born: Tehran, 1994.

The setting may be somewhat incongruous for such a bold statement but, ultimately, that does not make it any less justified, for this is very much someone who rolled the dice and won big. England is part of England\u2019s squad for the Women\u2019s World Cup and reflecting on how that came about the 29-year-old is in no doubt of the moment that changed everything, the moment the doors slid in her favour: her move from Chelsea to Tottenham in January. It was not an easy decision, especially for someone who, by her own admission, \u201chas never dealt well with change\u201d, and there was immediate pressure given the \u00a3250,000 fee, a domestic record for a British player in the women\u2019s game. But it simply had to be done given the striker\u2019s lack of game time allied to her desperate desire to travel to Australia and New Zealand with the Lionesses. England needed to be playing and scoring again, and Spurs offered her that opportunity. She well and truly took it. There were 12 goals in 12 Women\u2019s Super League appearances alongside an all-round excellence in leading the line, and the fact England was performing so well in a side struggling so badly spoke to her mental strength as well as technical ability. In the end Sarina Wiegman had little choice but to recall a member of the squad that had triumphed at last year\u2019s European Championship as the national team\u2019s focus shifted to global glory. \u201cThe situation I was in, I wasn\u2019t being used, I was on the bench, and as Sarina rightly said, I wasn\u2019t getting picked [for the national team] because I wasn\u2019t getting the minutes,\u201d says England of her situation at Chelsea. \u201cIt was up to me to make sure I was not only getting the minutes but making the minutes count and I did that at Spurs. I can\u2019t thank them enough for giving me the chance to go out and be happy again.\u201d When England received the call from Wiegman confirming her place in the 23-strong squad for the World Cup, that happiness turned into wild joy. \u201cI tried to play it nice and cool but I hung up the phone and screamed my house down,\u201d she says. \u201cThe first thing I did was ring my mum, ring my partner. Obviously I was elated.\u201d That much can be taken from England\u2019s sunny mood in less\u2011than\u2011sunny conditions at St George\u2019s Park at the start of the Lionesses\u2019 buildup for a tournament that kicks off with a match between New Zealand and Norway at Eden Park in Auckland on 20 July. She talks about being \u201cexcited\u201d four times during a six\u2011minute conversation. There is, however, also clear frustration and sadness in regards to losing her place in Wiegman\u2019s squad after Euro 2022 given it meant missing out on further triumphs at international level. \u201cIt\u2019s been hard seeing the team win the Finalissima and the Arnold Clark Cup \u2013 those are moments I wanted to be part of,\u201d says England. \u201cBut equally that\u2019s the decision that was made, that\u2019s life, not everything goes your way, and you can only control what you can control. All I could do was go to Spurs, work hard, train hard and put the performances in. I very much did that. \u201cIt was a big risk, I\u2019d been at Chelsea for seven years, that was a big part of my professional career, and I didn\u2019t like the thought of change. I could\u2019ve stayed in my comfort zone but ultimately I didn\u2019t want to be in a position where I didn\u2019t give everything to going [to the World Cup]. I would\u2019ve regretted that looking back on my career.\u201d Barring any setbacks, England will be on the flight from London to the Lionesses\u2019 training camp on Queensland\u2019s Sunshine Coast on 5 July with her sights firmly set on being in the starting lineup for the opening game against Haiti in Brisbane 17 days later. There is no guarantee of that, however, given the options in attack, with England battling for a place with Lauren James, Alessia Russo and the WSL\u2019s player of the season, Rachel Daly. But having fought her way back into contention, the girl from Barnsley is relishing the challenge and everything that lies ahead. \u201cThere\u2019s an exceptional amount of competition in the striking force, as well as the whole squad really, and we\u2019re all very excited to get out there and show the world what we can do,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a different group of players [compared with the Euros] but we want to win.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db503", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/ng-interactive/2023/jun/21/the-children-of-windrush-they-told-us-youre-people-of-the-world-thats-what-matters-not-skin-colour", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "The children of Windrush: \u2018They told us: you\u2019re people of the world, that\u2019s what matters, not skin colour\u2019", "lead": "On the 75th anniversary of the arrival of Empire Windrush, the children of its passengers tell of an enduring legacy", "author": "Amelia Gentleman", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 14:00:41", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.988851", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/0592c72018136caab1c5e9a5902d5631de25ea14/0_0_2560_1536/500.jpg", "body": "On the day Empire Windrush arrived in Britain in June 1948, 11 Labour MPs sent a letter to the prime minister, Clement Attlee, proposing that there should be controls on black immigration. The British people were \u201cblest by the absence of a colour racial problem\u201d, they wrote, adding: \u201cAn influx of coloured people domiciled here is likely to impair the harmony, strength and cohesion of our people and social life and cause discord and unhappiness among all concerned.\u201d The arrival of the ship, carrying about 500 people from the Caribbean, had already been the subject of an anxious debate in parliament. The Daily Express described its approach as \u201ca shipload of worry\u201d. But within a few years, for many of the passengers the huge significance of that journey had receded to such an extent that they did not tell even their children they had arrived in Britain on that ship. Mel Gaynor, the musician best known as the drummer for Simple Minds, had no idea his father, George, was a passenger on Empire Windrush until long after his death. \u201cMy father didn\u2019t talk about it, which feels sad now,\u201d he says. Sheine Peart, a university lecturer, only began to appreciate the importance of her father\u2019s journey when a teaching colleague was awestruck when she mentioned it in passing. \u201cShe said: \u2018He came over on Empire Windrush? That\u2019s like touching history.\u2019\u201d During their childhoods, the huge cultural import of their parents\u2019 journey was not in the least obvious to many children of Windrush passengers. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t seen as a particularly historic. It would have been like talking about a flight you\u2019ve taken. They didn\u2019t realise it was such a momentous event,\u201d says Deyon Johnston, director of a recruitment company , whose father, Clinton Johnston, was on the ship. It is only in later life that the children of the Windrush passengers have begun to appreciate the enormity of the decision made, usually by their fathers, to emigrate to the UK. \u201cI feel pride that he was one of those pioneers. My father had 10 shillings, a cardboard suitcase and a few bits of clothing to start forging his life here,\u201d Sheine\u2019s brother, Icah Peart, a criminal defence KC, says. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t have had the money to go back if he hadn\u2019t liked it. They were really brave coming here, entering an unknown world.\u201d \u2018When he broke out into Jamaican patois, I knew it was serious\u2019 \u2013 Mel Gaynor In interviews with 12 children of eight Windrush passengers, it quickly becomes clear the Labour MPs\u2019 doom-mongering warnings of impending \u201cdiscord and unhappiness\u201d were misplaced. The descendants of the Windrush arrivals witnessed their parents experiencing huge challenges in building new lives here, but say there were few regrets. The children have gone on to be barristers, headteachers, carers, civil servants, musicians, social workers, academics, hoteliers, shop workers, bankers, actors, surgeons, parents and grandparents. Conversations about their fathers\u2019 decision to spend \u00a328.10 on a ticket \u2013 the equivalent of six months\u2019 wages in Jamaica, or the proceeds of selling three cows \u2013 are mostly very cheerful appraisals of busy, complicated lives, filled with admiration, gratitude and pride. But despite a determination to celebrate their lives, memories of the deep hostility they encountered remain acute. As young children, most began only gradually to realise their families were different. \u201cMy father was very gentrified, English during the weekdays \u2013 immaculately dressed, suited and booted \u2013 but at the weekends we\u2019d all go to gatherings with his friends and there was more of a Jamaican spirit,\u201d says Gaynor. His father\u2019s Jamaican accent only came out around his friends or when he was angry with his children. \u201cI remember falling in the river in my brand new clothes which got destroyed. He broke out into Jamaican patois. I knew then: OK, this is serious.\u201d Johnston and her brother Errol, a retired Church of England pensions board employee, knew their father was feeling homesick when he took them to Portobello Road in London to buy ackee and plantain. \u201cAvocado pears were very expensive then. He used to buy them and hide them on the top shelf in the pantry. We weren\u2019t allowed to touch them. He might give us a little slice, but he was desperate for a taste of home,\u201d Errol says. They noticed how their father would talk to other black people on the tube and on buses when they rode around London with him. \u201cWe assumed he knew them but he was just glad to see a fellow stranger in this country,\u201d says Errol. Clinton was very outgoing. \u201cHe was always making friends. It was embarrassing \u2013 he\u2019d always be starting conversations. He was always the loudest in the room,\u201d says Deyon. \u201cHe was quite confident, but as I get older I wonder if it was false bravado because he was in a foreign country,\u201d Errol says. \u201cAs if he wanted his personality to come out first before you saw the colour.\u201d Gloria Brothwood says when her father, Andrew Mowlah-Baksh, was missing home he would complain about his chilblains and talk longingly about the heat in Trinidad; he would put on swing music and calypso, or take the children out to the park to fly kites he had made from the newspaper. \u201cYou could tell from his demeanour. He used to type airmail letters to his sisters, he said you could fit more in that way than with handwriting. They were always sending photos to each other, they never lost touch. We didn\u2019t have a phone at the time so there was always a letter in the pipeline.\u201d Howard Gardner remembers his grandmother sending rum cake in a parcel for her son Alford, who like many Windrush passengers had served in the RAF during the war and had travelled back to England after a brief return to the Caribbean. \u201cHe would have a slice of it. You couldn\u2019t eat much of it \u2013 it was very strong.\u201d \u2018Her mother was completely racist. She didn\u2019t accept our dad\u2019 \u2013 Errol Johnson As they grew older, the children of the Windrush arrivals who had married white women noticed that some of their English relatives had initially not entirely welcomed their fathers into their families. Clinton, Errol and Deyon Johnston\u2019s father, met their mother, a white typist from west London, at the Paramount in Tottenham Court Road, a dancehall decorated with palm trees. \u201cHer mother was completely racist. She didn\u2019t accept our dad. I never saw the two of them together,\u201d Errol says. \u201cNone of our mother\u2019s relatives attended her wedding,\u201d Sheine Peart remembers. \u201cThey were worried about what it would mean for her, being with a black man, because it was a complete break in the way things had happened. They would have been more comfortable if she\u2019d married someone from the local printing works in Bath, not someone who had come thousands of miles and was unknown and unquantifiable. There was fear and trepidation. It took them a while to realise he wasn\u2019t a bad bloke.\u201d Jean Thompson\u2019s grandfather on her mother\u2019s side was an Indonesian Muslim foundry owner in Liverpool. He and her grandmother were at first opposed to her mother\u2019s marriage to Wayne Armstrong, a double bass player from Jamaica. \u201cMy dad wasn\u2019t accepted by my nan\u2019s family whatsoever, so Mum cut herself off. But the minute the first daughter was born, her mum was straight up the hospital and it was all mended. We lived next door to each other and were in and out of each other\u2019s houses.\u201d He went on to have seven daughters with his wife, children who have grown up to work for the NHS, become social workers and run their own businesses. \u201cHe taught us: if there are barriers in the way, leap over them,\u201d says Thompson, who was the first black civil servant in the Liverpool unemployment office. \u201cHe taught us ambition, that if there was an opportunity, you must take it. We always thought, if Dad could have travelled 2,000 miles from Jamaica, why should we be scared of a challenge?\u201d The family grew up in a white area of Liverpool, where it was common to see the words \u201cblacks go home\u201d scrawled on the walls. Thompson remembers her schoolfriends trying to shield her from it. \u201cWhen I saw the N-word on the wall near my home, my friends put chalk over it to hide the word.\u201d Sheine Peart says they were the first family of colour in Reading. Her father had found landlords were reluctant to rent to him, so he saved and bought a family house in a very white area. \u201cGrowing up there were some bizarre assumptions made about us as a family. I remember the people across the road had some difficulties with the police, but the police would assume it was something to do with us. There was an assumption from the neighbours that we would go to the less academically able schools. When my mum said I\u2019d be going to the grammar school, the neighbours asked: how did that happen?\u201d Icah Peart remembers the day when someone spat at Sheine in her pushchair. \u201cI think my dad would have killed the person who did it if my mum hadn\u2019t stopped him. He was an extremely protective dad. He wasn\u2019t prepared to let anyone slight him.\u201d Mowlah-Baksh met his Dublin-born wife, Theresa, at a dance in Birmingham when he was serving in the RAF during the second world war. He returned to England on Empire Windrush and they married in 1949. He worked for Rover as a clerk, and they had five children. \u201cBeing a mixed couple in the 1950s, it must have been a lot, there must have been racism, but they didn\u2019t talk about it,\u201d Brothwood, a carer in Birmingham, says. \u201cThey wanted to make sure that we grew up in a happy home so they worked really hard to protect us from it, so we never saw the harsh side of things.\u201d She remembers being vaguely aware of uncomfortable moments at school. \u201cThe home economics teacher made me feel one inch tall once,\u201d she says. \u201cI wanted to do woodwork, but she told me: \u2018You have to do cooking and sewing.\u2019 I told her: I can already cook and I can sew. She said: \u2018Is there anything the natives can\u2019t do?\u2019\u201d She says she didn\u2019t have the language to classify it mentally it as racism, and only realised years later why it had upset her. Her brother, also called Andrew Mowlah-Baksh, says: \u201cI remember Enoch Powell\u2019s speech when I was 13 or 14, inciting people to have a bad attitude towards race. I remember wishing I could run faster, to get away from lads with an attitude.\u201d But the family was happy, the children were popular and their parents taught them to shrug off the occasional bits of malice. \u201cThey told us it was a good thing: you\u2019re people of the world, you\u2019ve got relations from every country, that\u2019s what matters, not the colour of skin,\u201d Brothwood says. Gaynor remembers the sudden proliferation of National Front posters when he was a teenager in the 1970s. \u201cI was attacked by sixth-formers when I was about 13. It wasn\u2019t serious enough to leave a scar, but it left a mental scar \u2013 making me less trusting, more aware of my surroundings, aware of the no-go areas.\u201d Thompson realised quite early on that her father faced difficulties that her friends\u2019 parents did not encounter. \u201cI can remember we had a TV that broke; he was good at fixing things, but he just couldn\u2019t do it. He had a friend who was an electrician so he put it in the pram and wheeled it around to him. Later he came home all flustered. He had been stopped by the police. To see my dad flustered was very sad.\u201d There was a generational shift between how she and her father viewed being targeted by the police. \u201cI can remember when I started to drive, the numbers of times I got pulled over by a policeman. My dad would say: \u2018Don\u2019t get angry, this will change in time.\u2019 For him, it was a minor inconvenience and his reasoning was: changes will come. But when you are a young angry black person who was born here, you just want the same as what your friends have and not to be harassed by the people who you thought were there to help you.\u201d But she notes that her father was right \u2013 changes have come. \u201cA few days ago someone asked me: \u2018Where were you born?\u2019 I said: \u2018Liverpool\u201d. They said: \u2018No, I mean where were you before that?\u2019 But it doesn\u2019t happen very often now, and it\u2019s usually the older generation,\u201d she says. \u2018He came over to ensure we would have a better chance than he did\u2019 \u2013 Icah Peart As they grew older they became more aware of the sacrifices their fathers had made in the hope of building better lives for their children, even if this was a subject they never spoke about. Many of them took jobs below the level they might have had in the Caribbean. Armstrong, Thompson\u2019s father, was a qualified engineer and also a talented musician but was unable to work in either of those fields. \u201cHe went to a good school in Jamaica, he could speak Latin. I think he wasn\u2019t expecting to do the work that he ended up doing, but he was a modest man. He worked as a dock labourer in the Liverpool docks for 27 years,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was just sweeping to begin with but later they realised he had a brain.\u201d In the evenings he played double bass in bands at local clubs. \u201cHis heart was in jazz. He always said there is no racial or social divide in music. He was hugely loved, a big part of the community. There were so many people at my father\u2019s funeral the crematorium didn\u2019t know what to do.\u201d Clinton Johnston worked as a driver for Findus foods and delivered magazines for Fleet Street publishers in London. \u201cHe was far more educated than the jobs he was doing, but I think there were only so many knocks you could take, so in the end he said: I\u2019ll just be a driver then,\u201d Errol Johnston says. They remember many of their father\u2019s friends being in much worse situations. \u201cWe were in a council flat, so we had heating and hot water, but whenever we went to visit them in Notting Hill Gate and Ladbroke Grove, they were living in squalid bedsits. We\u2019d sometimes keep our coats on it was so cold,\u201d says Deyon Johnston. Errol thinks his father and his friends coped by laughing at the slights they encountered. \u201cThey\u2019d talk about the racism. We were kids, and listening, but not really paying attention. But I remember they would joke about it, they\u2019d be killing themselves with laughter about it. It didn\u2019t seem to faze them.\u201d Somehow their parents\u2019 ambitions \u2013 though thwarted for them \u2013 were nevertheless implanted into their children. Gaynor\u2019s father, George had been a respected trumpeter in Jamaica, but never spoke about it with his children and found a good job as an engineer in London. He taught his son trumpet from the age of about six, until Mel discovered a drum kit at school and switched. \u201cHe played the trumpet at home and we listened to Miles Davis, Ella Fitzgerald \u2013 nothing Jamaican, mainly jazz \u2013 but at the start he didn\u2019t encourage me to become a musician. \u201cHe said: \u2018It\u2019s not a sensible career. You need to get a career, son.\u2019 But when he saw that I was absolutely adamant about playing drums and wanting to become a musician, then he helped me enormously. I was spending six hours a day rehearsing in the garden shed driving the neighbours mad. He used to take me to a lot of concerts \u2013 that was life-changing.\u201d On the Windrush manifest, Ralph Peart, passenger No 811, is described as a French polisher, but he worked in Britain as an electrician. and when he retired he was working at Heathrow airport. As a child in Jamaica he had to walk to Kingston to sell vegetables. \u201cThat was a challenge he didn\u2019t want for his children. He saw education as the passport out of that. He had huge ambitions for us,\u201d Sheine Peart says. \u201cHe was very keen for me to be a lawyer. Very, very keen,\u201d Icah Peart adds, remembering the copious, unasked-for advice his father would give him about trials he was involved with. \u201cIt was pretty obvious that he would have liked to be a lawyer. He wanted his children to succeed. He came over to ensure that his descendants would have a better chance than he did.\u201d His father took huge pride in his children\u2019s achievements. \u201cHe was protective and supportive, always on your side. I couldn\u2019t have wanted for a better dad.\u201d \u2018They were the first step on the ladder, showing people difference is nothing to be scared of\u2019 \u2013 Gloria Brothwood For some of the children the government\u2019s pointed determination to celebrate the Windrush anniversary this year has left a slightly sour taste. Guilt over the Windrush scandal \u2013 in which thousands of people from the Caribbean were wrongly classified as illegal immigrants \u2013 prompted the announcement by the government of funding for annual Windrush day celebrations. The scandal, which affected people from all over the Commonwealth, most of whom arrived in the 1950s and 60s, and which only acquired the Windrush name as a useful shorthand, complicated the lives of some of the families who arrived on the ship. Until interviewed by the Guardian, Gloria and Andrew\u2019s brother, Joseph Mowlah-Baksh, had struggled for decades to be issued with a passport; the Home Office is now processing his papers. Armstrong travelled abroad only once, when he went with his wife and the two youngest of their seven daughters on a bingo club coach trip to Spain in 1983, travelling on cheaper temporary British passports, which were available for short trips. On his way back he was taken off the coach at Calais and held in custody for several hours because the French border guards refused to accept he was British. \u201cMy father felt anxiety about travelling after that. He never visited Jamaica again because he was worried about being unable to return home to his family. He was a devoted husband, and he wouldn\u2019t have taken the risk,\u201d Thompson says. But, mostly, the Windrush arrivals\u2019 children want to put the anger and disappointments and challenges facing their parents to one side and focus on the positives. Sheine Peart says her father rarely paused to reflect on the immense historical shift to which he contributed. \u201cOf course there were black people in Britain 2,000 years ago, but this was the first big influx of Caribbean immigrants. He was aware that he was part of a significant change, but his direct experience of that change was sometimes quite negative and challenging. His way of managing was not to talk about it; you had to prise things out of him. I\u2019m pleased this is not a forgotten, marginalised piece of history. It\u2019s good it has been pushed to the forefront. The Caribbean people have made such a significant contribution.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s important to celebrate this moment \u2013 which doesn\u2019t make us blind to the tragedy of people waiting to be acknowledged after being here for 50 years,\u201d says Lesley Ewen, a playwright, actor and tutor at Rada. Her father, Sydney Mowatt, passenger No 791, became a research scientist with the Wellcome Foundation before returning to Jamaica. \u201cIt needs to be celebrated. They had epic courage.\u201d Gloria Brothwood adds: \u201cThey were the first step on the ladder, in terms of changing minds, showing people that everyone has something to offer, that difference is nothing to be scared of.\u201d Design by the Guardian editorial design team: Chris Clarke, Harry Fischer, Ellen Wishart, Alessia Amitrano, Tara Herman"}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db504", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/21/berkeley-interest-rate-fears-sales-homes-housebuilder-profit", "primaryCategory": "business", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Berkeley says interest rate fears hitting sales despite buyer interest in its homes", "lead": "Housebuilder reports jump in annual pretax profit but says current trading suggests 20% fall in sales this year", "author": "Julia Kollewe and Joanna Partridge", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 13:57:36", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.988869", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/26aa44d27eb483f0fe19ce97d9851a085d8fc3fd/0_135_3824_2294/500.jpg", "body": "The boss of Berkeley Group has said the property market will remain \u201cchoppy\u201d until interest rates settle, as the housebuilder forecast a 20% drop in sales this year. Mortgage rates have soared in recent weeks, as the Bank of England\u2019s attempts to reduce stubbornly high inflation have fed through into lending deals, pushing the average interest on a two-year fixed loan above 6%. UK inflation unexpectedly remained at an annual rate of 8.7% in May, adding to the pressure on the Bank to increase the cost of borrowing further at its meeting on Thursday. Another interest rate hike of at least a quarter of a point, to 4.75%, seems all but certain, with the odds of a half-point increase rising. Rob Perrins, Berkeley\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cThe [housing] outlook is going to be choppy for a while until interest rates settle, which brings confidence back into the market.\u201d He said housebuyers needed certainty on how high rates will go. Financial markets are now betting that the Bank base rate will peak at 6% early next year. Berkeley\u2019s share price fell 2%, as investors were surprised by the inflation figures and sold off shares in housebuilders. Shares in rivals Barratt, Persimmon and Taylor Wimpey also fell by more than 2%, amid concerns in the housing sector about rising mortgage rates. Data from the Office for National Statistics on Wednesday also showed house price rises slowed to an annual rate of 3.5% in April, down from 4.1% in March. It was a different picture in the rental market, where tenants were hit by the fastest increase in rents in at least seven years. Private rental prices increased by 5% in the 12 months to May, the biggest rise since the series began in 2016. Berkeley \u2013 which operates across London, southern England and Birmingham \u2013 reported a 9.5% rise in pretax profit to \u00a3604m in the year to 30 April, but said trading so far suggested sales would be about 20% lower in the current year. The company said it was still seeing \u201cgood levels of inquiry for well-located homes\u201d but added that the housing market was \u201clikely to lack urgency\u201d until consumers had a better idea of how mortgage rates would change over the coming months. Those buying were either existing homeowners who wanted to move, or investors with available funds. Berkeley flagged \u201csigns of some financial distress\u201d in its supply chain, as contractors such as cladding firms and bricklayers continued to grapple with the tail of the impacts from Brexit, the Covid pandemic and the war in Ukraine on top of the current economic backdrop. Of the housebuilder\u2019s 150 subcontractors, 20 have gone into receivership, as the market tightened. Berkeley said it had tried to help by paying them weekly. The housebuilder said interested buyers tended to favour housing developments that were closer to being finished, rather than projects two to four years away from completion. It said its forward sales were worth \u00a32.1bn but the value of those reservations was 15% lower than in the previous year. Berkeley \u2013 which specialises in redeveloping brownfield land such as the Oval Village project in Lambeth, bringing together four derelict gasholders and an adjacent supermarket and warehouse in south London \u2013 said it would continue to invest in its existing regeneration sites. However, Perrins cautioned over new investment. The builder said that with a complex and slow planning system, high building costs, increased regulation, higher corporation tax and the proposed new building safety levy, the supply of new homes in London and the south-east would continue to fall."}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db505", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jun/21/werther-review-royal-opera-house-benoit-jacquot-pappano-massenet-kaufmann", "primaryCategory": "culture", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Werther review \u2013 Kaufmann heads strong cast in stylishly sung and fabulously played revival", "lead": "This revival of Beno\u00eet Jacquot\u2019s 2004 staging of Massenet\u2019s tragedy sees Antonio Pappano and his orchestra on top form.

In Werther his players are indeed busy, tirelessly painting the scene under the vocal lines in music of golden-age Hollywood lushness: Massenet was not of the opinion that less is more. Beno\u00eet Jacquot\u2019s production is nearly 20 years old, but in its first act you might think you\u2019d gone back 80. Lit in sunset tones by Charles Edwards, it is a comfortable, big-scale, traditional staging that occasionally sparks to life dramatically but exists mainly as a vehicle for a star tenor \u2013 this time, Jonas Kaufmann. Not that the title character is much of a hero: Massenet\u2019s truncated treatment of Goethe\u2019s story sounds gorgeous but doesn\u2019t initially draw sympathy to the title character. In just a few seconds at the very end of Act 1, when Jacquot brings Werther in front of the plain black curtain, we finally see the point of him as a figure: on his own he can be the heroically doomed artist, one man against the world. For the rest of the time, back in the picture-postcard realism of Jacquot\u2019s production, he just seems petulant: an entitled child pounding the floor with his fists at the unfairness of it all. Directed for this revival by Genevi\u00e8ve Dufour, the cast is strong, with Sarah Gilford as a sweet-sounding Sophie and Gordon Bintner a solid Albert, smug in his fancy claret-coloured frock coat. There are two star performances. One is supplied by the orchestra, the other by Aigul Akhmetshina, singing in a rich and mettlesome mezzo-soprano that cuts through whatever the orchestra throws at it. Her Charlotte, contained yet impassioned, emerges as the opera\u2019s most interesting, fully rounded character. That might not have been the case had her Werther been on form. Kaufmann seemed to be suffering with a cold; by the second act he was giving the occasional cough, as if in explanation for the fact that his voice wasn\u2019t opening out as it might. It was still a stylishly sung performance and he kept something in the tank for his Act 3 aria, but otherwise we were left to imagine how affecting his Werther would have been at full strength. \u2022 At Royal Opera House, London, until 4 July."}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db506", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/21/jp-morgan-report-jeffrey-epstein-apparent-contact-peter-mandelson", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Bank report details Peter Mandelson\u2019s apparent contact with Jeffrey Epstein", "lead": "JP Morgan report from 2019 found Epstein seemed to keep \u2018particularly close relationship\u2019 with Labour peer", "author": "Rowena Mason Whitehall editor", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 13:51:00", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.988906", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/2e2a865685a8924d9ddc1ed5126da6fd158dcb12/0_19_5616_3370/500.jpg", "body": "Court documents have shed light on the Labour former business secretary Peter Mandelson\u2019s apparent contact with the disgraced businessman Jeffrey Epstein after the financier was convicted of procuring an underaged girl for prostitution. The document is a 2019 internal report on Epstein by JP Morgan bank, which had a 15-year relationship with the financier, and was filed to a New York court this week. It found that Epstein appeared to \u201cmaintain a particularly close relationship with Prince Andrew the Duke of York and Lord Peter Mandelson, a senior member of the British government\u201d. In 2008, Epstein was given an 18-month sentence after pleading guilty to procuring an underaged girl. He served time at the private wing of the Palm Beach county stockade in Florida before being released on probation on 22 July 2009. The JP Morgan report reveals that Epstein wrote to his private banker, Jes Staley, on 17 June 2009 in relation to Mandelson to say: \u201cPeter will be staying at 71st over weekend, do you want to organize either you, or you and Jamie,, quiertly [sic],, up to you.\u201d At the time, Lord Mandelson was business secretary in the government of Gordon Brown. It also refers to an email from Mandelson, when he was still business secretary in March 2010, to Epstein saying: \u201cCan Jes send me email on issues re Dodds/Volcker\u201d. The request appears to relate to US regulations in the wake of the financial crisis. The report also refers to two occasions on which Epstein said he was with \u201cPetie\u201d, which the bank interprets as a reference to Mandelson, in November 2010 and January 2011. Mandelson was out of the government by this point. The Guardian has contacted Mandelson and a lawyer for the Duke of York for comment on the report. A spokesperson for the Labour peer said: \u201cLord Mandelson very much regrets ever having been introduced to Epstein. This connection has been a matter of public record for some time. He never had any kind of professional or business relationship with Epstein in any form.\u201d It is understood Mandelson has no recollection or record of staying in Epstein\u2019s house in New York in 2009. Mandelson appears to have been introduced to Epstein by Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of the tycoon Robert Maxwell. She is serving 20 years in prison in the US for assisting Epstein in sex trafficking underage girls. The report also raises questions about Prince Andrew\u2019s claim to have cut ties with Epstein in December 2010. The royal\u2019s friendship with Epstein has been criticised, particularly after he stayed with Epstein during a December 2010 visit to New York, which the Duke of York has said was to tell him that they could no longer be in contact. However, the JP Morgan report states that in February 2011, two months after the Central Park meeting, Epstein wrote to Staley: \u201cAndrew asked for your London schedule.\u201d Last year, the Duke of York settled a sexual assault case filed against him by Virginia Giuffre for an undisclosed sum, but with no admission of liability. Giuffre was introduced to him through Epstein and Maxwell. In 2019, federal prosecutors charged Epstein with sex trafficking a minor and conspiracy to commit sex trafficking. Epstein denied the charges and was refused bail. He died months later in custody in an apparent suicide. The JP Morgan report was commissioned to examine the extent of the bank\u2019s relations with Epstein, which continued until 2013. Mandelson has given informal advice to the current Labour leadership. A spokesperson for the party said: \u201cThere are a whole range of people that Keir Starmer talks to. Obviously he talks to people who were part of the last Labour government, including Peter Mandelson.\u201d They added: \u201cPeter Mandelson will be putting out a statement and we\u2019ll look and see what he says.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db507", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/jun/21/virgil-quote-found-on-fragment-of-roman-jar-unearthed-in-spain", "primaryCategory": "science", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Virgil quote found on fragment of Roman jar unearthed in Spain", "lead": "Excerpt from the Georgics was carved into vessel used for olive oil 1,800 years ago", "author": "Sam Jones in Madrid", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 13:48:39", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.988925", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/700f24b22a7d9729e2cc527b466483ea9d3fd91c/0_9_633_380/500.jpg", "body": "A tiny fragment of a Roman jar that once held olive oil, produced in what is now southern Spain, has left archaeologists delighted, puzzled and \u201csaucer-eyed\u201d after they deciphered a quote from the ancient poet Virgil that was cut into its clay by an unknown but erudite hand 1,800 years ago. The highly unusual find, thought to be the first time a literary quotation has been discovered on a Roman amphora, was turned up by researchers from the universities of C\u00f3rdoba, Seville and Montpellier who were excavating a site in the town of Hornachuelos, in Andaluc\u00eda\u2019s C\u00f3rdoba province, seven years ago. While the ceramic vessels were routinely engraved with information relating to producers, quantities and taxes, the 6cm by 8cm shard appeared to contain an unusual amount of text. \u201cWe thought it might be something quite exceptional because you hardly ever get more than a line or two of engravings on an amphora,\u201d said Iv\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez Tobar, an archeologist on the project, which was funded by the Labex Archim\u00e8de research institute in Montpellier, France, part of Paul Val\u00e9ry University. \u201cThis one had four or five lines. While we didn\u2019t understand it, we thought it was quite special.\u201d Subsequent examinations by Latin experts determined that the fragment bore a quote from Virgil, best known as the author of the epic Latin poem the Aeneid. \u201cTo be honest, it took a while because there were some spelling mistakes that held us back from seeing what it was straight away,\u201d said Gonz\u00e1lez Tobar, who is now an archaeologist at the University of Barcelona. \u201cBut we did eventually get there.\u201d One of his colleagues, Ant\u00f2nia Soler i Nicolau, thought she recognised the quote \u2013 and indeed she did. It turned out to be from the first section of Virgil\u2019s second major work, the Georgics: \u201c[Earth] once changed the/Chaonian acorn for the plump wheat-ear/And mingled with the grape [your newfound gift].\u201d As far as Gonz\u00e1lez Tobar and his colleagues are aware, the fragment is the first time that a line from literature has turned up on a clay vessel. \u201cThere are quite a lot of bricks that have been found with texts from Virgil on them because we think they\u2019d been used for teaching before being used for building,\u201d said Gonz\u00e1lez Tobar. \u201cBut nothing\u2019s been found on amphorae.\u201d Given the fragment was found in a rural area where much of the olive oil sent to Rome was produced and bottled, the team thinks Virgil\u2019s agriculturally themed Georgics may have struck the engraver as more fitting that the heroics of the Aeneid. The researchers\u2019 key theory, as published in the Journal of Roman Archeology, is that the verses, written on the lower part of the amphora, were never really intended to be seen. They believe the author may have been a skilled labourer or perhaps even a child worker at the factory where the amphora was manufactured.

She\u2019s there and then she isn\u2019t in this short film, traversing past and present in the late winter sunshine, wringing her hands, catching her breath. As she moves out of sight, distant traffic glints brightly at the far end of the row. Later, in two series of photographs, we see her \u2013 always from behind in the same long black gown \u2013 in the ruins of ancient Rome and also among Mussolini\u2019s fascist architecture. And here she is again, outside the Louvre in Paris and Frank Gehry\u2019s Guggenheim Bilbao, then in Philadelphia, Dresden and Boston. The figure in the long black gown is Weems playing the role of her own alter ego, her personal muse. She\u2019s an African American witness at large in the world. For all that, Weems is hard to pin down \u2013 and the Barbican\u2019s Reflections for Now show traces the complexities of her development. Weems, who trained as a dancer before embarking on photography and art, often appears as a protagonist in her work. Now 70, she takes photographs, constructs installations and makes films. She also writes \u2013 and her words are a constant presence in this, the largest UK show of her work since the 1980s. Her art is rich and full of variety, without wavering from her focus on the Black American experience. In her best-known series of staged photographs, all set at a small table in a kitchen, people congregate under a cone of light, and we\u2019re positioned at the far end of the table. At the other end, a man reads the paper, while Weems sits and smokes to one side, or hovers in the shadows by the wall, and in another shot leans over him, fussing for his attention. There they are again, him sucking on lobster shell, her sitting over her own unpicked dinner. The claws on her plate still wear their rubber bands; in one hand she holds a cigarette, the other strokes his head. She\u2019s not getting his attention. Now she\u2019s with girlfriends, or doing homework with a daughter, or sitting pensive, alone with a bottle of wine. There are scenes of tenderness and complicity here, of raucousness and a palpable loneliness. The staged black and white images in Kitchen Table series 1990, with their calibrated ordinariness and attention to small details, are filled with understated tension and drama, playing out the dynamics of domestic life. The images examine gender and generational divides, intimacy and individuality, togetherness and separation. They are also annotated by lengthy captions that flesh out a woman\u2019s inner life. Although great in their own way, I\u2019m not sure the photographs need these inner monologues beside them. Maybe in a book, the juxtaposition of words and images would work better than on the wall, where we must shuttle back and forth between image and text. Sometimes it is better when things are left to speak for themselves. There is also a lot of sound leakage between the upper and lower floors of the gallery, where two film works are shown. The noise of tap-dancing, and snatches of the recorded, hysterical voice of the white woman who called the cops from Central Park to say she was being attacked by a black man, who was in fact a birdwatcher asking her if she\u2019d mind putting her dog on a lead, drift up from below. Later, we hear Jimmy \u201cThe Schnozzle\u201d Durante, singing the schmaltzy 1960 showtune Make Someone Happy. This all comes from The Shape of Things, a 2021 film projected on a wide, curved screen, like a 19th-century cyclorama. This ambitious work in seven parts splices old footage of circus performers and slapstick hijinks with pro-Trump rallies and the 6 January insurrectionists storming the Washington Capitol; fragments of earlier works by Weems jostle with face-masked crowds on the street during the pandemic. Black Lives Matter protesters, police violence, and lengthy choreographed sections in which not much happens jostle together in this panoramic, complicated 40-minute work. The Shape of Things attempts to get to the heart of a country whose black and brown citizens \u201care always stopped, charged and convicted\u201d, and where we must \u201cimagine the worst of the worst and that it is always happening\u201d. The Shape of Things is many things: angry, eloquent, sorrowful, compelling, didactic and portentous. The long, choreographed sections don\u2019t entirely work. With its stock footage, clowns, a performing elephant, spotlit people posed theatrically in indoor rain and, of course, Jimmy Durante, the tone is constantly shifting. After the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, in 2020, Weems returned to Portland, Oregon, the town of her birth and photographed sections of boarded-up buildings, where the layers of graffiti had been repeatedly painted over, in whatever colours were to hand, as if to muzzle the voice of the protesters. Weems\u2019 carefully cropped and lit images of these distressed planes of chipboard and ply resemble nothing so much as painted abstractions. No words remain, but they are redolent reminders of recent violence, of muted voices and censored slogans, and, surprisingly, of the works of the mostly overlooked black American painters who had been associated with the New York school and abstract expressionism during the 1950s. Past and present collide in these large colour photographs and Weems makes us aware of the uncanny double-take. Here, for once, less is more and the rich subtexts are implicit. For all that is staged in her works, they\u2019re a great reminder of the importance of simply paying attention and noticing things. \u2022 This article was amended on 21 June 2023. George Floyd was killed in Minneapolis, Minnesota not Portland, Oregon as an earlier version said.

The Davis school district, north of Salt Lake City, voted unanimously on Tuesday night to accept a recommendation by a subcommittee of three of its members to reinstate the book to middle and elementary school shelves. \u201cThe appeal committee determined that the Bible has significant, serious value for minors which outweighs the violent or vulgar content it contains,\u201d the district said in a statement seemingly critical of the parent majority that recommended the ban. \u201cThe committee-based process \u2026 allows for appeals to be considered when a committee\u2019s decision seems to be at odds with community values. The process takes time and it isn\u2019t perfect, but it is working.\u201d The district is still considering a separate complaint seeking the removal of the Book of Mormon, the foundational text of the Utah-based Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The wrangling over the Bible placed Davis county in the middle of a national debate over removals of books from public schools, a push driven by conservatives targeting material that contains references to gender identity or sexuality. Utah passed a law last year allowing parents to request the removal of books containing \u201cpornographic or indecent material\u201d. In December one parent complained that the King James Bible was \u201cone of the most sex-ridden books around\u201d. The original panel concluded that it did not violate the Utah statute known as the bright line law, but was age inappropriate for all but high school libraries. \u201cWithin days of the announcement of this determination, the district received several appeal requests and immediately began processing appeals,\u201d the Davis school district statement said. \u201cSome in the community have intimated that the initial committee\u2019s decision, or the district\u2019s policy/process, have been intentionally manipulated to undermine Utah\u2019s sensitive materials law. This is wholly untrue. The district has always acted with intent to uphold the law and maintain school libraries free from harmful material.\u201d The district says it has reviewed 60 books to date, with 37 removed from all school libraries due to bright line rule violations and 14 restricted at some grade levels \u201cdue to age appropriateness\u201d. The statement did not address the complaint over the Book of Mormon, which Joseph Smith, the church founder who published it in 1830, claimed was translated from inscriptions of prophets on golden plates. The request to remove the book, which church members typically study alongside the Bible, referenced violence including battles, beheadings and kidnappings. A backlash against school book-banning efforts is under way in other states. The Lake county school district in Florida, and the state\u2019s board of education, were sued on Tuesday by a group of students and the authors of a children\u2019s book about a penguin family with two fathers, the Orlando Sentinel reported. According to the lawsuit, the decision to remove And Tango Makes Three, based on the true story of two male penguins hatching a chick at New York\u2019s Central Park zoo, is unconstitutional, with Lake county having \u201cno legitimate pedagogical reason for its decision\u201d. The book fell foul of the Republican Florida governor Ron DeSantis\u2019s so-called \u201cdon\u2019t say gay\u201d law, that bans classroom discussion of gender identity or sexual orientation in any of the state\u2019s classrooms through 12th grade."}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db50a", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/21/orca-rams-yacht-off-shetland-first-such-incident-northern-waters", "primaryCategory": "environment", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Orca rams into yacht off Shetland in first such incident in northern waters", "lead": "Cetacean exhibits same behaviour towards vessel in North Sea that has been seen in Iberian orca population", "author": "Philip Hoare and Jeroen Hoekendijk", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 13:27:45", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.988978", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/200f4e2bb0b1c109698da48bccd73a273410292a/275_0_4140_2484/500.jpg", "body": "An orca repeatedly rammed a yacht in the North Sea off Shetland on Monday, in a concerning development following previous interactions between the cetaceans and vessels in the strait of Gibraltar and Portugal. Dr Wim Rutten, a 72-year-old retired Dutch physicist and experienced yachtsperson, was sailing solo from Lerwick to Bergen in Norway. He was fishing for mackerel, with a single line off the back of the boat, when the orca suddenly appeared in the clear water, and hit the stern of the seven-ton boat. \u201cI said: \u2018Shit!\u2019\u201d Rutten, who said he had heard about the \u201cPortuguese accidents\u201d, told the Guardian. The whale hit again and again, creating \u201csoft shocks\u201d through the aluminium hull. \u201cWhat I felt [was] most frightening was the very loud breathing of the animal,\u201d he said. The orca stayed behind the boat \u201clooking for the keel. Then he disappeared ... but came back at fast speed, twice or thrice ... and circled a bit. \u201cMaybe he just wanted to play. Or look me in the eyes. Or to get rid of the fishing line.\u201d This is the same behaviour that has been seen in the Iberian orca population, but it is the first time it has been known to happen in northern waters. Highly social cetaceans, orcas use complex vocalisations to communicate and to hunt for food, from small fish to blue whales. They learn matrilineally, and post-menopausal females assume the greatest importance in individual pods. \u201cGrandmothers\u201d in the Iberian population of whales have been seen observing during the interactions with yachts and other vessels. Experts believe this could be play among juvenile whales. Dr Alfredo L\u00f3pez, of the Grupo de Trabajo Orca Atl\u00e1ntica in Portugal, said: \u201cWe know that many boats use fishing lines from the stern to fish and it is a motivation for orcas, they come to examine them.\u201d But the focus on boats\u2019 rudders may come from adult whales who have developed an aversion towards boats, perhaps because they \u201chad a bad experience and try to stop the boat so as not to repeat it\u201d. Most surprising is the fact that this learned behaviour should have appeared nearly 3,000 miles (4,800km) from Gibraltar. Dr Conor Ryan, a scientific adviser to the Hebridean Whale and Dolphin Trust, who has studied orca pods off the Scottish coast, said: \u201cI\u2019d be reluctant to say it cannot be learned from [the southern population]. It\u2019s possible that this \u2018fad\u2019 is leapfrogging through the various pods/communities.\u201d Ryan suggests there may be \u201chighly mobile pods that could transmit this behaviour a long distance\u201d. L\u00f3pez thinks, however, \u201cthat human activities, even in an indirect way, are at the origin of this behaviour\u201d. Increased marine traffic, dwindling food sources, warming seas and noise pollution could all play a part. Rutten added: \u201cMaybe the universe knows. We do not.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db50b", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/21/body-found-in-river-in-search-for-missing-harrogate-woman-sophie-lambert", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Body found in river in search for missing Harrogate woman", "lead": "Sophie Lambert went missing last Friday and personal possessions were found the next day", "author": "Mark Brown North of England correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 13:24:08", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.988999", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/2431e036c7cc0da4e102769256d7e671c9bd897c/0_939_5483_3290/500.jpg", "body": "Police searching for a missing 22-year-old woman have found a body in a river.

He arrived from Bayer Leverkusen for an initial club record fee of \u00a372m in August 2020 and with the reputation of being one of the most exciting young talents in Europe. There were flashes of his talents at Chelsea but, in general, he underwhelmed, in large part from being deployed as a central striker, which is not his preferred position.

The latest blockbuster report on the tangled subject of supreme court ethics came, again, from ProPublica. The non-profit newsroom has already detailed the close relationship between another hardline justice, Clarence Thomas, and the conservative billionaire Harlan Crow. Supreme court justices are subject to the same ethics rules as other federal judges but effectively govern themselves. The chief justice, John Roberts, has resisted calls to testify in Congress about the Thomas-Crow affair. On Tuesday, Alito published a \u201cprebuttal\u201d to the new ProPublica report, using a Wall Street Journal column to say the piece was coming and to deny wrongdoing. Alito said justices \u201ccommonly interpreted\u201d ethics laws \u201cto mean that accommodations and transportation for social events were not reportable gifts\u201d. The seat on Singer\u2019s plane, the justice wrote, \u201cwould have otherwise been vacant\u201d. Virginia Canter, a former government ethics lawyer now with Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said a private plane trip was not an acceptable gift. \u201cThe exception only covers food, lodging and entertainment,\u201d Canter told ProPublica. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to move away from the plain language of the statute and the regulation.\u201d Alito said the fishing lodge in Alaska was \u201ccomfortable but rustic\u201d, serving \u201chomestyle fare\u201d. ProPublica said \u201cchefs served multi-course meals of Alaskan king crab legs or Kobe filet [steak]. On the last evening, a member of Alito\u2019s group bragged that the wine they were drinking cost $1,000 a bottle,\u201d according to a fishing guide. Alito said: \u201cI cannot recall whether the group at the lodge \u2026 was served wine, but if there was wine it was certainly not wine that costs $1,000.\u201d ProPublica detailed how Singer took Alito to Alaska in summer 2008, while engaged in a high-stakes case between his hedge fund and the government of Argentina. The case eventually reached the supreme court, Alito joining a 7-1 decision against Argentina. Singer denied wrongdoing or discussing business with Alito. Alito said he had never been aware of connections between Singer\u2019s businesses and cases before him. Abbe Smith, a Georgetown law professor, told ProPublica Alito should have recused himself because of the gift from Singer. If she were representing a client in such a case and \u201cfound out [about the gift] after the fact\u201d, Smith said, \u201cI\u2019d be outraged on behalf of my client. And, frankly, I\u2019d be outraged on behalf of the legal system.\u201d The rightwing activist Leonard Leo, who has done much to shape conservative dominance of federal courts including the supreme court, and who recently received $1.6bn to further his work, accompanied Alito and Singer to Alaska. Leo told ProPublica: \u201cNo objective and well-informed observer of the judiciary honestly could believe that they decide cases in order to cull favour with friends, or in return for a free plane seat or fishing trip.\u201d Kyle Herrig, president of the watchdog Accountable.US, said: \u201cAs the supreme court corruption crisis grows with yet another apparent violation of the court\u2019s bare minimum ethics code, it\u2019s no surprise that Leonard Leo is right in the middle. He\u2019s the corrupting influence responsible for the rot. \u201cAs long as Chief Justice Roberts continues to dodge responsibility \u2026 public trust in our court will continue to plummet. We need reform now.\u201d Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat and Senate judiciary committee member who has sought to highlight donors\u2019 influence on the court, responded to Alito\u2019s Wall Street Journal column with incredulity \u2013 and questions. \u201cFirst,\u201d the senator wrote, \u201cwho orchestrated this weird prebuttal \u2026 and did Alito get help from a PR firm? If so, who paid? \u201cSecond, why dwell on the term \u2018facility\u2019 [as Alito called Singer\u2019s plane] but not mention that the \u2018personal hospitality\u2019 reporting exemption is specifically limited to \u2018food, lodging and entertainment\u2019? Failing to mention that other part of the rule wouldn\u2019t fly in most courts. \u201cThird, why not ask the financial disclosure committee of the Judicial Conference, the body set up exactly for that purpose, for its advice on what should be disclosed? That\u2019s why it\u2019s there. \u201cAnd what, he just happened to be flying to Alaska and there just happened to be a private jet going to Alaska with an empty seat, and he just happened to find that out, like on some weird billionaire shared-ride Uber? \u201cOh, and would that \u2018empty seat\u2019 trick fly with legislative or executive ethics disclosures? (Hint: no.) And how about with the financial disclosure committee? (Right, you didn\u2019t ask.) \u201cThis just keeps getting worse.\u201d ProPublica also reported an earlier Alaska trip taken by another rightwing justice, Antonin Scalia, with Robin Arkley II, the businessman who then owned the fishing lodge and who ProPublica said \u201cdoes not appear to have been involved in any cases before the court\u201d.

There is a de facto ban on referring to him in the media, meaning we are no longer allowed to mention his name or show his picture. Pakistani TV channels are not allowed to interview him or air his statements. This is the result of a series of directives issued by the media regulator. As prime minister, Imran Khan tried to turn Pakistan from a struggling democracy into an autocracy. His successor, Shehbaz Sharif, appears to be following in his footsteps. Once upon a time I was one of Khan\u2019s favourite journalists (despite the fact that I advised him in 1995 not to go into politics). When I was banned from broadcasting my talkshow in 2007 by the Musharraf regime, Khan stood by me. He used to participate in my roadside shows and aggressively criticised the anti-media policies of a military dictator. When I survived an assassination attempt in 2014, Khan told the media: \u201cHamid Mir is my favourite TV anchor.\u201d Then, in 2018, he became prime minister. The next year, an interview I had conducted with former president Asif Ali Zardari was pulled from the air. The media regulator under Khan\u2019s watch also banned former prime minister Nawaz Sharif\u2019s speeches from being aired on Pakistani media. I criticised him when his government allowed the trial of civilians in military courts under the Pakistan Army Act. In 2021, a blanket ban was imposed on me (again) in electronic and print media after I gave a speech against the attacks on our colleagues. There was no written order against me from any court or from the media regulator, but I remained banned in Pakistan from May 2021 to March 2022. I blamed the military establishment for that ban. Khan remained silent on my disappearance from the media. Now Imran Khan is out of the government. I am back on the TV screens, and Khan is missing from the media. I want to speak about his mistakes, but I cannot do so without mentioning his name and using video clips. Owners of some prominent TV channels and newspapers were reportedly told by the military authorities recently that enough is enough. Khan has been declared an \u201cirresponsible\u201d politician and an \u201cenemy\u201d of the army after the 9 May riots that followed his arrest earlier this year. They don\u2019t want to see his name or picture in the media. They don\u2019t want to see any dissenting voices in the media criticising the military courts. The national assembly of Pakistan passed a resolution on 12 June demanding speedy action against 9 May rioters under the army act; Shehbaz Sharif had already declared Khan to be the \u201cmastermind\u201d behind the violence. Khan says he has no doubt that he will be tried in a military court and jailed. His problem is that he overestimated his popularity, blindly confronting the most powerful institution in the country. He failed to organise peaceful rallies. His violent supporters actually undermined their leader on 9 May. The attitude of an angry, fast bowler was good on the cricket ground but the same attitude in the field of politics pushed him towards a disaster. It is Khan v the army, and it\u2019s clearly the latter that is winning. History repeats itself quickly in Pakistan, with variations, but my principles must stay the same. I cannot support the censorship of Imran Khan because I opposed the same censorship of Nawaz Sharif when Khan was in power. I can never endorse the disappearance of journalists perceived as being pro-Khan, such as Imran Riaz, because I was also banned when Khan was in power. I cannot remain silent on a crackdown by the current regime against the critical voices because I was also a victim of the same crackdown in 2020. Imran Khan may be arrested again soon. The regime wants to remove him from electoral politics but cannot rid his name from Pakistan\u2019s discourse, as if he never existed. I think they are not fighting against Khan, they are actually fighting against the very idea of a democratic Pakistan. It\u2019s time for all Pakistani rulers to quit their censorship habit.

The external adviser will work in the heart of a Labour government, creating an action plan with Angela Rayner in the Cabinet Office to remove barriers, and also with the Electoral Commission. Rayner, who will announce the plans later on Wednesday, is understood to be committed to boosting representation across parties in order to ensure politicians are no longer removed from, or unable to personally understand, the impact of the policies they enact. The deputy Labour leader said: \u201cRepresentation shapes which issues get debated in the first place and what is up for decision. You might learn by asking or listening, but the lived experience adds a different quality \u2013 and gives a different perspective. Lived experience brings its own expertise.\u201d Labour says the tsar\u2019s work will not be focused solely on boosting representation within its own party as insiders say its candidate mentoring schemes such as the Bernie Grant leadership and the Jo Cox women in leadership programmes are already addressing its representation shortcomings. Instead the adviser will launch recommendations based on removing barriers blocking many hoping to stand for office from underrepresented groups. Samuel Kasumu, a former Conservative London mayoral hopeful, said he had been blocked from the longlist because he was \u201can outsider\u201d. He claimed Tory officials who were making the decision had said: \u201cYou don\u2019t sound like a politician,\u201d with others adding: \u201cYou haven\u2019t attended enough dinners.\u201d He told the BBC: \u201cSo all the indication was that the reason why they didn\u2019t want me in the room was because I represented something that perhaps they were slightly uncomfortable with.\u201d Labour members have raised concerns the party has sidelined many voices who have lived experience of dealing with anti-black racism, Islamophobia, misogyny and classism because they are considered to be on the left of the party. The deputy Labour leader has been praised by many within the party as being one of the few, authentic voices campaigning for marginalised voices. Rayner, the first woman to represent the constituency of Ashton-under-Lyne in its 180-year history, will discuss on Wednesday what a general election means for women alongside Australia\u2019s former prime minister Julia Gillard, now chair of the global institute for women\u2019s leadership at King\u2019s College London. They will share their experiences as women at the highest level of politics and discuss why representation matters. Rayner said: \u201cThere\u2019s more than a hint of snobbery in the argument that more authenticity and more diversity in politics is a recipe for disaster. The past decade will tell you that the playing fields of Eton education are no guarantee of good government. \u201cOur politics has never been so out of touch. Tackling the representation gap in gender, but also in class and ethnicity is an important step in building a politics that better reflects today\u2019s Britain. It\u2019s a personal priority for me. \u201cI am no stranger to misogyny but the messages I\u2019ve received from women have brought home how widespread experiences like mine are, not only in Westminster but across the political world, and also in workplaces across the country. It would break my heart if other women like me were put off from aspiring to participate in public life. We need more people with backgrounds like mine in politics.\u201d According to recent figures, Britain ranks 20th out of 38 OECD countries in terms of female representation in parliament. Labour is understood to be open to following the recommendation of legislating a \u201cright to run\u201d that makes sure employers allow people to take time off work to run for office, in a model similar to jury service. Gillard said: \u201cIt is easy in power structures that have been historically run by men, including politics, for an old boys\u2019 network to be the default, and for such networks to unconsciously favour the promotion of men who look and sound like they fit. For women at the forefront of change in politics, like Angela Rayner, all this means there are extra barriers which involve both gender and perceptions of class. For women of colour, the barriers are heightened.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db510", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/21/moments-that-decided-first-ashes-cricket-test-england-australia", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Flukes, fingers and fumbles: moments that decided first Ashes Test", "lead": "From dropped catches to blisters, we pick out eight moments that swung the first Ashes Test in favour of Australia", "author": "Simon Burnton and Paul Bellsham", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 12:47:34", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.989094", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/a8dafd809825e8a4e202ca5b14b1bfab012d83fe/0_104_5318_3192/500.jpg", "body": "Brook\u2019s bemusement Harry Brook had scored 32 runs at almost a run a ball and looked in sublime touch when a Nathan Lyon delivery somehow hit a thigh pad, bounced high over his shoulder, landed on the back of his leg and deflected into the stumps. A complete fluke. Stokes declares after Root hits form England were 393 for 8 in their first innings, with Joe Root purring on 118 and Ollie Robinson batting with real poise and control at the other end, when Ben Stokes called them in. They could have batted for six more overs that day but instead they chose to bowl four at Australia - Stokes called this their \u201cchance to pounce\u201d. They achieved little in that time, and a few extra runs would have been handy in the end. The fumbles Australia\u2019s first innings in particular was punctuated by missed chances behind the stumps. Cameron Green could have been stumped by Jonny Bairstow for a second-ball duck and scored 38; Alex Carey was dropped twice and scored 66. In the second innings Usman Khawaja edged to Bairstow\u2019s left in the first over. The keeper didn\u2019t move and Khawaja went on to score 65. The mis-steps There have been 17 years, and 214 Test matches, since England last bowled as many as 23 no-balls in a game. Almost 11 years have passed since Australia last benefited from so many. In the last decade England have, on average, bowled just over three per Test; at Edgbaston Stuart Broad alone bowled 11. Australia, meanwhile, bowled only four, and in total gave away 19 extras to England\u2019s 44. The weather Across five days of largely benign conditions for batting there was one, wild 20-minute period when the ground was blanketed in thick, dark cloud and the ball zipped and zinged. It was England\u2019s misfortune that it happened towards the start of their second innings, which contributed to them losing both their openers. The spinner\u2019s finger Moeen Ali replaced the injured Jack Leach in the side, but two years after his last first-class game he was not used to bowling for long periods with the pronounced seam of the Dukes ball. He wore a hole in his spinning finger, affecting his bowling, and in the end Joe Root did most of the spin bowling on the final day. Cummins goes big Pat Cummins was on eight, Nathan Lyon on two, and Australia still 51 runs away from victory. Joe Root had bowled 14 overs for just 29 runs, but the second new ball was due and England had to decide: give Root one more over, or let rip with the seamers? They went with option one, and Cummins creamed two sixes to kick-start the match-winning partnership. The drop Just two balls into the following over Nathan Lyon pulled a Stuart Broad short ball towards Ben Stokes at square leg. Australia still needed 36. The England captain backpedalled, leapt, stretched, caught it - and then uncaught it again. It was the last clear wicket-taking chance, and Lyon and Pat Cummins went on to guide Australia to victory."}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db511", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/21/wimbledon-introduce-ai-powered-commentary-to-coverage-this-year", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Wimbledon to introduce AI-powered commentary to coverage this year", "lead": "All England Club teams up with IBM to offer AI-generated audio commentary and captions in online highlights clips", "author": "Dan Milmo and Alex Hern", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 12:43:00", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.989112", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/ea9de7424b6fb32dd897f2934206723e215f45f4/0_13_3573_2144/500.jpg", "body": "Game, set and chatbot: Wimbledon is introducing artificial intelligence-powered commentary to its coverage this year.

Three weeks ago they were underdogs heading to Adelaide to take on a star-studded NSW outfit. Tonight they arrived in Brisbane as favourites and played like champions. Defensively they were extraordinary. Their line defence was near flawless. One-on-one they were rarely beaten, and if they were a covering tackle was close at hand. In broken play they were first to every loose ball. And then in attack they were clinical. Chances were few and far between in South Australia, and again tonight the Maroons didn\u2019t hog the ball or dominate field position. But when they saw an opportunity they went for the jugular and in Munster and Cherry-Evans they had a halfback pairing that controlled the ball masterfully in dangerous situations, and outside them Walsh was the series game-breaker, entering the line, creating space and timing killer passes. After a second series defeat in succession it is hard to see Brad Fittler either wanting to stay on as NSW coach, or being invited to do so. On paper, the Blues should be the stronger of the two units, but over 160 minutes there was a desperate lack of wit and cutting edge in attack, while squad selections lacked the bravery and purpose of Billy Slater. Fittler can point to the injuries to Mitchell, Cleary, and Trbojevic as mitigating factors, but they cannot mask the inability to match Queensland for intensity. In three weeks from now they will at least have a shot at redemption on Sydney soil, a night that, perhaps, will kickstart their Origin 2024 campaign. I will be back here for that, and you\u2019re welcome to join me. Until then, I will leave you with Angus Fontaine\u2019s match report and Queensland\u2019s celebrations. Goodnight! The Queensland players are lapping it all up, some carrying their children, others in the stands with family members. These are the moments they will remember for ever. The big prop gets the nod on the night for a performance that set the tone for the Maroons, in defence and attack. Too quick, too strong, and too hungry for the Blues to handle. This is what dreams are made of. This is what you do in the backyard growing up as a little kid, imagining this moment, and for it to be a reality, it\u2019s very, very special. I think there\u2019ll be a few sickies tomorrow. Reece Walsh, who has cemented his status as the most exciting young fullback in the game, is bubbling with delight. Obviously, the crowd at home, up here winning at Suncorp, this is our back yard. This is our home. We come to represent our people. It was an awesome game. We wouldn\u2019t be here without the fans. A special group, awesome coach and, you know, we really got the job done there tonight. It\u2019s crazy. It\u2019s a brotherhood. You know, since day one we went into camp, and we all just gelled. The coaching staff are out of this world. Just amazed in this group, with these boys, we\u2019ve got a saying Ubuntu, it\u2019s all stick together and do it for each other, not for yourself. Queensland should be proud tonight. Daly Cherry-Evans, who was outstanding tonight, is first at the mic to share the moment with former Queensland captain Darren Lockyer. It\u2019s our ability to defend our try line this series that got us the results both games. We should be really proud of the way we\u2019ve defended. I think the scoreboard reflected tonight the sort of footy we can play. The final couple of minutes were unsavoury but that does not prevent Queensland celebrating a classic night of Origin footy at Suncorp Stadium. Queensland are State of Origin champions for 2023! 80 mins: In that same melee, Walsh and Luai aimed head-butts at each other, each receiving their marching orders for their troubles. So unnecessary. 80 mins: Tempers have frayed in the final seconds. Addo-Carr has thrown a punch at Walsh, who was head-to-head with Luai in an exchange of words, and he is rightly sent to the bin. Stupid act. 77 mins: Fa\u2019asuamaleaui interrupts Yeo\u2019s run, reverses the momentum, picks up the big Panther, dumps him on his backside, and dislodges the ball in the process. It\u2019s been that kind of night. That kind of series. 76 mins: This has been some series from the Maroons. They have absorbed so much NSW pressure across the two matches, but they have done so with such defensive skill, discipline, and grit. And they\u2019ve scored with practically every serious attack they\u2019ve mounted. Queensland are giving their supporters their money\u2019s worth. Instead of walking down the last ten minutes they\u2019re flinging the ball from right to left, conceding metres in the process to keep the ball alive. Of course, it doesn\u2019t matter, because on the last Munster hoists up a Garryowen that Cook is once again exactly the man NSW don\u2019t want to be under the ball. He initially marks but loses the ball mid-air in contact with teammate Addo-Carr. Nanai is first to the loose ball to send the score into the 30s. Holmes kicks another two to rub salt in the NSW wounds. 74 mins: Moses, who began the night promisingly, has seen his performance deteriorate, and it reaches a new low with an awful play-the-ball that only looks more embarrassing during a NSW captain\u2019s challenge. 73 mins: The crowd is 52,433 by the way. Most of them deliriously happy with what they\u2019ve seen. 72 mins: An overcooked Moses kick from range allows Queensland another opportunity to settle things down, milk the clock, and take the sting out of the game. The crowd break out into cries of \u201cQueenslander!\u201d. 71 mins: Queensland utilise their captain\u2019s challenge to see whether Tabuai-Fidow should have been penalised for a knock-on during the kick chase. It was a forlorn effort, but succeeded in allowing the Maroons to catch their breath and slow the game down. The value of that breather is shown immediately with Haas dumped unceremoniously deep in his own half. 68 mins: NSW earn a scrum from the restart, then earn a ruck penalty under the posts. Can the Blues mount a late fightback? No. Young drops the ball on the burst on tackle two. This series has been an attacking disaster for Brad Fittler. The short drop-out is claimed by Tabuai-Fidow. Soon afterwards Yeo concedes a penalty at the ruck but Queensland reject the kick for goal and instead invite their forwards to pound the NSW defensive line. For a while anyway, this is Queensland after all, and eventually they\u2019re going to want to score a try. The halves get the ball under the posts \u2013 and there\u2019s that move again \u2013 the delayed pass to Walsh, the incredible strength and ball skills of the young fulback to release Coates on the outside, and he flys like superman to touch the ball down one-handed in the corner. Simply magnificent. Holmes dots the i\u2019s by crossing the t from the touchline. 63 mins: NSW have the bit between their teeth now. Tedesco finds a step, Moses accepts contact, there\u2019s finally some urgency and invention \u2013 but still Queensland find a miracle! Collins again, showing his alertness to block the attempted grubber, then pounce on the loose ball and run it away from danger. Four tackles later, Munster dabs a perfectly weighted kick to force Cook into conceding a line drop-out. 60 mins: Now the Blues come! First they look to expand early in the set, finding space for To\u2019o on the right, then they hammer Walsh as he collects Moses\u2019 bomb before setting about a series of ball carriers, threatening to drag Coates into touch before he offloads smartly. It takes a barnstorming run from Collins to settle things down for the home side. But the respite doesn\u2019t last long when that man Collins is pinged for going high on Luai early in the NSW set. Well, well, well. After all that\u2019s happened tonight, Damien Cook might be the man to spark a comeback. It arrives following the first penetrating run of the night from a man in blue \u2013 Young bursting on to a slick short pass from Luai. Queensland scramble to bring the forward down, but Cook is on hand for the offload to dash under the posts like he\u2019s sniping from dummy-half \u2013 not playing 75 minutes as a left centre. Crichton kicks the easy two points. 57 mins: NSW spend four tackles doing nothing inside 10m before a pass goes astray to create some unintentional penetration in broken play. Moses finally kicks to the right corner, Crichton does well in the air, but it\u2019s a Queenslander on the spot at ground level. This is up there with the best defensive performances I have ever seen. 55 mins: Luai almost goes by himself, picking up the ball in broken play following a Moses bomb, jinking one way, then the other, before Walsh eventually brings him down. NSW use up their captain\u2019s challenge shortly afterwards, claiming unsuccessfully that Holmes knocked the ball on following the bomb. However, in the process of the review, Walsh\u2019s last ditch challenge on Luai is ruled high, so NSW retain the ball. \u201cThat\u2019s embarrassing,\u201d bemoans Andrew Johns. It was around the neck mind you \u2026 53 mins: Munster\u2019s marshalling of that Queensland try was brilliant. Repeatedly steering play to the left edge until the space opened up for Taulagi to exploit. His halfback pairing with Cherry-Evans will go down in Origin history. I mean, it\u2019s funny. How on earth do they absorb so much pressure and then score in one hit? A solid set from their own line turns into something miraculous on the last when Taulagi plays on, kicks infield and the bounce sets up perfectly for Tabuai-Fidow to gather and touch down. Incredible. Holmes hits an upright for the second time tonight. Not that it matters much any more. 49 mins: Now the Blues come. From a tackle restart 30m out Yeo, Robson and Martin, all bust the line. Crichton almost gets free on the right. But everywhere they move there\u2019s a Maroon jersey waiting to pounce. Another set restart! The ball moves from right to left, the weight of territory and possession surely has to count \u2013 but no! For the umpteenth time the ball ends up out of sync as it\u2019s throw to the left \u2013 Cook\u2019s centre \u2013 and Addo-Carr watches the ball bobble into touch. Superb defence from Queensland, woeful attack from NSW. 47 mins: A poor DCE kick allows To\u2019o to set up NSW on halfway. But yet again five tackles pass quickly with no imagination or wit. The kick is tidy enough but Holmes does wonderfully in the air to defuse the bomb. The Blues defend well to deny Queensland any cheap metres coming out of defence, but they\u2019re going to need to offer much more with ball in hand to rescue this. 45 mins: New South Wales need a miracle in enemy territory. And it\u2019s hard to see where it\u2019s going to come from. Not that it matters for long. Just as they have all series Queensland only need a glimpse of the line to convert it into a score. The ball moves around at speed until there\u2019s room on the right. The Maroons don\u2019t panic, DCE double pumps, Walsh unloads in contact, and Holmes has the space to dive over in the corner. The prolific points scorer picks himself up, dusts himself down, and spanks over a touchline conversion to extend his side\u2019s commanding lead. 42 mins: Cotter and Fifita set the tone on the opening set for the Maroons. Grant then makes a burst to build the momentum. Munster launches a bomb Tabuai-Fidow plucks it out of the sky but To\u2019o tackles the Hammer almost immediately. Queensland back into their work. And how! NSW turn in s straightforward set that ends with Walsh fielding a bomb, bouncing out of mid-air contact, wriggling through a series of tackles and into open space before Tedesco just hauls him down! The teams are back out for the second half. Can NSW mount a comeback? Here\u2019s the DCE chase on Crichton that turned into a 10 or 12 point play. He saves at least four points with his tackle, one that immediately precedes his line break to set up Queensland\u2019s second try. NSW had more possession, more completions, more passes, more offloads\u2026 and rarely looked threatening. It\u2019s like Origin I all over again. To make matters worse, when the Blues did penetrate the ball followed makeshift centre Damien Cook like a magnet and he was repeatedly the wrong man at the wrong time. In case you\u2019ve joined late, Cook has been pressganged into the backline after Trbojevic was forced off in the opening exchanges with a serious pec injury. Brad Fittler\u2019s decision not to retain Nicho Hynes in his 17 is already beginning to look like a mistake. James Hewer has emailed in, questioning Queensland\u2019s second try. And I have to agree that Fifita\u2019s pass to Tabuai-Fidow looks forward to my poorly trained eyes. Have a look below, make your own call. The Maroons have been on the back foot for much of the half, but they are now just 40 minutes away from an Origin series victory. 39 mins: NSW should have one set in their own half before the break, but they benefit from a dangerous tackle and kick long downfield for one final assault for the half. Five tackles come and go in the shadow of the posts but there is zero penetration. On the last there\u2019s a set restart \u2013 which just means two more ineffective tackles before the hooter. Queensland\u2019s defence is phenomenal. 37 mins: Queensland go through hands on halfway but Walsh grasses the seventh or eighth pass in the move and NSW mop up. Again, it\u2019s a moderate set, and it ends in ignominy with Collins wrapping Luai in a mighty pile-driving bear hug that dislodges the ball and brings Suncorp Stadium alive. 35 mins: What an extraordinary couple of minutes for Daly Cherry-Evans. His tackle save on Crichton will be on Origin highlights reels for decades, then he made the line break to create his side\u2019s second try. Such a big game player. Going the other way, Damien Cook just cannot believe his predicament. After all that pressure from NSW, what do Queensland do? Carrigan makes a bust, DCE powers through the gap, and a tackle later the ball is shifted from right to left for Taulagi to complete the formalities. How do they do it? How do they always do it? Holmes makes the simple conversion. 30 mins: The Maroons get just what they want with a set restart on halfway. Defence is now very much attack with DCE and Munster darting around behind the ruck. On the last the kick is smothered and Crichton is away! Can he make it 90 metres for the try!? Queenslanders are coming from all angles to chase! It\u2019s a thrilling foot-race \u2013 and Cherry-Evans makes the desperate tackle! Wow. But NSW are not finished. They have a full set 20 metres out. There\u2019s so much space on the left against a tired Queensland defence \u2013 but the ball doesn\u2019t get there fast enough and the Maroons recover. They keep coming through \u2013 and now there\u2019s space again on the left, surely this time, no! The pass from Luai hits Cook in the face! Oh no! This is nightmare stuff for NSW. 28 mins: NSW are pushing hard now! Little happened for five tackles, but on the last a poor Moses chip bounced back into Blue hands and drew a knock-on for a repeat set in the red zone. After steering everything down the left NSW look to the right and as Moses feeds Tedesco there\u2019s room for To\u2019o on the outside \u2013 but Taulagi flies out of the line to pressure the NSW skipper and his pass misses its target. That was a long long intense spell of pressure and Queensland emerge unscathed. 27 mins: Finally some respite! After a long long period of unbroken play \u2013 largely dominated by NSW \u2013 there\u2019s a ruck infringement against Queensland after a long kick-chase, and everyone has a second to catch their breath. 26 mins: The Blues continue to probe. Crichton goes close, then there\u2019s an overlap on the left \u2013 can they find it? No! Cook is the wrong man in the left centre and he\u2019s crunched by a gang of Queenslanders when you\u2019d have to think a fit Mitchell would have handed a try on a plate to Addo-Carr. 25 mins: That\u2019s almost the moment of magic NSW need! Moses, on tackle one, spots Walsh out of position and chips and chases his own ball. Munster gets back to concede the drop-out just in time. Moses does not look overawed by the occasion. 24 mins: Wallop! Martin and Young absolutely pummel Coates a split-second after he fields the high ball. Munster\u2019s then dumped in a tackle as the Blues push \u2013 but Nanai breaks the line and can launch a counter\u2026 but he bites off more than he can chew with a flick pass out of contact that\u2019s too hot for Coates and NSW are back in attack. 22 mins: Moses has impressed me so far, looking to attack on the front foot, shaping to run whenever he receives the ball, buying him yards to finesse his kicks. There\u2019s been no magic yet though with the Blues content to grind through the sets and bide their time. 20 mins: NSW continue to enjoy good field position but they have yet to profit from Moses\u2019s boot. His latest effort, high to the right, is won in the air by Crichton, but Fa\u2019asuamaleaui is first to crumb the loose ball at ground level. The pace and flow of this contest is of a much higher intensity than Origin I. Already plenty of players look gassed. 18 mins: Superb defence from the Queensland line! NSW had A1 attacking position but time and again the Maroons not only won the one-on-one challenge but they did so with interest. Eventually, the grubber is secured by Munster who finds 10 metres from a crowded in-goal area to run the ball clear. 16 mins: Another massive DCE boot sets up a terrific chase at the end of a set highlighted by Fa\u2019asuamaleaui and Frizell getting to know each other better. The Blues move the ball incrementally downfield for four tackles, then there\u2019s some pathetic handbags at the ruck involving Flegler \u2013 and he concedes a dreadfully soft un-Origin penalty to invite the Blues onto attack. 14 mins: The Maroons are getting momentum with every set, and the kicking game is on point, looking for long early punts downfield to turn Tedesco and his wingers on their heel, inviting punishing chases. 12 mins: Nightmare start for NSW, losing an early try and Trbojevic. Damien Cook, normally a hooker, will have to play 75 minutes as a left centre. And Queensland are not letting them breathe easy, Munster almost nailing a 40-20. Queensland make ground every tackle of the set following Luai\u2019s poor kick, and by the last Cherry-Evans has time to loft a short iron to the right corner. The ball spills off fingers, hits the deck, and a Maroon jersey lands on the loose pill for an opportunistic try! Or is it? Ashley Klein reckons Coates knocked on in the aerial contest with Addo-Carr, so we\u2019re going to the Bunker. Replay after replay is indeterminate until an angle is found to call the play on. Try time! Or is it? Valentine Holmes\u2019s finish isn\u2019t pretty. Was it a knock-on? No! Another line-ball call goes Queensland\u2019s way and the home side hit the front! Holmes clips the outside of the post with his conversion attempt from the right touchline. 8 mins: The second penalty of the night goes the way of NSW after Munster is pinged for slowing down Crichton at the ruck. That turns a set from their line to a territory-builder from halfway for the Blues. But it\u2019s a set that lacks penetration, especially when Robson is fortunate not to knock on a fumble. Moses has looked bright early on and his dart from dummy half allows Luai to grubber from close range, but he overcooks and the balls dribbles dead. Confirmation Tom Trbojevic is out for the night with a pec injury. 6 mins: Following that early burst both teams exchange midfield sets before To\u2019o hammers into the Maroon line \u2013 and Cotter in particular - to create some go-forward. That sets up Moses to bomb from 40m out. His kick is allowed to bounce, but Queensland mop up. 4 mins: Queensland waste no time going through their repertoire, from left wing to right for a tackle, then back to the left where the Maroons have a glimmer out wide but Taulagi can\u2019t get into the corner. In desperation Trbojevic has done himself a serious mischief! Is it a dislocated shoulder \u2013 or worse? Either way, it looks as though Turbo is done for the night and Damien Cook is on in the centres. 2 mins: Paulo, To\u2019o, Haas, Young and Tedesco all hit the line hard for NSW but Moses is forced to launch his first kick from inside his own half. Queensland make little ground for three tackles but Fifita makes his presence known on tackle four and Trbojevic coughs up a soft penalty at the ruck. The Maroons on the attack early. Origin II is underway. The Blues receive Reece Walsh\u2019s kick-off. Can they keep the series alive at fortress Suncorp? The pre-match formalities have been taken care of. On with the footy \u2026 And now the home side, top to toe in Maroon, like most of the 50-odd thousand Queenslanders inside Suncorp Stadium. First out on to the arena are the Blues, led by James Tedesco, and they are met with a cacophony of boos and catcalls. The Blues are more recognisable tonight in their sky blue uniform after Origin one\u2019s navy affair. Wally Lewis and Darren Lockyer emerge from the gloom to parade the State of Origin shield. We are the Champions gets an airing on the PA system. Queensland relishing the opportunity to showcase their status. Could it be hubris? The lights are down at Suncorp Stadium. The two teams are going through their final drills in the sheds. We\u2019ll be underway in about ten minutes. Just enough time before kick-off for this nice read from Gavin Willacy about the growth of rugby league Stateside. The NRL\u2019s priority in the US seems to be more about cashing in on gambling revenue with no mention yet of developing the local game. Have you ever seen Succession\u2019s Roman Roy and Queensland\u2019s Cameron Munster in the same room at the same time? \u201cCan anything upstage what happened on day five of the Ashes last night?\u201d wonders David Ritchie. I doubt it, but hopefully there\u2019s more action in the 8-10pm region than we saw through the Birmingham rain yesterday! Gideon Suvio is tuning in from PNG and he wants to wish the Blues all the best for tonight\u2019s game. Series referee Ashley Klein had plenty of whistleblowing to do in South Australia. Hopefully tonight the two sets of players allow the game to flow. It\u2019s cool and dry and still in Brisbane this evening. In other words, perfect rugby league playing conditions. You\u2019re not imagining it, Queensland do tend to win when its tight. Queensland have a success rate of 51% in Origin games decided by seven points or more, but that jumps to 59% in games decided by six points or fewer. With nearly half of the 126 Origin games decided by these small margins, the Maroons\u2019 ability to clinch tight games is a key reason for their dominance. Do the Maroons have a game two hoodoo? They haven\u2019t won the second match of an Origin series since 2017. Extended further, it\u2019s nine defeats in the past 12 round two encounters. However, the Blues have only once won game two at Suncorp after losing the series opener, and Queensland have won eight of the past 10 Origin clashes at their HQ. Brad Fittler was forced into a huge decision when Nathan Cleary\u2019s hamstring pinged, and he has overlooked the merits of Dally M medallist Nicho Hynes and Suncorp specialist Adam Reynolds in favour of Eels halfback Mitchell Moses. Hynes misses the squad altogether, making way for Reece Robson to offer more versatility in the pack off the bench. He will dovetail at hooker with the recalled Damien Cook. Cameron Murray and Liam Martin were under injury clouds in the build up but both have been passed fit. Fittler is backing his Blues to rebound from their disappointment in Adelaide, especially skipper James Tedesco who was shown up by Roosters clubmate Lindsay Collins late on. \u201cI think the moment at the end of the game was most probably embarrassing for him and embarrassment is a pretty good motivator,\u201d Fittler said.

It\u2019s been a good week.\u201d Queensland: 1 Reece Walsh, 2 Xavier Coates, 3 Valentine Holmes, 4 Hamiso Tabuai-Fidow, 5 Murray Taulagi, 6 Cameron Munster, 7 Daly Cherry-Evans, 15 Tom Flegler, 9 Ben Hunt, 10 Tino Fa\u2019asuamaleaui, 11 David Fifita, 16 Reuben Cotter, 13 Pat Carrigan.

The Blues have started favourites in every one of Fittler\u2019s games since he took over in 2018, yet the coach is 8-8 over that time with two series losses. He has been strongly criticised for some questionable selections decisions \u2013 Josh Addo-Carr\u2019s omission in 2022 was widely disparaged \u2013 and admitted prior to this year\u2019s series opener that he was taking some unnecessary risks. Those risks did not pay off. Hello everybody and welcome to live coverage of State of Origin Game 2 between Queensland\u2019s Maroons and New South Wales\u2019s Blues. Kick-off at Suncorp Stadium is not before 8.05pm (AEST). Three weeks ago the Maroons did what the Maroons do and demonstrate that Queensland is not a place but a state of mind. Unfancied and outplayed for much of Origin I, Billy Slater\u2019s mob turned it on when it mattered to take a series lead to fortress Suncorp. The narrative since Adelaide has been all about the Blues. NSW selection, strategy, and execution have all been questioned. Why have so many key players underperformed so often? How do they fail repeatedly to get over the line when it matters? Whereto now for Brad Fittler? Changes were demanded of the Blues but Fittler\u2019s plans have been thrown into disarray with two cruel injury blows. Halfback Nathan Cleary has been ruled out of the remainder of the series with a hamstring injury, while Latrell Mitchell, the man expected to provide the spark, has not yet fully recovered from the complaint that ruled him out of the series opener. In their own ways each are impossible to replace and not what Fittler needed heading to a venue where his side has lost twice as much as it has won. Queensland are not without their own issues, but they have not come with the same psychodrama. The risk for the Maroons tonight is how they cope with the unfamiliar status of favourites \u2013 expected to seal a third series in four years \u2013 when their trademark footy has emerged with their backs against the wall.

R Adm John Mauger, who is heading the search for the Titan, confirmed an aircraft had detected noise in the water picked up by sonar buoys on Tuesday, but said: \u201cWe don\u2019t know the source of that noise.\u201d He said there were a lot of metal objects at the site of the Titanic wreck, which could be where the noise was coming from. Mauger also told CBS News that the search operation would continue \u201cas long as there\u2019s an opportunity for survival\u201d. The discovery on Tuesday led search teams to relocate their underwater robotic search operations \u201cin an attempt to explore the origin of the noises\u201d, the Coast Guard said earlier in a series of tweets. The searches by remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) came up empty-handed but would continue, the Coast Guard said. Authorities are scrambling to find the Titan, which went missing on Sunday during a dive to the wreck of the Titanic. On Tuesday, officials estimated the five people onboard had about 40 hours of breathable air remaining. The Coast Guard\u2019s announcement came after US reports citing internal government memos said banging sounds at 30-minute intervals had been picked up by crews searching for the submersible, and after an explorers\u2019 organisation said \u201cwe understand that likely signs of life\u201d had been detected. Search aircraft with underwater detection capabilities picked up a banging sound every 30 minutes for several hours, CNN and Rolling Stone reported, citing US government memos. The emails did not make clear when the sounds were picked up. The sounds were still heard after four hours, reported CNN, and said an update sent on Tuesday night suggested more sounds were heard, though they were not described as banging. \u201cAdditional acoustic feedback was heard and will assist in vectoring surface assets and also indicating continued hope of survivors,\u201d CNN quoted the updated government memo as saying. In a statement on Tuesday night, the Explorers Club \u2013 which lists missing British billionaire Hamish Harding as a founding member of its board of trustees \u2013 thanked those behind the rescue effort, and said: \u201cWe have much greater confidence that \u2026 there is cause for hope, based on data from the field \u2013 we understand that likely signs of life have been detected at the site.\u201d Later, the New York-based club told the Guardian that they were \u201cwaiting for updates from the Coast Guard\u201d before commenting further on reports that noises were detected in the search area. Those onboard Titan for the tourist expedition are believed to be Harding, 58; Pakistani-born businessman Shahzada Dawood, 48, with his 19-year-old son Suleman, who are both British citizens; French explorer Paul-Henri Nargeolet, 77; and Stockton Rush, founder and CEO of OceanGate Expeditions. Authorities have not confirmed the identity of any passenger. On Tuesday afternoon, US Coast Guard Capt Jamie Frederick said a giant sea and air search covering 20,000 sq km (7,600 sq miles) of remote ocean had \u201cnot yielded any results\u201d. Fresh equipment and craft, ranging from undersea recovery vehicles to hyperbaric chambers, have been sent to boost the rescue effort as estimated oxygen levels in the submersible run lower. The US navy sent a deep ocean salvage system called Fadoss that was expected to arrive in Newfoundland on Tuesday evening, a US spokesperson told CBC News in Canada. It was due to arrive along with other equipment and personnel. On Tuesday night, three US air force C-17 aircraft were confirmed as having landed in Newfoundland carrying equipment headed for the search area, 370 nautical miles (685km) to the south-east. The Fadoss system is designed to provide \u201creliable deep ocean lifting capacity of up to 60,000lbs (27,200kg) for the recovery of large, bulky, and heavy sunken objects such as aircraft or small vessels\u201d. The missing Titan submersible weighs 10,432kg (23,000lbs). The recovery system has previously been deployed alongside a US navy remotely operated vehicle called Curv-21, the Cable-controlled Undersea Recovery Vehicle, a 2.4-metre (8ft) craft that can operate as far down as 6km (20,000ft). However it is unclear if it is being deployed for this search. The Royal Canadian Navy ship HMCS Glace Bay was en route to provide a medical team specialising in dive medicine, as well as a six-person mobile hyperbaric recompression chamber. It was expected to be on scene by midday on Thursday. The Canadian Coast Guard Ship (CCGS) John Cabot was expected to arrive later on Tuesday, the CCGS Ann Harvey was en route, and the CCGS Terry Fox was at the launch base in St John\u2019s, Newfoundland. Magellan, a British firm that specialises in deep ocean investigations and recovery operations, said it was supporting the rescue mission for the Titan. A French research ship carrying its own deep-sea diving robot vessel was also being sent to the search area at the request of the US navy and was expected to arrive on Wednesday night local time, the Ifremer research institute said."}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db514", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/21/state-of-origin-2023-queensland-maroons-beat-nsw-blues-to-seal-series-win", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Queensland thrash sorry NSW to seal 2023 State of Origin series win", "lead": "A rampant Maroons side retained the State of Origin shield with a comprehensive 32-6 win over the Blues at Suncorp Stadium", "author": "Angus Fontaine", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 12:31:15", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.989167", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/947573b9c62f00e325f20a4cce3838c0fccfc65e/0_129_3000_1800/500.jpg", "body": "Led by the magic hands of fullback Reece Walsh and the cool head of captain Daly Cherry-Evans, Billy Slater\u2019s Queensland Maroons delivered a comprehensive 32-6 humiliation of New South Wales to win Game 2 in Brisbane, claim the series and, more than likely, end Brad Fittler\u2019s five-year reign as Blues coach. Since snatching defeat from the jaws of victory in Game 1 at Adelaide, NSW had been under siege from every cliche in the book and every rugby league pundit on the planet. \u201cIt burns,\u201d seethed Fittler. \u201cBut sometimes embarrassment is a pretty good motivator.\u201d Unfortunately, it motivated Queensland more. Until last night, Fittler had never lost a Game 2, winning all five during his tenure to amass an impressive three series wins since 2018. But the 51-year-old coach had been annoyed all week. His side was missing guns Nathan Cleary, Latrell Mitchell and Api Koroisau, and he had 80 minutes to save his skin \u2013 and his legacy. But it wasn\u2019t to be. Riding the sonic boom of a packed Suncorp Stadium, Queensland were imperious. NSW lost Tom Trbojevic with a pectoral injury in the opening minutes and a backline already shorn of Latrell Mitchell now lost its other turbo engine. Perversely, Fittler sent veteran hooker Damien Cook on as centre. He was targeted from the get-go. Cook may lead the NRL for tackles but in Origin he was a speedboat among tankers at ramming speed. Fittler paid the price for bad selections in Game 1 and here again he fumbled the mix, switching his starting wingers so Josh Addo-Carr could combat Xavier Coates\u2019 aerial skills. They met in a marking contest in the ninth minute and the Bronco won the jump but a Foxx hand touched first leaving Valentine Holmes to collect the crumbs for first blood. NSW lacked clarity in attack but rallied. Payne Haas\u2019s offloads and Brian To-o\u2019s charges built pressure. Called in to replace Cleary as playmaker, Mitchell Moses was nerveless, taking long strides into the defence and kicking to the corners. But each time Queensland had the answers. And too often, Blues overlaps came to nothing when the last pass went awry. On the half hour mark, with Queensland pressing, Stephen Crichton picked up a loose ball and ran 60 metres only to be tackled by Cherry-Evans. With the field spread and the men redlining with exhaustion, Patrick Carrigan charged into a Blue wall and split it to slip an inside ball to his captain. Cherry-Evans ran for 50 metres and got quick ball back whereupon Queensland went left with fast hands and flat passes to put Taulagi over for 10-0. Whatever Fittler told his troops at half-time it didn\u2019t stir them from their torpor. Queensland struck within four minutes after Walsh pinballed upfield and passed to Holmes who duly planted it in the corner. A desperate NSW came again but Crichton was held up in the corner and as the Blues kicked stones, Queensland shot downfield where Taulagi shimmied a kick infield for Hamiso Tabuai-Fidow to haul in and score. Somehow, with 57% of possession, NSW were behind 20-0. Finally, Cook converted, the former beach sprint champion slicing through to score under the posts and inject hope. The Blues surged, gang-tackling Coates to the sideline, hitting Walsh in the air and forcing errors and penalties from a tiring Maroons side. But again, with their last gasp, Queensland found a way, Walsh beating Addo-Carr and giving Coates clear air to the corner. The Blues\u2019 Latrell-shaped hole flared open again late when Addo-Carr and Cook collided in the air to allow a final insult and a scoreline reflective of Queensland\u2019s dominance. Tempers flared too as the final minutes exploded into an all-in melee that saw three players sent off for a litany of sins. By then Suncorp was swaying to We Are the Champions. The series was over and with it the Fittler era, but for the men in Maroon the party had just begun."}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db515", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/21/private-schools-labour-britain-fee-paying-vat-exemption", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Private schools are on the offensive because Labour looms \u2013 and their privileges are under threat | Lola Okolosie", "lead": "Britain\u2019s fee-paying schools could soon lose their controversial VAT exemption, and fear their protests are falling on closed ears, says teacher and writer Lola Okolosie", "author": "Lola Okolosie", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 12:30:38", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.989184", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/635b5e0fda28e6416aeac1c5b03d44cdb2fc5cf9/81_624_4040_2424/500.jpg", "body": "How do you square the circle that is a 20% tax exemption for wealthy people? That is the difficult question the Independent Schools Council (ISC), the lobby group for the UK\u2019s private schools, finds itself trying to answer. Accepting that it is \u201cincreasingly likely\u201d that Labour \u2013 which has a policy of charging VAT on private school fees \u2013 will win the next election, the body representing independent schools has stepped up its tactics. In its fightback against one of the few policies that puts clear daylight between the Tories and Labour, the ISC has written to MPs and contacted private schools \u2013 one letter gives schools \u201ca template that Labour insiders suggest could be shared with parents to try to discredit the party\u2019s policy\u201d. This prompted party figures to warn that they could write to the Charity Commission about private schools expressing political opinions or engaging in political campaigns. Were all this not enough, the lobby group\u2019s own emails reveal that officials described Labour\u2019s shadow education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, as \u201cchippy\u201d \u2013 someone who \u201cdoesn\u2019t know diddly\u201d and can not \u201cappreciate the great good our sector does\u201d. That private schools do much \u201cgood\u201d for \u201clocal communities\u201d is an argument their defenders repeat so often, you could be forgiven for thinking this is the real reason why \u201chardworking parents\u201d opt to go private. Little mention is made of the socioeconomic premium that private school attendance awards children over the course of their lives. After all, people who hold the top jobs in Britain \u2013 in politics, the judiciary and the media \u2013 are five times more likely to have gone to private school than the general population. By existing, the ISC argues, private schools enrich the school ecosystem, serving communities and creating opportunities for less fortunate children. They point to their charitable partnerships with their poorer state school cousins, warning these might end, should VAT be applied to their fees. And, were that not enough, they make threats: a smaller independent sector places an even greater burden on the already stretched resources of the state sector. Leaving to one side that extra students could well be considered a boon for the state sector, if private schools do believe that they will haemorrhage numbers, then why don\u2019t they countenance making changes to absorb the VAT fee rise rather than pass it on to parents? In any case, many experts are not sure what the effect VAT on fees will have on student numbers \u2013 after all, the rise in fees over the past two decades hasn\u2019t dented demand; fees are at a record high and so, too, are pupil numbers. The sector has raised its fees at a rate far exceeding inflation \u2013 the average annual fee for a non-boarding school is \u00a316,656 \u2013 reflecting how its market is hardly those \u201chardworking\u201d, middle-class families that it likes to speak of. Instead, as one head at a leading independent school put it in 2014, hiked fees have seen them become \u201cfinishing schools for the children of oligarchs\u201d. The Telegraph has also sounded the alarm, worriedly reporting earlier this year that \u201cprivate school fees cost parents twice as much of their income as they did a generation ago\u201d. Under Theresa May\u2019s premiership, the Tories saw the sense in scrapping the tax exemption on fees. So much so that Michael Gove, in a 2017 column for the Times, asked, given the over-representation of public school alumni in Britain\u2019s top jobs, whether \u201cthe children of the rich\u201d are \u201cintrinsically more talented and worthy, more gifted and more deserving of celebration than the rest?\u201d His answer was, of course, no. That didn\u2019t stop May losing her nerve and ditching the policy. Last November, during prime minister\u2019s questions, Keir Starmer posed his own simple question to Rishi Sunak: why, since the latter\u2019s alma mater, Winchester College, \u201chas a rowing club, a rifle club, an extensive art collection \u2026 did he hand them nearly \u00a36m in taxpayers\u2019 money?\u201d (This was Labour\u2019s estimate of the value of the school\u2019s exemption.) Sunak\u2019s response was to accuse Starmer of \u201cattacking the hardworking aspirations of millions of people\u201d. In casting the small minority of parents who can afford private school fees as aspirational \u201cstrivers\u201d, Sunak revealed more than he perhaps intended. What\u2019s more, to learn that parents who can afford to go private would perhaps reconsider doing so were an extra 20% added to fees will garner little to no sympathy. Many parents, I suspect, would like the \u00a31.7bn the Treasury would raise in applying VAT on fees to be pumped back into an education system that serves the majority of our children. \u201cParents have a right to choose how they educate their children, it is one of our basic human rights,\u201d says Julie Robinson, chief executive of the ISC. \u201cThe parents of children in independent schools just want to do the best for their children and that is not something anyone should stop.\u201d Be that as it may, surely, the question remains, why must the rest of us subsidise their drive to secure their children a lifetime of advantage?

Cox, 44, said: \u201cWe are both very much looking forward to celebrating with our families.\u201d Jo Cox, a Labour MP, was attacked outside her constituency office in West Yorkshire by a rightwing terrorist during the EU referendum campaign in June 2016. Speaking on Wednesday, Cox said he and Jo had previously discussed the idea of marrying if either of them died. The father of two told ITV\u2019s Lorraine that Jo had said she would want him to remarry. \u201cI always knew that she would want that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I never thought it would happen because when you lose someone like Jo, you never think you\u2019ll find somebody with the energy and the love and the enthusiasm and the excitement that Jo had. I\u2019m incredibly lucky that I have.\u201d He added that his children were \u201cvery excited\u201d when he told them that he intended to propose to Ryder. \u201cI said: \u2018I\u2019m thinking about asking her to marry me. What do you think?\u2019 I think their response was \u2018you\u2019re never going to do any better than Anna\u2019, which I think was basically a nice thing and a compliment,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re very excited about it.\u201d Cox also said there is still \u201chuge momentum\u201d behind this weekend\u2019s The Great Get Together, which celebrates Jo\u2019s memory. The series of events are based on the message in Jo\u2019s maiden speech in parliament in which she said that \u201cwe have more in common than that which divides us\u201d. Cox said: \u201cWhat The Great Get Together is about is bringing communities together from different backgrounds, different areas, different races, different religions and just saying actually that the thing that Jo talked about so much, which is that we do have more in common than the things that divide us, it\u2019s just that we\u2019re not always very good at remembering that.\u201d He said that Jo\u2019s sister, Kim Leadbeater, who is the Labour MP for Batley and Spen, is bringing MPs together in parliament on Wednesday as part of the events. Cox became a prominent campaigner in the wake of Jo\u2019s death, setting up two charities in her memory. In 2018, he resigned from his posts at More in Common and the Jo Cox Foundation, after being publicly accused of sexual assault. It was claimed in the Mail on Sunday that he had assaulted a woman in her 30s at Harvard University in 2015. Police filed her complaint as assault and battery but action against him was dropped. Cox denied the claims but admitted making mistakes in a previous role with the charity Save the Children."}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db517", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/21/rishi-sunak-inflation-plans-pmqs-mortgage-keir-starmer", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Sunak defends inflation plan as Starmer labels him out of touch over mortgages", "lead": "Labour leader accuses PM of failing to act on warnings about home loan repayments hit by \u2018Tory penalty\u2019", "author": "Ben Quinn Political correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 12:18:55", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.989222", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/cfc4fb013e649450237c8d48ae7f731178ec1569/60_0_1800_1080/500.jpg", "body": "Rishi Sunak has doubled down on his insistence that his government is \u201con track\u201d to halve inflation as he responded to Labour taunts that the Tory leader\u2019s own backbenchers were warning of a \u201cmortgage catastrophe\u201d.

Appearing at prime minister\u2019s questions hours after figures showed that the UK\u2019s annual inflation rate had unexpectedly remained unchanged in May at 8.7%, he said the IMF had strongly endorsed his government\u2019s approach to cutting into that figure. \u201cInflation is what erodes people\u2019s savings and pushes up prices, and ultimately makes them poorer. This is why a long time before I had this job I highlighted the importance of tackling inflation. It\u2019s why I said it is never easy to root out inflation, but we will take the difficult and responsible decisions to do so,\u201d he said. But the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, accused him of being out of touch with the fears of homeowners, who were now forecast to be facing extra mortgage repayments of \u00a32,900 a year from a \u201cTory mortgage penalty\u201d. The pain will increase if, as expected, the Bank of England increases the cost of borrowing on Thursday as part of efforts to tame inflation. \u201cNow he was warned by experts about this as long ago as autumn last year, but he either didn\u2019t get it, didn\u2019t believe it or didn\u2019t care, because he certainly didn\u2019t do anything, and when I raised this a couple of months ago, he had the gall to stand at that dispatch box and say he was delivering for homeowners,\u201d said Starmer. The Labour leader also kept up a strategy of focusing on the prime minister\u2019s personal wealth, remarking: \u201cI\u2019m sure from the vantage point of his helicopter, everything might look fine.\u201d When Sunak referred again to the UK being in the same boat as the US, Canada and Australia when it came to rising interest rates, Starmer referred to property owned by the Sunak family in the US, saying: \u201cI know he has a keen interest in mortgages in California.\u201d While the government is coming under pressure from its own backbenches to intervene for struggling mortgage-holders, there were no such announcements. But Sunak insisted mortgage-holders were being supported, telling the Commons: \u201cWe have deliberately and proactively increased the generosity of our support for the mortgage interest scheme. We have also established a new FCA (Financial Conduct Authority) \u2026 duty which will protect people with mortgages, for example, moving them on to interest-only mortgages or lengthening mortgage terms. \u201cWe have spent tens of billions of pounds supporting people with the cost of living, particularly the most vulnerable.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db518", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/21/former-tory-ministers-form-group-push-green-policies-next-election", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Former Tory ministers push for \u2018bold and positive\u2019 green agenda at election ", "lead": "Exclusive: Alok Sharma among those wanting more onshore and offshore renewables and better energy efficiency in homes", "author": "Helena Horton Environment reporter", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 12:08:19", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.989240", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/2644c41c3be551a3454dca9a30ac3ffb237684dd/0_137_4632_2780/500.jpg", "body": "Former Tory cabinet ministers have formed a group to pressure the government to improve its green policies in the hope of making it \u201ccredible\u201d in the next general election. Alok Sharma, the former Cop26 president, is urging Rishi Sunak to have a \u201cbold and positive environmental agenda\u201d in the next general election. He joins the former transport secretary Chris Grayling and Simon Clarke, who was the levelling up secretary, in calling for more ambitious climate policies. They will sit on the new steering committee for the Conservative Environment Network (CEN), a group of 159 Tory MPs who pressure the government to improve its green offering. The group was formed a decade ago. The ministers will be calling for Sunak to adopt ambitious policies to unlock more onshore and offshore renewables, improve home energy efficiency, incentivise sustainable transport options, clean up rivers and seas and reward farmers for using nature-friendly practices. In recent weeks, Sunak and government ministers including the energy secretary, Grant Shapps, have criticised the Labour party for its green energy policies and the fact one of its donors also donates to the campaign group Just Stop Oil. There are fears among green Conservatives that despite hosting Cop26 and announcing a range of environmental initiatives, the Tories are in danger of losing credibility on the matter, while Labour commits to policies that include ending the moratorium on onshore wind, and vastly expanding green energy. In addition, the Tories have recently given the green light to a coalmine in Cumbria, which the government\u2019s own net zero tsar, Chris Skidmore, said should never have been approved. Their focus appears to be on the more expensive routes such as carbon capture and storage, and nuclear power rather than cheaper, proven solutions such as insulation and onshore wind. Sharma said: \u201cClimate change is the greatest challenge of our time. As the UK showed at Cop26, the leadership of a country with a small share of the world\u2019s emissions can make a big difference, raising global ambitions and creating new jobs and industries at home. \u201cThe Conservative Environment Network has been a critical voice in keeping environmentalism at the heart of successive Conservative governments. I look forward to working with its many members to ensure the government has a bold and positive environmental agenda ahead of the next election.\u201d The new group also includes the 2019 Conservative manifesto co-author Rachel Wolf, the environmental audit committee chair and MP, Philip Dunne and the MPs Katherine Fletcher and Selaine Saxby. While the Labour party attempts to focus on green issues and make them a key part of its manifesto offering, there are debates among Conservatives about whether it is worth reaching climate goals at all. Sam Hall, the director of the CEN, added: \u201cWhile some conservatives remain sceptical, they are in the minority, with almost half of Conservative MPs signing up to CEN\u2019s principles during this parliament. \u201cThe debate has moved to focus on how we deliver on our climate and nature goals in a way that enhances our prosperity and security, not whether we have to act or if humans are responsible for environmental degradation. \u201cAs we head toward the next election and the future of conservatism debate continues, we will work to ensure environmental leadership remains at the core of the centre-right politics and to urge conservatives to set out a positive agenda for further environmental action.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db519", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/21/les-siecles-review-barbican-francois-xavier-roth-berlioz-boulanger", "primaryCategory": "music", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Les Si\u00e8cles review \u2013 Raw, radical and revelatory as Roth\u2019s period band thrills", "lead": "Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Roth led an exhilarating and illuminating programme that moved through 80 years of French music, from Berlioz to Boulanger", "author": "Clive Paget", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 12:06:19", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.989258", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/7439d0c0c409751c8ea30b4749bf4689d7c7f052/0_185_4000_2400/500.jpg", "body": "There are symphony orchestras and there are period instrument bands, and then there is Les Si\u00e8cles. Founded in 2003, Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Roth\u2019s crack French ensemble pulls off the remarkable feat of finessing a dizzying array of music on instruments specific to the time of composition. What\u2019s more, they do it all in the same concert. As a London Symphony Orchestra principal guest conductor, Roth is no stranger to these shores, but this was the first time he\u2019s brought his Paris-based outfit to the Barbican, an event well worth the waiting for. The programme spanned 80 years of French music: from 1841 and Berlioz\u2019s frothy take on Weber\u2019s Invitation to the Dance to Lili Boulanger\u2019s death-haunted D\u2019un soir triste. The latter was written in 1918, the year she died at the age of 24. Tonal contrasts throughout were revelatory. The diaphanous textures of Debussy\u2019s Pr\u00e9lude \u00e0 l\u2019apr\u00e8s-midi d\u2019un faune responded instinctively to the gut strings and mellow early-1900s horns. The sound was warm, though never amorphous, in a performance shot through with airiness and light. By contrast, the Berlioz was rich and hefty, an intoxicating waltz fed by a raw, earthy energy. The change to natural horns here lent the music a brazen theatricality. But Roth is more than a one-trick, period-instrument pony. His vibrant interpretations are radical, crafted by expressive, fluttering hand movements and backed up by eloquent body language. In the Berlioz, he practically pirouetted on the podium to get the feel he was after. If he brought out the brutal, uncompromising side of the Boulanger with its funereal drums and ticking celesta, his reading of Daphnis et Chlo\u00e9 was teeming with light and shade. Les Si\u00e8cles offered a superb interpretation, bolstered by the London Symphony Chorus\u2019s wordless vocals. From the eerie strings and deep magic of the invocation to Pan, to the languorous streams and birdsong accompanying Ravel\u2019s ear-ravishing sunrise, this was exceptional music-making. The seething bacchanale, with castanets a-go-go, brought matters to a sensual, full-throated conclusion. The encore, a shimmying mashup of Ravel with Quincy Jones\u2019s Soul Bossa Nova, was the icing on the gateau."}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db51a", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/jun/21/1-point-4m-uk-households-huge-hit-to-finances-mortgage-timebomb-payments-fifth-disposale-income", "primaryCategory": "money", "subCategories": "test", "title": "1.4m UK mortgage holders face 20% hit to disposable income from rate hikes", "lead": "Expected surge in costs by 2025 likely to hit people in 30s hardest, says Institute for Fiscal Studies report", "author": "Richard Partington Economics correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 12:04:41", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.989276", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/361b33968c7b905fd088f767c26301f10668d992/0_193_5214_3130/500.jpg", "body": "More than 1 million households across Britain are expected to lose at least 20% of their disposable incomes thanks to the surge in mortgage costs expected before the next election, the UK\u2019s leading economics thinktank has warned. Sounding the alarm as mortgage costs reach the highest levels since the 2008 financial crisis, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said that almost 1.4m mortgage holders would see at least a fifth of their disposable income erased. It said the heaviest blow would be reserved for those under the age of 40 with larger mortgages, with the biggest financial hit for households in London and the south-east of England, where property prices are typically higher than the national average. The biggest rise is for those in their 30s, for whom payments will jump by \u00a3360 a month, or 11% of disposable income. The prospect comes as the government faces growing pressure to intervene amid what some MPs have termed a \u201cmortgage timebomb\u201d waiting to explode for millions of households as they reach the end of fixed-rate deals on their home loans. More than a quarter of mortgage holders are expected to reach the end of cheaper deals before the next election, which must be held by 28 January 2025. Households are facing a sharp rise in costs as high street banks drive up new home loan costs above 6%, the highest levels since Liz Truss\u2019s disastrous mini-budget last autumn. It comes as the Bank of England is expected to raise interest rates for a 13th consecutive time on Thursday in response to stubbornly high inflation which has left the UK with the highest rate in the G7. Figures on Wednesday showed inflation unexpectedly remained unchanged at 8.7% in May, adding to pressure on the Bank for further increases. According to the analysis by the IFS, more than 14 million adults over the age of 20 have a mortgage. Many have fixed-rate mortgages and so in the short-term are shielded from rate rises. But eventually those fixed terms will come to an end, leaving households exposed to soaring costs. In March 2022, households with a mortgage were spending an average of \u00a3670 a month on payments. On average, individuals in mortgage-holding households will pay almost \u00a3280 on top of this amount each month, with those in their 30s paying almost \u00a3360 more. Adults over the age of 60, typically with smaller mortgages \u2013 often having bought their homes when property prices were lower, or after years of repaying their loans \u2013 would face the smallest hit, at just over \u00a3150 a month. The IFS said households in London and the south-east of England would see the biggest increases: more than \u00a3500 on average, which is worth about 12% of disposable income. The impact would be least in Northern Ireland, where average monthly payments are expected to rise by just over \u00a3150, or less than 6% of disposable income. Thomas Wernham, a research Economist at IFS, said: \u201cMany families bought homes \u2013 often with sizeable mortgages \u2013 when interest rates were very low. As people\u2019s fixed-term offers come to an end, they are going to be exposed to much higher interest rates. For many, the increase in monthly repayments is going to come as a serious shock. \u201cGiven the cost of living pressures people are already facing due to high food and energy price inflation, these significant increases in mortgage costs could not come at a worse time.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db51b", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/21/carnegie-medal-childrens-books-translation-manon-steffan-ros-blue-book-of-nebo", "primaryCategory": "books", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Carnegie medal for children\u2019s books goes to a translation for the first time", "lead": "Manon Steffan Ros\u2019s young adult novel The Blue Book of Nebo, set in a post-apocalyptic Wales, was praised by judges as \u2018expertly realised\u2019 and heartbreaking", "author": "Ella Creamer", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 12:00:39", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.989294", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/6ec70f24905b2196e981a228b629e2a096984f40/0_0_5000_3000/500.jpg", "body": "Welsh writer Manon Steffan Ros has won the 2023 Yoto Carnegie medal, the UK\u2019s most prestigious children\u2019s books award, the first time a translated book has won in its 87-year history.

The work, originally published in Welsh, was translated by Ros herself. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely delighted,\u201d Ros said. \u201cI used to see the word Carnegie on the cover of my favourite books when I was a child, so this means a great deal to me.\u201d The medal for illustration went to Jeet Zdung for Saving Sorya: Chang and the Sun Bear, by Vietnamese wildlife conservationist Trang Nguyen. The book, which features manga-inspired illustrations and watercolour scenes, is based on a true story about a young woman working on her own to save a bear. It is the second year in a row that a graphic novel has won the illustration prize, formerly known as the Kate Greenaway medal. The winners of the medals were announced at a London ceremony on Wednesday hosted by Lauren Child, who won the illustration award in 2000 for her first Charlie and Lola book. Ros\u2019s novel charts the relationship between a mother and son who struggle to survive in their isolated hilltop home after a nearby nuclear disaster leaves them without electricity or running water. \u201cAs this is the first book in translation to win the Carnegie, my hopes are that readers, and particularly publishers, are more open to books in translation,\u201d Ros said. The chair of judges, librarian Janet Noble, said of Ros\u2019s novel: \u201cThe world-building and distinct voices of the two main characters, the son and his mother, are expertly realised and the reader is compelled to question their own relationship with the modern world\u201d. Ros lives in Tywyn, north Wales, and has written more than 20 books for adults and children. The original Welsh version of The Blue Book of Nebo, Llyfr Glas Nebo, won the 2019 Wales book of the year. Ros and Zdung both receive a \u00a35,000 cash prize and \u00a3500 worth of books to donate to a library of their choice. Ros is planning to donate to Tywyn library, where she wrote some of her books when she didn\u2019t have internet access at home, while Zdung will support libraries that Nguyen has set up near Vietnamese national parks. Zdung said he hopes Saving Sorya \u201cwill offer a deep knowledge of wildlife while impressing upon young people the importance of its conservation\u201d. In preparation to illustrate the book, he conducted field research in Vietnam and Cambodia. \u201cRoaming through the jungle and volunteering in a bear rescue centre provided me with firsthand experiences that I used to enrich the characters\u2019 lives and make them authentic,\u201d he added. Noble said that Saving Sorya \u201cis a beautiful story, elegantly told, which brings together a global view of conservation and an empowering true story of an inspiring female environmentalist, told through dazzling manga art and watercolours. Jeet has crafted every illustration to immerse the reader, just as Manon draws the reader in completely with her vivid, deliberate prose.\u201d The prizes were judged by a panel of 12 librarians, who selected winners from a shortlist of seven for the writing medal and six for the illustration award. In a separate prize, children from reading groups in schools and libraries also voted for their preferred winners, who each received a medal. This year\u2019s \u201cshadowers\u2019 choice\u201d award for writing went to I Must Betray You by Ruta Sepetys, who previously won the headline Carnegie medal in 2017 for Salt to the Sea. Joe Todd-Stanton won the shadowers\u2019 illustration medal for The Comet. The Carnegie medals were established in 1936 for writing and 1955 for illustration, open to books in the English language. This means that in theory translations into English have always been eligible.

Jana, who asked to go by a pseudonym because she doesn\u2019t want her politically conservative family to know her story, started using birth control at 13. For nearly a decade, she tried different kinds of hormonal contraception to find the one that least exacerbated anxiety and depression. Her weight fluctuated, making her eating disorder even worse. After nearly a decade, her therapist suggested she get off birth control altogether. It worked. She felt in touch with her adult body for the first time in her life, and her mental health was finally in a good place. She started using apps to track her menstrual cycle, to tell her when she was ovulating and should avoid sex or use a condom. Then, on 24 June 2022, the supreme court struck down the nationwide right to abortion. Jana, now a 24-year-old aspiring lawyer, saw warnings across her social media feeds that period tracker apps were sharing her data, and could be used as evidence if the user was suspected of having an illegal abortion. Jana deleted the apps. A few months later, around the end of November 2022, Jana was pregnant. She managed to get an abortion, but only after over a month of canceled appointments, stressful calls with clinics and insurance, and having to lie to her anti-abortion mother in order to obtain the $500 she needed for the procedure. Jana quickly realized she would have to go back on birth control. If she got pregnant again, she felt, there was a high chance she wouldn\u2019t be able to book another abortion appointment. She felt lucky she was able to get that first one, and lightning doesn\u2019t strike twice. She opted for Nexplanon, a small arm implant that releases birth control hormones into your body and lasts about five years. \u201cAll of the things that I knew would happen if I got back on birth control happened: depression, anxiety and eating, especially,\u201d Jana said in mid-June. \u201cThe mental health stuff sucks, but I will never go through that process again,\u201d she added, referring to the \u201chorrible\u201d stress of trying to access the abortion. Jana is not alone in feeling backed into a corner by the supreme court\u2019s Dobbs v Jackson Women\u2019s Health decision. Within a month of the decision, in July 2022, a TIME survey found that 21% of respondents reported changing their method of birth control after Roe was overturned. CNN reported a 300% increase in demand for emergency contraception from the online pharmaceutical company Nurx in a matter of weeks. I\u2019m a part of these statistics. Even before the leak happened, when I knew Dobbs was going before the court, I opted to get a low-hormone IUD inserted, despite having had negative experiences with an IUD in the past. I live in New York, where abortion remains legal and comparatively easy to access, but it suddenly felt selfish for me to even risk taking an appointment from someone who might need it more than me, when I had access to insurance that covered long term birth control. However, requests for IUDs through my OB-GYN were so backed up that I had to call them every week or so for nearly four months before I was able to have one inserted. While it was difficult for me to access this care in a timely manner, it\u2019s much harder for millions of people across the country. Whether that\u2019s because they\u2019re one of the 27.6 million uninsured Americans, or one of the 1.2 million women living in a county without a health center offering a full range of contraceptive methods, or in a state without medicaid expansion, or unable to get respectful or thorough health care due to systemic medical racism and LGBTQ+ prejudice. This trend of politics influencing people to seek longer, more effective kinds of contraception is not new. A study published in JAMA Internal Medicine in 2019 found that, in the weeks after Donald Trump was elected president in 2016, there was a nearly 22% increase in insertions of IUDs and arm implants. Many of the devices inserted in November 2016 will have passed their five-year FDA recommended expiration date by now. Dr Rachel Neal, an OB-GYN working out of Atlanta, Georgia, said she has seen a trend toward LARCs nationally over the past six years, in part due to Trump\u2019s presidency, as well as medicaid expansion and more insurance plans covering long term contraceptives. But in the past year Dr Neal has also seen an increased skepticism about any methods \u2013 including many birth control pills and IUDS \u2013 that pause or stop menstruation altogether. Before Roe was overturned, Dr Neal said that patients often saw not getting their periods as a positive side effect because they didn\u2019t have to deal with cramps or spend money on tampons. \u201cNow they\u2019re uneasy towards methods that cause them to have no periods because they want to \u2026 prove to themselves that they\u2019re not pregnant,\u201d Dr Neal said. People are much more aware of the possibility of getting pregnant while on different kinds of birth control (no form of birth control is 100% effective). If it fails, they want to know as soon as possible so they can get an abortion within Georgia\u2019s legal limit. \u201cTrust in our healthcare system is decreasing,\u201d Dr Neal said. \u201cAnd I do think people are unfortunately making decisions out of fear of an unintended pregnancy.\u201d Kelly Cleland, executive director of the American Society for Emergency Contraception, has seen people taking their reproductive healthcare into their own hands. Cleland\u2019s organization provides people, often on college campuses, with free or affordable emergency contraception like Plan B and Ella (prescription emergency contraception which has a higher success rate and has a higher suggested weight limit than Plan B). Cleland said ASEC saw a four-fold increase in interest in the past year. \u201cIt\u2019s not just people saying, \u2018I need to get this for myself,\u2019 but, \u2018I want to make sure that other people have this too,\u2019\u201d Cleland told me. \u201cSo very much people taking care of each other, mutual aid, let\u2019s make sure that the whole community is OK.\u201d The mutual aid and community care framework around personal contraceptive decisions is one I\u2019ve seen among people in my community, as well as among several of the people I spoke to for this article. Another change that can be tracked over this past year are among people who do not engage in sex that could get them pregnant are taking extra contraceptive precautions caused by fear of lack of access to abortion. One University of Pennsylvania college student I talked to named Hannah (who asked that only her first name be used out of fear of being tracked online) identifies as queer and said that she doesn\u2019t have sex with people that could get her pregnant. However, she got an IUD from the campus clinic because of fear of being sexually assaulted and impregnated against her will while on campus. Hannah, 19, said several of her friends who also don\u2019t have sex with people who could get them pregnant feel the same way, and took the same action. Hannah and her friends see sexual assault on campus as inevitable, she told me. \u201cWe see it as part of college life now, it\u2019s not if it\u2019s going to happen, it\u2019s more when,\u201d she said. Roe being overturned made her feel more afraid to go out and go to parties, because it could result in an unwanted pregnancy she might be forced to carry to term due to not being able to access abortion. \u201cI feel a little bit safer now because I have a backup plan,\u201d she added. \u201cBut I\u2019m still nervous.\u201d Another new element of the post-Roe landscape is an uptick in people seeking more permanent methods. After the leaked Dobbs draft, Google searches for vasectomy went up 121%, and tubal ligation \u2013 generally known as \u201chaving your tubes tied\u201d \u2013 went up 70% across the country, a study of Google metrics found. Dr Neal, who in addition to her work as an OB-GYN is a fellow with the advocacy group Physicians for Reproductive Health, said she has definitely had more patients inquire about sterilization than in prior years. And for many of her patients, she said, she is not the first doctor they asked about sterilization, many of her patients have come to her after other doctors declined to perform the procedure. \u201cThese are people that are very certain they never want to have a pregnancy that are having trouble from the sort of patriarchal doctors who are telling them that they need to have a pregnancy or need to wait until a certain age to get a sterilization procedure,\u201d Dr Neal said. This was true for three of the people I spoke to for this article, including Jana. Jana has always been certain she never wants kids, and said that she started asking doctors about sterilization when she was 15 years old. Since then, she has asked three different doctors in two different states. None have acquiesced. Maggie, a 25-year-old living in Ohio, said that after self-managing her abortion in November, she asked her primary care provider for a recommendation of an OB-GYN who would perform tubal ligation. Maggie said the OB-GYN laughed in her face, suggested she was a \u201ccrazy cat lady\u201d who \u201chated children\u201d, and told her he was giving her a referral for a psychiatric evaluation instead. After some online research, Maggie found a list of doctors who would perform sterilization on the subreddit r/childfree. So many people had called them from that list that they were completely booked up, she said. \u201cIt really makes me sad to hear,\u201d Dr Neal said about people being denied sterilization. \u201cOne of the four main ethical principles by which we are supposed to practice is patient autonomy.\u201d Eventually Maggie found an appointment in Michigan, at a prestigious hospital that did not seem to think she needed psychiatric help. If a preoperative pelvic exam goes well, Maggie will be undergoing the surgery in September. She said she feels relieved. Despite the dire state of reproductive healthcare in the US, there has been one recent positive piece of news for birth control. In May, a panel of advisers to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) voted unanimously to approve the first over-the-counter birth control pill: an estrogen-free drug called Opill. The FDA isn\u2019t required to follow the recommendation of the panel, but it typically does. Barriers to birth control access will continue to exist, and conservative legislators are already planning to go after contraception access the way they did abortion. But an over-the-counter pill would help in a landscape that is increasingly making it more and more difficult for people to control their own reproductive health."}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db51d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/21/no-hard-feelings-review-jennifer-lawrence-comedy-plays-sex-work-for-laughs", "primaryCategory": "film", "subCategories": "test", "title": "No Hard Feelings review \u2013 Jennifer Lawrence comedy plays sex work for laughs", "lead": "This age-gap story \u2013 Lawrence has to seduce a teenage virgin boy to get a free car \u2013 refuses to make bought sex anything resembling an issue", "author": "Peter Bradshaw", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 12:00:39", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.989333", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/f99e4a92af0751cb4d8d59502d3e63a1ad23d281/0_115_2550_1530/500.jpg", "body": "Comedy, like sex work, is real work and both can have a tough time gaining acceptance in the respectable world, so it\u2019s a pleasure to find a comedy about bought sex that\u2019s pretty funny \u2013 and funnier than the pun in the title might suggest. Gene Stupnitsky co-wrote and directed the amusing bad-taste romp Good Boys, and now he gives us another age-gap comedy about a very unsentimental education. The scene is Montauk in New York state, famously the location for TV series The Affair. Jennifer Lawrence plays Maddie, a woman in her early 30s who has been unlucky in love, who still lives in her childhood home, all alone since the death of her mother and not much idea about what to do with her life. She scratches a living as an Uber driver, but her car gets repossessed for non-payment of Montauk\u2019s exorbitant property taxes on a house which she stubbornly won\u2019t rent or sell to the arrogant tourist incomers who are pricing locals like her out of the neighbourhood. Maddie\u2019s best friends, surfer-dude Jim (Scott MacArthur) and his pregnant partner Sara (Natalie Morales), point out an interesting opening advertised on Craigslist. A wealthy, painfully liberal couple, Laird (Matthew Broderick) and Allison (Laura Benanti) are offering a free car to a woman who can \u201cdate\u201d their intensely shy and virginal 19-year-old son, a brilliant musician who is going to Princeton in the fall; they are scared that without experience, college is going to be just too traumatic for him. With her usual robust frankness, Maddie interviews for the job and brusquely sets out to seduce tremulous young Percy, played by Andrew Barth Feldman. She impatiently wants to get this whiny kid\u2019s cherry popped and then get the car. But of course it isn\u2019t as simple as that. This screenplay may well have been conceived before Craigslist banned dodgy hook-up ads a few years ago, but the film\u2019s reluctance to make bought sex anything resembling an issue is very contemporary. It means that there is no comic or dramatic traction from the arrangement itself being supposedly wrong, other than the parents\u2019 sneakiness in not telling Percy that they were behind it. It is not aiming for transgressive or outrageous bad taste \u2013 as in, say, the Stifler-mom scenes from American Pie a generation ago \u2013 nor any final emotional reckoning for Maddie who is never called upon to regret her Faustian bargain. The movie cheerfully gets on with its high-concept premise, but this just gives a slight sheen or glaze of unreality to the proceedings. Maddie and Percy\u2019s relationship is not as plausible as that of Alana Haim and Cooper Hoffman in Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s Licorice Pizza, however studiedly bizarre that was. And for pure age-gap craziness, we can always look up Jennifer Lawrence\u2019s legendary encounter with Jack Nicholson on Oscar night in 2013. But there are some great scenes, chiefly one in which Maddie, stark naked, comes up to some bullies on the beach who have stolen her clothes while she and Percy were skinny dipping and proceeds to beat them up. There is also Maddie\u2019s generational dismay in crashing a high-school party to confront Percy after an argument. It shows what a comedy turn Lawrence can still be. \u2022 No Hard Feelings is released on 21 June in the UK, 22 June in Australia and 23 June in the US."}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db51e", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/21/transpennine-express-services-worse-under-state-owned-olr", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "TransPennine Express services \u2018worse\u2019 under state-owned OLR", "lead": "Operator, which covers trains across north of England and southern Scotland, cancelled more than 90 trains in a day this month", "author": "Gwyn Topham Transport correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 11:48:19", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.989352", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/29c6d6992b214c3f14ca5663220f59b6c79af862/0_91_3500_2101/500.jpg", "body": "The TransPennine Express train service has got \u201cworse rather than better\u201d since transferring to the state-owned operator of last resort (OLR), according to the rail minister, Huw Merriman. The government announced last month that the service, which covers trains across the north of England and into southern Scotland, would be run by the state after the expiration of a contract with the FirstGroup-owned private operator TransPennine Express on 28 May. The operator failed to run more than a quarter of trains at the start of the year as passengers experienced disruption, cancellations and a decline in the extent and reliability of the service. Its performance had improved since then but has dipped again, with more than 90 trains cancelled in a day at the start of June. Merriman said it was \u201cno reflection on that team\u201d from OLR who had taken over, and who had previously stepped in to rescue the neighbouring Northern franchise. Most staff, bar the managing director, were transferred over, but scarce drivers with route knowledge who were not required to work their notice were lost. Speaking to the Commons transport select committee, the minister said the decision to bring in OLR was taken because he did not believe FirstGroup\u2019s operator could work with the train drivers\u2019 union Aslef to restore services. While the service, which is still branded TransPennine Express, had started to show improvement, he said: \u201cI took the view that the plan couldn\u2019t be deliverable unless a rest day working agreement was in place.\u201d Merriman said: \u201cOnly 50% of drivers have full route knowledge \u2026 It takes 18 months to train a driver, and because they are all driving rather than training up others, we were only going to be able to train all the drivers up if we got back to the position in December 2021 where we had an agreement that unions could work overtime.\u201d The new management team and Aslef have now agreed to restart rest day working, he said, although it will be delayed due to a week of industrial action in July as part of the national pay dispute. Merriman said: \u201cI\u2019ve got great faith in their ability to turn this around, but we always said the issue was not necessarily with the management but with third parties \u2026 It appears Aslef have had a reset moment themselves and I welcome that and believe that will make things better.\u201d On the wider rail dispute, Merriman admitted that the government was \u201ccurrently stuck\u201d and said an offer to unions was \u201con the table\u201d. Earlier, speaking to LBC radio, the RMT leader, Mick Lynch, said they were not any closer to a resolution. Lynch said: \u201cThe government have locked down this dispute \u2026 It\u2019s very likely there will be more strike action by the RMT. There\u2019s no resolution at the moment, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d Meanwhile, Merriman said proposals for a new station in Bradford would be announced next week, when the Department for Transport responds to select committee criticisms of its integrated rail plan. The plan, announced in 2021, outraged northern leaders by missing out the city in downgraded high-speed connections."}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db51f", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/21/bank-of-england-interest-rates-inflation-unchanged", "primaryCategory": "business", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Bank poised to hike interest rates as inflation remains unchanged at 8.7%", "lead": "OONS figures show stabilising energy prices were offset by rises in cost of air fares, holidays and secondhand cars", "author": "Richard Partington Economics correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 11:41:40", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.989369", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/6558a3d89c257ccccaf6a2537cdb0c57ac6e41b0/0_118_4000_2400/500.jpg", "body": "Borrowers have been put on notice for further Bank of England interest rate rises after inflation in the UK unexpectedly remained stuck at 8.7% in May, adding to the pressure on households suffering a surge in mortgage costs. Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed that annual inflation as measured by the consumer prices index was unchanged last month from the rate in April. City economists had forecast a figure of 8.4%. In a shock report that underscored the challenge facing the central bank to curb the highest rates of inflation in decades, energy prices stabilising at record levels were offset by a sharp rise in the cost of air fares and package holidays as consumers rushed to book overseas summer travel. Rising prices for secondhand cars, live music events and video games also contributed to inflation remaining high. Financial markets reacted to the figures by betting that the Bank would increase rates on Thursday by at least a quarter-point from the current level of 4.5%, with a 50/50 chance of a tougher hike of half a percentage point to 5%. The central bank has already pushed through 12 consecutive rate hikes since December 2021, when borrowing costs had been set at a record low of 0.1% to support the economy through the Covid pandemic. Core inflation \u2013 a measure that excludes volatile food, energy, alcohol and tobacco prices, and which is closely watched by the Bank \u2013 rose from 6.8% in April to 7.1% in May, the highest level since 1992. The government is under growing pressure to intervene to help millions of households facing a \u201cticking timebomb\u201d of higher mortgage payments before the general election. Figures from the data provider Moneyfacts showed that the average interest rate on a two-year fixed residential mortgage rose to 6.15% on Wednesday, the highest level since Liz Truss\u2019s disastrous mini-budget last autumn. Underscoring the financial pain for millions of housheolds, the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank warned that almost 1.4m mortgage holders would see 20% of their disposable income erased by the surge in borrowing costs. It said the heaviest blow would be reserved for those under the age of 40 with larger mortgages, and that households in London and the south-east of England, where property prices are typically higher than the national average, would be worst hit. The latest inflation reading is likely to embarrass Rishi Sunak, who promised to halve inflation to about 5% before the end of this year. Concerns are growing about the persistence of the cost of living crisis as prices continue to rise at rates that are among the fastest in three decades. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, said he recognised that inflation was hurting families and businesses across the country, but he dismissed calls for government intervention. \u201cOur plan to halve the rate this year is the best way we can keep costs and interest rates down,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will not hesitate in our resolve to support the Bank of England as it seeks to squeeze inflation out of our economy, while also providing targeted support with the cost of living.\u201d Hunt said he had spoken to the consumer champion Martin Lewis ahead of a meeting with banks this Friday \u201cto ensure banks are living up to the commitments\u201d agreed in December to help mortgage borrowers struggling with payments and to discuss \u201cwhat more they can do to help\u201d. The shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said the government was failing to tackle inflation despite Sunak\u2019s promise to halve it. \u201cThis Tory government can\u2019t get a grip of this problem because they are the problem \u2013 13 years of the Tories and their disastrous mini-budget are damaging our economic security and leaving families worse off,\u201d she said. According to the latest snapshot from the ONS, certain bigger musical acts playing at concert venues last month contributed to a sharp rise in the price of buying a gig ticket, drawing parallels with Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Stockholm concert last month being blamed for high Swedish inflation. Economists said it was unlikely that the singer had caused the increase in Britain, because her tour came to London in late May, after the cut-off point for the ONS to gather price information. The statistics body declined to identify which acts had contributed to the rise in particular. Falling petrol and diesel prices for motorists led to the largest downward contribution to inflation, while pressure from food and drink prices eased after they increased by less in May than in the same month a year earlier. Prices remain high and are still rising fast, adding to pressure on struggling households. Although food and drink inflation slowed from 19% in April, it only dropped to 18.3%, still among the fastest rates in decades. The figures highlighted the UK\u2019s position as an international outlier with the highest inflation in the G7. The rate is more than three times the figure in the US and significantly higher than in several EU countries. There are growing speculation that high interest rates could tip the UK economy into recession as households suffering from a sharp rise in borrowing costs pull back on spending. Karen Ward, the chief market strategist at the US bank JP Morgan, who is also an adviser to Hunt, told Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that the Bank of England could be forced to engineer the conditions for a recession. \u201cThe difficulty for the Bank of England \u2013 I mean, no one envies them their job at the moment \u2013 is, they have to therefore create a recession,\u201d she said."}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db520", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/21/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-483-of-the-invasion", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 483 of the invasion", "lead": "Zelenskiy urges help to rebuild country as UK and EU unveil reconstruction packages at London conference", "author": "Alexandra Topping and agencies", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 11:37:22", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.989386", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/5957c90e662a4dd69c5d0ec2c6c0f06697c918ef/0_125_5770_3461/500.jpg", "body": "Volodymyr Zelenskiy has urged western leaders to help rebuild his war-torn country, as he hailed the reconstruction project as a crucial part of its fight for freedom.

The Flying Kangaroo\u2019s drop from fifth to 17th in the World Airline Awards\u2019 2023 edition, announced at the Paris Air Show, was one of the most significant fluctuations among global carriers. Qatar Airways, which had the No 1 ranking in 2022, dropped to second, swapping places with Singapore Airlines. The Doha-based carrier did however win the award for world\u2019s best business class offering. Japan\u2019s All Nippon Airways rose one spot to third, swapping places with Emirates which dropped to fourth, while Turkish Airlines and Air France each jumped one place to sixth, seventh respectively. Elsewhere, British Airways dropped seven places over the past year, from 11th to 18th. The rankings were released by Skytrax, which are based on customer surveys it conducts. It claims the results are independent and impartial, but exact methodology is unclear. A Qantas spokesperson acknowledged 2022 was a difficult year for the airline. \u201cThis survey started nine months ago when it was clear our service wasn\u2019t back to our best,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cA lot has changed since and if you ran this survey today, the results would be very different. We\u2019ve worked hard to improve and the feedback from customers shows we are,\u201d the spokesperson said. The dip in rankings follows a post-pandemic deterioration in Qantas\u2019 service, including surging rates of mishandled baggage, delays and cancellations, in conjunction with soaring air fares, which also saw Qantas plunge 31 places to be Australia\u2019s 40th most trusted brand last year. However, Qantas remains top in rankings of the world\u2019s safest airlines. The 2023 rankings cover surveys from the year known for \u201cthe summer of lost luggage\u201d, in which travellers across the world told stories of disappearing bags as the aviation industry struggled to keep up with the post-pandemic rebound in demand. In 2022, the rate of mishandled baggage almost doubled globally, with 26m pieces of luggage delayed, lost or damaged. The mishandled luggage rate soared to 7.6 bags per 1,000 passengers in 2022, up from 4.35 in 2021 and 5.6 in 2019, according to the aviation data company SITA\u2019s annual insights report. For international flights, the mishandling rate was 19.3 bags per 1,000 passengers, more than eight times higher than the rate of 2.4 for domestic flights."}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db522", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/21/uk-government-debt-above-100-per-cent-of-gdp-first-time-since-1961", "primaryCategory": "business", "subCategories": "test", "title": "UK government debt rises above 100% of GDP for first time since 1961", "lead": "In blow to Rishi Sunak\u2019s plans to cut taxes before general election, net debt reached \u00a32.6tn at of end of May", "author": "Phillip Inman", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 11:26:14", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.989439", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/55d215f96a652ef2ff528144d0f24a31eda4ee68/0_120_3620_2172/500.jpg", "body": "The UK\u2019s total government debt pile in May reached more than 100% of annual national income for the first time since 1961 as state borrowing more than doubled, according to official figures. In a blow to Rishi Sunak\u2019s plans to cut taxes before the general election, which is expected next year, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said net debt reached \u00a32.6tn as of the end of May, estimated at 100.1% of gross domestic product (GDP). It is the first time the ratio of debt to GDP has risen above 100% since March 1961, apart from a brief spike at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic that was later revised down because of stronger GDP figures. The increase in total debt came after government borrowing soared to \u00a320bn in May, pushed higher by the cost of energy support schemes, inflation-linked benefit payments and interest payments on debt. The borrowing figure was \u00a33bn lower than in April but \u00a310.7bn higher than a year ago and the second highest May borrowing since monthly records began in 1993. A rise in tax receipts offset the increase in debt payments. Economists said the chancellor Jeremy Hunt\u2019s drive to cut spending across Whitehall appeared to be having an effect. But the combination of higher income and cuts in day-to-day spending was unable to prevent a steep rise in the monthly deficit. Hunt said the government had been taking \u201cdifficult decisions\u201d to balance the books after the pandemic and Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. \u201cWe rightly spent billions to protect families and businesses from the worst impacts of the pandemic and [Vladimir] Putin\u2019s energy crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it would be manifestly unfair to leave future generations with a tab they cannot repay. That\u2019s why we have taken difficult but necessary decisions to balance the books in order to halve inflation this year, grow the economy and reduce debt.\u201d Martin Beck, the chief economic adviser to the EY ITEM Club, said that while there were only two months of figures for the current financial year, borrowing was already running \u00a32.1bn above the most recent estimates by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the Treasury\u2019s independent forecaster. Beck said: \u201cWe expect this gap to widen as we move through 2023-24. The likelihood that GDP and inflation will be stronger than the OBR expects is positive for tax revenues. However, this will be more than offset by the upward pressures on spending. \u201cHigher inflation combined with higher short- and long-term interest rates will significantly increase the level of debt interest payments, and borrowing could overshoot the OBR\u2019s forecast by as much as \u00a320bn by the end of the fiscal year.\u201d TaxPayers\u2019 Alliance, a right-of-centre pressure group, said Hunt should respond with even deeper cuts to public spending to free up funds for tax cuts. Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said financial markets would only tolerate the government reviving tax cuts after the debacle of last autumn\u2019s mini-budget if inflation had fallen sharply and interest rates had \u201crisen to a lesser extent\u201d than the markets currently envisaged. He said figures for May that showed the consumer prices index remained at 8.7% cast doubt on whether inflation would have \u201cfallen sufficiently far by the autumn statement for the chancellor to consider any loosening of the fiscal plans\u201d. Inflation has already cost the government billions of pounds in extra spending. The ONS estimates that the Treasury spent about \u00a31.5bn on energy support schemes in May. These include the energy price guarantee (EPG) that caps average bills at \u00a32,500 a year and the energy bills discount scheme (EBDS). The schemes are estimated to have cost the UK \u00a329.7bn in the first six months alone. The EPG was initially set to run from October to March but was extended until July. It will be replaced by Ofgem\u2019s price cap for average annual energy bills on 1 July, which has been set at \u00a32,074. The figures also revealed that the interest payable on central government debt was \u00a37.7bn in May, which was \u00a3200m less than a year ago but \u00a3700m more than was forecast by the OBR. Borrowing in the first two months of this financial year has reached \u00a342.9bn \u2013 \u00a319.6bn more than in the same two-month period a year ago."}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db523", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/21/manchester-city-begin-talks-over-25m-deal-for-mateo-kovacic-from-chelsea", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Manchester City agree \u00a325m deal to sign Mateo Kovacic from Chelsea", "lead": "Manchester City have agreed a deal to sign Mateo Kovacic from Chelsea for a fee of \u00a325m plus \u00a35m in add-ons", "author": "Fabrizio Romano and Sachin Nakrani", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 11:23:23", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.989457", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/962101f1cdf06004074e6e8806971cafea1f1c4b/0_101_3025_1815/500.jpg", "body": "Manchester City have agreed a deal to sign Mateo Kovacic from Chelsea for a fee of \u00a325m plus \u00a35m in add-ons.

That bill will only be getting higher, but as a conference in London on the reconstruction and recovery of the country begins, humanitarians and political leaders have warned that bricks and mortar are not all that is needed. What has been pledged so far? The EU pumped \u20ac30bn (\u00a326bn) into Ukraine in the last year, diverting cash from energy and cohesion funds to respond to the crisis. On Tuesday it pledged a further \u20ac50bn in loans and grants, with the UK and the US following suit with a promise of $3bn and $1.3bn respectively in financial supports. Is it enough? No. The World Bank\u2019s estimate represents three times Ukraine\u2019s GDP and the money pledged by the EU, UK and the US will be disbursed over a number of years. The \u20ac50bn in EU money is spread out over four years. The goal is to help stabilise the country\u2019s finances not build back blown up towns and cities. But it will go a long way to meet Ukraine\u2019s request for up to $40bn for the first part of a programme being dubbed a \u201cGreen Marshall plan\u201d. Can physical reconstruction begin? How can you rebuild a country when it is still at war? \u201cYou don\u2019t know how long the war will be there, whether what you invest in will be destroyed the week after. So it\u2019s very challenging,\u201d Odile Renaud-Basso, the president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), told reporters in Brussels recently. How has the country been functioning up to now? Contributions to Ukraine\u2019s defence resources have dominated the headlines in terms of international support for the fight against Russia. Day to day needs have been put at \u20ac3bn a month \u2013 half of which has been paid by the EU. Financing from the EBRD, set up in 1991 to help secure financial stability in post-cold-war central and eastern Europe, has enabled salaries of teachers, civil servants, doctors and nurses to continue to be paid. The bank expects to invest \u20ac3bn this year and is hoping to put together guarantees that can leverage about \u20ac12-13bn in additional funding from the public and private sector. What about the bereaved and the bombed? Financial systems are already in place for state compensation for those whose homes have been bombed with a government app, DIAA, allowing rapid applications. But long-term human capital is the key to recovery, Ukraine\u2019s ambassador to the EU, Vsevolod Chentsov, said this week in Brussels, with investment not just in factories, agriculture and IT but in mental health. A director of the Danish Red Cross, Peter Klanso, told a conference that there were an estimated 9 million people directly impacted by the war, both soldiers and civilians. He said the poor and the marginalised would be \u201cfurther marginalised\u201d if their voices were not heard. And those on the recovery leadership planning must find a way of reaching them too. The leaders of the EU will meet next week and are expected to reiterate this point, restating the need for \u201cpsychological and psychosocial rehabilitation\u201d alongside bricks and mortar."}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db525", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jun/21/how-to-make-the-perfect-pissaladiere-recipe-felicity-cloake", "primaryCategory": "food", "subCategories": "test", "title": "How to make the perfect pissaladi\u00e8re \u2013 recipe | Felicity Cloake's How to make the perfect\u2026", "lead": "The definitive guide to making this salty-sweet, deliciously oily yet crisp and fluffy Italian-French repast \u2013 think onion, olive and anchovy pizza", "author": "Felicity Cloake", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 11:00:38", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.989497", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/f9b72c138c428ea785d91e607367b6df578390b1/0_1693_3761_2257/500.jpg", "body": "Visitors to the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur don\u2019t need to set foot in a museum to clock that the region was for a long time under Italian control. In fact, it became part of France only as recently as 1860, which explains why the traditional dialect, architecture and, most obviously, cooking all have a distinctly Ligurian feel (and why there\u2019s a statue of Giuseppe Garibaldi in Nice, his birthplace). It\u2019s unsurprising, then, that pissaladi\u00e8re, \u201ca typically Ni\u00e7oise hors d\u2019oeuvre\u201d, according to the city\u2019s disgraced former mayor Jacques M\u00e9decin, bears more than a passing resemblance to pizza. (Indeed, food writer Caroline Craig, whose family hails from farther west, fancifully dates the Proven\u00e7al fondness for the stuff to the Roman occupation, while Jonathan Meades believes that Marseille does better pizza than Naples). But, as Noble Rot Soho\u2019s chef Alex Jackson observes, whatever you liken it to, pissaladi\u00e8re is \u201cmuch more than the sum of its parts. To call it \u2018onion tart [or pizza] with anchovies and olives\u2019 somehow underplays it\u201d. Salty-sweet and deliciously oily, it\u2019s ideal cut into small squares and paired with a well-chilled aperitif or, served in more generous wedges, with a green salad. Sunshine optional. The base Craig explains in Provence: The Cookbook that, \u201clike pizza, truly authentic pissaladi\u00e8re is made with bread dough\u201d, something confirmed by M\u00e9decin (who, when he wasn\u2019t peddling far-right views, managed to pen a more palatable cookbook, published in English as Cuisine Ni\u00e7oise). In agreement are chef Paul Bocuse and the Ma\u00eetres Cuisiniers de France\u2019s 1984 collection, Cuisine du Terroir. A recipe from Alex Benvenuto\u2019s Carnets de Cuisine du Comt\u00e9 de Nice, written in collaboration with the committee responsible for ensuring the preservation of local gastronomy \u2013 which in 2019 was declared part of France\u2019s cultural heritage, because the French take such serious things seriously \u2013 also uses bread dough. But not everyone agrees with these authorities: Jackson, whose previous restaurant Sardine lives on through his cookbook of the same name, writes that: \u201cI have heard many arguments for the use of puff pastry for a pissaladi\u00e8re, and I have even tasted a few pizza-like numbers made with semolina flour, but for me a shortcrust does the job perfectly. I make mine very buttery.\u201d Marseille-based Meades, meanwhile, who uses puff pastry, describes pissaladi\u00e8re in his book The Plagiarist in the Kitchen as \u201coften closer to tarte fine than to a \u2018real\u2019 pizza\u201d, adding: \u201cBetter always trumps real. This is better.\u201d Vexed questions of \u201cauthenticity\u201d aside, just about any base would be improved by the oniony topping, but, much as I love Jackson\u2019s very buttery pastry (in fact, when I go back to the samples, I find one tester, who shall remain anonymous, has removed most of the crust), the meeting of oily onion and fluffy dough is so especially pleasing that I\u2019m going to stick with the traditional choice of bread. Craig\u2019s richer recipe is particularly good (interestingly, the late Alastair Little deploys a focaccia dough in his 1999 book Soho Cooking on the basis that, \u201coriginating in Liguria just across the border from Nice, [it] seemed apposite\u201d). The onions Here\u2019s where British readers might need to compromise with authenticity. Jackson notes that \u201cthe best onions for a pissaladi\u00e8re are expensive, small white onions from Italy and France \u2013 not a spring onion, but sweet and delicate nonetheless. When cooked very slowly in olive oil, they are remarkably mild, even sweeter and strangely delicious for something so simple.\u201d Like Meades, Bocuse simply specifies sweet onions in his Regional French Cooking, cook Lulu Peyraud favoured \u201clarge, white summer onions, very sweet with a high water content\u201d, according to Richard Olney in their co-authored collection, Lulu\u2019s Proven\u00e7al Table, and Benvenuto \u201coignons paille\u201d, which Craig\u2019s mother Fran\u00e7oise informs me are big, juicy and flatter than the usual yellow sort, but which prove elusive in London. I don\u2019t have any luck with Jackson\u2019s expensive, small white onions, either, but I do try Peyraud\u2019s larger white ones, which I find a bit bland, and, on a whim, red onions, which prove rather too jammy, bringing back memories of the red-onion marmalade craze of the 1990s. A certain level of sweetness is desirable as a contrast with the salty layer above, but it shouldn\u2019t be the predominant flavour. Though heretical, if the stern instruction of many that they \u201cshould remain absolutely uncoloured\u201d, as Peyraud puts it, is anything to go by, the very lightly browned onions on top of Craig\u2019s pissaladi\u00e8re prove the most popular with my testers; ignore the warnings \u2013 they won\u2019t burn in the oven, as long as you keep an eye on them. (If the thought fills you with purist disgust, take the onions off the heat once the water has evaporated.) Benvenuto\u2019s recipe cooks the onions for an hour, Jackson\u2019s for 90 minutes, Craig\u2019s for a minimum of hour and 45 minutes and Meades two hours, so you\u2019ll be relieved to know that, as long as you lubricate them liberally with oil (Benvenuto recommends 100ml for 2kg onions; Craig uses the same amount of lovely butter*) and cover the pan so they steam in their own juices, they don\u2019t require much of your attention at this stage. As onions, pans and hobs all differ, however, you\u2019ll need to judge for yourself when they\u2019re soft enough to form \u201ca semi puree\u201d, as Peyraud (or Olney) puts it, and be more present in the next step, when the water is boiled off and the sugars caramelised. Bocuse, Benvenuto and the French masterchefs add a bouquet garni to the pan (Jackson and Craig stick with thyme alone), while the latter two add garlic as well. Like the butter, these seasonings are enhancements rather than essentials, but who doesn\u2019t benefit from a little enhancement? I\u2019m afraid this recipe does involve a lot of peeling and slicing (a mandoline \u2013 with a safety guard! \u2013 is advisable), and there\u2019s no getting around that: M\u00e9decin cautions readers to be wary of \u201cthe mass-produced versions of pissaladi\u00e8re that are sold on street stalls or \u2018drugstores\u2019 in the south of France \u2013 the layer of onions is usually paper -thin. A proper pissaladi\u00e8re of the kind still found in Ni\u00e7oise food markets will boast a layer of onion at least half as thick as the base, if it is made of bread dough, and equally thick, if it is made of shortcrust pastry.\u201d So don\u2019t be dismayed by the amount of onion in the recipe below \u2013 I can\u2019t promise that slicing onions will be a mindful activity, but I do believe the results are well worth the tears. * Up here in the frozen north, it\u2019s easy to assume that Mediterranean regions cook purely with olive oil, but, as Craig explains, somewhat crossly: \u201cthere is no imaginary wall below Lyon that prevents cows from entering Provence, and butter continues to be extensively used in dishes well beyond the usual cakes and bakes\u201d. The topping There\u2019s almost no dissent here: just olives, preferably the salted black sort sold as \u201c\u00e0 la Grecque\u201d for maximum flavour punch, and anchovies. Jackson, Peyraud and Benvenuto all specify the salted variety, which have become strangely hard to procure, in London at least. Plumper, with a firmer, more fishy texture, if you can\u2019t find them, I can assure you that their oil-packed cousins will shine here, too (I suspect their oily bath actually helps keep them softer in the heat of the oven). As well as using the anchovies on top, Meades stirs a generous helping into the onions as they cook, which gives them a pleasant, savoury edge, but spoils the sweet and salty contrast between the different elements of the topping. One for real anchovy fiends only. More controversially, Bocuse adds a layer of tomato sauce, which is the kind of thing you can only get away with if you have more Michelin stars than you can shake a spoon at \u2013 because tomatoes belong in Ligurian pissadella, not Ni\u00e7oise pissaladi\u00e8re. (That said, don\u2019t tell the French, but it is quite nice.) Traditionally, instead of anchovies, pissaladi\u00e8re was smeared with a cloth dipped in pissala, or fish puree, before going into the oven, but pissala is pretty thin on the ground these days. M\u00e9decin helpfully explains that, authentically, it is made with \u201cpalaia [small fry] of sardines and anchovies\u201d, but, \u201cbecause of the difficulty in obtaining palaia, there is an increasing tendency to make pissala with fully-grown anchovies \u2026 though no self-respecting connoisseur would touch [it]\u201d. His recipe takes a month, and requires 2kg of baby fish. Note that, of course, this dish is easily made vegan by simply leaving out the butter and fish; I\u2019d substitute strips of roast pepper on top for a different, but equally good result. Also, it\u2019s very hard to give exact timings for either the dough or the onions, because both depend on the conditions, so leave this for a day when you have enough time that you don\u2019t have to rush, either. Perfect pissaladi\u00e8re Prep 45 min Cook 2\u00bd hr Serves 4-6 For the base (or use 300g shortcrust or puff pastry) 250g strong white bread flour \u00bd tsp salt 3g fast-action yeast 1 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for greasing For the topping 1kg onions 1 garlic clove 3 tbsp olive oil A knob of butter (optional) 1 sprig each fresh rosemary and thyme, plus 1 bay leaf (all optional) Salt About 10 anchovy fillets About 14 dry black olives Extra-virgin olive oil, to serve Peel, trim, halve and finely slice the onions using a mandoline, sharp knife or the slicing attachment on a food processor. Peel the garlic and roughly crush it with the flat of a large knife. Put a large, heavy-bottomed pan or pot for which you have a tight-fitting lid on a low heat, add the oil and butter, immediately followed by the onions, herbs (if using), garlic and a pinch of salt. Stir to coat the onions with the oil, then clap on the lid and leave to cook, stirring occasionally, for about an hour, or until they\u2019re very soft. Meanwhile, if you\u2019re making a bread dough base, stir the flour, salt and yeast in a large bowl, then add the oil and just enough water (probably a little under 150ml) to bring it together into a coherent, but not sticky or floury dough. Tip out on to a lightly oiled surface, oil your hands, and knead the dough until it\u2019s springy, smooth and elastic. Lightly oil the bowl, put the dough back in, cover and leave in a draught-free place until it\u2019s roughly doubled in size \u2013 this should take about 90 minutes, but judge by eye rather than time. Take the lid off the onions, turn up the heat very slightly and cook, stirring frequently to ensure they don\u2019t catch, until the liquid has evaporated and the onions have turned a light golden brown. Take off the heat and leave to cool. Lightly oil a baking tray and heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Knock the air out of the dough, then, on a greased surface, roll it out into a roughly \u00bdcm-thick rectangle. Spread the onions in a thick layer on top, leaving a border all around the edge. Cut the anchovies in half lengthways, to make thin strips, use these to create a diamond pattern all over the top of the onions, then pop an olive in the centre of each diamond.

As Narendra Modi arrives in Washington DC on Wednesday \u2013 the capital of a country he was once prohibited from visiting for almost 10 years \u2013 he will join the ranks of Winston Churchill, Nelson Mandela and Volodymyr Zelenskiy as one of the few leaders to address a joint session of Congress more than once. Statements from US officials ahead of the visit have been rapturous on the subject of US-India relations, praising the \u201csignificant defence partnership\u201d and describing it as \u201ca unique connection between the world\u2019s oldest and largest democracies\u201d. Before his departure from India, Modi said: \u201cThis special invitation is a reflection of the vigour and vitality of the partnership between our democracies.\u201d Yet this trip \u2013 Modi\u2019s sixth to the US since he came to power in 2014 but the first where a full state dinner will be given in his honour \u2013 is expected to yield more than good optics for the Indian prime minister. Many expect it to further crystallise ties between two countries and boost a relationship that has been on an upwards trajectory for two decades \u2013 even as they remain fundamentally opposed on several key issues. Defence, technology, security, AI, telecoms, visas, manufacturing and space are all said to be on the table. Meanwhile, the issues of the erosion of democracy in India and the shrinking space for dissent and civil society under Modi are unlikely to be discussed in depth. Now the world\u2019s most populous country \u2013 with 1.4 billion people and rising \u2013 and the world\u2019s fifth largest economy, India\u2019s growing prominence, both economically and geopolitically, makes it a country that the Biden administration \u2013 like those of Trump, Obama and Bush before it \u2013 could not ignore. Yet most experts say that it is China that has been the fundamental driver of this growing alliance; and as Modi touches down in DC, mutual concerns over Beijing\u2019s aggressive, expansionist agenda have never been more acute. Since Modi last visited the US in 2019, when Donald Trump was in the White House, China\u2019s actions along its 2,100-mile (3,500km) border with India have become increasingly antagonistic. In 2020, the two sides came the closest they had been to war in 70 years when troops clashed along the Himalayan border in Ladakh, killing dozens of soldiers, after Chinese troops encroached on land typically patrolled by India. Since then, China has built up vast amounts of infrastructure along disputed territory and shown little desire to disengage in key areas of contention. This has coincided with a shift in Washington\u2019s relationship with China, from that of strategic competitor to rival or outright threat that must be deterred and contained. The bipartisan consensus is that India is a crucial geopolitical, and even economic, counterweight to China\u2019s dominance in the Indo-Pacific region. \u201cIn Washington, the hope is to build out an extended framework of deterrence to try and keep China in check,\u201d said Milan Vaishnav, director of the south Asia program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \u201cBoth geographically as well as strategically and economically, India has become a linchpin in this framework.\u201d This geopolitical alignment over China \u2013 which also drove the formation of the Quad, a security grouping of India, the US, Australia and Japan \u2013 has led to an unprecedented flourishing of security and defence cooperation between the US and India. There has been increased intelligence sharing and joint military exercises in the Himalayas close to the China border, and Modi\u2019s US visit is expected to yield several defence deals for surveillance technology and drones. India has embraced Washington\u2019s new willingness to share its advanced technology and cyber resources, given that its own technological advancements have lagged far behind China\u2019s. Modi will be hoping to close a landmark deal allowing US giant General Electric to produce jet engines in India, to power Indian military aircraft. It will be the first time such a collaboration on military technology has taken place, sending a clear message to China. While there is little expectation of trade deals between the two countries, trade between India and the US reached a record $191bn in 2022, making the US India\u2019s largest trading partner. There is an interest on both sides in building up India as an economic and manufacturing alternative for big western companies to wean it off its dependency on China \u2013 95% of iPhones are currently made in China, for example, but Apple is slowly shifting manufacturing to India, which is expected to produce 25% of iPhones by 2025. The limits of a US-India relationship Yet for all the gushing rhetoric about being \u201cpartners of first resort\u201d, experts have also been quick to point out the limitations of the US-India relationship. Writing in Foreign Affairs, Ashley Tellis, one of the key negotiators for the US nuclear deal with India, warned that even as the Biden administration continued to invest heavily in India, it should not have any \u201cdelusions of New Delhi becoming a comrade-in-arms during some future crisis with Beijing\u201d, particularly in terms of India actively taking the US side if China invades Taiwan. \u201cIndia will never be the kind of ally that the Americans have found in the Anglosphere: this is not going to be Australia, Canada or the United Kingdom,\u201d said Avinash Paliwal, an associate professor in international relations at Soas University of London. \u201cIndia thinks of itself as a power on its own merit and it has its own geographical compulsions, its own kind of power and its own aspirations on a regional and global scale. There is a meeting of minds and interests at the moment but that\u2019s not something that will last for ever.\u201d Another issue that looms large over Modi\u2019s visit is that of human rights, in particular the democratic backsliding and the attacks on minorities in India since his populist, Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came to power. They are allegations that have haunted Modi even before he was prime minister, when his alleged role in the Gujarat riots led to him being banned from the US for a decade. They have been well documented by the Biden administration. Last year, the state department\u2019s report on international religious freedom documented the challenges to freedom of expression, extrajudicial killings and discrimination against minority groups in Modi\u2019s India, prompting India to call the report \u201cflawed and biased\u201d. More recently, the Commission on International Religious Freedom, a bipartisan agency appointed by Congress, recommended in May that the state department designate India a country of concern for \u201congoing and egregious religious freedom violations\u201d. Before Modi\u2019s visit, Amnesty International called on the US to confront India on the deterioration of human rights and Human Rights Watch organised a screening for US policymakers of a BBC documentary that was critical of Modi, and which was banned in India earlier, as a deliberate reminder of the attacks on freedom of speech under his government. Yet no US president since Bill Clinton has been forthright on human rights in India, and though the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, did make a rare reference to a rise in \u201chuman rights abuses\u201d last year, the Biden administration is expected to continue to keep quiet on any discomfort it may have over Modi\u2019s populist, religious nationalist politics in the name of building strategic security ties. Already several White House officials have made recent references to India\u2019s \u201cvibrant democracy\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely to come up, at least in this round of conversations,\u201d said Paliwal. \u201cThe Americans are OK doing business with quasi- or undemocratic countries and so I don\u2019t see the democratic decline in India dislocating the glue that is binding the top levels of the two governments or preventing them coming together to deal with the China question.\u201d Russia, which was briefly a source of contention between India and the US, is also unlikely to be brought up by Biden. India\u2019s historic ties to Russia, which provides almost 80% of its defence and weapons, have ensured that Modi has refused to condemn Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, instead taking a neutral stance, and in the meantime India has become the biggest buyer of cheap Russian oil. While there was initial pushback from Washington, the consensus among analysts is that the Biden administration has now accepted India\u2019s deep-rooted relationship Russia; some believe it has even hastened US cooperation with India on defence to help the country become less dependent on Russia. But for Modi, this visit can also serve a more personal political purpose. In the US, the Indian diaspora is now one of the largest immigrant groups \u2013 second only to Mexicans \u2013 and its members occupy influential positions in tech, business, banking and law, and some have even become well-known faces in Hollywood. Emphasising these people-to-people ties, and the vital contributions Indians have made in the US, is also likely to be a prominent part of Modi\u2019s trip. With India\u2019s next general election less than a year away, the optics of Modi being given full honours by the US president are also likely to play well to the electorate back home. Modi is expected to win a third term in office and his popularity is credited in part to an image among voters that he has made India into a respected player on the world stage and is now courted by powerful western leaders. \u201cSince independence, India has seen itself as an international power but felt it did not get the recognition or role it deserved,\u201d said Tanvi Madan, director of the India Project at the Brookings Institution in Washington DC. \u201cBut Modi seems to believe that endorsements from the US, far from generating a backlash, generate a sense of optimism that this is India\u2019s moment.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db527", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/21/behind-bars-how-rap-lyrics-are-being-used-to-convict-black-british-men", "primaryCategory": "music", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Behind bars: how rap lyrics are being used to convict Black British men", "lead": "<strong>Exclusive</strong>: Crown Prosecution Service claims no one is convicted solely via lyrics, but shocking new research finds juries being shown music and dance as evidence of guilt", "author": "Will Pritchard", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 11:00:38", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.989536", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/f0045be536a4c6094238d7390a3214482613730d/0_437_5050_3030/500.jpg", "body": "On 6 February 2020, around 11.15am, a 16-year-old boy stepped out of Brighton\u2019s Regent Hotel and walked towards the terraced green of Regency Square. He had with him a handful of small, pebble-sized packages, some bound in blue plastic, the others in white. The different colours let him know which contained heroin, and which cocaine. Plain clothes police officers watching the boy soon discovered another 115 similar wraps in the hotel room he had been staying in. Just over a year later, at the crown court in Lewes, a jury convicted the boy, who had been sent to Brighton by a north London gang known as the Mali Boys, of two counts of being concerned in the supply of Class A drugs. James (not his real name) had been placed into care early in his teens, the court had heard, and subjected to abuse in the years before that. He\u2019d been arrested in the past, and had moved and sold drugs for other gangs from north London, venturing as far as Norfolk with their packages. James is also autistic. His lawyers suggested this would have made him more susceptible to being drawn into criminality by these gangs. He and two other young men admitted to selling drugs in Brighton, but claimed in their defence that they were victims of modern slavery \u2013 exploited by the Mali Boys to distribute its drugs and collect the proceeds. The two other teenagers were acquitted, but James\u2019s defence was rejected by the prosecution. The court had been shown a rap video in which James could be seen dancing while alleged Mali Boys members traded verses over a brooding drill beat. This proved, the prosecuting barrister argued, that the boy was a willing associate of the gang. The boy said this wasn\u2019t the case. He said he\u2019d joined in with the filming because he thought it would be fun. He didn\u2019t know what the song was about. He was just dancing. James is just one of more than 240 people in the UK \u2013 almost all young, black men \u2013 whose fate in court over the past three years has been decided in part by their taste in rap music. Rap materials making their way into UK courtrooms can be professionally recorded tracks, but often consist of little more than throwaway lyrics in iPhone notes or derivative scribbles in teenagers\u2019 notebooks \u2013 still enough for prosecutors to win convictions. When contacted by the Guardian, the Crown Prosecution Service says that it \u201chas never prosecuted anybody solely on the basis of their involvement with drill/rap music\u201d but that \u201cdrill/rap music may be of specific relevance to the case against a suspect, in which case it may be used as evidence.\u201d New research, conducted in partnership with the University of Manchester\u2019s Prosecuting Rap project, has identified more than 70 trials from 2020-2023 in which rap evidence including lyrics, music videos and audio recordings has been used by police and prosecutors to build their cases. Previous research spanning a period five times as long, between 2005 and 2020, uncovered 67 cases. This increased appearance of rap in courtrooms suggests authorities have latched on to the approach as one that can secure convictions with juries \u2013 seemingly without concern for the possibly prejudicial nature of such evidence. For UK police and prosecutors today, \u201cmusic helps open a pathway to conviction\u201d, says Eithne Quinn, professor of cultural studies at the University of Manchester and lead on the Prosecuting Rap project. She\u2019s particularly worried by \u201cthe young age and high average number of defendants in cases in which rap is sought to be used. Children and young adults are being drawn into rap-fuelled group charges in which there is often one principal offence committed by one individual.\u201d In drill rap, performers taunting others and referring in verses, often callously, to specific instances of real-world violence is not unheard of. But even in these cases, it remains a stretch to prove that such wordplay directly results in violence. Those who oppose the use of the practice say that, more often, rap is introduced as a sprinkle of prejudice across proceedings. In James\u2019s case, his mere presence in a video was seemingly enough to colour his character for the court. Following a successful appeal based on the original judge\u2019s mishandling of the modern slavery defence, James\u2019s convictions were quashed. But in a 2020 analysis of earlier use of rap evidence in UK courts, Dr Abenaa Owusu-Bempah, an associate professor of law at the London School of Economics, found just one instance in which the use of such evidence was successfully appealed. High-profile trials like the one currently involving US chart-topping rapper Young Thug draw attention to this issue; Jay-Z is among the artists behind a prominent campaign for rap lyrics not to be admissible as evidence in the US. But in the UK, most instances go unreported, and there could be many more than those uncovered here. Save for the testimony of witnesses, the grousing of barristers and solicitors, or police officers posting about their exploits on social media, researchers are left to rely on the publication of appeal judgments and reports from local media \u2013 neither of which are guaranteed to include mention of rap evidence. James\u2019s case is emblematic of how rap evidence has been used in UK courts over the past three years. Firstly, in that it involves young men (almost half of the cases recorded in the research featured defendants yet to turn 18). Secondly, in that prosecutors relied on a gang narrative to shape their case, an approach often involving controversial joint enterprise laws. And thirdly, in the use of what is known as a \u201cbad character application\u201d to have the Mali Boys music video included in the evidence shown to the jury. These applications are used when prosecutors (or occasionally defence teams) want to introduce evidence of previous offences or, more vaguely, of a \u201cdisposition towards misconduct\u201d. Typically, this would include things such as previous, similar convictions \u2013 but it has also become one of the most common routes by which rap evidence ends up in front of juries. James was alleged to be a gang associate based on his presence in the Mali Boys music video. Definitions of \u201cassociate\u201d, \u201caffiliate\u201d and \u201cmember\u201d \u2013 and the difference between them in relation to gangs \u2013 remain slippery in the justice system, where there is still no consensus on defining what a gang is. This, defence teams say, makes it easier for prosecutors to apply the term in broad strokes, and to benefit from the prejudice it invites. \u201cFew words provoke as much bias among a jury as \u2018gang\u2019,\u201d wrote criminal barrister Oliver Mosley in 2021 (Mosley has prosecuted drill artists himself in the past). The word \u201cdrill\u201d can have a similarly provocative effect: during the 2020 trial of Daniel Lena, the popular rapper Unknown T who had been accused (and was later acquitted) of murder, concerns were raised in court about specific references being made to drill music, owing to the \u201csubstantial prejudice\u201d that mentions of the genre attract. Drawing clear conclusions on the motives of drill rappers \u2013 particularly ones that could form solid evidence \u2013 is made almost impossible by the way in which bold claims, aggressive boasts, local gossip, and provocation are woven into the fabric of the genre. Fans living vicariously through the outlaw tales portrayed in drill songs flock to reaction videos and street gossip channels on YouTube and other social media platforms, further boosting artists\u2019 online clout and notoriety \u2013 and muddying the already grey waters of what might be true and what is not. Documents reviewed by the Guardian show how the comment sections under these channels, as well as discussions on Reddit, are in turn mined for evidence by police officers, in spite of the flimsy, unreliable nature of these sources. James\u2019s case was heard in Lewes, a town in Sussex better known for its vigorous Bonfire Night celebrations than hardcore rap offshoots. This too is indicative of a shift revealed by the Prosecuting Rap research. While the bulk of rap evidence still crops up in London and its network of crown courts, the research uncovers hearings involving rap in locations as widespread as Leicester, Warwick, St Albans and Derby. \u201cWhen we think of the use of rap in court cases, we tend to think first of London and the Met police,\u201d says Quinn, \u201cbut what also emerges is that rap music is actually a courtroom soundtrack across the country.\u201d Trials were also identified in Sheffield, Winchester, Bradford, and Nottingham, as well as major cities including Manchester, Liverpool, and Birmingham. \u201cDisturbingly,\u201d says Quinn, \u201cevidence suggests there is even less oversight and scrutiny of this practice outside of the capital.\u201d Quinn\u2019s highlighting of the Met\u2019s role in the uptake of rap evidence is pertinent. The Prosecuting Rap research reveals a pattern in which police officers are put forward by prosecutors to act as rap experts in court. Typically, these police witnesses will draw links between lyrics and real life crimes, and between music and gang membership. They offer translations of slang and provide their own interpretations of the meaning behind songs and music videos. (Examples of translations seen by the Guardian included inaccuracies, such as the word \u201cting\u201d, despite its breadth of possible meanings in different contexts, being singularly interpreted as \u201cgun\u201d.) The provision of some of these experts can be linked with the Met\u2019s Project Alpha unit, an online surveillance initiative established in 2019 and funded by the Home Office. One of Project Alpha\u2019s core activities involves referring rap videos it deems dangerous to be taken down by YouTube. Last year, according to figures released in response to a Freedom of Information request, 1,825 requests from Project Alpha resulted in 1,636 rap videos being removed. Until late 2022, Project Alpha\u2019s efforts targeting drill music \u2013 under the banner of \u201cOnline Harm Referrals\u201d \u2013 were led by an officer named Michael Railton. Under Railton, the scope of this work was expanded to include other social media platforms beyond YouTube, and to lobby national radio stations and record labels. This would culminate, in 2022, with Meta\u2019s Oversight Board \u2013 the group of academics, legal professionals, journalists and former politicians to whom the tech giant has devolved responsibility for its most contentious content moderation decisions \u2013 being tasked with considering whether Instagram should have cowed to pressure from the Met in removing 164 separate posts featuring a clip of a song by London drill rapper Chinx (OS). The board ruled against Instagram\u2019s decision, stating in its judgment that \u201cwhile law enforcement can sometimes provide context and expertise, not every piece of content that law enforcement would prefer to have taken down should be taken down.\u201d Noting that Project Alpha\u2019s requests had focused solely on drill music, the Board suggested that the Met\u2019s \u201cintensive focus on one music genre among many that include reference to violence raises serious concerns of potential over-policing of certain communities\u201d. A spokesperson for the Met did not address the board\u2019s comments directly, instead telling the Guardian:\u201cProject Alpha aims to develop intelligence from social media platforms linked to offline gang violence and serious and organised crime, as we want to use all opportunities to prevent Londoners being victims of violent crime. The Met works only to identify and remove content which incites or encourages violence; it does not seek to suppress freedom of expression through any kind of music.\u201d Since February 2023, age and ethnicity data has been recorded \u201cwhere identifiable\u201d by Project Alpha officers. Railton, for his part, says that over-policing of any community was \u201cnever the intention\u201d and that he never set out to demonise any one genre of music or group of people. \u201cAll I want them to do is to be able to put out music which is socially responsible and that doesn\u2019t play into the further perpetuation of the downward spiral of their community and themselves,\u201d he says. In 2021, PC Railton helped lead an initiative called Project Insight, which prepares police to act as expert witnesses, providing courts with commentary on \u201curban street gangs\u201d and the use of slang (including when it appears in music). Railton\u2019s initial cohort of police-trained expert witnesses numbered 18 individuals. According to the UK\u2019s Criminal Procedure Rules, the overriding duty of expert witnesses is to provide the court with testimony that is objective and unbiased. Academics and defence lawyers have questioned whether police officers can act as truly independent experts, given their proximity to prosecutions. Beyond issues of independence, others have questioned the degree to which police officers \u2013 who are trained to view events through a criminological lens \u2013 are able to interpret rap materials in a manner that gets anywhere near to the heart of what an author may have intended or, indeed, how songs and videos are consumed by fans of the music, their intended audience. Railton says he holds himself to the \u201cgold standard\u201d of independence when acting as an expert witness, and that he welcomes the scrutiny that the role entails. He also argues that police officers are often the best placed to offer expertise to the court when it comes to decoding rap lyrics. Professor Quinn disagrees. \u201cPolice officers themselves typically act as rap experts in these cases. But their interpretations are too often shaped by what legal scholars call \u2018flawed inferences\u2019 rooted in pre-existing beliefs about young black men and criminality, as well as a pro-prosecution stance,\u201d she says. \u201cWith the Casey Review\u2019s finding of institutional racism in the Met, the danger of fielding police officers as \u2018neutral\u2019 experts is stark. The interpretations of rap lyrics presented to jurors, who tend to know nothing (and certainly nothing positive) about this provocative music, can be crucial to court case verdicts.\u201d The Met did not offer the Guardian any comment on its provision of police officers as rap experts. Increasingly, the format in which rap lyrics are presented in UK courts follows templates designed by PC Railton, which he describes on his LinkedIn profile as \u201cjury friendly evidential products\u201d (he left the Met at the end of last year, and now runs a private consultancy offering expert witness training). These templates present lyrics, the officer\u2019s direct translations, and their interpretations of those translations in adjacent columns, and strip the materials of all context of how they might otherwise be presented (recorded or performed over a beat, for instance), and the fact that, ultimately, these are artistic expressions. Railton says that how experts present their evidence is a matter of individual choice, but expresses some pride in the way that his templates \u201cstep the jury through\u201d the evidence and \u201cdissolve the hyperlocal context out of the music\u201d. In January last year, the Crown Prosecution Service said it would be reviewing how rap evidence can be used in court. However, a later announcement in June, about a new \u201cpioneering \u2018gangs\u2019 unit\u201d based in Birmingham, appeared to double down on the admissibility of drill evidence, noting a number of new cases in which lyrics had been successfully put before juries. The full results of the review are yet to be published. Updated guidance, \u201cwhich sets out the issues for prosecutors to consider regarding the use of drill music as evidence\u201d, is due to be published later this year. The CPS declined to name any of the organisations it had approached to take part in its public consultation on the matter. In the face of this, barristers, youth workers, and music industry representatives in the UK are beginning to rally efforts for legislative and legal advisory changes, similar to those recently enacted in the US, which have curbed the use of creative expressions in courtrooms and seen unfair convictions overturned. In a social media post of his own last December, in response to a story published by the Guardian, former PC Railton noted his pride in the role police officers have played in the history of UK drill music. \u201cThere is no show without the stand we have taken. I am massively proud to have generated such vital discussion,\u201d he wrote. James would perhaps disagree with him on that count. At the Crown Prosecution Service, meanwhile, the jury remains out."}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db528", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/21/china-is-state-most-dangerous-to-its-own-citizens-civil-rights-report-finds", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "China is state most dangerous to its own citizens\u2019 civil rights, report finds", "lead": "China scores better on food, health and housing, while crackdowns have worsened Hong Kong\u2019s ratings", "author": "Amy Hawkins senior China correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 11:00:38", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.989554", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/37cbe630b3fb84f6d46b6b153b3db7cfb70b5341/0_0_8256_4954/500.jpg", "body": "China has been ranked as the worst country in the world for safety from the state and the right to assembly, in a human rights report that tracks social, economic and political freedoms. The Human Rights Measurement Initiative (HRMI), a New Zealand-based project, has been monitoring various countries\u2019 human rights performance since 2017. In 2022, HRMI started tracking freedom of religion and belief for the first time. China also scored worst on this indicator, although the pilot study only covered nine countries. HRMI concluded that on several measures China was the country in the world with the worst human rights record. On freedom from arbitrary arrest, only Kazakhstan scored worse. However, on certain economic indicators, such as the right to food, health and housing, China scored relatively highly, coming near the top of more than 100 surveyed countries. For the economic indicators HRMI uses publicly available statistics published by national and international institutions, rather than surveys. The index does point out that people in certain groups in China, such as critics of the government and ethnic minorities, often miss out on basic economic rights. The index tracks civil and political rights via a survey that is distributed to human rights experts such as journalists, NGO workers and lawyers in various countries. These areas are tightly controlled in China, making accurate data collection extremely difficult. Thalia Kehoe Rowden, a spokesperson for HRMI, said: \u201cWe take survey respondents\u2019 safety and security extremely seriously, and have been operating in countries where human rights defenders are in danger for several years now. \u201cOne of the keys to our security is that the survey is taken anonymously in an encrypted online form, so no one can find out exactly who has participated or what they have said.\u201d Hong Kong has dropped down HRMI\u2019s index in recent years. Although it does not score as badly as China, it has seen a rapid decrease in many rights since the crackdown on the pro-democracy movement in 2019 and 2020. Between those years its ranking on the freedom of assembly index declined by nearly 40%, and on the freedom of expression index by 33%, according to HRMI. HRMI also concluded Hong Kong\u2019s score on the freedom from arbitrary arrest index had improved, increasing by 85%. But this was because the index was based on instances of actual rights violations, said Kehoe Rowden. \u201cIn this repressive context, the rise in scores for freedom from arbitrary arrest and detention is not good news. It just means that the repression is working. \u201cHong Kong\u2019s scores for democratic rights and freedoms plummeted over 2019-21 and have remained appallingly low.\u201d Between 2019 and 2020, the last year for which HRMI has data on health indicators, most countries\u2019 health score declined, reflecting the high numbers of deaths from Covid-19. However, the score for China, which experienced a relatively low number of deaths before the zero-Covid policy was abandoned in 2022, remained steady."}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db529", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/21/lead-emissions-racetracks-portland-international-raceway", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Revealed: a toxic metal is in a US city\u2019s air \u2013 and may be harming children\u2019s brains", "lead": "The Guardian finds children in Portland, Oregon, could have lower test scores due to lead emissions from nearby racetrack, one of dozens across the US to use toxic leaded gasoline", "author": "Emma Pattee and Stuart Henigson  in Portland, Oregon", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 11:00:38", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.989572", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/10573e440fa4714af168b659225d1e1a62f5d672/0_170_3000_1800/500.jpg", "body": "When a neighbor mentioned to Kristy Lanciotti, a mother of two and pediatric nurse who works in environmental health, that toxic leaded gasoline was being used at a racetrack just down the road from her house in Portland, Oregon, she was taken aback. She was well aware of Portland International Raceway \u2013 most summer weekends were punctuated by the roar of engines \u2013 but Lanciotti, like most of her neighbors, was surprised to learn that the cars in many of those events were powered by a fuel that could damage her children\u2019s brains. Lead is so toxic that its use in gasoline has been phased out worldwide. Yet, unbeknownst to many, it is still in widespread use at dozens of racetracks around the US identified by the Guardian. Concern about the Portland racetrack, for one, is now growing, because new research has revealed the extent to which lead emissions from automobile racing impairs the cognitive development of children living nearby. Based on the research, the Guardian calculated that third graders \u2013 students aged eight or nine \u2013 who have grown up within two miles of Portland International Raceway could experience more than a six-percentage point decline in their standardized test scores. \u201cThat is pretty startling,\u201d said Vivek Shandas, a professor of urban studies at Portland State University, who reviewed the Guardian\u2019s findings. He described lead exposure at Portland International Raceway as \u201cone of the more serious concerns that would affect the environmental health of Portlanders\u201d. Part of what makes Portland International Raceway a serious concern is simply the location. Unlike most other tracks in the country, the raceway abuts a dense urban neighborhood in North Portland. The researchers who developed the methodology \u2013 Alex Hollingsworth, an associate professor in the school of public and environmental affairs at Indiana University, and Ivan Rudik, an assistant professor in the school of applied economics and management at Cornell University \u2013 say that students living as much as 25 miles from a given racetrack can be affected by its lead emissions. When Hollingsworth was asked what he would do if he lived in one of the many houses bordering the Portland raceway, his answer was simple: \u201cI would move.\u201d The city of Portland \u2013 which owns and operates the track \u2013 does not share this conclusion. It has rebuffed years of calls by residents to address the lead emissions. In response to the Guardian\u2019s findings, it said: \u201cPortland Parks &amp; Recreation\u2019s highest priority is public safety by following the guidance of public health and environmental protection agencies.\u201d Residents say the decision to allow leaded gas at the racetrack is especially confounding given Portland\u2019s reputation as one of the greenest enclaves in the country. Portland recently announced a goal to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by 2050. \u201cPhilosophically, it just doesn\u2019t seem right that this is something that\u2019s owned and operated by the city for recreational purposes,\u201d said Lanciotti. Lead began to be used in gasoline in the 1920s as a means of improving engine performance. However, in the 1950s, researchers discovered that when a child is exposed to lead \u2013 even in small amounts which would be safe for an adult \u2013 it can have devastating consequences. It travels from their blood into their brain and other organs. It can lower their IQ and cause other neurological problems. Later in life, lead exposure is linked to early death from stroke and certain heart diseases. In 1996, the Environmental Protection Agency banned the sale of leaded fuel for passenger cars as part of the Clean Air Act. However, an exemption was made for \u201coff-road\u201d vehicles, such as farm machinery, marine engines and race cars. Because of the risk of lead exposure, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) continued to pressure the racing industry to stop using leaded fuel. In response, Nascar, one of the top motorsports organizations in the world, stopped using leaded fuel in 2007. But leaded racing fuel has continued to be used in vintage automobile races and to enhance performance in certain race cars. Sunoco, one of the largest distributors of racing fuels, sells at least ten leaded racing fuels with names like Surge and Cyclone 17, which retail for more than $20 a gallon. There are more than a dozen major race tracks around the US where leaded gasoline is in use in certain races. One of these tracks, Sebring International Raceway, outside of a small community in central Florida, says that its track is active nearly 300 days a year. In response to the Guardian\u2019s inquiry about the amount of leaded gasoline used at their races, Sebring said it \u201cwould not have any information that would be helpful\u201d. Laguna Seca, a renowned track in central California, reported that the track sold 11,000 gallons of leaded fuel from April 2021 through April 2022, which is over four times the amount sold at the Portland track annually. It is in a relatively remote area, though there are several schools within a distance of 3 miles. The remaining tracks did not respond or declined to comment. It\u2019s not just the urban proximity that sets Portland International Raceway apart from these other tracks. Even more striking is that the racetrack is technically a city park, a fact that neighborhood advocates say makes the lead exposure even more egregious. \u201cIt\u2019s a city park run by the City of Portland, that has all these initiatives to ban diesel and lower emissions while also saying we\u2019re fine with using leaded gas in one of our parks and exposing our citizens to it.\u201d says Ryan Pittel, a longtime resident of North Portland and a board member of the Kenton Neighborhood Association. At Portland International Raceway, about 40% of the events use leaded gasoline. Over the past five years, the racetrack has sold anywhere from 1,300 gallons to 3,000 gallons of leaded gasoline annually. Although the CDC, EPA and WHO \u2013 along with the city of Portland \u2013 state that there is no safe level of lead for children, Portland\u2019s bureau of parks and recreation maintains that lead emissions from the track do not pose a health risk. This stance is based on a 2017 study that tested levels of lead during a race event. The Oregon department of environmental quality (DEQ) used those numbers to estimate emissions in nearby areas and said, in a memo to the neighborhood association, that \u201clevels of lead emissions modeled did not pose immediate health risks to residential areas around the track\u201d. At the heart of the issue is the tension between what would cause \u201cimmediate health risks\u201d, judged by the DEQ to be a lead exposure level of 0.15 micrograms averaged over 24 hours, and the less-immediate but lifelong impacts to children from chronic exposure to lower levels of lead. \u201cI get the frustration,\u201d said Perry Cabot, a public health officer for Multnomah county, which includes the city of Portland. \u201cPeople living in these neighborhoods, they see that we\u2019re saying there is no safe level [for children], but that we are allowing this release of lead and they are asking, \u2018How do we make sense of that?\u2019\u201d Lanciotti, the nurse living near the raceway, dismissed the idea that low levels of lead emissions wouldn\u2019t be harmful to children living nearby. \u201cWe know enough about lead to know that that\u2019s not true.\u201d And pollution experts such as Shandas, of Portland State University, argue that in any event the national and local regulators are underestimating how much lead is in the air. \u201cThe ways in which DEQ and OHA [Oregon health authority] and even the EPA go about addressing air quality has been so well recognized as woefully inadequate,\u201d he said. Now, with this new research showing that the levels at the Portland racetrack may be significant enough to cause developmental issues in children, local residents are asking why the city isn\u2019t taking their concerns more seriously. Ella Newell, a mother of a third grader who has lived near the racetrack for the past eight years, said the 6 percentage points outcome was even worse than she feared. \u201cIt\u2019s like we don\u2019t matter enough. Our homes, our taxes, our kids, don\u2019t matter enough to address this.\u201d Residents of North Portland have been fighting with the city to ban the use of lead at the raceway for over seven years. While Portland has the title \u201cWhitest City in America\u201d, the neighborhoods closest to the raceway \u2013 Portsmouth, Kenton and Piedmont \u2013 are historically diverse neighborhoods. As of 2020, 30%-50% of the population of these areas identified as a race other than white. Terrance Moses, the chairman of the neighborhood association, argued that low-income and marginalized communities aren\u2019t prioritized by the city of Portland. \u201cWe aren\u2019t [heard], we never have been, and it\u2019s still an ongoing process,\u201d Moses said. \u201cThe low-income white folks that are living here feel the same way because they\u2019re just being ignored also.\u201d In October 2022, residents of North Portland appeared before the Portland city council, asking them to ban the use of leaded gasoline at Portland International Raceway. In January, the Kenton Neighborhood Association met with Dan Ryan, the new commissioner in charge of the parks bureau. When the Guardian reached out to Ryan for comment, his office said: \u201cThe city takes public safety very seriously and works diligently to comply with all public health and environmental protection regulations, and we will continue to do so.\u201d In March 2023, Portland Parks &amp; Recreation indicated to the Guardian that it would continue to allow racers to use leaded fuel at the racetrack, but the city itself would no longer sell it at the track. For Ryan Pittel, who was one of the residents who spoke in front of the city council last October, this is a frustrating development, since the city of Portland will no longer be required to report the gallons sold. \u201cThat\u2019s not what we asked for. We\u2019re gonna keep fighting until it\u2019s gone.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db52a", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/21/your-body-is-miraculous-enjoy-it-10-ways-to-be-much-more-body-confident", "primaryCategory": "lifeandstyle", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018Your body is miraculous \u2013 enjoy it!\u2019 10 ways to be much more body-confident", "lead": "Forget your inhibitions this summer.

If you have a pulse, you already have a bikini body. Or indeed a mankini body. We all know this in theory. Yet these sensible thoughts are easily spouted but not so easily, um, embodied. Many of us find it relatively straightforward to be kind (and relatively less judgmental) towards other people. Because all you have to do is remember not to be a cruel git. But when it comes to our view of ourselves, we can be over harsh and critical, submitting ourselves to a level of scrutiny that we wouldn\u2019t dream of applying to others. But the 1980s idea that we must all prepare ourselves for the Great Unveiling of the Socially Acceptable Flesh and improve our aesthetic qualities before we venture near a beach or swimming pool \u2026 Well, that has kind of had its day. How often do we have the chance to get the sun on the bits of us that rarely make contact with the outside world? Why would you squander that chance? Here\u2019s how to feel confident with your body this summer and all year round. 1. Remind yourself how pointless fad diets are The concept of the \u201cbeach body\u201d is predicated on the ill-advised idea that you must suddenly embark on a short-term seasonally motivated plan of action that is alien to you. \u201cWe need to get away from the boom or bust mentality that often comes with weight loss,\u201d says nutritionist Emma Bardwell. \u201cI see a lot of women embarking on faddy, restrictive diets and extended fasts, declaring they will \u2018cut out sugar completely\u2019 and \u2018only eat after midday\u2019. This is difficult and unsustainable.\u201d 2. Dress and shop for your body the way it is today The body you see in the mirror on this very day will never be quite the same again. Chlo\u00e9 Dall\u2019Olio, video director at the beauty company Trinny London and the host of the online series The Body Talks, says: \u201cIt\u2019s all about highlighting the person who you are today. Yes, be inspired by other people. But it\u2019s about what assets you have and celebrating them. The bigger and the smaller bits. The bits that have been shamed and the bits that have been praised.\u201d Long live all our bits. 3. Rest is the cornerstone of confidence Heed the motto of the yoga teacher Paula Hines, author of Rest + Calm: Gentle Yoga and Mindful Practices to Nurture and Restore Yourself: \u201cImagine how different the world would be if we were all well rested.\u201d She says: \u201cYou can\u2019t be confident if you\u2019re tired and wired or burnt out. It might not be about taking a nap, but finding something that works for you \u2013 and is good for your nervous system \u2013 is essential. I saw a video recently on social media of a young boy asking his wailing little brother if he\u2019d had a nap. He hadn\u2019t. So his response to his younger sibling was: \u2018Well, you need one!\u2019 It was funny and relatable but I do think this applies to grownups too. Rest gives you perspective and clarity.\u201d 4. Do not dress apologetically It\u2019s a cliche, but wearing \u201cloud\u201d clothes \u2013 or anything that doesn\u2019t feel like \u201chiding\u201d \u2013 lifts your mood. Nickie Reynolds, the owner of Gold Dust Vintage, explains: \u201cDress in colours that make you feel good about yourself. This will instantly boost your confidence. If you\u2019re not sure what these are, just start with the colours you love. And experiment. You can begin with introducing \u2018pops\u2019 of colour.\u201d Ignore clothes sizes, especially if you\u2019re shopping vintage. \u201cGet to know your measurements and the styles and cuts of clothes that you enjoy wearing.\u201d 5. Link your body confidence to sustainable fashion One of the main reasons we buy too much is when we shop from a place of insecurity. Hands up anyone who has ever shopped for a body they wish they had or a body they used to have? (All my hands are up. Or they would be if only I could lift them in the air while wearing this teeny tiny blouse.) In 2014, a UK survey by a lingerie company found that 48% of women have bought clothes that are too small for them. We can only hope this has improved over the past decade but it seems unlikely. Ask: \u201cDoes this fit me right here, right now? Do I want to wear it right here, right now?\u201d If not, maybe let the shop or the website store the item \u201cfor safekeeping\u201d until the craving passes. Buy fewer things and let them fit better. 6. Park your insecurity when it comes to fitness Exercising \u2013 especially in class, or anywhere in public \u2013 can seem daunting. This is a chicken and egg thing. By which I mean that when you are lacking in confidence in your body, you are less likely to exercise. And the less you move, the less confidence you have in your body. Hines says: \u201cIf you\u2019re attending a class for the first time and you\u2019re feeling nervous or insecure, then I\u2019d suggest having a word with the teacher beforehand. I\u2019m so used to people letting me know that they\u2019re new or it\u2019s their first yoga class and they\u2019re feeling a bit anxious.\u201d Admitting your vulnerability makes it less of a big deal. 7. If you do want changes, make them small and easy If change of some kind really is your goal, aim for small, consistent habits that you can maintain. Seek out sensible health advice that resonates with you as an individual. We are not all the same. We do not all want to look the same. And we are not all motivated by the same aims. That is OK. And if change is not your goal, that is also OK. 8. Dress for your character not your physical shape Marleen Beevers is a fashion psychologist and the author of the forthcoming Satisfashion, a book about using your attitude towards style to cement the idea that you are \u201cenough\u201d. Our style should be about expressing what we think of ourselves, she says. \u201cWho are you? And what do you want in life? Focus on your personality strengths. Challenge your negative thoughts with positive affirmations. Limit your exposures to negative triggers and social media campaigns.\u201d 9. Buy amazing exercise clothes This is a corrective to the previous advice about sustainable fashion. If an outfit will make you move your body, then buy it with reckless abandon. Take a look at the meticulously coordinated gym wardrobe of musical theatre goddess Marisha Wallace (currently appearing as Miss Adelaide in Guys and Dolls) who mostly wears Sofina Active. Hines recommends jumpsuits from Thought, and stretchy jersey trousers and vests from Asquith and Sweaty Betty: \u201cI don\u2019t do leggings or formal yogawear. Some of my most faithful long-wearing items have come from M&amp;S. Sometimes just wearing something comfortable can make you feel relaxed.\u201d 10. It\u2019s OK not to be \u201cbody positive\u201d all the time No one loves themselves constantly. So it\u2019s OK to feel unconfident occasionally. Just not all the time. Hines says: \u201cWe all have negative body days. I\u2019m not sure I believe anyone who says they never do. But one thing I suggest is to focus on what your body does for you \u2013 whether it\u2019s getting you through the day or achieving a personal best at the gym.\u201d One of the greatest moments of my own life was having a \u201cpersonal best\u201d in a 1.5km swim because I beat my own record by 50 seconds. (Count. Them.) This achievement mattered more to me than the fact that I had taken well over an hour to cover this distance, whereas the fastest swimmer could cover it in under 20 minutes. We all need our own PBs. Hines sums it up: \u201cWhen I started focusing on what my body could do, it shifted my mindset over to a place of gratitude, away from constant negative self-talk. Our bodies really are miraculous, and you only get one, so you may as well enjoy it.\u201d Happy High Status: How to Be Effortlessly Confident by Viv Groskop is out on 29 June (Torva, \u00a316.99).

In 1985, British boys and girls ranked 69 out of 200 countries for average height aged five. At the time they were on average 111.4cm and 111cm tall respectively. Now, British boys are 102nd and girls 96th, with the average five-year-old boy measuring 112.5cm and the average girl, 111.7cm. In Bulgaria, the average height for a five-year-old boy is 121cm and a girl, 118cm. Experts have said a poor national diet and cuts to the NHS are to blame. But they have also pointed out that height is a strong indicator of general living conditions, including illness and infection, stress, poverty and sleep quality. \u201cThey have fallen by 30 places, which is pretty startling,\u201d said Prof Tim Cole, an expert in child growth rates at the Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London. \u201cThe question is, why?\u201d GPs in poorer areas of the country have reported a resurgence of Victorian diseases such as rickets and scurvy caused largely, they say, by nutritional deficiencies. NHS data shows that about 700 children a year are admitted to hospital with malnutrition, rickets or scurvy in England. Separate research suggests that dietary inequalities in children from poorer backgrounds are driving higher rates of problems including obesity, type 2 diabetes and dental decay. Cole, who was not involved in the study, said the data suggests that growing up in the 2010s \u201cwhich happens to coincide with the period of austerity \u2026 tells me that austerity has clobbered the height of children in the UK\u201d. Food experts point out that a diet of cheap junk food makes people simultaneously overweight and undernourished. \u201cChildren in the poorest areas of England are both fatter and significantly shorter than those in the richest areas at age 10 to 11,\u201d said Henry Dimbleby, the former government food adviser.\u201cThis is a big enough problem to have an impact at an international level.\u201d In the Netherlands, the average five-year-old boy is 119.6cm and the average girl is 118.4cm tall. In France, the figures are 114.7cm and 113.6cm respectively. In Germany they are 114.8 and 113.3. Danish boys are on average 117.4cm tall, and Danish girls 118.1cm. Dimbleby said that in modern Britain the way we eat is one of the clearest markers of inequality: annual surveys show children from the poorest fifth of families consume about a third less fruit and vegetables, 75% less oily fish, and a fifth less fibre than children from the most well-off families. The data is taken from national measurement programmes, collated by the Non-communicable diseases risk factor collaboration, a global network of health scientists. A government spokesperson said: \u201cThere are a range of factors that can impact children\u2019s growth, which are not just limited to diet, and we are taking steps to support families by providing record financial support to families who need it most.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db52c", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2023/jun/21/australia-politics-live-indigenous-voice-to-parliament-anthony-albanese-greens-labor-standoff-rent-freezes-china-military-threat", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Politicians dress up for Canberra\u2019s night of nights \u2013 as it happened", "lead": "This blog is now closed.", "author": "Elias Visontay, Jordyn Beazley (earlier) and Amy Remeikis (earlier)", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 10:41:00", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.989628", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/8a16ac7ce9dc9c0697e41af79229980bb8896ee2/0_221_6624_3974/500.jpg", "body": "Thanks for following today\u2019s action, but with that, we\u2019ll wrap up our live coverage.

Labor senator Jana Stewart is making a statement in her voice-themed outfit, with her husband, Marcus Stewart. The former deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce is radiating, wearing a huge grin and dapper black tuxedo. He arrived with his partner, Vikki Campion, who is in an earth-toned dress. Watch out, Nationals party room \u2013 someone is dressed to impress! The big dogs have arrived. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, is in a sharp black tuxedo, with his wife Kirilly in a navy ensemble featuring a sparkly jacket and silky dress. And a tiny, sparkly purse. \u201cThat\u2019s the best I\u2019ve seen Dutton look,\u201d says someone in our newsroom. And here\u2019s a full body shot of Anthony Albanese and Jodie Haydon in the outfits we described earlier in this blog. These pictures are from AAP\u2019s Lukas Coch. Karen Andrews, Dorinda Cox arrive at Parliament House The former home affairs minister Karen Andrews is in a stylish fur number, pictured here with staffer Valeria Cheglov in green. Not to be outdone, here\u2019s the Greens senator Dorinda Cox in what my colleagues Julia Hollingsworth and Ann Ding tell me is a semi-sheer shawl. Liberals at midwinter ball form a harmonious quartet in blue Midwinter ball guests are cutting a stylish image as they enter Parliament House for tonight\u2019s event. A quartet of Liberal members have entered, featuring the Lindsay MP, Melissa Macintosh, in an icy light blue shade; the Durack MP, Melissa Price, in a darker but still voguish sapphire blue; the deputy opposition leader, Sussan Ley in black; and the Flinders MP, Zoe McKenzie, in navy. So far the colours seem wintry cool \u2013 matching the weather! Midwinter ball kicks off in Canberra If you\u2019re just tuning in, we\u2019re bringing you the latest from Canberra\u2019s night of nights \u2013 the midwinter ball! First up, the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has tweeted a picture of himself in a tuxedo with his partner, Jodie Haydon, wearing a stylish long-sleeved black number. Thanks for following along. I\u2019ll now hand you over to our resident fashionista Elias Visontay who will be covering the press gallery\u2019s much-awaited annual midwinter ball and any other developments. WWF calls for further action with nature repair market bill Australia\u2019s World Wide Fund for Nature has urged senators to \u201cwork together\u201d to pass the nature repair market bill after it passed the lower house, but urged the government to pair it with strengthened nature protection laws. WWF Australia\u2019s conservation economist, Joshua Bishop, said: WWF encourages rapid passage of the nature repair market bill, and asks our government to double down on strengthening nature protection laws. Australia has waited far too long for critical nature policy reforms to be enacted. We need stronger nature protection laws, together with new ways of mobilising investment in nature, because business as usual is failing our wildlife and wild places. Nature repair market bill passes lower house without Greens\u2019 support The bill passed with the support of independent MPs Helen Haines, Allegra Spender, Kylea Tink, Zali Steggall, Sophie Scamps, Kate Chaney and Monique Ryan. It was opposed by the Coalition, the Greens and independent MP Zoe Daniel. It comes after Paul Karp reported earlier today the teal independent MPs had accused the Greens of \u201cincredibly short-sighted\u201d opposition to Labor\u2019s proposed nature repair market, and urged them to improve rather than stall or block the bill. The proposed legislation establishes a scheme to incentivise investment in nature restoration by creating tradable certificates for projects that protect and restore biodiversity. Federal Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi says education minister Jason Clare\u2019s comments that making university free would result in fewer people going to university and poorer people missing out as \u201cfrankly bizarre and the opposite of what would happen\u201d. It comes after the vice-chancellor of the University of Melbourne, Duncan Maskell, joined the Greens and student unions in calling for tertiary education to be free. Faruqi said: \u201cAcademics, experts, students, the NTEU, and now a vice-chancellor at one of Australia\u2019s top universities have joined the Greens\u2019 call to back free university. It\u2019s time for the prime minister, who went to university for free, to get on board. We have universal primary and secondary education. Free public higher education is the missing piece of the puzzle. Making university free will be life changing for many, especially for people who want to change careers and re-skill later in life. By removing the crushing debts, people will be able to adapt to new and emerging careers without being penalised.\u201d Our Caitlin Cassidy has the full story on Maskell backing calls for free tertiary education here: Rolfe police complaint referred to corruption watchdog A complaint against a detective involved in the investigation of ex-constable Zachary Rolfe over the shooting death of an Indigenous teenager has been referred to the Northern Territory\u2019s corruption watchdog. AAP reports Rolfe\u2019s solicitor has written to NT police detailing a number of matters of concern. They included accusations that evidence from an independent expert witness was amended and edited and that evidence favourable to Rolfe was withheld, the NT News reported. Acting NT Police Deputy Commissioner Michael White confirmed receipt of the letter and that it had been referred to the NT Independent Commission Against Corruption. He said: We have received a letter from the lawyer representing Mr Rolfe and we\u2019re investigating the contents of that letter and assessing the information that\u2019s been provided. We\u2019ll determine where the investigation goes. I\u2019m not going to talk about specifics but again, we\u2019ll review the information that\u2019s been provided and we\u2019ll thoroughly investigate any allegation that\u2019s been made. I have referred it to the ICAC. White declined to comment on whether the detective concerned had been spoken to. \u2018Gambling ads must be banned, full stop\u2019: independent MP Zoe Daniel The parliament is gearing up for another significant fight on gambling ads, with the Greens considering backing a Coalition bill to limit advertising, but other crossbenchers saying they should take much bolder action. As we\u2019ve reported, Sarah Hanson-Young says the Greens are sympathetic to \u201cany bill\u201d that would limit gambling - and are considering backing the Coalition in the Senate, which could roll the government again in the upper house - even though the Greens want such moves to go much further than the Coalition proposal to block ads for an hour either side of sporting games on TV. But lower house independent MP Zoe Daniel, whose own private bill would look to a complete ban on gambling ads, says the Senate should go much further. David Pocock is putting up amendments to the Coalition bill, which would see it mirror Daniel\u2019s bill. Daniel said: The Senate should not duck the issue. It should reject the coalition\u2019s meagre proposal and pass Senator Pocock\u2019s version of my Private Members Bill for a complete ban. I hope the Coalition\u2019s squib of a bill does not pass. The evidence is that trying to ring fence gambling advertising won\u2019t work. Daniel said past evidence of restricting gambling ads in this way just saw such ads shift into other programming, and actually an increase in overall ads: Only a complete ban on gambling advertising on our screens will stop the gambling giants from grooming impressionable young people to believe they are not part of the gang if they don\u2019t bet as they watch sport. Gambling ads must be banned, full stop. Pocock calls for debate on Middle Arm development After Guardian Australia\u2019s investigation of the expansion of gas projects in the Northern Territory, independent senator David Pocock has called for a debate about the government\u2019s plans to back the Middle Arm industrial precinct on Darwin Harbour with $1.5b in taxpayer funds. Read the investigation from our Anne Davies and Lisa Cox here: Anthony Albanese reckons he might have broken the record today for most people in the prime minister\u2019s office thanks to visiting students from Haberfield public school. The Labor senator Deborah O\u2019Neill has criticised PwC in the Senate for \u201cattempting to walk away from this profound ethical failure\u201d after the committee expressed concern PwC had failed to take responsibility for the actions of its staff. O\u2019Neill says: It shocks me that the obfuscation by PwC Australia continues and that PwC Global appears to be attempting to walk away from this profound ethical failure and calculated breach of trust. I am concerned by reports of threats and intimidation by leaders inside PwC as they continue in their efforts of coercion and spin. Parliament\u2019s interim report on PwC scandal makes two recommendations The unanimous report of the finance and public administration committee has two recommendations: The committee recommends that PwC cooperate fully and openly with all investigations and inquiries into this matter, including the investigations by the Australian Federal Police and the Tax Practitioners Board. The committee recommends that PwC be open and honest with the Australian Parliament and people, and with the international community, by promptly publishing accurate and detailed information about the involvement of PwC partners and personnel (including names and positions) in the matters canvassed in this report. The Greens want to go further. The Greens senator Barbara Pocock says: We now have cross-party agreement about what happened. PwC engaged in a calculated breach of trust and an intentional cover-up. The committee unanimously agrees that PwC should come clean and fully cooperate with independent inquiries into their wrongdoing. PwC must move beyond a simple \u201cfall guy\u201d strategy. It is untenable for the government to keep doing business with an entity that conducts itself like this. The Greens are calling on the government to cancel PwC\u2019s registration as a tax agent and will be introducing an amendment to do exactly this. The government must also enact an immediate ban on contracts with PwC. We need Luke Sayers, who was CEO of PwC Australia throughout this debacle, and the head of taxation at the time, Tom Seymour, along with others in senior leadership to answer questions and be held to account. The evidence in this report points to a go-slow and weak response from regulators that calls into question how far PwC\u2019s tentacles reach into the heart of our public institutions. It has never been more clear, we need a NACC investigation of this matter. The Green\u2019s will make this referral to the NACC on the day it opens. The evidence cited in this report shows an internal culture at PwC so poor that it has lost the capacity to act honestly. In fact, it is clear now that its senior leadership does not recognise basic ethical and legal principles. The evidence also creates a strong argument for breaking the link between political donations and big consultancies. The chair of the finance and public administration committee, Richard Colbeck, is tabling the interim report into consultants and the PwC scandal. In the Senate, Colbeck described PwC\u2019s actions as a \u201ccalculated\u201d and an \u201cegregious\u201d breach of trust. Colbeck says: The report is titled: PwC a calculated breach of trust. Because that\u2019s how the committee sees the actions that were undertaken by Mr Peter Collins, when he was given the privilege of being part of a consultation process on new legislation being proposed to deal with multinational tax avoidance. Colbeck cites efforts by PwC to put obstacles in the way of the Australian Taxation Office investigating the breach. Colbeck says the committee had to take \u201csome care\u201d in its inquiry, given the Treasury\u2019s referral of the matter to the Australian federal police. The committee had to be careful not to \u201ccreate a pool of evidence that would inhibit potential legal proceedings\u201d or call witnesses \u201cwho may be subject to legal proceedings, who may want to come before the committee to put on record things that may not be able to be used in proceedings\u201d. At last year\u2019s Midwinter Ball, we saw the Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young and Adam Bandt\u2019s partner, Claudia Perkins, also emblazon their gowns with political messages. Hanson-Young wore a dress bearing the phrase \u201cend gas and coal\u201d, while Perkins arrived in a gown emblazoned with the slogans \u201ccoal kills\u201d and \u201cgas kills\u201d. The fashion statements came after criticisms raised by Senator David Pocock and climate groups about fossil fuel companies Woodside and Shell sponsoring the annual press gallery ball. Labor\u2019s Jana Stewart offers sneak peek of yes dress Our Mike Bowers has snapped our first sneak peek of the opulent fits that will be on display at the press gallery\u2019s Midwinter Ball tonight, where politicians and journalists rub shoulders with business leaders and celebrities. The Labor senator Jana Stewart has continued the trend of politicians making their fashion statements at the ball political, with a dress that says yes. The white dress, designed by Laura Thompson \u2013 the co-founder of social enterprise Clothing the Gaps \u2013 is embroidered with words from the Uluru statement of the heart and the word \u201cyes\u201d in a nod to the upcoming referendum on an Indigenous voice to parliament. The Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young has said the government should be reminded the point of the Senate is to hold it to account after the Greens decision to defer the debate on the Housing Australia Future Fund until October granted the first half of a trigger towards a full Senate election. Asked on ABC whether she was concerned about the Greens decision leading to a double dissolution, Hanson-Young said: Breaking news; the Senate is not at the whim of the government. It has not been for a long time and it should not be. It is how the Australian people vote, election after election. They want the Senate to hold the government to account. We have been trying for months to negotiate with the government. We were very clear about what is needed for it to happen. We know the expert opinion is that this housing future fund bill is a bit of a sham. It is not spending any money for another two years, it is not building houses, it is gambling it on the stock market. Burke warns MPs that parliament may have to sit on Friday Tony Burke has just warned the house the parliament may have to sit on Friday because the Senate isn\u2019t getting through its business because the Coalition keep adding speakers to things. It\u2019s a filibuster tactic designed to make it look like the government isn\u2019t getting through its work. So Burke has come back with a WE WILL SIT LONGER DON\u2019T PUSH ME move. Let\u2019s see if that moves them along in the Senate. Premier pressured over Hobart stadium advice An independent MP responsible for plunging the Tasmanian government into minority has threatened to send the state to an early election if his concerns about plans for a Hobart stadium are not addressed, AAP reports. John Tucker and Lara Alexander quit the Liberal party in May to sit on the crossbench, citing concerns around the government\u2019s planning for a $715m waterfront stadium at Macquarie Point. The stadium project was a condition of the AFL granting Tasmania a licence for a team. The premier, Jeremy Rockliff, said he had tabled all relevant advice on the stadium plan, though some documents could not be released because they were covered by cabinet confidentiality, a longstanding convention under which government deliberations about policy were kept under wraps. In a speech to parliament, Tucker said the government\u2019s reference to cabinet in confidence amounted to an \u201cobvious cover-up\u201d. Here\u2019s Tucker: At the end of the day, if they don\u2019t provide the information there\u2019s going to be a confidence problem in the government and we will be off to an election. Thanks Amy for leading us through the latest developments today. I\u2019ll be with you for the rest of the day! I am going to pass you to Jordyn Beazley for the rest of the afternoon while I go stare at a wall. Stay tuned for more updates \u2013 I will be back with Politics Live early tomorrow morning and will let you know how the parliament and press gallery pulls up after the Midwinter Ball tonight. As always, take care of you Ax Liberal Democrat says Victorian government has committed to act on Denyer bail The Liberal Democrats MP David Limbrick, who\u2019s partner Natalie Russell was 17 when she was murdered by Denyer, says despite the bill failing they\u2019ve secured a commitment from the government to act: Although the bill didn\u2019t pass today, I regard it as a win \u2013 the efforts of the people behind me who bravely stood up and been making noise about this since 2021 have finally pushed the government into action. I\u2019m very disappointed that it\u2019s taken this long for the government to act. When we first started this in 2021, we thought that it would be something that would happen really quickly. That would be sort of a no-brainer for the government to come up with some sort of legislation to deal with this. For whatever reason they chose not to act. But they have said now, the attorney general said herself they\u2019ve made a public commitment to some sort of parole reform \u2026 I\u2019m willing to contribute to that and work with the government on how that might work. Albanese put on hold in FM radio bit The prime minister is on hold in his latest FM radio bit to give the hosts an \u201cimportant clue\u201d to get out of the escape room they are in because we are a very serious country. When Americans joke Australia is not real. It does give Paul Karp and I a chance to annoy our colleagues to sing Miley Cyrus\u2019s Flowers out loud while we await this very important piece of national security information delivered to FM radio hosts doing a bit by the leader of this country. \u2018We\u2019ll work with you. No politics\u2019: Liberals appeal to Labor on Denyer parole The Liberal MP Brad Battin is holding a press conference after his bid to change Victoria\u2019s law to restrict any future parole applications by the serial killer Paul Denyer failed to pass the upper house. Labor MPs, the Greens and the two Legalise Cannabis MPs voted to block the bill, which proposed the serial killer should only be able to apply for parole if seriously incapacitated or at risk of death. The government has instead proposed changing the law to restrict serial killers from applying for parole for several years. The attorney general has said a law dealing specifically with Denyer would be subject to a high court challenge. Battin \u2013 the opposition\u2019s corrections spokesperson \u2013 says he is happy to work with \u201cwhoever it takes\u201d to ensure the families are given closure: Daniel Andrews our cry to you now is work with us. We\u2019ll work with you. No politics. Let\u2019s make sure to pass that legislation to ensure that Victorians are safe. Vikki Petraitis, a crime author, has followed the case since the 1990s, and has become close to Denyer\u2019s victims\u2019 families. She says today is a \u201cdistressing day\u201d. We sat in the gallery and we watched 19 people vote no, and the stark reality is that even though they expressed that they wanted to help the families, they could have finished this today. And they voted no. And that\u2019s really distressing. And just for fun and because we have missed him, here is a Mike Bowers series on facial expressions. Please enjoy this series from Mike Bowers: politicians discover hands. Anthony Albanese is bookending his day with FM radio interviews \u2013 he\u2019ll be on KIIS FM Sydney this afternoon (he spoke to Triple M this morning, which feels like 20 years and at least 100 will the voice \u2026 questions ago). At the end of QT, Anthony Albanese and Max Chandler-Mather appeared to have words \u2013 as caught by Mike Bowers: The independent senator Lidia Thorpe has commented on the government\u2019s announcement of real-time reporting on deaths in custody. Staff at the University of Melbourne are on strike for the second time this year demanding pay rises at least in line with the consumer price index and lower workloads. The National Union of Students education officer, Xavier Dup\u00e9, is rallying alongside academics. He says \u201ca win for staff means better conditions for students\u201d. \u201cMelbourne University is far from unique. Students across the country are faced with management that ... charge huge fees to students. A win for University of Melbourne staff and students would be an example for other unions fighting the cost-of-living crisis and education cuts.\u201d Arts students have been sent an email reminding them of their rights to attend classes and exams, while a fundraiser has been launched with a $20,000 goal to help staff losing pay due to the strike. Bid to restrict future parole applications by serial killer Paul Denyer fails A bid by the Victorian opposition to change the state\u2019s law to restrict any future parole applications by the serial killer Paul Denyer has failed to pass the upper house. Labor MPs, the Greens and the two Legalise Cannabis MPs voted to block the bill, which proposed the serial killer should only be able to apply for parole if seriously incapacitated or at risk of death. The government has instead proposed changing the law to restrict serial killers from applying for parole for several years. Debate on the bill was emotional, with the loved ones of victims in the chamber. The Liberal Democrats MP David Limbrick, who\u2019s partner Natalie Russell was 17 when she was murdered by Denyer, spoke in support of the bill. Limbrick said he had felt closure after Denyer was sentenced in 1993 to three life sentences but this was ripped from him when on appeal he was granted a 30-year sentence: No one who\u2019s been talking about this publicly, none of us want to be going over and over it. But we just want to have some sort of solution or closure that we felt that we had back in 1993. Because, even today, despite our will, no one here can actually stand up and say for certain that he\u2019s never going to harm another girl, the way that he harmed Nat. So we have to act. Question time ends And that is pretty much it for QT. One. More. To. Go. Will the voice be able to declare its a scallop and not a potato cake for all of Australia? Will the voice be able to move Parliament House? Will the voice change Valentine\u2019s Day to Captain Cook was killed day? Given where this week has gone so far, it is hard to rule anything out. \u2018Do not tell me what I do or do not know about Aboriginal Australia,\u2019 Burney tells Liberal MP Tony Pasin is next up with the non-government questions: Minister, where in the wording proposed to create a new chapter in the constitution is the voice restricted from offering advice to the government and the executive on any issue it chooses? Linda Burney: I am sorry that it appears you are unable to read the very simple instructions for what this is about. Clause three makes it very clear. Pasin makes a point of order asking Burney to withdraw: While I did grow up in a household where English was not my first language, I can read. Burney withdraws. I have said on at least five or six occasions, this week, what the voice is responsible for and what the second reading speech of the attorney general said, especially in relation to matters that affect Indigenous people differently. I think it is patently clear. Let me say this to the member for Barker. I have been to communities that are crying out for a different way of doing things. I have been to communities where there are 30 people living in two-bedroom homes. I have been to communities where babies are drinking sweet cordial instead of water because it is cheaper. I have been to communities where you cannot get in and out because of the road conditions. I have taken a friend, who died at 43, of end-of-life renal failure, to visit his son in jail. I have seen friends die, in hospitals, because they are very young, and their conditions in their life when they were younger terrible. So do not tell me what I do or do not know about Aboriginal Australia. Do not tell me the proposition the prime minister has outlined is not needed in this country. I am not interested in culture wars. I am interested in closing the gap. Katter inquires about \u2018housing packages in paradise\u2019 Bob Katter then takes the next non-government question. PM, could you confirm that house prices in Brisbane and Sydney exceed 800,000. And since only one million people live outside the 70km east coast, Perth and Victoria, who would miss Victoria, minister, if migration is halved in your housing authority buys or designates 14,000 one hectare housing blocks, at Mareeba and Atherton for example, if the authority overrides what the Reserve Bank describes as insurmountable building, building, zoning and planning impositions, won\u2019t we get housing packages in paradise for under $280,000. I don\u2019t know what to tell you. Why is housing so expensive and what are you doing about it? That\u2019s what I think he was asking there. The prime minister gives his housing speech in response. \u2018I am not sure what the opposition is missing\u2019: Burney fields more opposition questions on scope of voice Michelle Landry asks Linda Burney: Will the voice have the power to provide advice to the government on any program in the budget? That sound you hear is Burney\u2019s internal scream at this line of questioning. Burney: I have made the point repeatedly this week, that the voice has no power of veto. So the answer to the question is obvious. I am not sure what the opposition is missing. This is a practical and simple proposition. This is about making practical change the lives of First Nations people in this country and it is also about this country and recognising 65,000 years of history. There are 10 design principles and that is the end of my answer. Jason Clare says making university free would mean \u2018just a lucky few\u2019 would be able to attend Greens MP Elizabeth Watson-Brown asks Jason Clare: You and I and many others in this place benefited from free university before fees were introduced by the Hawke Labor Government. Last night, the University of Melbourne vice-chancellor called for first degrees to be free, something the Greens have also been calling for. Prime minister, will you commit to making university free, or is Labor content with students continuing to accumulate massive rising debt to the minister for education? Jason Clare: Now we don\u2019t support that because what that would mean is that fewer people go to university not more. In fact, that would mean that just a lucky few would end up going to university. And the sort of people that would miss out would be people from poor backgrounds. People from the bush and more Indigenous Australians. You know, Mr. Speaker, Kermit the Frog was wrong. It is easy being green because you can promise the world and you don\u2019t have to deliver anything. He then includes a sledge about housing. Question time is almost over but I am still catching up because of the transcription issue, so apologies for dragging this out. The Nationals\u2019 Pat Conaghan then asks Linda Burney: The voice referendum working group and Yes23 director Thomas Mayo has stated: \u201cWe keep going. We maintain this momentum until we change the system, until we tear down the institutions\u201d. On what basis did the minister appoint Mr Mayo to the referendum Working Group? Burney says: I have a responsibility and that responsibility is what I say. Liberal MP asks Burney to name issue affecting non-Indigenous Australians, but not Indigenous Australians OK. We have hit a new low with questions. The member for Flinders, Zoe McKenzie, asks (the questions are handed to backbenchers by the tactics team which is made up of the leadership) Can the minister name an issue that affects non Indigenous Australians, that does not affect Indigenous Australians? There is a very long back-and-forth over whether the question is in order. Milton Dick rules it is, but is broad (meaning Linda Burney can answer it however she would like). Burney: The voice will not be required to make a representation on every law, policy and program. The attorney general made clear that matters relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people need measures specific to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people \u2013 or matters which affect Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people differently. Just look at the bottom score of every social round, of every social ladder in this country and you might figure that out. The New South Wales corruption watchdog will hand down its much-anticipated and highly delayed report into former premier Gladys Berejiklian next week. The Independent Commission Against Corruption announced the report would be released on 29 June at 9am. In a statement, Icac said: The NSW Independent Commission Against Corruption will furnish its Operation Keppel investigation report, concerning the then member of Parliament for Wagga Wagga, the then premier, and others, to the Presiding Officers at the NSW Parliament on Thursday 29 June 2023 at 9.00 am. If the presiding officers make the report public, it will be made available for download from the Icac website at www.icac.nsw.gov.au with notification also provided to media and via the commission\u2019s Twitter account. Berejiklian has denied any wrongdoing Sussan Ley (with the delivery of a high school debating captain): Would the voice have the power to advise the government to abolish Australia Day? Linda Burney: The voice will not be bothered by cultural wars. It will focus on the practical and on the [matter of] policy [which affects Indigenous people] differently in terms of closing the gap. As the \u2026 speech of the attorney general made clear, it will focus on matters specific to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people or matters that affect Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people differently. And the key word is \u201cdifferently\u201d. The word \u201cdifferently\u201d talks about things like the 10-year gap in life expectancy. It talks about the higher chance that Indigenous people have of being incarcerated than of them possibly going to university. It talks about infant and maternal mortality. It talks about children born at lower birth weights, higher rates of family violence, lower rates of finishes school and higher rates of unemployment, overcrowding in houses. It will not be involved in cultural wars. Sussan Ley has the next non-government question. Guess. GUESS what it\u2019s on. Chalmers: Greens \u2018not prepare to vote for\u2019 social housing \u2018when it really matters\u2019 Jim Chalmers is up next on the housing slam. The Greens \u2026 say they believe in social housing, they\u2019re just not prepared to vote for it when it really matters. They say they want more social housing, and they go into the Senate and they vote against more social housing. \u2026 Our budgets, they aren\u2019t just defined by our Labor values. They\u2019re defined by Australian values, working together to get things done for each other, putting pragmatism and problem solving ahead of posturing and product differentiation, not just issuing pithy press releases, but running this country and our economy in the interests of the people and communities who sent us here to work for them. Andrew Wilkie asks if Labor is trying cover up \u2018obvious crime\u2019 of coal quality fraud Andrew Wilkie breaks the housing fund questions with: These documents contain additional evidence of coal quality fraud by three companies regarding Australian exports to South Korea. Now when I first raised this issue with you last year, the ACCC initially told me it would investigate. But since then, no agency has contacted me, the whistleblower involved struggled to even get a meeting with the ACCC and only Terracom is being investigated. Minister, is your government trying to cover up this obvious crime? Madeleine King: I thank the member for Clark for his question, and I can assure you this government is not interested in covering up anything at all at, least of all accusations such as this. I also want to thank the member for Clark for his advocacy for whistleblowers across Australia. And I admire him for his strong sense of social justice, and I thank him for his tireless work of protecting our nation against corruption and misinformation. My office has engaged with the member on \u2013 not, perhaps, the matter you are raising today, but on other matters in relation to alleged misconduct and coal quality testing. I can assure the member I do take these allegations very seriously. I will have to look in to the new matters you mentioned in relation that you\u2019ve raised and your involvement or otherwise or lack of involvement as you have said in relation to the ACCC and of course I will do that and my office will undertake to do that straight away. King says the government takes the allegations seriously and she will be on it. Wilkie asks to table the documents but leave is denied. Tony Burke says he is unaware of the legal issues if the documents were tabled. The next dixer is to Julie Collins who continues the reading of the Labor Burn Book entries about the Greens. Dutton and Albanese spar over One Nation, Clive Palmer preferences at election Peter Dutton then asks if the Australian Labor party will accept Greens preferences at the next election. The chamber explodes in a cacophony of faux-rage and Milton Dick has to use his best headteacher\u2019s voice to bring the house to order. Anthony Albanese: I do really thank the leader of the opposition for this question. From the party that relies on preferences from One Nation and Clive Palmer. Peter Dutton has a point of order \u2013 the Labor party also accepts preferences from Clive Palmer and One Nation, he says. Albanese: They are often a part of a Coalition of the cookers over there in Queensland. He has to withdraw it after complaints. I note they find it offensive that I mention Clive Palmer and One Nation with the Queensland LNP. Albanese then points out that the Liberal federal conference this weekend had a seven-minute video on \u201cthe Peter Dutton I know\u201d. \u201cIt was seven minutes, but it seems like longer,\u201d he says. I hope I don\u2019t need to say this, but political parties don\u2019t get to choose who they accept preferences from \u2013 voters vote how they vote. Political parties can put out how to vote cards for their supporters which have a guide on how they would like people to vote, but they cannot decide not to take someone\u2019s preferences. PM: Greens \u2018want people to stay in poverty so they can have a rally against it\u2019 The next question is a dixer on how terrible the Greens are for holding up the housing Australia future fund with its demand for action for renters. Anthony Albanese is VERY exercised as he delivers his answer which includes the mention of an article written by one of the Greens (I think it is Max Chandler-Mather, in Jacobin: This is what he had to say. He wrote, \u2018This parliamentary conflict helped create the space for a broader campaign in civil society\u2019. He went on to say this: \u2018We\u2019re opposing 30,000 social and affordable homes because\u2019 \u2013 and I quote \u2013 \u2018allowing the Haff to pass today would demobilise the growing section of civil society that is justifiably angry about the degree of poverty and financial stress that exists in such a wealthy country\u2019. Because it would demobilise people from campaigning against poverty. They want people to stay in poverty so they can have a rally against it. It goes on and the chamber is in absolute outrage \u2013 on all sides. Paul Karp sees Chandler-Mather say \u201cthat\u2019s right\u201d when Albanese says the Greens want a fight on the issue, and he and the independent MP Dr Monique Ryan are waving Labor MPs on in the universal \u201cbring it on\u201d signal. Or as we said at my Gold Coast school: earrings off, rings on. After learning that Anthony Albanese went downstairs to watch the cricket so as not to disturb his partner, and Peter Dutton watched it on his phone with the volume down so as not to wake his wife, we move on to the questions. Melissa Price kicks it off asking if Linda Burney misled parliament with some of her statements yesterday. (The one in question is about Australia Day not being moved \u2013 the question seems to be based on an article in the Australian (one of many questions which have been based on articles in the Oz over the last couple of weeks) Burney does the verbal equivalent of an annoyed eye roll and says no and what she won\u2019t do is engage in \u201ctokenism\u201d adding that this is \u201cnot about culture wars\u201d. It is not the policy of this government to change the date of Australia Day, many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders have strong views about Australia Day but it is the parliament that makes those decisions. \u201cThis is not about culture wars, this is about closing the gap. This isn\u2019t about division, this is about bringing people together.\u201d Alas, even the Tveeder transcription service has given up today and I can\u2019t say I blame it. Universities contributing to housing crisis \u2018by charging huge prices\u2019, Randwick councillor says The Randwick Greens councillor Philipa Veitch has called for an immediate increase in public and affordable housing and a rent freeze, as students struggle under the weight of rising rents. Speaking at the UNSW protest, she said: Universities have \u2026 been contributing to the problem by charging huge prices for student accommodation, and selling off and leasing land to private accommodation operators. A UNSW spokesperson said its Sydney campus was seeing higher demand for student accommodation compared to recent years, aligned to rental market demands and had established a new \u201cconcierge service\u201d to help students find housing on and off campus. This has been undertaken to support the needs of our students who have been increasingly experiencing difficulties in finding appropriate accommodation. The University is aware that some students may be facing financial challenges at this time. UNSW endeavours to provide the support students need to succeed at university, ranging from financial assistance to academic skills support. UNSW students rally to call for rent caps on campus housing UNSW students are holding a rally this afternoon calling for urgent affordable campus housing as the rental crisis continues to bite. Students are demanding UNSW caps rents on student housing to one-third of youth allowance \u2013 equating to roughly $100 a week \u2013 and commit more finances to providing affordable campus housing. Organiser Cherish Kuehlmann said the cheapest accommodation on campus was currently $653 per fortnight, $100 more than Youth Allowance. Students would have to earn a full-time salary of over $56,000 a year to not experience rental stress. What student can afford that? Every thing I have learnt about Bazball has been against my will. This includes the four minutes of my life listening to both Anthony Albanese and Peter Dutton talk about the Australian team underdog win in the first test. There are four more tests to go. Calm down. Meanwhile, QT will end with a Go the Blues, Up the Maroons moment ahead of origin. And then we will continue to hear about how politics and sport should be seperate. President of Tibet\u2019s government-in-exile compares China\u2019s treatment of Tibetan children to Stolen Generations \u201cWe are dying a slow death culturally, day by day,\u201d the president of Tibet\u2019s government-in-exile said today, as he called on Australia to do more to stop China\u2019s human rights abuses in his country. Penpa Tsering is the democratically elected head of the exiled government, living in India (the Dalai Lama is the spiritual leader of the east Asian nation). Tsering has described China\u2019s increasingly authoritarian rule in China to be \u201ccultural genocide\u201d, and in his National Press Club Speech he said if the federal government\u2019s foreign policy was to impose sanctions on governments that commit crimes against humanity \u201cjust like China does in Tibet\u201d, it should apply equally to everybody. He said: We know for a fact Australia has sanctioned Iran, Burma, Russia, but when it comes to China, then everyone calms down a little bit. He said he understood the sensitivities and the national interest that were involved, with China as Australia\u2019s biggest trading partner, but that the bigger countries could \u201cget away with everything\u201d. Tsering also likened the situation in Tibet to Australia\u2019s Stolen Generations, saying Tibetan children were being taken from their families and put in boarding schools. China was also trialling schools with no Tibetan classes, he said. China is trying to block Tibet and \u201cmake it like a huge prison where nobody can go in, nobody can go out\u201d and then it tells the world it is a \u201csocialist paradise\u201d, he said. He also said the international community seemed to pay attention to violent conflicts and ignore the peaceful resistance of the Tibetan people, and that suited China. \u201cWe are dying a slow death culturally, day by day,\u201d he said. \u201c[But] we have never lost hope.\u201d Greens accused of engineering rental crisis The Greens are now being accused of engineering a rental crisis for their own ends in the house, as the airing of the grievances (90-second statements) comes to an end. The last 90-second statement is usually the main message the government wants to get out because it is the time when everyone is switching over to pay attention before question time. Anyway, here is another view: Question time approaches There is now less than half an hour until question time \u2013 the second last one of the sitting, which means it is also the second last one for almost six weeks. We know that the Coalition will be asking more questions about what the voice can or can\u2019t do and there will be more \u201cwhen will the prime minister come clean about the damage his government is causing our country?\u201d Will the voice be able to save Fantales? Stay tuned. Robodebt statement from Shorten still pending We were waiting for Bill Shorten to deliver a ministerial statement (by leave) on robodebt which was down on the house notice paper for noon \u2013 but it doesn\u2019t seem to have eventuated. It is not surprising that Shorten would be delivering a statement \u2013 the final report is being handed down on 7 July and it\u2019s the last parliament sitting before the Fadden byelection, which is happening because Stuart Robert, one of the Coalition ministers that had carriage of robodebt, has quit the parliament. We\u2019ll endeavour to find out what happened there. \u2018We are not asking for independence\u2019: Tibet\u2019s Penpa Tsering What is the difference between statehood (which Penpa Tsering wants) and independence? Penpa Tsering The middle way approach as proposed by his Holiness is a Buddhist concept avoiding extreme polarity. So one polarity is the status of Tibet, historical status as an independent state and the other polarity is the present state of Tibet under the government of the PRC. We are trying to seek a solution of an autonomous arrangement whereby Tibetans would have the freedom to practise its language, protect its environment, you know, and preserve its culture and religion and language. So these are basic fundamental rights which are taken for granted in the free world that does not exist in Tibet. So this is what we are asking for. We are not asking for independence. Even here at the Press Club, we know that Chinese government \u2013 the Ambassador here \u2013 ask the Press Club to disinvite me, and I always thank the Chinese government for being our best publicity agent. President of the Tibetan government-in-exile delivers press club address Penpa Tsering, president of the Tibetan government-in-exile, is giving his press club address. His government-in-exile is headquartered in northern India. Freedom House, the international watchdog, has designated Tibet as one of the least free countries alongside South Sudan and Syria. That itself explains it is not the Tibetans who are saying we are the least free country in the world, it is the international watchdog who is looking into all the parameters of freedom. That it is what are the least free countries in the world where you have no access, no access to diplomats, no access to journalists, no access to even ordinary travellers. That is what China tries to do, lock away Tibet, make it like a huge prison where nobody can go in, nobody can go out and then tell the international community that Tibet is a socialist paradise. If Tibet is a socialist paradise, then why does Chinese government [not] allow [people] to see the paradise for themselves? Tibet does not have any political or civil rights. If anyone of you have read George Orwell\u2019s 1984, that has come into reality in China and more so in the Tibetan region, Mongolian region and in Hong Kong. Tibetans inside Tibet have no political space to express themselves. Government sets up national registry to help combat workplace respiratory diseases A national registry has been established to detect and combat deadly workplace respiratory diseases as the federal government seeks to tackle the prevalence of silicosis, AAP reports. If passed, the law will require mandatory reporting of the disease which affects nearly one-in-four engineered stone workers in the industry prior to 2018. But the peak union representing workers wants a ban on engineered stone to eradicate disease. Products with high silica levels \u2013 commonly used in kitchen and bathroom benches \u2013 have been linked to the incurable lung disease silicosis and cancer. Assistant health minister Ged Kearney said every case of silicosis was unacceptable. Introducing the proposal to parliament, she told the story of Joanna, a 34-year-old mother of two who worked at a quarry run by a large multinational company. During a fit-for-work test after returning from maternity leave, Joanna was diagnosed with silicosis. Kearney said: She\u2019s not who many people would first picture when they think of a worker diagnosed with silicosis. She\u2019s a young woman and she worked largely in a reception role at the front office of the quarry. (Joanna) should never have been diagnosed with this disease.\u201d The proposed national occupational respiratory disease registry will capture information on respiratory disease believed to have been caused by or exacerbated in the workplace. Respiratory, sleep, occupational and environmental medicine specialists will be required to notify the registry of every diagnosis of occupationally caused silicosis. They may also notify the registry of other occupational respiratory diseases, with the patient\u2019s consent. Protest mounted to save Kosciuszko brumbies Ahhh \u2013 the mounted protest on the lawns of Parliament House is seeking to draw attention to the push to save the feral horses/brumbies in Kosciuszko national park. The horses are being culled because their population is too large and they are causing damage to the ecosystem of the national park, including critically endangered frogs. But the group is urging for other solutions to allow the horses to live. Victorian Coalition urged to drop vote on Paul Denyer parole bill Victoria\u2019s attorney general Jaclyn Symes is urging the Coalition not to put its bill to restrict any future parole applications by serial killer Paul Denyer to a vote in parliament today. The bill, which proposes the serial killer should only be able to apply for parole if seriously incapacitated or at risk of death, is currently being debated in the upper house and will be put to a vote, but is doomed to fail without the support of Labor, the Greens and the two Legalise Cannabis MPs. The government has ruled out creating a single law dealing specifically with Denyer\u2019s case and is instead considering restricting serial killers from applying for parole for several years. Symes said she had met with the family of one of Denyer\u2019s victims and gave them a \u201cpersonal commitment\u201d that she would craft laws that \u201cgive them comfort that Paul Denyer is not getting out of prison\u201d. But she confirmed Labor would vote against the Coalition\u2019s bill, which she says would lead to a legal challenge: A one-man piece of legislation in relation to denying them parole forever will be challenged in the high court. We\u2019ve had successes in the high court before but there\u2019s no guarantee that we will have a success again, particularly when I\u2019ve been able to articulate that there are other options on the table in relation to dealing with this matter. Symes urged the Coalition to delay a vote on their bill and instead arrange a meeting with her and the family I have expressed my preference to not debate this bill today. I know that family members are coming in today. We should use the opportunity to sit down and have further conversations with them. It\u2019s a very unknown world \u2013 politics \u2013 for a lot of people. So taking the time to explain the process, explain the options, I think is a better use of today\u2019s time than politicians standing up talking about these victims when you can actually talk to them. The neighs have it There is some sort of mounted protest on the lawns in front of Parliament House. As in horses. The Senate has passed a government taxation bill, including a Greens amendment supported by Labor setting up a proactive disclosure regime for the future fund. The Greens amendment would require the minister to make regulations specifying that the future fund is to publicly report every six months on details of its investments including where funds are invested and how much. Greens treasury spokesperson Nick McKim said: Australians have a right to know exactly how the future fund is investing $250bn of their money. For too long the future fund has been operating behind closed doors and making investments that have had calamitous environmental and human rights impacts. Mandatory disclosure will reveal whether the future fund is still investing in weapons manufacturers or fossil fuel corporations, as it has regularly done in the past. It took [freedom of information] requests to reveal the fund had invested in arms companies with links to the Myanmar military. And it took questions through Senate estimates to find out that the future fund has $3.4bn in the 50 biggest fossil fuel companies in the world. Public pressure following these revelations forced the future fund to divest, but it shouldn\u2019t be that hard to hold the future fund to account. We hope that the disinfectant of sunlight will bring about a change in the future fund\u2019s investments and ultimately force them to invest ethically. Proactive disclosure will increase pressure on the future fund to make investment decisions in line with the values that Australians expect. Defence stopped sharing VIP flight details with watchdog, FOI documents show We reported earlier this year that the defence department had suddenly stopped publishing details about the use of its VIP jet fleet by politicians, preventing the public from scrutinising their potential misuse. Now, freedom of information documents show that the department has also stopped providing details of the flights to the Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority, the watchdog designed to prevent travel rorts. Ipea has a role in recovering funds from the offices of MPs who should be using their own travel budget to pay for the costly flights \u2013 thought to be worth $4,600 an hour. It recovered about $38,000 in 2019-20 and 2020-21 alone. But the department ceased handing over the data to Ipea in December 2021, preventing it from recovering any further funds. An Ipea spokesperson said: Ipea undertakes budget allocation and recovery action based on information provided by Defence. The most recent information related to 2021. Discussions with Defence relating to the SPA [special purpose aircraft] are ongoing. Defence did not respond to a request for comment but has previously raised security concerns around the sharing of the VIP fleet data. The AEC commissioner Tom Rogers has a general message for anyone campaigning for either side of the referendum \u2013 if in doubt, authorise the message. Politically active entities are familiar with the requirement to authorise their messages but others who will campaign in this referendum may not be. If your communication is designed to encourage people to vote a certain way and you are expending money to create or distribute that communication, or if you\u2019re likely to be a referendum entity, then you have to authorise that communication. Authorisation laws are all about people knowing who is communicating with them about their vote \u2013 my advice to all campaigners is to make that as clear as possible and, if in doubt, authorise. Public debate is important. The AEC isn\u2019t here to stifle or prevent debate but we do want to make sure referendum communication is transparent and complies with the law. Jane Hume makes her speaking slot \u2013 just Liberal senator Jane Hume, the shadow minister for finance, is a little out of breath as she delivers a speech in the Senate \u2013 it looks like she has had to run into the chamber to make her speaking slot. She pulls on her blazer as she speaks and pushes through catching her breath at the same time. Someone hands her a glass of water, which she gratefully accepts. Chris Bowen has announced funding to sustainable aviation fuel. Bowen, the climate change and energy minister, and Andrew Leigh went out to the Canberra airport this morning to make the announcement. Bowen: Today we\u2019re announcing that Arena, the federal government\u2019s renewable investment agency, will invest $30m to work with companies to make sustainable aviation fuel a reality \u2013 not interested at this point in early-stage research; that work has been done. This is about late-stage research taking work that\u2019s already been done and turning it into commercial reality, making it available for Australia\u2019s airlines and, indeed, for international airlines to refuel in Australia. Qantas calls Australia home; we want to make Australia a home for sustainable aviation fuel. So these grant applications will open in the coming weeks and will be open until November. So I invite people who are interested in developing Australia\u2019s sustainable aviation fuel industry to apply for $30m of funding. It will make a difference to taking good research that\u2019s already occurred and taking it to the next step to make that a reality. Tibetan leader to speak at the National Press Club At the National Press Club today is Sikyong Penpa Tsering, the democratically elected political leader of the Tibetan government-in-exile. He is visiting Australia until 25 June. Penpa Tsering wants the Australian government to take a stronger stance at China\u2019s increasing human rights violations in Tibet and wants help ending what he is calling a \u201ccultural genocide\u201d. Perfect exchange, no notes. The Victorian premier Daniel Andrews has arrived at parliament and is taking questions from journalists. First up, he\u2019s asked if he deserves to be the highest-paid premier in the country \u2013 with his salary set to increase by 3.5% to about $480,000. His reply: An independent body determines all of our pay, terms and conditions. It\u2019s an independent body. There was a time when politicians set their own pay and we took steps to change that. We stand by those decisions. Andrews says Victoria won\u2019t follow NSW in freezing MPs pay during the cost-of-living crisis. He says the government is currently negotiating pay deals with the public sector \u201cin good faith\u201d: We will negotiate in good faith with all of our workforce and we hope that all employers negotiate in good faith with all employees regardless of industry, regardless of circumstance, that\u2019s our approach. It\u2019s an independent model. We do not set our own pay \u2013 it\u2019s set by an independent, arm\u2019s length tribunal, and that is far preferable in my mind to MPs setting their own pay rises. Andrews has rebuffed questions about his \u201chalfwit grub\u201d comment directed at a female Liberal MP: The comments were withdrawn in accordance with the rules of the house. I\u2019ve got nothing further to say. I\u2019ve addressed these issues in question. I\u2019ve got nothing further to add. This sort of debate is going to continue today: Greens\u2019 Barbara Pocock wants to see PwC held accountable The Greens senator Barbara Pocock is using the Australia Institute polling that found 80% of respondents wanted to see PwC banned from holding new government contracts to continue her push to see the consulting and accounting firm held accountable: I share the shock and disgust that Australians feel when they hear about the rich and powerful ripping off Australian taxpayers in the most cynical and self-interested way. This survey result certainly ramps up the pressure on the government to take more decisive action against PwC, who have clearly lost the trust of the Australian people. There has been a moral and ethical failure within this firm, which has its tentacles in just about every facet of public life in Australia. Pesutto says Victorian MPs\u2019 3.5% pay rise \u2018overshoots the runway\u2019 Victorian opposition leader John Pesutto has called for a review into the state\u2019s remuneration tribunal, which awarded MPs a 3.5% pay rise yesterday, saying the decision doesn\u2019t meet community expectations. He told reporters: This was a system that the Andrews government established some years ago. It\u2019s designed to be an independent tribunal. But clearly, it\u2019s landing decisions that don\u2019t sit well with the expectations of the Victorian community. The government having set up this system really needs to look at ways to make sure that the criteria that the remuneration tribunal takes into account as an independent wage setting body will lead to decisions that better reflect the expectations of the Victorian people. I don\u2019t think Victorians believe that politicians should never get pay increases. I think Victorians, like everyone else around the country, believe in fair and reasonable increases, but not ones that overshoot the runway like this. Pesutto also reiterated his call for Daniel Andrews to apologise to Cindy McLeish: This parliament must lead in terms of lifting standards of political discourse and debate in this state. And if the premier can\u2019t do it, if the minister for women won\u2019t defend women, and if Danny Pearson is prepared to come out and say that he too supports the premier\u2019s comments, it shows that we have a government that is not committed to those high standards. Telstra-TPG bid to expand regional networks knocked back Telstra and TPG have suffered another blow in their bid to expand their networks in regional parts of Australia, with the Australian Competition Tribunal backing a previous Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ruling against the two companies sharing network infrastructure. The deal would have resulted in TPG decommissioning about 700 Vodafone mobile sites in order to use 3,700 Telstra mobile sites in a network sharing agreement across 4G and 5G. It would have increased the reach of Vodafone\u2019s mobile network in regional and remote parts of Australia \u2013 increasing coverage from 96% to 98.8% of the Australian population. Telstra would have also gained access to 169 TPG sites. It was struck down by the ACCC in December, and in an appeal judgment on Thursday, competition tribunal president Justice Michael O\u2019Bryan said while the agreement would not materially affect TPG\u2019s position in the market, it would further increase Telstra\u2019s competitive position in the market. He said it would also undermine Optus\u2019s willingness to invest in expanding its network coverage. O\u2019Bryan said the tribunal was concerned with maintaining competition in the mobile retail and wholesale markets as a whole, and not Optus specifically, but said that the market is highly concentrated and unlikely to expand to more operators. He indicated the ruling was limited to this agreement and other network sharing arrangements might not be knocked back in a similar fashion. AAP has reported on the latest climate protests at the country\u2019s coal ports: Newcastle and Melbourne ports have again been targeted by climate protesters, just hours after a teenager scaled a coal loader and glued herself to a railing. It\u2019s the third day of action by climate activists targeting major east coast coal ports. A young woman abseiled off Shepherd Bridge on Footscray Road on Wednesday morning, blocking six lanes of traffic with a safety line stretched across the road. Earlier, a 22-year-old man perched himself on top of a nine-metre pole on a rail bridge at Branxton, forcing the closure of the NSW Hunter railway line, with no trains running between Scone and Maitland. The man anchored the pole to rail infrastructure to cause maximum disruption to operations. By mid Monday morning both protesters had yet to be removed by police. The action comes after an 18-year-old Canberra woman was charged on Tuesday night after scaling a coal loader at Newcastle and gluing herself to a railing. On Monday another woman was charged after suspending herself above the railway leading to Newcastle\u2019s coal loader. NSW police minister Yasmin Catley labelled the protesters \u201ccrazy\u201d and \u201cblockheads\u201d, describing the action as \u201cabsolute nonsense\u201d. \u201cTheir actions do absolutely nothing for the environment or climate change,\u201d she told Sydney radio 2GB. Midwinter Ball \u2013 the Aldi version of the White House press corps dinner I\u2019ve had a few people ask about the Midwinter Ball \u2013 what is it, what goes on and why it happens. Hosted by the press gallery, it\u2019s like the Aldi version of the White House press corps dinner. Unlike the White House gala, it is off the record \u2013 which is why you don\u2019t see the speeches like you do when DC hosts its annual affair. People have to register their interest in buying tickets \u2013 attendance is not guaranteed. Politicians have to be invited to attend on one of the tables \u2013 again, attendance is not guaranteed. It\u2019s all run by the press gallery committee and a special Midwinter Ball committee. Everyone has to pay for their ticket. There is usually a comedian as host and live entertainment. The press gallery journalist of the year is announced at the ball. And the leaders of the political parties give speeches, usually self-deprecating. There has been an ongoing battle over whether they should be off the record. You may remember that Malcolm Turnbull wasn\u2019t happy when his Donald Trump impression was reported quite a few years ago. There is a good cause underpinning it all \u2013 it has raised millions for charity over the years. Which means there are raffles and auctions \u2013 this year you can go to the cricket with Peter Dutton, or play a game of tennis or pool with Anthony Albanese at the Lodge. I am not attending (it is not my scene) so I will let you know if I hear of anything happening on the night. In the meantime, a few happy snaps from last year\u2019s do: Daniel Andrews was defending female MP, says former minister for women Victoria\u2019s former minister for women Gabrielle Williams is also out this morning defending the premier\u2019s \u201chalfwit grub\u201d comment directed at a female Liberal MP yesterday. Williams \u2013 who served as minister for women between 2018 and 2022 \u2013 also said he was defending Northcote Labor MP Kat Theophanous: I know that the premier like a great many others on our side of the chamber took umbrage at what was without doubt a very low blow directed at the member for Northcote. He was obviously defending the member for Northcote. These are attacks from the opposition that are not unusual in that place. And you know, we have much to point to in their treatment of women and in their approach on these issues. She accused Liberal MPs of shouting over female ministers during recent budget estimates hearings: We disproportionately saw women members screamed at, talked over and generally treated very poorly in in contrast to our male counterparts. After about five minutes of questioning, Williams eventually conceded the premier\u2019s comments were inappropriate and noted he withdrew them: The premier himself acknowledged they were not appropriate hence his withdrawal. It is no surprise that it gets icier the closer you get to Parliament House. Zoe Daniel not impressed with Coalition gambling bill Independent Goldstein MP Zoe Daniel introduced her private member\u2019s bill to ban gambling ads earlier in the sitting \u2013 she has just seen the opposition\u2019s bill, which was introduced in the Senate and she is not impressed: The Labor legislation to expand income management is in the Senate today for its second reading debate \u2013 and will be passed, given the Coalition is also in support of it. Labor said it had abolished mandatory cashless debit cards \u2013 but it always remained, it just became voluntary and the BasicsCard (which is mandatory in some areas, including the NT) remained. So income management never went away. And now, it is about to be expanded. As the bill\u2019s explanatory notes say: Firstly, the bill extends the enhanced IM regime to include all of the measures that are in place for the IM regime in part 3B of the Administration Act. This will allow eligible welfare recipients to enter an enhanced IM regime that offers improved technology and access to over one million outlets across Australia as well as \u2018Tap and Go\u2019 transactions, online shopping and Bpay Secondly, the Bill gives people subject to the IM regime under part 3B the choice to move to enhanced IM from the commencement date, thereby allowing them to access the BasicsCard bank account and superior SmartCard. Thirdly, the bill directs all new entrants to the enhanced IM regime while further consultation is undertaken on the long-term future of IM. The Greens and the crossbench cannot stop this as the Coalition is in support of the bill, which means the government does not have to negotiate. Greens leader: Victorian MPs\u2019 pay rises should match public sector workers\u2019 Victorian Greens leader Samantha Ratnam says MPs\u2019 pay rises shouldn\u2019t be higher than that of public servants. MPs were awarded a 3.5% pay rise \u2013 0.5% more than what has been offered to public sector workers. Ratnam told reporters outside parliament: The Greens have consistently argued that politicians\u2019 pay rises shouldn\u2019t exceed the public sector wage cap. We\u2019ve also consistently argued that politicians\u2019 pay should be set by an independent body like the remuneration tribunal. We acknowledge that people are doing it really tough at the moment and our public sector wages especially have been suppressed for years. We\u2019ve been pushing for that public sector wage cap to be increased. Our nurses and teachers should be paid fairly and we will continue to advocate for the fair pay for all workers. The sitting has begun and the house has opened with a moment\u2019s silence for WA police officer Anthony Woods. Victorian frontbencher backs Andrews over \u2018halfwit\u2019 comment Danny Pearson also backed in the premier, who on Tuesday refused to apologise to Liberal MP Cindy McLeish for calling her a \u201chalfwit grub\u201d in state parliament. Andrews argued he was defending Northcote Labor MP Kat Theophanous, after McLeish said she should vote on a bill related to anti-corruption report into her father, Theo. Pearson said Andrews was justified in his comments: I absolutely support the comments made by the premier because of the premier was standing up to support the integrity of the member Northcote, which was under attack. Victorian minister Danny Pearson has defended a 3.5% pay rise awarded to MPs, saying he would be contributing some of his salary to local charities. The Victorian Independent Remuneration Tribunal on Tuesday released its annual determination that will see the base salary for all Victorian MPs increase by 3.5%. The increase will see a backbencher\u2019s salary reach $199,000 a year, while the premier\u2019s will rise to $480,000. Pearson said the decision was independent, noting the Andrews government in 2017 set up the tribunal to ensure politicians could no longer set their own salaries: One of the decisions we made as a government early on was to take out these decisions from the hands of politicians into the hands of any independent tribunal. That tribunal has done its work; it\u2019s made those findings. He said he would donate some of his salary to charities in his Essendon electorate: I work very closely with my community and identify where there\u2019s needs and make a donation. I\u2019ve always done that. And I\u2019ll continue to do that. Deputy RBA governor says unemployment needs to increase for inflation control The deputy RBA governor, Michele Bullock gave a speech in Newcastle yesterday where she made clear the central bank believes unemployment needs to increase in order for inflation to get under control. Bullock was speaking about Nairu \u2013 the non-accelerating rate of unemployment, which is a fancy term that essentially describes the theoretical level of unemployment where wages and employment are under control. When orthodox economists talk about \u2018full employment\u2019 this is what they mean. Not everyone having a job and the hours they want to work (which is what full unemployment meant postwar at least for white men of working age) but a set unemployment rate (at the moment they think 4.5%). So hundreds of thousands of people being unemployed in order for the economy to keep inflation under control. Bullock: Our goal is to return the labour market (and the market for goods and services) back to a level consistent with full employment \u2013 something like the endpoint in our forecasts. We think this can be achieved if employment and the economy more generally grow at below trend pace for a while. This would help to bring demand and supply into better balance and give us the greatest chance of securing sustainable full employment into the future.\u201d The unemployment rate is currently 3.6%. So what the RBA is saying is unemployment needs to INCREASE for the good of the economy as a whole. You\u2019ll probably see a lot of neoliberal economists and market defenders talk about how alternative is a much higher unemployment rate and inflation sticking around for longer and that it\u2019s a hard reality, but a reality nonetheless. Which, OK, fine. But are they going to volunteer for unemployment to help the economy? Will they be OK with losing their job in order to help lower inflation as a whole? Of course not. Because it won\u2019t be them. Or the people they know. It will be the people who benefited the most from the tight labour market \u2013 people in minimum wage jobs and those with low education/skill levels. And at the same time, those same people defending calls for higher unemployment don\u2019t want to see the unemployment rate raised because that could be inflationary. Sussan Ley: Linda Burney has questions to answer on voice to parliament Sussan Ley has held a quick doorstop to deliver her daily \u2018XX has questions to answer\u2019 spiel. This time it is Linda Burney. Linda Burney has real questions to answer regarding the portfolio that she\u2019s responsible for, Indigenous Australians. Yesterday in the parliament, we asked straightforward questions, and we didn\u2019t get straightforward answers. Which is the way this government treats the question of the voice in the parliament, they are politicising it*. They\u2019re not answering in genuine terms the questions that we\u2019re asking. It is simply not good enough for Linda Burney to say in the parliament the voice will not make representations on Australia Day and she ruled out other matters that we questioned her on as well. She\u2019s now being contradicted by experts, including those on the Yes campaign and her own referendum working group. They\u2019ve taken a completely different position. They\u2019re right, Linda Burney is wrong. She needs to come into the parliament, and she needs to correct the record. *little bit of projection there ** the questions included; Which policy area, portfolio or government department would the voice not deal with? Would the voice be able to make representatives to the chief of the defence force on military acquisitions or the location or operation of military bases? How many people will make up the voice body, who will appoint them and how long will they be appointed for? Which have been answered over and over again. Just on that post from Josh independent senator and former Wallaby captain David Pocock plays for Queensland in the politician state of origin and it\u2019s like watching a benevolent uncle play with the kids at the family barbecue. State of Origin match clashes with the press gallery Midwinter Ball Tonight is the annual gladiatorial contest of mate against mate, state against state \u2013 as top competitors, who are usually staunch allies, face off in bitter rivalry to be crowned champion. The competition is fierce and tense. And in addition to the press gallery Midwinter Ball naming the journalist of the year this evening, there\u2019s also the second match of the State of Origin series. For any footy tragics, you\u2019ll know that one of the best parts of Origin was always Nine commentator Phil Gould giving his dramatic monologue right on the cusp of kickoff, with sweeping cinematic camerawork as the former NSW coach talked about heart and spirit and Origin; and guts and bravery, and Origin; and mateship, and putting your body on the line, and of course, Origin. Gould has sadly long since retired that pregame monologue, but sports minister Anika Wells has resurrected a version of her own, filmed on the Parliament House front lawn. It\u2019s very on-point and startlingly true to Gould\u2019s tradition (now we\u2019re just waiting for the minister to announce some long-awaited progress and federal funding for NRL Island). We\u2019re hoping her Queenslanders don\u2019t wrap up the series tonight. PM Anthony Albanese has already ribbed the gallery for scheduling the Midwinter Ball on the same night as the decisive footy clash, so we\u2019re expecting a lot of phones quietly playing the game under tables tonight. The Albanese government has announced it will start real-time reporting of all deaths in custody. Thirty-two years after the royal commission into Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander deaths in custody, 540 Indigenous people have died while incarcerated. The attorney general Mark Dreyfus said real-time reporting of deaths will bring additional transparency and accountability. The government has launched a \u201cdashboard\u201d to provide up-to-date information on all deaths occurring in police and prison custody as well as in youth detention. The dashboard will be monitored by the Australian Institute of Criminology (AIC). From the statement: The new real-time deaths in custody dashboard provides aggregate information on all deaths in custody at the national level. Information is provided on custody type (police or prison), Indigenous status (including unknown), and sex and age group of the deceased. The dashboard provides preliminary data. The AIC will continue to provide verified information on deaths in custody on a quarterly and annual basis. Information included on the dashboard is supplied to the AIC by state and territory police and prison authorities through death notification forms and the dashboard is updated as the information is received. The real-time deaths in custody dashboard will be available on the AIC Website at 9am, Wednesday 21 June 2023 (AEST). Lambie says Greens need to start \u2018putting a roof over people\u2019s heads\u2019 Labor has said that the Housing Australia future fund is one part of its plan to address housing, but not the only one, so no, I don\u2019t think Jacqui Lambie is breaking any confidences there. Lambie finished the interview with a message to the Greens (this is also not a new message from Lambie but it is a little more refined) Just get this money and start spending and get those houses built. Goodness. We need those houses started now. It really floored me with the Greens that sit there and put their credentials down to you know \u2018that they\u2019re the best social people out there. They help the most vulnerable\u2019. Well if this is helping the most vulnerable, well, blow me blimey bloody over this morning. You are not helping anyone but yourselves. This has got nothing to do with politics. This has got to do with putting a roof over people\u2019s heads. Get on with it. The interview moves to housing and Jacqui Lambie says she doesn\u2019t think there will be a double dissolution election over it (the government made it clear after the Senate decision to delay the bill to 16 October it considered the bill to have failed for the first time \u2013 the first step in a double dissolution trigger) but she is also very uncomfortable with the delay itself. Every day you delay this is every day that we have more kids sleeping out in the cars with their parents. And I can tell you I\u2019m sitting in Canberra now. It\u2019s bloody freezing, and Tasmania is just as bad. This is a starting point. And if there are hiccups along the way, you know, I\u2019m sure the government will work alongside that. They\u2019ve just put another $2bn into it. They will \u2013 I honestly believe the prime minister and I hope this is not breaking confidentiality with my meetings with him \u2013 there\u2019s things to be worked out along the way or we need to add more we can see that there\u2019s, you know, see that we can plug gaps along the way Lambie agrees with calls to have Iraq invasion decision referred to ICC Jacqui Lambie says she also agrees with calls to have the leaders of the \u201ccoalition of the willing\u201d \u2013 the leaders of the UK, the US and Australia when the decision was made to invade Iraq \u2013 also referred to the international criminal court. Beyond that, she says Australia has never really examined its role in that decision. I absolutely agree with and when you go in to Iraq, and you say you have a reason to do that \u2026 when you work out three years later that the reason that they were using was not there at all, then we have a massive problem here and you continue to stay in a war that you probably should never have been involved in the first place because you didn\u2019t have that information correct. Then you have a problem. And quite frankly, politicians when they send us into war, they should be accountable as well. What really bothers me more than anything \u2026 We still have not got a committee up and running, to look at what happened in the last 20 years to fully investigate this and come up with their own conclusions in this country, because we\u2019re too bloody scared. Jacqui Lambie speaks about referring Australia\u2019s ADF command to ICC on RN breakfast Independent senator Jacqui Lambie is speaking to Patricia Karvelas on ABC RN Breakfast about her referral of Australia\u2019s senior ADF command to the international criminal court that she announced yesterday. If Australia \u2013 and both governments we\u2019ve seen it from the Liberal party and now from the Labor party \u2013 if they\u2019re not prepared to go in and look at senior command \u2026 I\u2019m going to force them to. Because you are not going to chuck all these diggers under the bus and not [front] up. Lambie says she expects the ICC to make inquiries to Australia about whether it has included senior command in its investigations. The ICC has to decide to investigate \u2013 a referral does not mean an investigation. What was not covered in that interview is one of the biggest news stories of the year \u2013 Fantales are to be discontinued. We may never know the PM\u2019s thoughts on the matter now. History will forever be bereft of these details. Albanese promises footy and beers with Triple M Sydney hosts Anthony Albanese gets a Taylor Swift \u201cshake it off\u201d intro and launches straight in to telling how he is a bit tired because \u201cI got up early and watched the last hour of that amazing cricket\u201d. \u201cI was sitting there in the dark, in the jammies at the Lodge.\u201d He\u2019d like to give himself a holiday he says, because he is tired. We move on to the State of Origin. Not enough Rabbitohs in the team apparently. He says that Annastacia Palaszczuk is not confident because Queensland does better when they\u2019re the underdog. True. But he neglects to mention that is just because Queensland has more heart. It\u2019s just a fact. But he won\u2019t be watching the game because of the press gallery Midwinter Ball. They say sometimes that politicians are out of touch and I understand why they sometimes say that \u2013 but the media, the media guys, the press gallery ball is on tonight. It\u2019s for charity but they put it on tonight. \u2026 Could have been last week, could have been next week. Could have been any time. They then play a clip of Albanese promising to take the hosts on a pub crawl around Balmain. That\u2019s another in a growing list of promises the prime minister has made (and kept) for FM radio hosts \u2013 he went to Kyle Sandilands\u2019 wedding and had Perth FM breakfast hosts over to the Lodge for dinner. Now it\u2019s footy and beers with Triple M Sydney hosts. The interview ends and we hear Roam by the B-52s Albanese to speak on Triple M Sydney soon Anthony Albanese is continuing his FM radio strategy \u2013 he\u2019ll be on FM radio Triple M Sydney very soon. It\u2019s a strategy Bill Shorten started as opposition leader and Albanese has perfected. He\u2019ll be speaking to Mick and MG this morning because it is Origin tonight. We\u2019ve just heard White Wedding and Pearl Jam\u2019s Last Kiss so it\u2019s not as bad as it could be. Tomorrow is the last sitting day in parliament For a moment I was excited and thought it was the winter solstice (the shortest day of the year) but alas that is tomorrow. Which is also the last sitting day ahead of the winter break. If you were wondering why the parliament seems more unhinged than usual lately, this is why \u2013 it\u2019s the last chance to get things on the agenda until the end of next month. Thank you to Martin for getting us started on what is another below-freezing start to a Canberra sitting day. This little Queenslander is not impressed. The MPs are up and about ahead of the second-last sitting day for about six weeks. It\u2019s also the Midwinter Ball tonight, so there will be a lot more people hanging around than usual. As Martin said, the main issue inside the parliament is the ongoing housing fight between Labor and the Greens. It\u2019s between Labor and the Greens because once again, the Coalition dealt themselves out very early. Paul Karp and Josh Butler will keep you informed on the Canberra happenings and you\u2019ve got Amy Remeikis on the blog. Ready? It\u2019s at least a four-coffee day. And a few hot-water bottles. And maybe cake for breakfast. Warmed. Let\u2019s get into it. As rents rise across the country, Labor\u2019s signature policy to ease the rental crisis \u2013 the $10bn Housing Australia future fund \u2013 has stalled in the Senate as the Greens demand more concessions. To pass the bill, they are calling for up to $2.5bn of direct spending on housing and extra funds to incentivise the states to freeze rents. Amid the worsening standoff between Labor and the Greens, chief political correspondent Paul Karp looks at the fight over renters\u2019 rights and whether it could spell the end of the government\u2019s housing bill. Listen here: Looks like the PM was up early this morning, judging by this 4am tweet \u2026 Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the news day. I\u2019m Martin Farrer and I\u2019ve got a few overnight headlines for you on what promises to be another fast-moving day in Canberra. Amy Remiekis will then be along to guide you through the day. The Albanese government has asked the solicitor general for advice about having another attempt to pass the Housing Australia future fund bill amid a continued standoff with the Greens about the legislation. The move could lead to a double dissolution election if the Greens reject the bill again. They want to see more progress on help for renters while the government accused them playing \u201cjuvenile\u201d games. More on this coming up, including our Full Story podcast today. The defence department has stopped providing details about the use of taxpayer-funded VIP jets to the nation\u2019s independent expenses watchdog, leaving it unable to recover funds from the offices of MPs who use it to ferry electorate staff and family across the country. The lack of transparency means we can\u2019t scrutinise how politicians are using the expensive planes, our freedom of information expert, Christopher Knaus, reports. Three-quarters of Australians believe it is likely China will become a military threat to Australia in the next two decades but a majority say Australia should remain neutral in the event of a conflict between China and the United States. The 2023 Lowy Institute poll, which surveyed more than 2,000 Australians in March on a range of issues, also found that 82% of Australians see an alliance with the US as \u201cvery important\u201d or \u201cfairly important\u201d, down five points from a record high last year."}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db52d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/21/ukraine-recovery-london-conference-volodymyr-zelenskiy-eu", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Ukraine has made west more united than ever, says Zelenskiy", "lead": "Ukrainian president says his country can become an engine of green growth for decades after the war", "author": "Patrick Wintour Diplomatic editor", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 10:40:52", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.989646", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/28797084222b58ee817c4a386f551ebc15c958cb/0_120_6543_3926/500.jpg", "body": "Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said that Ukraine has made the west, including the EU, more united than ever before and can become an engine for green world growth and security for decades, in an address by video link to more than 1,000 businesses and foreign ministers at a two-day Ukraine Recovery conference in London. The Ukrainian president argued that the fight for his country was a way to protect freedom and security across the world and, once at peace and free from Russian interference, Ukraine could be \u201cthe largest source of economic, industrial and technological growth in Europe for decades and decades\u201d. He told the conference it was now time to move from visions of Ukraine\u2019s recovery to specific agreements. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, told the meeting Ukraine was running a budget deficit to 2027 of \u20ac60bn (\u00a352bn) and blamed the destruction on \u201cone man\u2019s delusional attempt to restore a lost empire\u201d. She said she was sure Ukraine would become a member of the European Union, and delivered an upbeat progress report on Ukraine meeting its pre-accession commitments towards democracy, judicial reform, media freedom and anti-corruption. \u201cUkraine had accelerated its reform programme with impressive speed and resolve,\u201d she said, adding that before the summer break the EU woud deliver a report on how Russia should pay for the damage it has caused inside Ukraine. \u201cUkraine stunned us with their bravery, inspired us with ingenuity and awed us with their determination. Others could never match Ukraine\u2019s courage, but it is our special responsibility to make a Ukrainian victory happen. \u201cUkrainians tell us that when they imagine their future, they see Europe\u2019s flag flying over their cities. And I have no doubt that Ukraine will be part of our union.\u201d Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, said the US was providing a further $1.3bn (\u00a31bn) in additional aid including $520m to overhaul its energy grid, of which half has been destroyed by Russia. A further $675m will be provided to update its infrastructure, ports and border crossings, including to funds to digitalise trade. He said the US had provided $60bn in aid but eventually only the private sector could provide the investments that Ukraine needed. Blinken also insisted: \u201cRussia will eventually bear the cost of Ukraine\u2019s reconstruction.\u201d Richard Branson, the Virgin owner and a Ukraine ambassador for business, condemned those companies still operating in Russia and called for sanctions to be strengthened and loopholes to be tightened. Zelenskiy tried to present a vision of how a postwar Ukraine could become a future bulwark for security, stability, democracy and prosperity across the west. He said Ukraine could provide grains to 600 million consumers, lithium for batteries, metallurgy, fertilisers and green energy. He added that there was no alternative to the green transformation of the economy saying \u201ceach strike on our energy facilities ends the era of fossil fuel dominance and a world over-dependent on one supplier, Russia\u201d. He claimed Vladimir Putin had invaded Ukraine not just to steal resources, but because Russia was \u201cworried about our democracy because democracy paves the way for rule of law and getting rid of corruption\u201d. He urged western leaders to have the \u201ccourage\u201d to acknowledge that his country was already a key part of their economic and defence alliances. \u201cWe are only waiting for the courage of the alliance leaders to recognise this reality, politically,\u201d he told the conference. Rishi Sunak, the UK prime minister, said: \u201cBefore this terrible war, Ukraine\u2019s economy was becoming a huge investment opportunity. \u201cIt was the breadbasket of Europe, exporting millions of tonnes of food and grain each month, a top-five exporter of iron ore and steel, a leader in energy \u2013 pushing forward renewables, hydrogen and electric vehicles \u2013 and a start-up nation [\u2026] with a thriving tech sector, which actually had a record year in 2022. \u201cThe truth is, that opportunity is still there today \u2013 in fact the war has only proved how much Ukraine has to offer.\u201d He highlighted Ukraine\u2019s technological expertise, saying IT experts and the military have developed a mobile app to track the Shahed drones being used by Russia. Sunak said that when he visited Kyiv in November, he saw the people\u2019s spirit of \u201cingenuity and innovation\u201d. \u201cIn a converted office block I met tech experts \u2013 civilian and military \u2013 who were working together to find new ways to bolster the country\u2019s defences. \u201cThey were networking mobile phones so that people across Ukraine could download an app which would allow their phone to pick up the sound of the Shahed drones and feed back the location so that Ukrainian air defence could track them and shoot them down.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db52e", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jun/21/roman-holiday-review-theatre-royal-bath", "primaryCategory": "stage", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Roman Holiday review \u2013 movie magic gets lost in translation", "lead": "Despite charismatic performances and real chemistry, the classic Audrey Hepburn romcom falters in its transition into a Cole Porter jukebox musical", "author": "Emma John", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 10:38:06", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.989664", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/f21aeff820c92307dbd6caa2827d3261b4777808/0_240_3600_2160/500.jpg", "body": "Jeremy Sams\u2019 production of Roman Holiday opens in Bath the same week that Prince Harry\u2019s phone hacking trial is being heard in the high court, and some material could come straight from a witness statement. \u201cShe\u2019s fair game,\u201d photographer Irving tells his journalist partner Joe: \u201cIt\u2019s always open season on princesses\u201d.

I was with a friend who had never heard of it, and so a couple of hours later we were playing it on the Switch in a pub, honking and flapping and making life difficult for any human unfortunate enough to cross our path. The sheer physical comedy of the game \u2013 the goose\u2019s waddling gait, the appalled reactions of the villagers, the mischievous glee of running away from a gardener with a trowel in my beak and throwing it into the pond \u2013 is delightful. If anything, it\u2019s even funnier now, because you can play with two geese (one of you can run interference while the other steals sandwiches). When people talk about funny video games, they often mention Monkey Island or Sam and Max \u2013 games with quippy writing and witty characters, wordplay, and self-referential puzzle design. But those games have only rarely made me laugh; an appreciative smile, sure, but never an involuntary hoot of amusement like those Untitled Goose Game embarrassingly elicits. Perhaps my comedy tastes lean more slapstick, but it\u2019s always the games with dumb physics or amusing controls or absurd set-ups that crack me up \u2013 games where the experience of play itself is what\u2019s funny. Octodad is a game I recommend to everyone, because it\u2019s one of only a few that have reduced me to a helpless, breathless puddle of mirth. It\u2019s about an octopus trying to masquerade as a human father, and you have to stuff yourself into a suit and use your wibbly tentacles to try and do normal things like navigate the supermarket with your kids, sending groceries flying everywhere. I ended up crying with laughter, forced to pass the pad over to my equally helpless friend until I regained enough composure to try again. Often it is the presence of other people that tips a game from amusing to hilarious. The Nintendo series WarioWare barrages you with 10-second mini-games, and the element of the unexpected makes it extremely funny \u2013 one second you\u2019re plucking someone\u2019s nose hair, the next you\u2019re trying to get two fish to smooch. But I was taken by surprise when I played the Switch version with friends in multiplayer mode and we were all swiftly incapacitated by uncontrollable laughter. The beloved multiplayer game Overcooked has the same effect: your own incompetence, and that of your fellow players, amps up the amusement. Comedy often results from the unexpected interplay between yourself and a game. For all its other strengths, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is also a work of comic genius, because it gives you all the tools you could possibly need to entertainingly humiliate yourself. The first time I played it at Nintendo\u2019s Frankfurt headquarters a few months ago, I spent 15 minutes painstakingly constructing a flamethrowing car and then immediately set it (and myself) on fire as soon as I started to drive it, which made both me and my poor demonstrator instantly collapse in giggles. \u201cThe comedic timing in this game is unmatched. Every clip I see is like Wile E Coyote Simulator 2023,\u201d observed the Verge\u2019s Tristan Cooper, commenting on a clip of someone accidentally smashing their own wagon\u2019s chassis instead of turning on the fan to power it, its four wheels tumbling sadly one by one to the ground. I\u2019m not one for torturing Koroks intentionally, but I did once accidentally send one yeeting off a mountain by attaching it to a rocket-powered sled and giving it a good whack. Link fell off immediately, but the Korok went soaring into the distance and then off a cliff with a forlorn \u201coof\u201d. The guilt only slightly tempered my amusement. All this is to say that. despite the exquisite brain-pleasing comic writing of something like Portal, or the clever self-referential humour of stick-man western comedy West of Loathing, or indeed the surreal postmodern gags of Jazzpunk, I have probably laughed more at the parping noises of Trombone Champ. Maybe I am simple. What to play Despite a lifelong affection for Japanese games, Final Fantasy remains one of my embarrassing blind spots \u2013 I have only ever played the boyband road trip adventure that was XV, when I was massively pregnant and wanted to do nothing but eat ice cream and play video games on the couch. I can\u2019t say too much here for fear of breaching embargo agreements, but Final Fantasy XVI is out this week, and veers into more Game of Thrones-style semi-realistic fantasy. If you\u2019re a devotee of the series you\u2019ll already have made up your mind, but if you\u2019re wavering, you\u2019ll be pleased to know that our reviewer doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a stinker.

Why it\u2019s worth rediscovering the joy of joysticks Cormac McCarthy gave post-apocalyptic video games their flavour Question Block This week\u2019s question comes from reader Emma: \u201cHow can I tell which genre a game is? What\u2019s the difference between a first-person shooter and a first-person RPG? What about roguelikes, roguelites and soulslikes?\u201d Gamers love to argue over genres. We also love coming up with absolutely terrible names for them. (Metroidvania, anyone?) Loads of first-person games have guns in them, but are not first-person shooters. Soulslike is bad enough \u2013 I would call \u2019em try-and-dies \u2013 but the very worst game genre term, in my opinion, is immersive sims. This refers to games such as Deus Ex and Dishonored, where you inhabit a character and have the freedom to approach the game however you like \u2013 but to me it sounds as if it ought to apply to a cockpit flight simulator. Anyway! It\u2019s often hard to tell what genre a game is from a trailer, and sometimes even if you\u2019re told what it is, it doesn\u2019t make much sense. (I still, if pressed, couldn\u2019t tell you definitively what the difference is between a roguelike and a roguelite.) My advice is: a) don\u2019t worry about it too much; b) to check a game\u2019s Steam page to see what genre the developer thinks it is; and c) read this guide that Keith wrote to esoteric genre classifications, from looter-shooter to masocore.

Videos of chefs making stir-fried rocks are the latest trend on Chinese social media. Some show chefs frying up pebbles with garlic and chilli at busy night markets, while others depict bucolic scenes of villagers cooking freshly fished stones on a riverbank. However it is made, the dish, known as suodiu (suck and discard) is having a resurgence, at least in videos of people pranking unsuspecting friends. While some online chefs insist that it\u2019s a delicious dish, other videos show unsuspecting diners spitting out the stones in horror. One video with nearly 800,000 views shows a chef offering up a portion of suodiu for 16 yuan (\u00a31.74), which some said was expensive considering that the ingredients can be reused. The dish is said to date back hundreds of years, when boatmen in the landlocked province of Hubei would run out of animals and vegetables while travelling along the Yangtze River, and so turned to minerals. Unsurprisingly, according to one history of the dish, it faded in popularity after economic development and motorised vessels came to Hubei, reducing the chances of boatmen being stranded without supplies. The dish is also linked to the Tujia people, an ethnic minority who originate from the Wuling mountain range that straddles the borders of Hubei, Hunan and Guizhou. According to one food blog, the river stones have a naturally fishy taste that is enhanced when fried at a high heat. But whatever their culinary appeal, many people are not convinced. Some people have flagged the choking risks. Another commenter predicts that the next food trend will be an ingredient that\u2019s easier to swallow: mud.

Biden calls Chinese president Xi a \u2018dictator\u2019 a day after Blinken visit aimed at easing tensions The US president, Joe Biden, has called the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, a dictator and said Xi was very embarrassed when a Chinese balloon was blown off course over the US earlier this year. Biden made the remarks one day after the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, met Xi on a trip to China that was aimed at easing tensions between the two countries. \u201cThe reason why Xi Jinping got very upset in terms of when I shot that balloon down with two box cars full of spy equipment in it was he didn\u2019t know it was there,\u201d Biden said at a fundraiser in California yesterday. \u201cThat\u2019s a great embarrassment for dictators. When they didn\u2019t know what happened. That wasn\u2019t supposed to be going where it was. It was blown off course,\u201d Biden added. A suspected Chinese spy balloon flew over US airspace in February. That incident and exchanges of visits by US and Taiwanese officials have recently magnified US-China tensions. What has been agreed between the two countries? Blinken and Xi agreed in their Monday meeting to stabilize the intense rivalry between Washington and Beijing so it did not veer into conflict but failed to produce any breakthrough during a rare visit to China by the secretary of state. They did agree to continue diplomatic engagement with more visits by US officials in the coming weeks and months. Biden said later on Tuesday that the US climate envoy, John Kerry, may go to China soon. Drones intercepted en route to Moscow, Russia says Two drones have been intercepted on their approach to military warehouses in the Moscow region, Andrei Vorobyov, the governor of the area, has said. \u201cDebris was found, no damage or casualties,\u201d Vorobyov said, adding that the drones fell near the village of Kalininets. Russia\u2019s channels on the Telegram messaging app, including one with links to the security services, said at least one more drone was intercepted near the village of Lukino. The country\u2019s Tass news agency has reported, citing unnamed law enforcement sources, that another drone was shot down near Lukino village in Moscow region, according to Reuters. Reuters could not independently verify the reports. It was not immediately known who launched the drones. In May, drones struck wealthy districts of Moscow, in what Russia said was a Ukrainian attack and one politician called the most dangerous attack on the capital since the second world war. What has Ukraine said about the drone attacks? Ukraine almost never publicly claims responsibility for attacks inside Russia or on Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine. What else is happening? The UK has backed $3bn of World Bank loan guarantees to shore up Ukraine\u2019s economic stability, the government announced today. The government is calling the support \u201cthe first bilateral package of multi-year fiscal assistance to be set out by a G7 country\u201d.

Stat of the day: gas stoves emit benzene levels 10 to 25 times higher than that from electric coil stoves, US study finds Using a gas stove can raise indoor concentrations of benzene, a cancer-linked chemical, to above what is found in secondhand smoking or even beyond levels found next to oil and gas facilities, a study has found. The research, which measured benzene levels in 87 homes in California and Colorado, found that gas and propane stoves frequently emitted benzene at rates well above healthy benchmarks set by the World Health Organization and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Leaving a single gas hob on for 45 minutes raised benzene levels to above that found in secondhand tobacco smoking, or at the boundary of oil and gas plants, with emissions 10 to 25 times higher than those from electric coil stoves. Don\u2019t miss this: how I found joy in life without children of my own Some people know they do not want to have children, writes Lucy Handley, but I always did. During my 30s, I was ashamed not to have met someone I wanted to have a family with and felt embarrassed when colleagues asked if I had kids. For a long time, I carried this feeling of shame around with me like a ball and chain. When the UK, where I live, went into lockdown in March 2020, that hope was fading. I sought help from David Edmonds, a life coach who encouraged me to ask myself different questions from those I was stuck on. The first one he suggested was deceivingly simple: \u201cHow might I have a great life beyond having kids?\u201d At first I resisted, because asking this meant accepting that it might not happen. But eventually, I started to engage: who would I be if I didn\u2019t become a mother, and how could I feel fulfilled? The future finally held some possibilities, and slowly I decided to start opening up to them. Climate check: groundbreaking youth-led climate trial comes to an end in Montana A groundbreaking climate trial came to an early close yesterday as lawyers on each side presented a very different picture of who could be held responsible for the climate crisis. Attorneys representing the lawsuit\u2019s young challengers said Montana officials and agencies must be held accountable for exacerbating the crisis, and thereby violating the plaintiffs\u2019 state constitutional rights. But the defense argued that the climate crisis was a global problem, and that if Montana was contributing to it, plaintiffs should work to change that through the legislature. The trial for Held v Montana began in the state\u2019s first judicial district court in the capital city of Helena last week, marking the first constitutional climate trial in US history. A ruling will now follow from Judge Kathy Seeley, who has been hearing the case, expected in the next few weeks. Sign up First Thing is delivered to thousands of inboxes every weekday.

As might be expected for a musician, producer and entrepreneur with more than 14 million followers on Instagram, the A-list count in the audience was high. Guests included Jay-Z and Beyonc\u00e9, Rihanna and her partner, A$AP Rocky, Zendaya, Lewis Hamilton, Kelly Rowland, Tyler, the Creator and Kim Kardashian. Some stayed after the show for the performance by Jay-Z. Williams joined him on stage for the 2003 song Frontin\u2019. Williams was announced as creative director of Louis Vuitton menswear in February. It was a surprise to the industry after the British designers Grace Wales Bonner and Martine Rose had been tipped to take the role. Tuesday\u2019s show, however, explained why Williams works. This went beyond a fashion show \u2013 it was a celebrity showcase, a gig and a party, with clothes thrown in for good measure. \u201cIt\u2019s the convergence between entertainment and fashion, and mass appeal and luxury,\u201d says Osman Ahmed, the fashion features director at i-D magazine, who was at the show. \u201cI think it is going to be one of those moments when we look back and [see it] as a turning point.\u201d The catwalk show was a mixture of maximalist logo-fuelled design \u2013 a full-length faux fur coat with LV logos or a football-style shirt with Louis Vuitton crest \u2013 smart tailoring and lots of bags. A high point \u2013 and possibly a first for fashion \u2013 was a Jeep convertible driven down the catwalk stacked with luggage. The \u201cLV is for Lovers\u201d slogan referred to Williams\u2019s home state Virginia and its tagline \u201cVirginia is for lovers\u201d. The creative director took a bow wearing a suit in a pixelated camouflage print, which matched that worn by his four children in the front row. Williams\u2019 appointment \u2013 over a trained designer \u2013 has been a talking point since it was announced. But, says Chris Black, the co-host of the style and pop culture podcast How Long Gone, Williams has cultural capital. \u201cIn today\u2019s age, the creative director job is more about vibe and vision,\u201d he says. \u201cI hate to say it, but I think that the product is almost the least important, or it\u2019s at least the third or fourth most important [thing].\u201d Crucially, Williams has experience working with fashion brands. He has collaborated with Adidas since 2014, his own brand Billionaire Boys Club began in 2005, and Humanrace, a skincare brand, was launched in 2020. He has previously worked with Louis Vuitton. In 2008, he collaborated with the then-creative director Marc Jacobs on a pair of bestselling sunglasses called Millionaires. The appointment follows the death of the previous creative director, , in 2021. Abloh, a friend of Williams, showed a new interpretation of luxury, drawing on references including pop culture, hip-hop and anti-racist activism. Williams has said he will continue his predecessor\u2019s work, bringing Black experience to a house with its roots in what has traditionally been a very white elite. The release of the first ad campaign \u2013 starring a pregnant Rihanna \u2013 was part of that. Speaking to the New York Times, he said \u201cWhat I love about this is, it\u2019s the biggest fashion house in the world, and that is a Black woman with child.\u201d The fact that Rihanna and A$AP Rocky, along with a host of Black American stars, also attended his debut show demonstrated Williams\u2019s clout, and the influence that Black culture has on the world. Writing in the New York Times, Jon Caramanica speculated that Williams at Louis Vuitton could be \u201ca full-throated acknowledgment of the power of Black cultural capital on a global stage\u201d. \u201cThis was not just a catwalk show,\u201d agrees Ahmed. \u201cIt was the entire centre of Paris closing for a fashion show. It was Beyonc\u00e9 in the middle of a world tour showing up, Rihanna and A$AP Rocky arriving halfway through. \u201cIt\u2019s surreal, because you realise how much power is involved in that. Cultural power, financial power, fashion power, artistic power. I think that we\u2019re going to see aftershocks in the industry for years to come.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db534", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/21/pwc-tax-scandal-firm-engaged-in-a-calculated-breach-of-trust-senate-committee-finds", "primaryCategory": "business", "subCategories": "test", "title": "PwC tax scandal: firm engaged in a \u2018calculated\u2019 breach of trust, Senate committee finds", "lead": "Consulting firm used confidential government information to help private clients avoid tax, interim report tabled in parliament finds", "author": "Paul Karp Chief political correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 10:06:23", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.989773", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/fb7e44b509deb828d230cd782013695730825cbe/0_105_5987_3594/500.jpg", "body": "Consulting firm PwC engaged in a \u201ccalculated\u201d breach of trust by using confidential information to help its clients avoid tax and engaged in a \u201cdeliberate cover-up\u201d over many years, a Senate committee has found. PwC should be \u201copen and honest\u201d by promptly publishing the names and details of its partners and staff involved, the finance and public administration committee has recommended. In a unanimous report, tabled on Wednesday, the committee also recommended that PwC cooperate with investigations by the Australian federal police and Tax Practitioner Board, which deregistered its former head of international tax, Peter Collins. The Greens will continue to push for harsher punishments, including calling on the Albanese government to cancel all PwC\u2019s contracts and for the cancellation of PwC\u2019s registration as a tax agent for two years. The committee chair, Liberal senator Richard Colbeck, told the Senate PwC had engaged in an \u201cegregious\u201d breach of trust after Collins \u201cwas given the privilege of being part of a consultation process on new legislation being proposed to deal with multinational tax avoidance\u201d. The report found that Collins \u201cintentionally shared confidential information obtained through Treasury consultations with PwC partners and personnel in Australia and overseas\u201d, seeking to assist clients avoid new tax laws and putting at risk $180m of revenue.

The report found that the Tax Agent Services Act required PwC to report Collins\u2019 breach of confidentiality to the Tax Practitioner Board. \u201cHowever, PwC chose not to do so, in breach of its legal obligations.\u201d \u201cTaken together, the committee concludes that PwC engaged in a deliberate strategy over many years to cover up the breach of confidentiality and the plan by PwC personnel to monetise it.\u201d The report noted so far PwC has stood down nine unnamed partners, and has publicly named four former partners as having received confidential information: Peter Collins, Michael Bersten, Neil Fuller and Paul McNab. The report said PwC had given the committee a list of 63 names of staff without \u201cany indication of the extent to which each of the 63 named individuals were involved in the breach of confidentiality and the plan to monetise that information\u201d. However, the committee decided not to reveal these names to avoid creating a \u201cpool of evidence inadmissible in court by dint of it being covered by parliamentary privilege\u201d, and out of \u201cprocedural fairness in relation to naming everyone who appears on an email distribution list\u201d although they may not have been involved. The Labor senator Deborah O\u2019Neill told the Senate that prior to the report she had received reports from whistleblowers in PwC \u201cfrightened to speak up because they\u2019re being intimidated\u201d. The Greens senator Barbara Pocock said PwC \u201cmust move beyond a simple \u2018fall guy\u2019 strategy\u201d. \u201cIt is untenable for the government to keep doing business with an entity that conducts itself like this,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cThe Greens are calling on the government to cancel PwC\u2019s registration as a tax agent [for two years] and will be introducing an amendment to do exactly this. The government must also enact an immediate ban on contracts with PwC.\u201d Pocock said the evidence to the committee \u201cshows an internal culture at PwC so poor that it has lost the capacity to act honestly\u201d. \u201cThe evidence also creates a strong argument for breaking the link between political donations and big consultancies.\u201d PwC said in a statement: \u201cWe thank the Senate for its important work and we acknowledge today\u2019s interim report.

Conservatives accused Joe Biden of using the justice system to prosecute his main political rival and attempting to \u201csteal\u201d the 2024 election. Kevin McCarthy, the Republican speaker of the House of Representatives, promised to \u201chold this brazen weaponization of power accountable\u201d. In short, the right wants us to believe that Biden and his administration will stop at nothing to put Trump in jail as quickly as possible. In fact, the exact opposite is true. Worried about just this type of accusation, the justice department under Merrick Garland and the FBI have approached their investigations of Trump much too cautiously. Far from being persecuted because of who he is, Trump\u2019s status as a former president and as the unofficial leader of the Republican party have led to him being handled with vastly more deference than anyone else would be. The result has been a series of delays and missteps which may allow Trump to escape accountability once again. It is now nearly 18 months since the government first recovered classified material from Mar-a-Lago in early 2022. Although the justice department concluded shortly afterwards that Trump likely possessed further sensitive material, it took seven months for Mar-a-Lago to be searched, in part because the FBI feared that the move would open the agency to accusations of partisanship. Trump was then only indicted nearly a year later. After his initial arraignment he remains a free man, released without having to post bail \u2013 despite credible concerns he may still have additional classified material in his possession. Compare that timeline to the events surrounding the arrest of intelligence contractor Reality Winner, who in 2017 received a five-year prison sentence for leaking one document to the news website the Intercept. The document Winner leaked was written on 5 May 2017 and she was arrested on 3 June, days before the Intercept even had a chance to publish its article about her leak. She was indicted on 8 June and jailed pending her trial. Winner later pleaded guilty to violating the Espionage Act \u2013 precisely the law that it seemed clear Trump had flouted for over a year before he was indicted. Trump has likewise been slow to face consequences in the federal investigation into his actions leading up to the insurrection at the US Capitol. According to a new report by the Washington Post, the justice department and FBI delayed launching a probe into Trump\u2019s push to overturn the 2020 election for 15 months, again because of fears that they would be criticized for partisanship. The agencies instead pursued cases against rank-and-file insurrectionists, ignoring the existence of evidence implicating Trump and his inner circle until media and political pressure forced them to begin taking it seriously. These delays matter because they make it possible \u2013 even likely \u2013 that Trump will never truly face accountability for his actions. Trump\u2019s trial in the documents case is unlikely to be held before the 2024 presidential election and the same is true for any possible charges in the January 6 case. If Trump wins the election and becomes president again \u2013 as current polls suggest he will \u2013 then he will have multiple tools at his disposal to derail the trials or even pardon himself. Justice delayed will be justice denied. Efforts by the justice department and other agencies to appear non-partisan have been well-intended but outdated. The modern conservative movement will give the Biden administration and the law enforcement agencies little credit for proceeding so slowly and deliberately. Instead, the justice system\u2019s extreme deference to conservative complaints will only encourage the Maga movement to double down. If federal law enforcement can be so easily scared away from enforcing the law without fear or favor, we can expect more hysteria and finger-pointing \u2013 even threats of violence \u2013 to follow in the future. These events also set a catastrophic precedent. The sitting president\u2019s immunity from prosecution and the political barriers to impeachment leave criminal proceedings after a president leaves office as the last available means of imposing accountability. If law enforcement agencies are too scared to investigate prominent politicians promptly and effectively, even that opportunity will vanish and presidents will be left with virtually no checks on their behavior. But worst of all is the fact that if Trump gets off the hook and re-enters office, the independence and integrity of the justice department and FBI are likely to be destroyed anyway. He has made it clear that he would seek to weaponize law enforcement agencies against his political opponents, including by forcing the justice department to follow his personal and political vendettas. Trump himself represents a unique threat to the rule of law and the independence of American law enforcement, one which must be confronted with appropriate but aggressive tools. Sadly, thanks to years of misplaced appeasement, it might already be too late. Andrew Gawthorpe is a historian of the United States at Leiden University.

But Rancid have always been about more than simply making noise for noise\u2019s sake. Many of their songs are mid-paced tunes that you can dance and swagger to, while the likes of Time Bomb and Tenderloin have legitimate pop prowess: even people who have never heard them before will have those choruses memorised by the end. As a result, what tonight lacks in sonic muscle is more than compensated for by arena-wide enthusiasm.

In an appearance on Fox, the television and radio host Sean Hannity gave his viewers a similar warning: \u201cThis would be a direct hit politically on conservative talk radio in particular, which is what most people go to AM radio to listen to.\u201d Mark Levin, another longtime radio host, agreed: \u201cThey finally figured out how to attack conservative talk radio,\u201d he told his listeners in April. What are they all so worried about? It turns out, a minor manufacturing change announced by car companies including Volkswagen and Mazda: they will be removing AM radios from their forthcoming fleets of electric vehicles, citing technical issues. Tesla, BMW, Audi, and Volvo have already dispensed with AM in their electric cars, because AM\u2019s already unpolished reception is subject to even more buzz, crackling, and interference when installed near an electric motor. While some manufacturers have found workarounds for the interference, others appear to have decided that it\u2019s not worth the engineering expense. Many on the right have been quick to declare the move political sabotage. The Texas senator Ted Cruz, while promoting a federal bill that would require automakers to install AM radios in new cars, claimed he smelled something fishy: \u201cThere\u2019s a reason big car companies were open to taking down AM radio \u2026 let\u2019s be clear: big business doesn\u2019t like things that are overwhelmingly conservative.\u201d AM is the oldest commercial radio technology in the US. In the 1920s, when AM was all there was, listeners would gather around neighborhood and living room radio sets to hear everything from music to boxing matches, soap operas, and presidential speeches. They would listen through AM\u2019s constant (if now somewhat nostalgic) hum. By mid-century, music was king on the radio as many dramatic programs shifted over to the new medium of television. And in the 1960s, the comparatively crystal clear FM band overtook AM as the band of choice. Many music stations deserted AM, leaving it floundering in lo-fi isolation and struggling to secure advertising dollars, until it found its salvation in talk radio. Initially there was a wide variety of political perspectives on AM but the deregulation of content and consolidation of ownership of radio during the 1980s edged many minority voices and local owners off the air. Following the model of the nationally syndicated Rush Limbaugh Show, conservative talk became the cost-effective default for the risk-averse corporations that now dominated the radio dial. The humble AM band played a starring role in the rise of social conservatism in the US and was a precursor to outlets like Fox News. These days, AM radio is somewhat synonymous in the public imagination with conservative blowhards, a place where false claims about the 2020 election, racist notions of a \u201cgreat replacement\u201d and other conspiracy theories fester and escape into the atmosphere without accountability. Far-right programming is not only ubiquitous, it\u2019s monotonous \u2013 with a few national radio chains syndicating the same handful of shows to \u201clocal\u201d stations, many of which have almost no local content. In cities and towns across the country, listeners hear much of the same one-sided, syndicated programming. But the idea that AM radio is made up of nothing more than conservative talk is a myth that has dangerous implications for the medium. It is true that conservatives and far-right pundits have claimed near dominion on talk radio \u2013 a medium that still ranks nearly neck-and-neck with social media for how Americans get their news. Seventeen of the top 20 most-listened-to US talk radio hosts are conservative, while only one is liberal. But that\u2019s not the whole story: while syndicated rightwing voices are the best platformed on AM radio, what is less known is that the band is home to many of the country\u2019s increasingly rare local stations and non-English-language radio shows. And ownership of AM radio stations is more diverse than that of FM stations: according to a 2021 FCC report, 13% of commercial AM stations were majority-owned by a Black, Hispanic, or Asian American broadcaster; on the FM band, that figure was only 7%. Often lacking the financial and political resources available to chain-owned conservative talk stations, it is these local and diverse voices \u2013 not nationally syndicated conservative talkers like Sean Hannity and Mark Levin \u2013 that are likely to be the hardest hit by any changes to the band. \u201cAM is, generally, the least expensive route to a broadcast station ownership,\u201d says Jim Winston, president and CEO of the National Association of Black Owned Broadcasters (Nabob), a trade organization serving Black- and minority-owned radio stations. And though the 1980s and 1990s saw a decrease in local and minority ownership, Winston says a disproportionate number of the stations he works with today are on the AM dial. \u201cThere are many communities where the only Black-owned station is an AM station,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd Black owners, for the most part, are local owners.\u201d In cities across the country, AM stations remain a crucial resource for those who are rarely served by other media. Detroit\u2019s WNZK, known as the \u201cstation of nations\u201d, runs a variety of non-English and English language programming for the area\u2019s immigrant communities. In Chicago, WNVR broadcasts in Polish, and many AM stations in California and New York run talk and music programs in Vietnamese and Chinese. The time-tested technology of AM radio has also given the medium a particularly important role in small towns and rural areas. \u201cOut here, it does serve a very distinct purpose, because AM frequency travels very differently from FM,\u201d says Austin Roof, general manager at KSDP in Sandpoint, Alaska, on the Aleutian Islands. AM is better than FM at getting through mountains and other barriers. Plus, Roof says, \u201conce AM hits water, it just carries really well\u201d. For a radio station serving island residents and those who work on the area\u2019s fishing boats, that value can\u2019t be overstated. \u201cOne kilowatt of AM can outperform thousands of kilowatts of FM in our environment.\u201d Satellite internet has only recently become available in much of KSDP\u2019s coverage area, and the region\u2019s geography means that even the few local newspapers have limited distribution. So radio stations like KSDP \u2013 which serves an area nearly twice the size of Massachusetts \u2013 can be a lifeline. In recent years, as the islands have experienced some of their largest earthquakes and subsequent tsunamis, the radio has played a crucial role in spreading emergency alerts and instructions. (Between emergency updates after a 2021 earthquake, station staff played songs like AC/DC\u2019s You Shook Me All Night Long and the Surfaris\u2019 Wipeout.) \u201cYour cellphone can lose its charge,\u201d says Winston of Nabob, \u201cYou could be \u2026 out someplace where your cellphone signal is not being picked up.\u201d But radio, he says, is ubiquitous, and it\u2019s very important \u201cthat people be able to receive radio when they can\u2019t receive anything else\u201d. AM stations are not just of value during emergencies: in small towns and rural areas across the country, AM stations are a rare tool for civic engagement, especially with the decline in local newspapers. Roof says KSDP\u2019s most popular broadcasts are those that listeners can\u2019t find anywhere else: \u201cLocal, state news, local meetings, sports,\u201d he says, \u201cit\u2019s the hyper-local content that matters.\u201d The story is similar on the Yakama Reservation in Washington state, where the program director Reggie George says the local AM station KYNR broadcasts public service announcements and coverage of local events such as government meetings and powwows, in addition to a steady playlist of both oldies and Native American music. When a technical snag or bad weather temporarily silences the station, residents react. \u201cWe get calls right away when we go off the air,\u201d says George, one of two paid staff at KYNR. Many AM stations have tried to prepare for an uncertain future by meeting their listeners on other platforms, such as FM simulcasts, podcasts, and web streams. Alaska\u2019s KSDP has managed to get its content simulcast on one full-power and three low-power FM signals that serve nearby towns, and on a well-utilized online audio stream. But finding the money to stay afloat while supporting those other platforms hasn\u2019t been easy. \u201cWe\u2019ve begged, borrowed, and stolen for hardware,\u201d Roof says. Roof personally climbs the radio tower to replace equipment and touch up paint, has taken pay cuts, and has opted out of company healthcare to keep more money in the station. But other hyperlocal AM stations haven\u2019t had the budget to make the expansion. To some in the radio industry, the removal of AM radios from electric vehicles feels like a death sentence for their already struggling medium. Others are less worried. \u201cI think a lot of these places that are really benefiting from AM \u2026 are not where electric cars are really going to serve up the most benefits,\u201d says Roof. In his part of the country, there\u2019s no infrastructure to support EVs yet, and not many people can afford a Tesla or a BMW. \u201cIf you think someone in Sandpoint, Alaska, is getting an electric car any time in the near future, you\u2019re crazy,\u201d he says. \u201cIs getting rid of [AM radio] in electric vehicles going to do away with it? Absolutely not.\u201d There remains a lurking sense, however, that the removal of AM from EVs is a symptom of a larger shift away from the AM band. And if other changes come to pass, it will probably be the local, diverse stations \u2013 the unlauded heroes of AM \u2013 that are at greatest risk, not the well-resourced nationally syndicated conservative talk hosts who dominate talk radio. \u201cThose voices are not going to be shut down, no matter what happens with AM radio,\u201d says Winston. If AM radio does become harder to access, he says, \u201cthere are serious casualties.\u201d Katie Thornton is a freelance print and audio journalist.

The 2013 \u201c#RISE for the Ashes\u201d campaign featured Alastair Cook and Charlotte Edwards, admittedly on separate posters, with the same squiggly orange flames as the backdrop. The following summer, with Waitrose on board as the new \u00a33m sponsor of men\u2019s and women\u2019s Test cricket, a TV advert showed Stuart Broad, Jimmy Anderson and Katherine Brunt shopping in what purported to be their local supermarket, while Jonathan Agnew commentated on their choice of groceries. What did both campaigns have in common? Women\u2019s cricket was present, but only as an afterthought. Sky promoted the 2013 Women\u2019s Ashes using the tagline: \u201cOne Down, One to go: See if the women\u2019s team can secure our second Ashes victory of the summer.\u201d The Waitrose ad was an unmitigated disaster, with Anderson and Broad failing to acknowledge Brunt while Agnew\u2019s voiceover ignored her presence completely. For all the recognition she got, she might as well have been a random extra who had wandered in off the streets to do her shopping wearing an England shirt. Fortunately for the ECB, the advert was swiftly pulled from the airwaves because of controversy over Agnew\u2019s involvement. Ten years later, the marketing looks a little different. The award-winning \u201cAshes, Two Ashes\u201d campaign centres on a 30-second TV advert with split-screen images, flitting between footage and commentary from the women\u2019s and men\u2019s games, and concludes with the slogan: \u201cThe only thing better than an Ashes series? Two.\u201d Two weeks ago, images of the England captains \u2013 Heather Knight and Ben Stokes \u2013 were projected side by side on Tower Bridge. It\u2019s worlds away from Brunt playing Supermarket Sweep by herself and it\u2019s working. Almost 75,000 tickets have been sold for the Women\u2019s Ashes; the ODI at Taunton is sold out, 16,000 tickets have been sold for the Edgbaston T20I and another 13,000 for the five days of the Trent Bridge Test. It appears someone at the ECB has finally woken up and realised that if you want people to show up to watch the England Women\u2019s team play, it helps to act like they may be some people\u2019s first choice. \u201cIt\u2019s been a huge mindset shift internally,\u201d says Beth Barrett-Wild, director of the women\u2019s professional game at the ECB. \u201cIt\u2019s about demonstrating the value we are placing on these fixtures, recognising that we think people would want to come and shifting perceptions about England Women\u2019s cricket in the process.\u201d The ECB\u2019s planning for the dual-Ashes summer, she says, started early, with a meeting in March 2022. \u201cIt was after the first season of the Hundred. There had been this swell of engagement and we all said the same: \u20182023 is our big year.\u2019 It was a case of sitting down and going: \u2018How do we make the most of this?\u2019\u201d \u201cHistorically, England Women\u2019s internationals haven\u2019t been at the top of the list of matches we\u2019ve scheduled and it\u2019s usually been left fairly late. Doing it early and alongside the men was a very conscious decision, to make sure that this Ashes summer was very much seen as a men\u2019s and women\u2019s Ashes season combined.\u201d The result of that early conversation was twofold: for the first time, the dates and venues for the 2023 women\u2019s and men\u2019s fixtures were announced concurrently (in September 2022). Meanwhile, the venues and schedule for the Women\u2019s Ashes reflected a new ambition for women\u2019s cricket \u2013 evening matches at Lord\u2019s, the Oval, and Edgbaston, a Sunday ODI at the Rose Bowl and a five-day Test at Trent Bridge. \u201cThe key part was starting with the fan,\u201d Barrett-Wild says. \u201cI was looking back at the 2019 women\u2019s Ashes schedule and we started on a Tuesday with an ODI at Leicester, followed by another ODI at Leicester on the Thursday. That is not a fan-centric schedule. With all the marketing in the world, that\u2019s never going to generate massive attendances. It\u2019s recognising how much the women\u2019s game has shifted since that moment and making sure we\u2019re doing a proper service to it this summer.\u201d Barrett-Wild doesn\u2019t say so, but it is clear she\u2019s been one of the driving forces behind this culture shift at the ECB. Since October 2018, she has headed up the women\u2019s Hundred, which she says \u201cblew the lid off everything that we thought about where the women\u2019s game was\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve always known women\u2019s cricket has got this potential, if you just invest in it then it will work, but this is a massive proof of concept. It shows people will watch women\u2019s cricket if you present it at scale, market it and give it that visibility. It would have taken many, many years to get to that stage if we\u2019d carried on as we were.\u201d Barrett-Wild is ensuring the ideas she and her team incubated in the Hundred \u2013 equal marketing budgets; playing women\u2019s matches at the biggest grounds \u2013 permeate out into the rest of the ECB. Last week, the ECB released the major match venues for 2025-31: England Women will play at Lord\u2019s in each of the seven years during this period, with the Oval, Edgbaston, Headingley, Old Trafford, Trent Bridge and the Rose Bowl hosting the team at least four times. \u201cWe\u2019ve invested heavily into the professionalisation of the women\u2019s game on the field. Now it\u2019s a case of: \u2018Right, we need to catch up in terms of what we are doing to support this team off the field,\u2019\u201d she says. Are there concerns this may be a one-off, given the scale and visibility of the Ashes compared with other women\u2019s bilateral series? \u201cOur objective is to create a blueprint which will enable exponential growth in attendances in future years. Sales for the Sri Lanka series [in September] aren\u2019t as high as the Ashes sales but they are significantly up on where they normally would be.\u201d As someone who understands the recent growth of women\u2019s sport \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t want cricket to be left behind, I\u2019m a very competitive person\u201d \u2013 Barrett-Wild already has her sights firmly set on 2026 when England host the Women\u2019s T20 World Cup. \u201cThat will be our Women\u2019s Euros moment,\u201d she says. Before then, though, there\u2019s an Ashes series to focus on, one that will be enjoyed live by a record number of fans. and follow the instructions. \u2022 This is an extract from the Guardian\u2019s weekly cricket email, The Spin.

You may notice that the election is still 17 months away. This was the earliest endorsement in the AFL-CIO\u2019s history, amounting to an all-in bet by organized labor that the interests of the Democratic president are identical to its own. The problem with this is not so much that labor might have decided to endorse a Republican \u2013 whoever that party\u2019s candidate is, they are sure to despise the concept of working-class empowerment \u2013 but rather the fact that the endorsement is an implicit acceptance of the status quo. These union leaders believe that the Biden White House as currently constituted is the best they can hope to get. Indeed, they are overjoyed by what they have gotten already. It is this lack of ambition that is the labor movement\u2019s biggest flaw. They have been beaten down for so long that they have lost their ability to believe that the world they deserve will ever be real. This is a sort of trauma, induced by a decades-long decline in union power. By settling for what they have, unfortunately, they have forsaken their leverage to ask for more. At his speech accepting the endorsement, Biden declared himself \u201cthe most pro-union president in American history\u201d. That may be a bit much \u2013 a few generations ago, even Republican presidents supported unions, so the standards were much higher \u2013 but it is certainly true that Biden is the most pro-union president of the past half century. He signed a $36bn bill to save union pensions; his Covid relief and infrastructure bills were boons to union workers; his nominee for NLRB general counsel has been tirelessly pushing invaluable labor law reforms; and he has, to a degree not seen before in my lifetime, used his bully pulpit to speak out in favor of union drives, in ways that Clinton or Obama never would have. The AFL-CIO feels that its voice is being listened to in the White House more than they can ever recall. On the other hand, the single biggest labor issue of Biden\u2019s first term was the potential national rail strike, which he dealt with by crushing the workers\u2019 right to strike and imposing a contract on them that they didn\u2019t want. But hey, what\u2019s the occasional knife in the back between friends? Seventy-one percent of Americans say they approve of labor unions. Only 40% of Americans say they approve of Joe Biden. Unions are more popular than the president, by a long mile. In fact, the popularity of organized labor is at a 60-year high. This is due not to the AFL-CIO, nor to the White House, but to a realization that swept working people across the nation as the Covid pandemic paralyzed society: your job does not care if you live or die. Your boss will not save you from disaster. There is no safety net, except for unions. That\u2019s it. The wave of interest in labor organizing that has swept through coffee shops, warehouses and college campuses is fueled by a widening, bone-deep understanding that solidarity is the only shield against capitalism\u2019s scorching rays. I can attest, from years spent traveling America as a labor reporter, that this grassroots enthusiasm is real. It is the job of the labor movement\u2019s institutions to turn that enthusiasm into the maximum possible gain. That\u2019s where the malfunction is. We have an army ready to fight the class war led by generals who have been trained to assume that it is unwinnable. Unions do not have to endorse the Biden agenda. Unions can set the agenda. Now is not the time to settle. Now is the time to demand. The labor market is strong, the appetite for unions is high and the discontent with inequality is everywhere. This is a time to push the president, not bow and scrape and thank him for what he has done. Working people are begging to become a part of a strong labor movement. If the AFL-CIO and its unions could find within themselves the ambition to take advantage of current conditions to organize 10 or 20 million new union members, they could quite literally reverse the post-Reagan inequality crisis. Labor\u2019s early endorsement of Biden is meant to enable unions to start mobilizing their political operation now \u2013 but that mobilization is also their leverage. They could demand that Biden commit to federal funding for union organizing and to abolishing the filibuster so that the labor law reforms of the PRO Act might actually have a chance to pass, rather than just serving as a campaign slogan. In short, they could make the building of the labor movement itself their central political demand. Biden will be out of power in a few years, but a labor movement with 10 million new union members would transform the entire American political landscape for decades to come. Instead of taking this tack, the AFL-CIO has committed to organize only a paltry 100,000 new union members a year (which would ensure the continuing decline of union density) and handed its support to Biden in exchange for the gifts he has already given. It is not a strategy that will ever be mistaken for a master class in boldly seizing the initiative. History\u2019s greatest labor leaders have not been conservative pragmatists in search of marginal gain. They have been people whose outrage over the injustices of the present fueled them to accomplish things that others dismissed as unrealistic. Too much time spent inside of existing institutions seems to extinguish this spirit. The next generation of working-class heroes is out in the world right now \u2013 working. It will be up to them to force the labor movement to thrive in spite of itself, long after the \u201cmost pro-union president in history\u201d is gone.

Americans have $1.635tn in federal student loan debt, held by 43.8 million borrowers. Some 26 million people applied or were automatically accepted for student debt relief under Biden\u2019s plan before applications were suspended because of lawsuits launched by Republicans. That plan would provide student debt relief of up to $20,000 for eligible borrowers and up to $10,000 for borrowers with less than $125,000 in annual individual income. But Republicans pushed to prevent any further extensions of student loan payments and want to overturn Biden\u2019s plan that has now been tied up in the US courts since last year, with a US supreme court ruling on the issue expected very soon. Michael Chaney, a 56-year-old truck driver in Ohio, has student debt from a retraining program through the Ohio Bureau of Vocational Rehabilitation that he went into after getting injured on the job while working in a foundry in the late 1990s. \u201cI had to take out student loans to help pay for the schooling, or else they wouldn\u2019t help me,\u201d said Chaney. He said his student debt increased due to having to repeat some math classes. Even after Chaney filed for bankruptcy in 2009 after getting divorced, his student debt wasn\u2019t able to be discharged. He worked in IT after finishing schooling but switched to truck driving to be able to work more hours. \u201cThere\u2019s no way I can pay it. They\u2019ve got it set up so you can never pay it off,\u201d said Chaney, who still owes around $60,000 in student loans. \u201cI keep making $400 or $500 a month payments and none of the principal goes down. I worked all my life and I don\u2019t have nothing. I\u2019ve worked six days a week, 12-hour days in the steel mill before I got hurt. We\u2019re barely staying alive. I can\u2019t keep up. I can\u2019t pay it.\u201d The debt ceiling package negotiated between Biden and House majority speaker Kevin McCarthy and signed into law in June 2023 ends the pause on federal student loan payments and interest. A spokesperson for the US Department of Education told the Guardian the department will be in contact with borrowers before repayments begin. Interest accrual on student debt is set to begin occurring again in September 2023 and the first payments are due in early October. For millions of Americans, restarting payments or even being able to keep up with payments, won\u2019t be financially possible. \u201cAdding another expense to my budget would put me beyond a financial hardship,\u201d said Anne Marie Mosley, a teacher in Massachusetts who is still waiting to see if her public loan service forgiveness application is approved. \u201cWhen payments restart, I will not pay. I\u2019m an underpaid teacher and I just won\u2019t have the funds,\u201d said Jacque Abron of Texas. Janelle Gallardo, a mother of three in California, started paying her student loans in 2016 when she completed her master\u2019s degree, with payments ranging from $200 to $500 a month. Under the student loan payment pause, she\u2019s struggled to keep up with the rising cost of living and currently works two jobs to make ends meet. \u201cI went from paying about $1,000 a month to now over $2,000 in groceries, I cannot even imagine paying another large bill like this,\u201d said Gallardo. \u201cI don\u2019t even know how we would make it work with resuming payments based on how much everything has gone up in my state. I have not been paying during the pause because all our money either goes to bills or taxes, we haven\u2019t even been able to afford health insurance right now.\u201d But Republicans have also pushed to add retroactive interest to student loans that did not accrue during the pause and revoke forgiven debt for over 250,000 borrowers who applied and were approved for public service loan forgiveness. Christina Winston of Phoenix, Arizona, has struggled with paying her student loans since graduating with her bachelor\u2019s degree and completing her master\u2019s degree program. She has filed for public service loan forgiveness, after having to obtain years of her bank statements because her loan service provider did not have records to prove she made the required 10 years of payments to be eligible. She explained student debt has affected her considerably over the years and despite keeping up with payments, through loan service providers changing rules and ballooning interest, she still owes more than she originally borrowed. \u201cI\u2019ve been paying student loans for over 30 years. I\u2019m a first generation graduate, first in my family and maybe the last one. I have a 17-year-old and an 11-year-old. Neither of them will be able to attend school, I can\u2019t afford to pay for it, I\u2019m too busy trying to work, pay the bills, and pay these loans,\u201d said Winston. She added: \u201cOnce loans restart with interest starting again, the artificially high balance bill will have interest added again, causing a huge crisis.\u201d Debt relief advocates have pushed for broader student loan forgiveness and to expand borrower rights, such as making it easier to discharge student debt through bankruptcies. The NAACP has pushed for a minimum of $50,000 in student loan forgiveness and has warned about the negative impacts starting student loan repayments will have without any forgiveness plan enacted. A recent report by the Jain Family Institute found the student debt pause benefitted borrowers who were already going to pay their student loans back, while structural problems with student debt have created a system where the majority of borrowers have not and cannot pay back their student debt. Jim Mazey, 54, who lives in Ohio, said he\u2019s paid over $27,000 on an original student debt of $44,00, but over $18,000 of that went toward interest and he currently has 140 more monthly payments left. He obtained a bachelor\u2019s degree and certification to work as a purchasing manager, where he has worked for 29 years. When the pause ends, he fears being stuck with payments into retirement or the debt delaying his ability to retire. \u201cI will be 65 years of age before the loan is paid,\u201d said Mazey. \u201cLike most people we have, and always will be, living paycheck to paycheck.\u201d Even before the pause on federal student loan payments, the majority of borrowers were not making any payments, with just over 50% of borrowers not making any payments toward direct and FFEL loans in late 2019, according to Department of Education data. More than 4 million borrowers were paying zero payments while enrolled in income driven repayment plans. Audrey Fiscus of Arizona has struggled with student debt since graduating nursing school in 2006 as a single mother, who divorced her ex-husband at the time and went back to school while he struggled with a drug addiction. \u201cI\u2019ve been paying my student loans monthly for over 10 years, ranging from $450 to $510 a month,\u201d she said. Despite making regular payments for ten years, her $35,000 in student debt has ballooned to $82,000 since 2006. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ll die with this debt,\u201d she added."}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db53c", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/21/caribbean-british-millennials-windrush-generation", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "subCategories": "test", "title": "A bit Caribbean, a bit British.

With their passing, I lost my direct links to the Windrush generation, and the unrecorded stories and family histories they carried with them. As we celebrate the 75th anniversary of the first arrivals from the Caribbean in 1948, I am conscious of the scale of potential loss as more of the pioneers of this generation reach the end of their lives, and the void that creates for descendants like me. Where does all this loss leave us? The generations that came after Windrush, those of us with a foot in both camps, born in Britain but brought up with fading memories of sun-drenched islands, half-told stories from our elders and a sense of dual identity hanging somewhere between the two. For my generation \u2013 millennials \u2013 our parents, now in their 50s and 60s, were born here, too, or brought over when they were very young. Many of them have never been back. And now their parents are dying. Without them, the ones who made the brave journey towards a promised better life, there is a sense of something becoming untethered. It\u2019s a link that we cannot afford to lose. For me, the most pertinent question is one of responsibility. Is it on us to ensure that the legacies of the Windrush generation endure and move forward? And how can we do this with authenticity and honesty, even as those direct connections to the past diminish? There are times when I feel this individual responsibility keenly. I worry about a lack of tangible knowledge to pass on to future generations. So, I have learned to cook Jamaican food, dug through my dad\u2019s record collection in search of clues, visited Jamaica for the first time in my 30s, and made contact with more distant relatives on that side of my family. I have found so much joy in these unearthed cultural connections and shared stories, but I still wonder if they are enough. This quest feels particularly challenging because of the deep fractures in my dad\u2019s family. It was never an option for me to sit at my grandmother\u2019s feet and ask her for stories of home while she braided my hair. My dad was put into the care system when he was just a baby, and his parents never brought him home. They existed only in the peripheries of his life, and subsequently had minimal involvement in the lives of their grandchildren. My grandparents were both in their 80s by the time they passed, and they were practically strangers to me. I have maybe two or three hazy memories of them. I only know their faces from photos. I am not alone in grappling with a disjointed family history. So many families of Caribbean descent have been splintered due to the deep, intergenerational impacts of the hostile environment that made life unduly difficult for the migrants who arrived in the 50s, and still affects the prospects and quality of life of their descendants. There was also the prevalence of children being left behind while their parents settled in the UK, the \u201cbarrel children\u201d who were sent for at a later date, or never sent for at all. And there is the ongoing Windrush scandal, which tore families apart with threats of deportation and the harrowing experiences of people being barred from returning home after a holiday abroad. Some were even deported to countries they had not visited since early childhood. While I relish the opportunity for celebration that comes with Windrush Day, it is not lost on me that the very people being celebrated are still suffering at the hands of the state. The British government has recently been accused of \u201cfailing its citizens\u201d due to the \u201cbelittling and horrible\u201d process of the Windrush compensation scheme, set up in 2018 by the Home Office. The scheme has been marred by delays and controversies \u2013 in June last year, three in four claimants were still waiting for compensation. With so much of our present and immediate history mired in unresolved hurt, and the fact that there has been precious little accountability, it can feel hard to look forward. There is still so much injustice to be reckoned with and rectified. Perhaps then, the responsibility to the Windrush generation and their legacy should be collective, rather than individual. It was a shock to me to realise that, despite there being approximately 2,500 museums in Britain, there is no permanent building base that exclusively presents the stories of Windrush pioneers or their descendants. This is a crucial place to start. Dr Les Johnson is the founder and chair of a campaign to build a National Windrush Museum, and his work \u2013 alongside the newly formed Next Gen development council \u2013 is pushing back against the historical erasure of Windrush from Britain\u2019s collective memory. The immense contributions of the Windrush generation \u2013 including my grandparents \u2013 have not only shaped the fabric of British society but will have a radical impact on Britain\u2019s future, with the legacies of their revolutionary spirit. It is crucial that these stories aren\u2019t lost. On an individual level, I feel it is my responsibility to create a life for myself and future generations that celebrates this spirit, embedding their histories into a new identity of Black Britishness. This feels like the most authentic way to keep these narratives from disappearing.

It\u2019s refreshing for a time when, according to a Pew Research study, 76% of US journalists are white. \u201cI think about that number all the time,\u201d Sur said. \u201cThose stats are so heart-wrenching and they\u2019re also why [the big publications] can\u2019t beat me. That kind of newsroom will never be able to tell the community\u2019s story as well as the Juggernaut can.\u201d Having grown up in the Bronx and Queens after immigrating with her parents to the US from India in 1990, Sur said she found no media outlets meant for south Asians of her generation. She rose through the stages of a supposedly traditionally successful life \u2013 first pursuing undergraduate studies at Yale, then two different consulting stints at McKinsey &amp; Company with an MBA at Harvard Business School thrown in between. The need for what the Juggernaut would become certainly was there all along. As she once told potential investors of the south Asian demographic: \u201cWe\u2019re half a trillion dollars in spending power in the US. We\u2019re 1.8 billion people in the world.\u201d A visitor to the Juggernaut today will find stories ranging from a look back at Steve Jobs\u2019s 1974 visit to India to badminton\u2019s history and comeback in the US. There\u2019s a review of season three of Indian Matchmaking and a profile of Gaurav Gupta \u2013 the favorite fashion designer of Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion who made his long-awaited debut at the Paris haute couture week in 2023. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be south Asian to write for the Juggernaut, but you have to be able to dive deep and be curious,\u201d Sur said. It took Sur a while to scare up the courage to quit her job and secure proper backing. She made the Juggernaut her full-time job in 2019. Today she employs four full-time employees and has plans to expand the staff later this year \u2013 including a much-needed full-time engineer and several staff writers. According to Sur, if she stopped ramping up staff and spending on marketing, she would find herself in the black. But cutting down on investment would curtail the growth she\u2019s seen. While unwilling to share overall numbers, Sur said the Juggernaut counts the likes of Padma Lakshmi, comedian Hari Kondabolu and actors Freida Pinto and Poorna Jagannathan as subscribers. Back in 2020, funds were running low \u2013 $50,000 in the bank low. At the start of Covid-19 outbreak, Sur readily admits that the US government\u2019s paycheck protection program and subscription revenue helped keep the lights on before she could secure $1.2m in funding from Precursor Ventures and a syndicate of angel investors in October 2020 that keeps the business chugging along. \u201cWe had these ambitions to do TikTok more,\u201d Sur said. \u201cWe had ambitions to do more podcasts. I think in 2021 we had ambitions to do way more regular events.\u201d Instead of splurging on the extras that might have driven her out of business, Sur refocused her attention to the stories. She wanted to see what drew readers in \u2013 and more important, what didn\u2019t. While things like book reviews were nice to include, they simply didn\u2019t have the pull that true crime did. They had to go. The Juggernaut wasn\u2019t a vanity project. This was Sur\u2019s business. And it needed to deliver the content people wanted if it was going to work. \u201cI was like, pardon my French, \u2018Fuck this,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna just go back to the core business. Yeah, we\u2019re gonna do less, but we\u2019re gonna make it awesome.\u201d Your initial infusion of $2m got a lot of press back in 2020. But how far did that really go? To the outside world, $2m seems like a lot because it\u2019s $2m, right? But one thing to remind people is I never got that $2m at one time. I got $800,000 in the summer of 2019. And then I got $1.2m in October 2020. You know, four plus four hours of sleep doesn\u2019t equal eight hours of sleep? What are your thoughts about your role with south Asian writers and representation \u2013 I actually don\u2019t like that word. I hate that word, too. I hate, hate, hate whenever I read an article where the angle is \u201crepresentation\u201d. Kill me now. Please stop. That should never be the angle. That\u2019s one of the reasons I started the Juggernaut, which is to ask: \u201cWhat\u2019s the second level?\u201d Representation isn\u2019t the end-all be-all. The end goal isn\u2019t representation. I think the end goal is showing how we are living our lives and noticing our histories and noticing stories in such a way that is respectful of each and all of our individual trajectories. When someone pitches me a story on south Asian musicians at Coachella, that story is not just about representation. It opens up 10 more questions: Why now? Why those artists? Do south Asians even attend Coachella? Who are the artists for? Does it even matter? The story is never just about representation. We always want to get to the second level at the Juggernaut. What was the most annoying thing about starting a small business? The paperwork! What\u2019s something that you found useful that other entrepreneurs might use? I did once hire a Vedic astrologist to look at the birth chart of my company. That was something? But seriously, something I\u2019m trying to get better at is firing myself from more functions and delegating more. So I\u2019m trying to move away from a digital to-do list \u2013 where your tasks can be endless \u2013 and bought a daily planner Moleskine where I limit myself to only the biggest, most important things. You can\u2019t go beyond the page, so limits are good! I\u2019m trying to get better at it. What is your ultimate goal for the Juggernaut? I\u2019d really love for stories that are important to our community not to be a footnote. I want the Juggernaut to be a household name. When there\u2019s a show happening, or when there\u2019s a story happening, I want people to say, \u201cWait, we should call those folks up and ask them to help us with the story or consult with us.\u201d I don\u2019t want to see just one show like Indian Matchmaking. I want to see 10 versions of what dating or arranged marriage looks like in our communities. I would love to start a studio like what the New York Times did and take [the weekly column] Modern Love and make it into a show. I really do look up to the New York Times a lot in terms of showing what is possible \u2013 through super-serving your audience. And I also look up to the Athletic a lot. One of their founders [Adam Hansmann] is one of our investors. They knew who their audience was \u2013 sports fans. They just built that, got out, got cash. What do you think you would be doing if you weren\u2019t doing this? There are alternate universes, right? I think that if I weren\u2019t doing this, there was an alternate multiverse where I would be trying to work at Amazon Studios and they were going to put me 50% in Bombay, 50% in LA, working on film production, film and TV production, which is nice. There\u2019s another alternate universe where I\u2019m doing something else, but I\u2019m pretty confident that all the multiverses would still end with me saying: \u201cI want to build something like this.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db53f", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/21/britain-is-embracing-switch-to-refillable-water-bottles-say-campaigners", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Britain is embracing switch to refillable water bottles, say campaigners", "lead": "Growing support from councils and firms and a culture shift over refills has changed how the country drinks", "author": "Esther Addley", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 10:00:37", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.989981", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/c8de8f385fc0b670abaa5ba826fbaeda02c05c9b/0_365_5472_3283/500.jpg", "body": "Passengers on London Underground and Manchester\u2019s Metrolink are urged to do it. Councils from Sunderland to Norfolk, Cardiff to Hounslow want their residents to do it. Many primary schools have been asking students to do it for ages. And now a growing number of high street outlets, including Greggs, Costa Coffee and Neal\u2019s Yard Remedies, want to make it easy to do it, wherever you are. Happily, lots of people in Britain are way ahead of them and are doing it already \u2013 carrying a refillable water bottle, that is. Whether for reasons of economy, hygiene, an urge to keep hydrated or a concern for the environment, for many people filling up a water bottle before they step out the door is now as habitual as picking up their keys or wallet. In 2015, just 20% of people in the UK used a refillable water bottle, according to the anti-disposables campaign Refill. That figure is now almost 60%, they say. Topping up a bottle from a tap, once seen as the preserve of the stingy or abstemious, is also big business, with the refillable bottle market in Europe worth \u00a31.5bn a year, a figure expected to grow by almost 40% by 2028. The challenge, say activists, is to encourage people to do so, and cut down on the 10m single use water bottles bought every day in the UK, 700,000 of which are discarded as litter. Working alongside more than 80 councils, and with a growing network of high street chains onboard, the Refill app showcases a network of 32,000 places across the UK \u2013 from municipal fountains to big chains to pubs to independent shops or businesses \u2013 where people can top up their bottles for free, no questions asked. \u201cWe did some initial consumer research to understand why we were buying so much bottled water in Britain, especially given that we have some of the best-quality tap water in the world,\u201d says Jo Morley, the head of campaigns at environmental group City to Sea, which runs the Refill campaign. \u201cAnd we found out that back then [in 2015], it just was not possible to fill a bottle. \u201cI remember commuting to London and filling up my bottle in pub toilets. It just wasn\u2019t the done thing to ask. And actually, that\u2019s what came out in our research, that we Brits were just too polite. We didn\u2019t like to ask for something for free.\u201d Their push to destigmatise and raise awareness is being embraced by a growing number of local authorities. Last Friday, Manchester city council and the Greater Manchester Combined Authority pledged to become \u201crefill destinations\u201d, opening up their buildings to provide more places where people can fill up water bottles for free. Sunderland, Southend, Norfolk, Waltham Forest, Hounslow and Cardiff have also signed up, says the organisation. It is not just about litter, although Bournemouth city council has said its introduction of 150 free refill taps last year reduced waste on its beach by 19,000 bottles in July alone. In a warming British climate, easy access to clean, free water is also an issue of social justice and public health. The mayor of London, too, has installed 110 new water fountains across the City and an additional 28 at ZSL London zoo. Some find the habit of carrying water easier than others, according to Jo Travers, a nutritionist based in London, who says younger generations are more attuned to the need to keep hydrated, and potentially attracted by the wide variety of designs now available. \u201cA water bottle is as an accessory, you can customise them and have whatever colour you like \u2013 these things do make a big difference to whether people want to carry a bottle of water around. But I definitely think that more of my younger clients understand about hydration \u2013 elderly people are often chronically dehydrated. There is definitely a bit of a generational divide.\u201d While the advice to drink two litres a day has been somewhat debunked, she acknowledges \u2013 it depends on body type and what else you are eating, for example \u2013 not drinking enough water can lead to sluggishness, constipation and difficulty regulating temperature. \u201cSo my general advice is to keep drinking. It\u2019s very, very rare, almost nonexistent, to feel worse after having a drink of water.\u201d For the manufacturer of Chilly\u2019s insulated bottles, however, the popularity of its collaborations with Liberty and Emma Bridgewater \u2013 not brands conspicuously targeted at Gen Z \u2013 shows that refillable bottles are not only for younger people, according to co-founder Tim Bouscarle. The brand, founded in 2010, was at one point the fastest-growing private company in Britain, with sales tripling over the three years to 2018; Bouscarle says it now sells \u201cmillions\u201d every year. \u201cOur company mission is to accelerate the adoption and everyday use of reusable products \u2013 and I do think that we have encouraged millions of people over the years in the UK to make a change to their daily habits.\u201d For Morley, the scale of behaviour change in Britain has been \u201creally phenomenal\u201d, though there is much further to go. \u201cIt used to be totally normal to carry a plastic water bottle around. Now there\u2019s a bit of a social stigma. For us, that was what we set out to do, to create that cultural shift.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db540", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/21/reproduction-by-louisa-hall-review-pregnancy-pain-and-frankenstein", "primaryCategory": "books", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Reproduction by Louisa Hall review \u2013 pregnancy, pain and Frankenstein ", "lead": "A visceral novel about Mary Shelley, the violence of procreation and our overheating planet", "author": "Lara Feigel", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 10:00:36", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.990000", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/ea576f379343573080b7891651aa6f4e9514dcb7/0_192_5760_3456/500.jpg", "body": "Are pregnancy and childbirth the most or least natural things we do? At the heart of Louisa Hall\u2019s brainily visceral new novel is a reading of Mary Shelley\u2019s Frankenstein as a book whose uncanny energy is forged in the crucible of reproduction. Pregnant, nauseous, fearful of miscarriage, Hall\u2019s narrator fails in her attempt to write a novel about Shelley, in part because her insights about Shelley\u2019s masterpiece have become too turbulent and revelatory. \u201cHow could she,\u201d the narrator asks, \u201ca creature who never had a mother, have observed such physical changes with anything other than terror? What am I? she must have wondered. What kind of creature is this?\u201d Hall is best known for her ambitious AI novel Speak (2015), which intertwines letters, diaries and court transcripts across several centuries to tell the tragic story of the rise and fall of a generation of intelligent, human-seeming dolls. She has now turned her attention inward, in this short, intricate work of autofiction about pregnancy and childbirth. But the preoccupations of Speak are still here: a thread about IVF introduces questions about the relationship between scientific overreaching and \u201cnatural\u201d biology, darkened by an increasingly unnatural climate. Hall\u2019s narrator journeys through snowstorms from a happy, childless second marriage in New York to a new life in Montana dominated by pregnancy. There are three: the first results in an empty sac that has to be surgically removed; the second leads nauseously to an excruciatingly long live birth that the narrator experiences more as an act of destruction than creation, and results in haemorrhaging so severe that organs seem to be falling out of her body; the third is a molar pregnancy in which her body creates cancerous matter that kills the embryo \u2013 \u201cmy body, I realised, had eaten my child alive\u201d. In the midst of this bloody chaos, a beloved daughter is born, managing to suckle even while her mother bleeds away her insides. The whole process has been so alien that the baby seems to come from the moon: \u201cHer brow was a burrow. And when she opened her mouth to cry: the darkness within it was an estuary, and behind it a river that tunnelled deep into her planet\u2019s centre.\u201d Joyfully, the narrator joins her there, looking down from her new happiness on a faraway, troubled Earth. As the baby becomes a more earthly toddler, brave in the playground, the particular combinations of separateness and togetherness of this phase of motherhood are caught with moving understatement. Meanwhile, the narrator thinks about Shelley and avoids seeing her former friend Anna, whose efforts to have a baby alone by IVF provide an unnerving parallel with her own supposedly natural attempts at reproduction. Anna, a scientist genetically modifying mice embryos to make them Covid-resistant, goes through several punishing IVF cycles, until she has no more viable eggs and only a handful of substandard embryos. She has to decide whether to use her scientific skills on her own child. Increasingly desperate, she lectures the narrator on how inferior miscarriage is as a selection method. Doesn\u2019t she owe it to herself and her baby to select the best embryos before implanting them? The two women come apart in their separate pain. It\u2019s Shelley who shows the narrator how closely related these experiences are. The book\u2019s triumph is to reveal, brilliantly and with feeling, the uncanny peculiarity of pregnancy and childbirth, and to connect this to all that is unnatural and peculiar about our overheating planet, with pollution and global warming throwing hormones awry and overheating pregnant bodies. It\u2019s the tussle with Frankenstein that reveals how high the stakes are. The narrator\u2019s gradual revelation is that if Shelley created a brilliant novel about the tragedy and unnaturalness of creaturely reproduction out of the heat of her own reproductive experience, we need such a novel for our times. This must be a novel that is itself a creature \u2013 \u201cmade of disparate parts, flesh and bone, blood lost in a haemorrhage, stitched-together old skin\u201d \u2013 because the novel is in some sense always an act of reproductive technology. It is just this novel that Hall creates, out of the disparate parts of bodily experience and medical disaster, seen in the larger context of a world becoming too polluted for \u201cnatural\u201d life processes to flourish, which turns pregnancy into a political issue (the narrator is aware that the life-saving terminations she requires wouldn\u2019t be available in some states). Through all this, as Shelley did, she writes the body with poetic clarity and beauty. \u201cOur water,\u201d the narrator says as her waters break. \u201cNo. Our body, our blood. Everything inside us might break, blow, burn against the bounds of us, flood over our shores.\u201d This is life born of pain; life that may make us all into monsters of the kind Shelley incandescently brought into being. Hall\u2019s achievement is to make these bleak revelations triumphantly on the side of life. \u2022 Reproduction by Louisa Hall is published by Scribner (\u00a314.99).

Folk horror, like film noir, is a term that seems to have been first used by critics before film-makers themselves, but The Wicker Man is so much better and more distinctive than any film that comes under the folk-horror heading that it\u2019s virtually a one-movie genre in itself. It now appears billed as a \u201cfinal cut\u201d: a restoration complete with the footage that was excised when it was released as a B-picture support to Don\u2019t Look Now in 1973. It is a brilliant conspiracy-chiller set on May Day on a remote fictional island off the Scottish coast, ruled over by the haughty laird Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee), whose inhabitants are devoted to sinister pagan observances to preserve the annual fruit harvest on which their economy depends. The Summerislanders are variously polite and insolent towards a thin-lipped young copper from the mainland who has been alerted to the disappearance of a teenage girl by an anonymous letter. This is the fiercely respectable Sgt Neil Howie, wonderfully played by Edward Woodward, a stickler for the Christian religion, saving himself for marriage to his demure fiancee, and outraged and yet also faintly excited by the sensual abandonment he sees around him. The film is a genuinely scary adventure in group psychopathology, carried off by director Robin Hardy with an inspired seriousness and density of imagined folkloric detail. It is all clearly inspired by Ira Levin at some level, but adapted by Anthony Shaffer from the 1967 novel Ritual by David Pinner, an actor-turned-writer who originally developed the story for Michael Winner and whose cop protagonist may owe something to a part that Pinner played in the West End: Sgt Trotter, from Agatha Christie\u2019s The Mousetrap. (Like TS Eliot\u2019s The Waste Land, incidentally, The Wicker Man is indebted to the images of death and rebirth from James Frazer\u2019s The Golden Bough.) Apart from everything else, The Wicker Man has the greatest pub-going-silent-when-a-stranger-comes-in scene in cinema history. The local hostelry The Green Man subsides into mutinous, hostile quiet at Sgt Howie\u2019s appearance and then, when the sneering landlord MacGregor (played by dancer and choreographer Lindsay Kemp) sends Sgt Howie up to his room accompanied by his comely daughter Willow (Britt Ekland), the drinkers erupt into an extraordinary smutty song accompanied by a gaggle of musicians. Every shot from this amazing sequence could be a prog album cover. The image of the local postmistress May Morrison (Irene Sunter) putting a frog into her daughter\u2019s mouth to cure her sore throat will never leave anyone who sees this film, and the same goes for the maypole song and the young woman Howie sees in the ruined churchyard, smiling blankly at him, breastfeeding a child while enigmatically holding an egg. The Wicker Man is often compared to movies that emerged at around the same time, such as Piers Haggard\u2019s The Blood on Satan\u2019s Claw in 1971 and Michael Reeves\u2019s Witchfinder General in 1968, although for me the element of pure folk ritual and mystery that is paramount in The Wicker Man isn\u2019t there, quite, in the others. The closer comparison is with Peter Watkins, particularly his docu-realist nightmare Punishment Park from 1971. In the end Sgt Howie meets his terrible destiny without quite appreciating the ironic parallel with the service of communion in which he solemnly partakes at the beginning: the blood and body of Christ. And it was only having watched this film again that a new thought struck me. The anonymous letter\u2019s author or authors addressed the missive to Howie by name: how exactly did they know about him and his situation in the first place? An informant in Howie\u2019s congregation? His fiancee perhaps? \u2022 The Wicker Man is screened as a one-night-only event on 21 June in cinemas."}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db542", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/21/thg-chief-matt-moulding-gives-up-golden-share", "primaryCategory": "business", "subCategories": "test", "title": "THG chief Matt Moulding gives up \u2018golden\u2019 share", "lead": "Retail group says Moulding has \u2018transferred\u2019 share that had given him power to veto hostile takeovers", "author": "Joanna Partridge", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 09:57:52", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.990036", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/3d71b5eacf9ee3ed4408ac67bdb4a8cd3b224bb1/602_312_2399_1439/500.jpg", "body": "Matt Moulding, the founder and chief executive of the online retail platform THG, has given up his \u201cgolden\u201d share allowing him to block any attempt to takeover the company, months after he was due to surrender it. THG \u2013 formerly known as The Hut Group and the owner of retail sites LookFantastic, Glossybox, Zavvi and Coggles \u2013 first pledged to cancel Moulding\u2019s controlling share in October 2021, after a disastrous investor presentation triggered a 35% one-day crash in its share price. Before its annual investor meeting on Wednesday, THG said Moulding had \u201ctransferred\u201d his special share that had given him power to veto hostile takeovers. The share will be cancelled by the company. Moulding\u2019s \u201cgolden\u201d share had long been contentious, and the company had originally said it would be cancelled during 2022, \u201cin furtherance of good corporate governance\u201d. The move came as Manchester-based THG, which also owns the MyProtein brand, forecast an increase in first-half profits thanks to a strong performance from the nutrition part of its business. The company is now predicting adjusted pre-tax profit of between \u00a344m and \u00a347m for the first half, compared with \u00a332.3m a year earlier. THG\u2019s shares rose 2% to 75p in early trading on Wednesday \u2013 but about 90% has been wiped off the company\u2019s market value since it first listed in London in September 2020. The 2021 announcement that Moulding would relinquish his controlling share was intended to pave the way for THG to apply to switch from a standard stock market listing to a premium one, as is usual. THG said it still intended to move to a premium stock market listing, but added that the timing was dependent on the final outcome of the review by the financial watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, on reform of the listing regime. The online retail platform said its nutrition division, which sells products including protein shakes, had had a \u201cparticularly strong start to the year\u201d, adding that commodity prices would continue to ease, boosting its profit margins in the second half of the year. THG said it expected to see sales of beauty products and makeup to increase in the second half, as beauty brands once again increased their production. The company, co-founded in 2004 by Matt Moulding and fellow former Phones4u executive John Gallemore, initially became an investor favourite after floating in London at an opening valuation of \u00a35.4bn. However, amid continued underperformance, the market value has fallen below \u00a31bn, to about \u00a3950m, and shares were recently knocked by THG\u2019s announcement that it was ending talks about a possible takeover bid by Apollo. The company said last month the private equity company\u2019s offer provided \u201cinadequate valuations\u201d of the retail platform."}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db543", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/21/taiwan-kindergarten-teachers-accused-drugging-children", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Teachers at Taiwan kindergarten accused of drugging children", "lead": "Anger over handling of scandal threatens opposition party\u2019s presidential election chances", "author": "Amy Hawkins and Chi Hui Lin", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 09:45:06", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.990053", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/6bf7d236d733803b22675322e952137876a357ec/0_0_1024_614/500.jpg", "body": "Parents of toddlers in Taiwan have accused teachers at a preschool of drugging their children, in a scandal that threatens to dent the opposition party\u2019s chances at the upcoming presidential election.

Eight pupils reportedly tested positive for trace amounts of the psychoactive drugs phenobarbital and benzodiazepines. The children\u2019s symptoms are thought to be withdrawal symptoms from the highly addictive drugs. Phenobarbital is used in the treatment of epilepsy, while benzodiazepines are a strong type of sleeping drug. It is not clear why the drugs, which are not easily available, were given to the children, although it is thought to have been because of their sedative properties. One teacher is also accused of using corporal punishment on the preschoolers. The principal of Baoren kindergarten, and five teachers, have been arrested pending a criminal investigation. The school was ordered to close and pay a fine of 150,000 Taiwanese dollars (\u00a33,793). When the Guardian visited the preschool on Wednesday the office was still open, but staff declined to comment on the situation. A spokesperson for Baoren said by telephone: \u201cI have nothing to say.\u201d In a statement to parents, Jidibao Education Group, the parent company of Baoren, apologised and said, \u201cthe truth has yet to be clarified\u201d, but acknowledged that families were \u201cdeeply affected\u201d by the incident. The group said it would work with the education bureau to help transfer children to alternative preschools. Parents have complained that the authorities were slow to react to their initial complaints in April and May. On Sunday, hundreds of people protested outside government buildings in New Taipei City, criticising the mayor, Hou You-yi, for his administration\u2019s handling of the scandal. In particular, parents are angry that children were not tested until 22 days after concerns were first raised. Taipei City hospital is offering free blood tests to preschool children, according to the BBC, but many parents fear it is too late to check if their children were affected by the alleged drugging. Hou is the presidential candidate for the KMT, the main opposition party, in next year\u2019s election. On 9 June, legislators from the ruling DPP accused Hou of focusing on his campaign rather than the drugging scandal, calling him a \u201cpart-time mayor\u201d. Hou saidthe incident should not be made into a \u201cpolitical issue\u201d. A poll by the Taiwan Public Opinion Foundation on 17 June found more than half of people were not satisfied with Hou\u2019s handling of the scandal. The anger cut across social groups such as gender, age, class and party affiliation. One commenter on a Facebook group set up as a \u201cvictims\u2019 alliance\u201d wrote that the government\u2019s response was \u201cridiculous\u201d and that the city was \u201cnot well managed\u201d. The kindergarten\u2019s Google listing has also been the subject of negative reviews. One commenter wrote: \u201cThis is the kindergarten where they drug toddlers \u2026 the New Taipei City government has been dragging its feet for a month without addressing the case \u2026 the drug feeding incident will not be forgotten by the people.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db544", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/21/too-good-to-be-true-key-greens-demand-for-rent-freeze-rejected-by-labor-states", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018Too good to be true\u2019: Key Greens demand for rent freeze rejected by Labor states", "lead": "Party vows to keep pursuing rent caps after working with Coalition to delay vote on Albanese government\u2019s housing fund", "author": "Tamsin Rose  Paul Karp and Eden Gillespie", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 09:25:59", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.990071", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/5b7dd9694f6b9c0267dd5b98905f4f46d0cce30f/0_51_5472_3283/500.jpg", "body": "Pressure is mounting on the Greens to support Labor\u2019s housing fund after the party\u2019s calls for state governments to impose rent freezes and increase caps were roundly rejected by east coast leaders. The Greens have come under pressure from the Albanese government and Labor states after voting with the Coalition on Monday to delay the $10bn housing Australia future fund until 16 October. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Despite Anthony Albanese offering an extra $2bn of direct spending on social and affordable housing over the weekend, the Greens have vowed to continue pursuing a rent freeze or rent caps, delaying legislation until national cabinet considers the prime minister\u2019s request to consider improving renters\u2019 rights. With the Greens facing threats that delaying the bill could create a trigger a double dissolution election, Albanese continued to pile pressure on in question time on Wednesday. The prime minister quoted at length from Max Chandler-Mather\u2019s essay in Jacobin magazine, in which the Greens housing spokesperson described the bill as \u201cthe only immediate leverage\u201d the Greens had to force action on rents. Earlier on Wednesday, the New South Wales premier, Chris Minns, repeated the position he has held since before the March election, flatly refusing to consider freezing rents across the state. \u201cIf the NSW government announced a rental freeze in the next fortnight, [property owners] would immediately increase rents,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see the unanticipated consequences of well-meaning legislation, meaning renters have to pay more. Max Chandler-Mather said: \u201cThere is $610 million of direct federal funding for social housing that NSW is getting right now because of the Greens. \"The Greens are now pushing to pass a housing plan in October that will lock in more direct funding for social housing and coordinate national limits on rent increases that will protect NSW renters from further devastating rent hikes. \"Labor\u2019s Housing Australia Future Fund doesn\u2019t guarantee a cent of funding until 2024/25 and won\u2019t build a single home until 2025, and so of course the Greens are fighting for more direct funding for public housing now and nationally coordinated limits on rent increases. NSW\u2019s better regulation minister, Anoulack Chanthivong, echoed his leader\u2019s concerns. \u201cAny solution that sounds too good to be true, probably is,\u201d he said. \u201cWith thousands of renters under extreme pressure, now isn\u2019t the time for political games and point scoring. Our focus is on getting the balance right with responsible reforms that deliver better rights for renters and changes to get new homes built to drive down prices.\u201d The NSW Greens have also been pushing for a rent freeze amid soaring costs in parts of Sydney and regional areas. When asked if she supported the idea of caps or freezes, Queensland\u2019s housing minister, Meaghan Scanlon, said the Greens needed to get out of the way of the federal government\u2019s plan. \u201cWe\u2019re committed to ensuring that the private rental market operates in a fair and balanced way,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat the Greens political party need to do to ease national housing pressures is stop blocking legislation that will build 30,000 homes.\u201d The only state government to show any consideration of the rental caps proposed by the Greens was Victoria, where the treasurer, Tim Pallas, said people were doing it tough after ruling out a freeze as a \u201cdistortion of the market\u201d. \u201cI do think there has to be a point at which the community says this has gone beyond reason \u2026 some of the poorest people are being encumbered with costs,\u201d he said. \u201cOne in three Victorians rent and they do need and deserve support.\u201d The government has flagged there were more housing reforms slated for later in the year."}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db545", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/21/will-rishi-sunak-december-deadline-halve-inflation", "primaryCategory": "business", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Will Rishi Sunak meet his December deadline to halve UK inflation?", "lead": "As Bank raises interest rates again and big business greedflation pushes prices higher, the PM\u2019s vow is a gamble", "author": "Phillip Inman", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 09:10:53", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.990091", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/ad2acf8f7220bb3e08b6add5d6713881fa033165/0_44_4816_2890/500.jpg", "body": "It was considered an easy win when Rishi Sunak promised to halve inflation by the end of the year. That was January, when most economic forecasters were predicting the story for the UK in 2023 would be marked by recession. Month after month, the figures have confounded those forecasts. The economy has proved more resilient \u2013 though only because it is going sideways rather than contracting \u2013 and inflation rampant. The consumer prices index (CPI) stayed the same in May at 8.7% when City economists expected a fall to at least 8.4%. It wasn\u2019t much of a drop, but the cost of living crisis affecting so many people would have eased. Now the UK has the worst of all situations \u2013 rising prices, a flat economy and a central bank that has only one method of arresting the situation, and that is to raise interest rates to make enough people poorer that consumer spending goes down. It is almost certain the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee will raise interest rates on Thursday from 4.5% to 4.75% or higher, despite at least two dissenting members arguing that the current rate is enough to depress the economy as the year rolls on. It is clear from May\u2019s figures that dramatic falls in energy and food prices, which were expected, have yet to bring down the CPI. While wholesale gas prices are a fraction of their peak, and have been since the beginning of the year, long-term energy contracts have most likely prevented steeper falls in consumer prices. Food inflation appears to have peaked, but the industry continues to drive up prices at record rates despite all its major input costs declining. Unions have said all this points to price gouging by leading food businesses and the supermarkets to protect their profit margins. Explaining what has been a global phenomenon, the US economist James K Galbraith joined a growing band who argue that greedflation is a factor pushing prices higher, not wages. He explained how, without the need for cartels or back-street deals, big firms find they can continue raising prices, even when their cost pressures are modest. \u201cIn disturbed and disrupted moments, increased margins are a hedge against cost uncertainties, and there develops a general climate of \u2018get what you can, while you can\u2019. The result is a dynamic of rising prices, rising costs, rising prices again \u2013 with wages always lagging behind,\u201d he said. The UBS economist Paul Donovan said the same trend could be seen in the UK and Europe. May\u2019s data shows that most of the price rises are in areas of discretionary spending, like holidays, recreation and entertainment. Britons have always demanded foreign holidays. And after three years of uncertainty and long periods of restrictions on travel, the sale of flights has rocketed. No one seems to mind that the airlines are hoping to recover some of their pandemic losses with much higher ticket prices. Sunak could still score a victory. He has six months to go. Some of the biggest increases in energy and food prices happened last summer and these will not be repeated over the coming few months, which should mean inflation drops to 5% quite quickly. Still, he thought it was going to be his easiest win and now it looks like being a Johnsonian gamble. He seems to have misread the UK economy, or at least the capacity of businesses to keep increasing prices without much justification. In that, he is not alone."}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db546", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/21/teal-mps-criticise-greens-short-sighted-opposition-to-labors-planned-nature-repair-market", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Teal MPs criticise Greens\u2019 \u2018short-sighted\u2019 opposition to Labor\u2019s planned nature repair market", "lead": "Kylea Tink says the Greens are \u2018cutting off their nose to spite their face\u2019, but Sarah Hanson-Young says \u2018Green Wall Street is not what nature needs\u2019", "author": "Paul Karp Chief political correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 09:07:56", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.990109", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/c567c1b7af99001ef0ba30b8331cba3f8cfa256e/0_0_5472_3283/500.jpg", "body": "Teal independent MPs have accused the Greens of \u201cincredibly short-sighted\u201d opposition to Labor\u2019s proposed nature repair market, urging them to improve rather than stall or block the bill. The members for North Sydney, Kylea Tink, and Wentworth, Allegra Spender, have suggested the Greens are \u201ccutting off their nose to spite their face\u201d and \u201cblocking things that are important because they don\u2019t get everything they want\u201d. The crossbench has negotiated amendments that have been approved by the environment minister, Tanya Plibersek. The bill passed the House of Representatives on Wednesday evening, with Labor, Helen Haines, Spender, Tink, Zali Steggall, Sophie Scamps, Kate Chaney and Monique Ryan in favour. It was opposed at the second reading stage by the Coalition, Greens and Zoe Daniel. The proposed legislation establishes a scheme to incentivise investment in nature restoration by creating tradable certificates for projects that protect and restore biodiversity. In March, the Coalition party room resolved to support the bill in principle because it had proposed the same scheme in government. But in June it backflipped, meaning in the Senate the Albanese government will need to pass the bill with the 11 votes of the Greens, who regard it as \u201cirreparable\u201d. The bill is supported by the National Farmers\u2019 Federation, the Northern Land Council, Farmers for Climate Action and Landcare but is not widely supported by environment groups, due to concerns that the scheme as proposed could be used to offset habitat destruction caused by other developments. Spender\u2019s amendment attempts to address this by allowing landholders to specify if the certificates created protecting nature on their land are able to be used for offsets or not. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Spender told Guardian Australia the purpose of the bill is \u201cpositive nature repair \u2026 not primarily offsets\u201d. \u201cPeople doing this are doing it because they\u2019re committed to nature, that\u2019s why this [amendment] is really important.\u201d \u201cPeople can specify \u2018I\u2019m trying to invest to improve nature, not to offset\u2019. This gives clarity to investors, and landholders to make that investment with certainty.\u201d Spender said it \u201cbeggars belief\u201d that the Coalition is standing in the way of a scheme \u201cthat can benefit farmers and rural communities\u201d. \u201cWhen it comes to the Greens, obviously the scale of the environmental challenge is massive, but it is up to the Greens to make it better, not to stand in the way. \u201cPeople are out there giving nature credits now, with no oversight on those \u2013 it\u2019s a huge opportunity for greenwashing, this really reduces that opportunity. \u201cIt\u2019s not perfect \u2026 But the Greens have got to stop blocking things that are important because they don\u2019t get everything they want.\u201d Tink\u2019s amendment increases the transparency and accountability of the scheme by requiring activity reports of the regulator and annual reports about the purchases of biodiversity certificates to be tabled in parliament. Tink said the crossbench had sought to improve the legislation \u201crather than take an \u2018it\u2019s our way or the highway\u2019 approach that doesn\u2019t benefit anybody\u201d. \u201cThe government is never going to be able to spend enough money to fix this problem. \u201cThe only way to make a significant impact is by getting all of society engaged in pursuing solutions. Part of that is private philanthropy and corporate money into the problem, dedicated to fixing it.\u201d Tink said the market for environmental improvements will be supported by philanthropists and businesses because \u201cthat\u2019s what shareholders and customers expect, and what international trade conditions require\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s good for their business to invest, not just to pay for a sin that they may have done somewhere else.\u201d Tink said the Coalition\u2019s backflip was \u201ccompletely nonsensical\u201d, because the bill was \u201ctwo-thirds exactly what they\u201d had proposed in government. Tink said the Greens current opposition is \u201cincredibly short-sighted\u201d, likening it to an approach of \u201ccutting off their nose off to spite their face\u201d. Plibersek said the government had agreed to some amendments from Tink, Spender, Zoe Daniel, Zali Steggall, and Kate Chaney.

Onboard the ship was an array of scientific monitoring equipment, cameras and a sleek, 22ft-long submersible named Titan. The passengers onboard the chartered Polar Prince vessel were excited at the prospect of reaching the final resting site of the RMS Titanic, even if it meant cramming themselves inside the hollow body of Titan. But the small carbon fibre craft disappeared on Sunday, nearly two hours after it dipped below the surface, en route to the remains of the sunken ocean liner. The disappearance has prompted a frantic international search, with Canada and the US marshalling all available resources in a race against time. The Titanic never reached its destination of New York City. But along the east coast of Canada, the legacy of the doomed ship still looms large more than a century after it sank. More than 120 victims of the disaster are buried in the Fairview cemetery in Halifax, Nova Scotia \u2013 at the time the city nearest to the sinking with rail and shipping connections. The city\u2019s Museum of the Atlantic showcases artifacts from the ship, including a deck chair, personal effects and wreckage, as well as the white canvas mortuary bags used for the victims. St John\u2019s, Canada\u2019s easternmost city in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, remains the closest city to the liner\u2019s final resting place and has become the launching site for expeditions traveling to the wreck site, nearly 400 miles (650km) away \u2013 and more than 12,000ft (3,800m) below the surface of the ocean. On Tuesday, the city, known for its brightly coloured \u201cbiscuit box\u201d houses, was blanketed in a thick haze of fog and rain as residents made sense of the news. \u201cTo hear that there are people in distress possibly and not knowing where they are and if we\u2019re ever going to find them \u2026 it\u2019s heart-wrenching,\u201d said Anne Simmons, operations manager at a local tour company. \u201cThe whole world is watching because it\u2019s the Titanic. Everybody knows about it.\u201d On April 1912, the Titanic received warnings of drifting ice in the area of the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. Hours later, a remote Marconi wireless station on the south-east tip of the island received the Titanic\u2019s first distress call. St John\u2019s is also home to Memorial University and the world-class Marine Institute research centre, which recently announced a partnership with OceanGate, the American company behind the missing submersible. Friday\u2019s mission was the company\u2019s fifth Titanic expedition. Onboard were Hamish Harding, 58, a British explorer and pilot who has previously taken a suborbital spaceflight; British Pakistani businessman Shahzada Dawood, 48; and Dawood\u2019s son Suleman, 19. \u201cDue to the worst winter in Newfoundland in 40 years, this mission is likely to be the first and only manned mission to the Titanic in 2023. A weather window has just opened up and we are going to attempt a dive tomorrow,\u201d Harding posted on Instagram on Saturday. \u201cWe started steaming from St John\u2019s, Newfoundland, Canada, yesterday and are planning to start dive operations around 4am tomorrow morning. Until then we have a lot of preparations and briefings to do.\u201d Paul Henri Nargeolet, a deep diver, submersible pilot, former French navy commander and a leading authority on the Titanic wreck site, is also believed to have been onboard alongside Stockton Rush, the founder of OceanGate. On Tuesday, St John\u2019s harbour was blanketed in a thick cover of fog. Out on the ocean, challenging conditions have hampered the search efforts. \u201cI don\u2019t believe anybody should just be able to build their own submarine and head off into the world without the skills or talents to do so because then you know tragedies like this do happen,\u201d said resident Ashton Quinn. \u201cI feel very bad for the families of the people involved.\u201d As the search intensifies, there is collective hope the vessel can be located.

Scientists at University College London said women should be aware that natural pregnancies after IVF were not as unusual as thought. The experts said a study of more than 5,000 women showed that 20% of those who sought assisted conception for their first child were able to become pregnant naturally within three years. Dr Annette Thwaites, the lead author from UCL\u2019s EGA Institute for Women\u2019s Health, said: \u201cOur findings suggest that natural pregnancy after having a baby by IVF is far from rare. \u201cThis is in contrast with widely held views \u2013 by women and health professionals \u2013 and those commonly expressed in the media, that it is a highly unlikely event.\u201d The researchers analysed data from 11 studies of more than 5,000 women around the world between 1980 and 2021, including 1,160 from the UK. They speculated that fertility techniques could boost natural conception, saying: \u201cIt is biologically plausible that ovarian stimulation from IVF cycles may improve ovarian function.\u201d They also suggested that hormonal changes that occur during pregnancy and reduced stress after giving birth may also help women conceive naturally. The team said a vast majority of participants in the studies had subfertility, in which conceiving takes longer than typically expected. It means not all women seeking and undergoing fertility treatment are absolutely or permanently infertile, they added. A small number of participants underwent the IVF procedure due to reasons not related to infertility, such as being in a same-sex relationship, being a single parent or being a surrogate. With more than 10 million babies born worldwide via IVF, the researchers said it was important for those who have had successful treatment to know how likely they were to conceive naturally afterwards. Thwaites said: \u201cKnowing what is possible would empower women to plan their families and make informed choices regarding further fertility treatment and/or contraception.\u201d The research, published in the journal Human Reproduction, also included a report featuring interviews with 22 women in the UK who experienced natural pregnancy after fertility treatment. Shema Tariq, a doctor and academic from London who has two children aged three and four, was diagnosed with low ovarian reserve and told that her chances of conceiving without IVF were almost zero. The 43-year-old said: \u201cIt took six rounds of IVF to conceive our son, who was born in 2018. My GP briefly mentioned contraception to me after he was born, but we both laughed and agreed that it wasn\u2019t relevant. \u201cEight months later I was unexpectedly, and naturally, pregnant with our daughter. She has been the most wonderful surprise, but when we first found out I felt overwhelmed and unprepared for another pregnancy. \u201cIf I\u2019d known that one in five women conceive naturally after IVF I\u2019d have used contraception until I was ready both emotionally and physically.\u201d According to the NHS, about one in seven couples may have difficulties getting pregnant.

Or do you just wash it habitually?\u201d He then points out that the fabric that has most contact with your body is your bedding, and you wouldn\u2019t dream of washing it after every use. Orsola de Castro, fashion designer and author of Loved Clothes Last, says (quite sternly) \u201cthe washing machine is not an extension of your wardrobe. It has a function, which is to alleviate the pain of washing by making it easier, but more frequent is not the point.\u201d Meanwhile, NJ Stevenson, fashion historian and curator, considers as a thought experiment: what did people do when they didn\u2019t have washing machines or dry cleaning facilities? \u201cThey\u2019d have one good wool suit, which would be spot cleaned and aired; it would never be washed.\u201d How long is it acceptable to wear something without washing it? This will depend not only on the fabric and the season, but on how you comported yourself in the garment. \u201cDid I fall asleep blind drunk having smoked last night?\u201d De Castro asks rhetorically. \u201cFor me, it goes a little deeper than just talking about washing. If you think about our relationship with clothing and how we\u2019ve removed ourselves from any kind of emotional attachment, that leads to the way we care for our clothes, like \u2018boom. Shove it in the machine\u2019. I treat my clothes as I treat the food in my fridge \u2013 with some understanding of what it needs, and the way it links to my body. I call clothes my chosen skin.\u201d Also, think about how dirty you are, underneath your clothes: \u201cWe wash ourselves so much anyway,\u201d Blackburn says. \u201cMost people shower or bathe once a day. Most of us do occupations where, frankly, we don\u2019t really perspire. We don\u2019t get dirty, and it\u2019s not good to be uber clean. We live with this nice microbiome of bacteria on our skin, which helps you to have good skin.\u201d Is it ever acceptable to wear underwear more than once without washing it? Blackburn says he\u2019ll happily wear socks more than once, and has been known to wear pants twice if on the first day, he didn\u2019t get the full 18-hours\u2019 use out of them. Say he got up late, or took them off early because, I don\u2019t know, something else happened. For De Castro: \u201cI have been known to spot clean underwear if it looks OK, rather than put it in the machine.\u201d She will frequently hand-wash underwear while she\u2019s having a shower, which requires minimal effort. Stevenson sketches the change in function of underwear \u2013 before washing machines, \u201cwomen would always wear a slip or a bodice, and men would always wear a vest. There was an element of formality, it wasn\u2019t done to see the bits that you\u2019re not supposed to see, but it was also to soak up sweat.\u201d So there\u2019s always been a sense that underwear is doing the heavy-lifting, body-odour wise, and has to be washed often to protect the outerwear. But ask yourself, per Blackburn, how heavy that lifting is, in your pampered life. Some people never wash their bras \u2013 is this advisable? It is commonly agreed that \u201cnever\u201d is pushing it, but \u201cI definitely wash my bras less often than pants, because they get less dirty\u201d, De Castro says. Underwired bras last longer the less often you wash them, because of the complexity of the structure and the fragility of the wire, but De Castro would like to \u201cdebunk the myth of luxury as the be-all and end-all. My La Perla bra lasted way less time than my Victoria\u2019s Secret one.\u201d Should you ever wear gym clothes more than once? Some expert discord, here, on the very concept of athleisure: De Castro calls it \u201cthe biggest oxymoron in the history of clothes \u2013 these are the clothes we wear supposedly to be fit, to be in touch with our bodies and with nature. They\u2019re made of Lycra and polyester. It means that every time you wear them, every time you sweat and breathe heavily, you\u2019re breathing in plastics. I would only wear cotton, and I would only wash it after vigorous sweating.\u201d Blackburn has nothing against polyester, on the contrary, he approves of its ability to wick away sweat, and has this ingenious top-rotation strategy: \u201cIf I go running in a polyester top, particularly at this time of year, that definitely needs washing. But if I go to yoga \u2013 I\u2019m not doing hot yoga \u2013 that same top will be absolutely fine afterwards. So I\u2019ll wear that to yoga first, then get two workouts for one wash.\u201d Which fabrics need the least washing? Stevenson would never put wool in the washing machine: \u201cIt just damages the fibres. Lots of vintage fabric, you would hand-wash. Viscose-mix pre-1980s can be difficult. Silk can be OK, but generally I wouldn\u2019t put it in the machine, because it goes crispy.\u201d Once you\u2019re in hand-washing territory, you\u2019ll naturally wash garments less because it\u2019s a pain in the arse. Wool \u201cis amazing at managing our heat\u201d, Blackburn says. \u201cIt has natural self-cleaning properties, and doesn\u2019t hold odour. In processing it, we do remove some natural oils, but fundamentally, it\u2019s designed in nature not to have a smell because a smell attracts pests.\u201d \u201cPolyester was designed with a purpose,\u201d De Castro says, \u201cand its purpose was easy care. It\u2019s meant to be very easy to clean, and because of that, we tend to throw it in the machine without thinking. But it\u2019s very easy to spot-clean.\u201d At the same time, all hydrophobic materials \u2013 nylons \u2013 will be \u201cmore likely to attract odour molecules\u201d, Blackburn says, whereas cotton tends not to pick up your smell. Once anything smells, you pretty much do have to wash it. Unless \u2026 Can airing clothes outside help to keep them smelling fresh? \u201cThe reason you can smell the molecule is because it\u2019s volatile,\u201d Blackburn says. \u201cIt\u2019s effectively evaporating, you could not smell something if it wasn\u2019t vaporised. The best way to get something to vaporise very quickly is to stick it outside, let some wind move it. Even in a room where you\u2019ve got wind moving through, that will work.\u201d De Castro both airs and sunbathes her textiles, particularly throws, cushions, and duvets. A dress that smells like last night, she will hang in the bathroom while taking a shower, and use essential oils (on herself, not the clothes), \u201cso it gets the steam and the smell of the shower, but not the water\u201d. \u201cPeople don\u2019t really have airing cupboards any more,\u201d says Stevenson. \u201cI tend to hang things in our downstairs loo, where the boiler is, in the winter, and that will air it.\u201d Even with all this science and all this testimony, I still didn\u2019t believe it until I tried it \u2013 I hung two dresses, both a viscose mix, outside in this baking weather, and stone me if they didn\u2019t end the day smelling like they\u2019d been dry cleaned. Won\u2019t dirty clothes attract moths? \u201cI have long given up,\u201d De Castro says. \u201cI tend to keep my knitwear quite dirty, and it gets attacked by moths. My husband is pernickety and keeps his in plastic, and it gets attacked by moths.\u201d She says that she is a \u201cbiodesigner,\u201d who co-designs with moths: \u201cI can live with holes. I love holes,\u201d she says. \u201cOne of the most beautiful pieces of art I\u2019ve ever seen was someone who took a table cloth and embroidered every single stain \u2013 egg, wine, whatever, rendered beautiful by this creative act of embroidering over it.\u201d However, if you do not love holes, here are some tips which do not involve more washing. According to De Castro \u2013 a suggestion passed on from a vintage reseller in Italy \u2013 you should put a decoy in your wardrobe, something moths will love. If you find the right garment, apparently they will stick with that and leave your other knitwear alone. She uses a camel hair jumper. Also, move your clothes often; take your knitwear out regularly, shake it all and refold it. \u201cMoths are only attracted to protein, because they want to eat it,\u201d Blackburn says. So that\u2019s wool and silk, basically \u2013 they\u2019re not even interested in cotton. Stevenson says the older your house, the worse the moth problem will be. She\u2019s now in a postwar house and hasn\u2019t seen a moth for ages. It would be drastic to actually move house. Is it OK to wash your clothes on a short 30 degree cycle if you\u2019re only washing them very occasionally? Or will you need to opt for a long, hot wash when you do finally chuck your stuff in the machine? \u201cI had interesting advice from somebody who worked with washing machines,\u201d De Castro says, \u201cwhich was, always use the lowest possible temperature, and then every two months, do a 95, for all the things that need it.\u201d Blackburn is a massive fan of detergent. \u201cI\u2019ve always washed on short cycles, because these days, if you buy the right product, you don\u2019t need a long cycle and you can wash at 30 degrees and know your clothes will be clean. People are cynical, and think the promises are just marketing. But they spend a hell of a lot of money patenting detergent because the tech is so valuable.\u201d Can you wash clothes less in winter as you generally sweat less? Obviously, doofus. Although Blackburn points out that if you\u2019re working in an air-conditioned office, you\u2019re effectively living in a mild winter most of the time. What happens if I get a blob of something on my T-shirt? Can I spot-wash instead? And what is the best way to do this? De Castro says: \u201cSome stains you can brush clean, and the abrasive element of the towel gets rid of it \u2013 I\u2019m thinking mud, egg, things that aren\u2019t necessarily unctuous. Then finish it off with a bit of humidity. Some stains need a bit of wet, and some, like oil, need detergent.\u201d Blackburn doesn\u2019t sound like a man who spills very much, which he admits: \u201cI have a background in chemistry, you get very good at pouring things.\u201d But now he has a baby. \u201cI often go to work and I\u2019ll look at my jeans, and think: \u2018Where\u2019s that handprint in spaghetti bolognese come from?\u2019 Often it just rubs off though.\u201d \u201cWhen you rub, look at the weave of the fabric and rub in that direction,\u201d says De Castro. \u201cYou\u2019ll see the material sag a little bit if you do it in the opposite direction.\u201d For a wet spot-clean, according to Stevenson, \u201ctake a clean cloth, generally I use a tea towel, dampen it a bit. I find the very best thing for spot washing is Fairy Liquid. Get a little blob of it, rub it together to take away the greenness, and then just dab the fabric very gently.\u201d The cardinal rule with stains is to attack them immediately; De Castro keeps a little sponge in her handbag."}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db54a", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/21/britain-mortgage-banks-bailout-profits-homeowners", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "subCategories": "test", "title": "There\u2019s only one way to tackle Britain's mortgage meltdown \u2013 get the banks to cough up | John McDonnell", "lead": "The big five owe the public for the 2008 bailout \u2013 and they are taking in enormous profits while many homeowners and renters struggle, says former chancellor John McDonnell", "author": "John McDonnell", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 08:39:16", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.990180", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/2a76b24dc12e5082f466b5a4b2716d520916af8e/0_441_6656_3996/500.jpg", "body": "Across the country, homeowners are facing a mortgage payments crisis. They ultimately face the possibility of losing their homes. Meanwhile, the government says nothing and the banks sit on their hands, offering next to no support. But the very same banks that offer mortgages are taking in huge profits. So here\u2019s a solution to the current crisis: a decade since hundreds of billions were spent bailing them out with taxpayers\u2019 money, the banks need to pull their weight and support customers. The big five banks \u2013 Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds, NatWest and Standard Chartered \u2013 posted profits of around \u00a337bn for 2022. An analysis by the Unite union in May found that UK banks made an extra \u00a37bn by refusing to pass on higher interest rates to savers. In April 2023, many of those banks were paying customers rates of less than 1.3% on their easy-access savings accounts, despite the Bank of England base rate being 4.25%. They\u2019ve also been enjoying a profit surge this year. On 3 May, Lloyds reported \u00a32.3bn profits for Q1 2023 \u2013 a 46% increase on the previous quarter. On 28 April, Natwest reported \u00a31.9bn profits for Q1 2023 \u2013 a 50% increase on the previous quarter. NatWest said its net interest income \u2013 which accounts for the difference between what it pays savers and what it charges to borrowers \u2013 jumped 43% to \u00a32.9bn in the first quarter. These are just two examples \u2013 the figures from HSBC and Barclays are also eye-watering. In fact, Nationwide \u2013 a building society \u2013 even announced last month it would pay \u00a3340m directly into customer accounts for the first time, after a jump in deposits and higher interest rates drove annual profits up 40% to \u00a32.2bn. The payout is worth about 15% of its annual profits. But it\u2019s a different story for ordinary homeowners. Already the cost of fixed-rate mortgages has risen, with a two-year fixed rate above 6% this week. When the Bank of England meets this Thursday, it\u2019s expected to increase interest rates further. There are 1.5m or more households that are facing a massive increase in the cost of remortgaging. The fear is that this could lead to significant rises in repossessions and rent increases. With bank profits continuing to soar, it\u2019s surely time for action from the banks to shield households from the worst effects of this mortgage crisis. So what can be done? The banks could voluntarily shoulder some of the burden of the rise in interest rates and take a form of haircut. This would mean that they accept that mortgagees are struggling to pay and cut their interest rates, covering the cost from their profits. But if the banks are not willing to act, the government should intervene and levy an excess profits tax on the sector. If the UK\u2019s big five banks were required to pay a windfall tax of 15% (equivalent to Nationwide\u2019s customer payout), itt could fund a mortgage interest relief scheme of \u00a35.5bn for 2022, and likely significantly higher in 2023. A 15% tax on Q1 2023 profits alone would be \u00a33bn. At this level, it would not relieve the full burden expected to result from the rate rises, but it would go some way to lift the pressure on households at a time of a cost of living crisis. For many people it could be the difference that saves them from repossession and losing their homes. Support for mortgagees in difficult times is nothing new. Past governments introduced support through a mortgage tax relief scheme (Miras). In 1971, Miras cost the exchequer \u00a3302m \u2013 equivalent to \u00a33.5bn today. In 2000 (its final year), its value was \u00a31.4bn \u2013 equivalent to \u00a32.5bn today. Finally, renters must not be forgotten. Alongside mortgage support, it\u2019s long overdue that the mayors of our big cities are given the power to control rents that they have been asking for. Landlords have seen their profits rise between 15% and 20% in recent years. The time has come to act. Whichever way assistance can be provided it\u2019s vital that action is taken soon, and reassurance is given to people that their homes are safe and that they will be able to afford their mortgage or rents. This will provide a breathing space needed to enable a comprehensive housing policy programme to be brought forward under Labour, with at its core a mass council housebuilding initiative.

Official figures had been expected to show that the UK\u2019s consumer prices index (CPI) eased slightly last month, to 8.4%. But unlike almost everywhere else in the world, that didn\u2019t happen. The inflation rate has fallen from a peak of 11.1% last October but household bills are still rising at the fastest rate in the G7. Supermarket inflation has eased to its lowest level this year, yet remains at its sixth-highest level since the financial crisis in 2008. As recently as March, Goldman Sachs was predicting UK inflation could drop quickly through the summer and autumn to below 2% by the end of 2023. Once it was clear Europe\u2019s major economies could cope without Russian gas and wholesale gas prices had slumped, every G7 country would enjoy an inflation dividend, was the majority view. In January, the price of a kilowatt hour of gas was down to almost pre-pandemic levels. In the US, the impact of falling energy prices has been greater. The inflation rate has dropped to 4% from a peak of 9.1% last summer. Canada benefits from a 4% inflation rate while, in April, Japan registered a 3.4% increase in consumer costs. In Germany, the inflation rate dropped from 6.8% in April to 6.3% in May while in France it was even larger, to 6% from 6.9% in the previous month. And the eurozone average inflation rate eased more than expected in May, declining from 7% to 6.1% year-on-year, with Italy an outlier after it registered a rate of 8%. Lower petrol and gas prices meant energy reduced inflation across the eurozone by 1.8%. Setting the UK apart is a jobs market that is struggling to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic, Brexit visa rules and the decision by many older workers to quit the employment scene. In France, the rate of worker participation is higher than before the pandemic. That is to say, a higher proportion of working age people have a job or have registered to work. In the UK, the participation rate has declined, driving up wages and maintaining the pressure on prices. The UK also imports more than 50% of its food, mostly from the EU, which has proved to be badly affected by rising raw materials costs. Food prices have risen at more than 18% for most of the year, pushing the overall UK inflation rate above those of rival economies. Subsidies in other countries have also acted to suppress inflation. For instance, France capped energy prices last year and only lifted the cap when prices had fallen in the spring, preventing a big increase in consumer bills. More recently, Germany introduced a monthly \u20ac49 public transport ticket, which can be used across the country on regional and local trains, that economists said subtracted as much as 0.1 percentage points from eurozone inflation on its own. \u2022 This article was amended on 21 June 2023 to clarify that the German transport ticket is \u20ac49 per month, and is valid for the whole country."}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db54c", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/21/taylor-swift-australia-tour-eras-sydney-melbourne-shows-cost", "primaryCategory": "music", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Taylor Swift\u2019s Eras tour in Australia: what you need to know about tickets to the Sydney and Melbourne shows", "lead": "When are tickets on sale, how much will they cost and what about New Zealand?

An American Express Card presale starts on Monday 26 June, but it appears to be limited to two VIP packages selling for $1,249.90 and $899.90. Sydney shows are on sale from 10am, while Melbourne shows are on sale from 2pm. The pre-sale lasts for 48 hours or until the allocation is exhausted. The Frontier Members presale starts on Wednesday 28 June, and will run for 24 hours from 10am for Sydney shows and from 2pm for Melbourne shows, or until the pre-sale allocation is exhausted. To get your hands on these, you\u2019ll need to sign up to be a member of Frontier Touring and register for a presale code. General ticket sales will go live on Friday 30 June \u2013 and once again, it will start at 10am for Sydney shows and 2pm for Melbourne shows. Customers can buy a maximum of four tickets for each show. Guardian Australia has asked Frontier Touring what proportion of tickets will be reserved for the general sale. How much will tickets cost? Tickets range from $79.90 to $379.90. Packages begin at $349.90 for the We Never Go Out Of Style Package, which includes an E Reserve ticket, and goes up to $1,249.90 for the It\u2019s Been A Long Time Coming Package, which includes an A Reserve ticket. What about scalping and scams? Even though tickets aren\u2019t even on sale yet, there are already ticket scalping websites saying they can guarantee tickets at inflated prices, Choice spokesperson, Jarni Blakkarly says. \u201cThe bigger the demand is, the bigger the ticket scalping is, the higher prices people are getting ripped off. I\u2019m sure these tickets will sell out in a matter of minutes when they go on sale, and there\u2019ll be thousands of fans who want tickets who aren\u2019t able to get them,\u201d Blakkarly said. Blakkarly says Choice has heard of many cases where consumers have never received the tickets, have received fake tickets \u2013 and even been turned away at the venue. The main way to avoid being scammed, Blakkarly says, is to buy tickets through the official ticket seller, which in this case is Ticketek. If people do try to get resold tickets, \u201creally high prices, unrealistic promises around ticket delivery or front-row seats should be a red flag\u201d, Blakkarly says. According to Frontier Touring\u2019s website, tickets will only be able to be accessed via Ticketek\u2019s apps. No physical tickets will be available, and the ticket barcode will activate just before the show. Who will be supporting Swift? Pop\u2019s next big thing, Sabrina Carpenter, will tour with Swift as a special guest in all Australian shows. That doesn\u2019t necessarily rule out other guests.

With her big sunglasses and permanently dishevelled jet-black hair, Taylor gives an intense and more-than-slightly alarming performance in a preposterous, slightly dated yet very watchable psycho-existential mystery, a cousin to the era\u2019s paranoid thrillers. It was shot by Vittorio Storaro, who repeatedly directs light sources into the camera so that the figures often move like shadows behind a disconcerting glow, which is part of the film\u2019s distinctive puzzle. Taylor plays Lise, a single woman of a certain age who is clearly on the verge of a breakdown. Lise lives in Hamburg, where she is seen buying oddly garish, multicoloured clothes in a department store, high-handedly terrorising the sales assistants and announcing that these garments are appropriate for the warm, southern climes to which she says she is heading. We first see Lise drifting through a surreal department filled with naked mannequins; perhaps The Driver\u2019s Seat has been an influence on Peter Strickland. On the plane and in the city itself, she has deeply strange, fraught encounters with men, most of whom want to have sex with her, such as the creepy businessman and macrobiotic diet enthusiast Bill, played by Ian Bannen \u2013 the pan right on the plane to reveal his grinning face is one of the film\u2019s most disquieting moments. There is also garage mechanic Carlo (Guido Mannari), who rescues Lise in Rome after she is dazed and traumatised by witnessing a car bomb assassination attempt in the streets; another deeply dreamlike and unsettling set piece. Lise befriends a ditsy old lady, Mrs Fiedke (Mona Washbourne), but seems impatiently keen to ditch her. She also has an encounter with a distrait English aristocrat; this is an extraordinary cameo from Andy Warhol (who of course created the iconic silkscreen portrait of Taylor in 1963). But her closest connection seems to be with the sensitive, nervous Pierre (Maxence Mailfort) who was freaked out by her predatory behaviour on the plane and whom she urgently tracks down. Lise needs a man: not to make love to her, but to murder her, a bizarre thanatotic urge underscored by strident flashforward episodes in which police are shown interrogating everyone involved. Maybe a contemporary audience will not be persuaded by this central conceit, in the way Martin Amis found some female readers unconvinced by his \u201cmurderee\u201d trope in London Fields. But Taylor herself sells it with an authentically mad-seeming performance, a sort of quasi-Blanche DuBois turn from a star who was in 1974 perhaps not entirely reconciled to this phase of her career. Her character never really seems to know who she is talking to or why; and Taylor\u2019s portrayal is hammy but somehow very subtle. The scene in which she is queuing at the airport check-in and seems to be zoning out while the man behind the desk asks her questions is really fascinating. Despite the title, and despite the scene in which she boldly escapes a rape attempt, Lise is not in the driver\u2019s seat; someone or something else is guiding her life and fate. \u2022 The Driver\u2019s Seat (AKA Identikit) is on digital platforms and Blu-Ray from 26 June."}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db54e", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/21/allergic-by-theresa-macphail-review-in-canaries-the-coal-mine", "primaryCategory": "books", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Allergic by Theresa MacPhail review \u2013 in canaries the coal mine", "lead": "Is environmental change behind the mysterious rise in allergies, from asthma to anaphylaxis?", "author": "Katy Guest", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 08:00:07", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.990254", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/861f0257979bb0ca6e7152883f1f0c333a15ac6e/0_71_4074_2443/500.jpg", "body": "Allergic begins with a minute-by-minute account of a man in a car having an allergic reaction to a bee sting. Author Theresa MacPhail is coolly scientific as she describes anaphylaxis progressing through his body, the rising panic of his helpless girlfriend and the firm resignation of the pharmacist who refused to give him adrenaline because the law forbade it. The man in the car was MacPhail\u2019s father, and he died that day. The book continues, describing the science, politics and personal experience of allergies in the same matter-of-fact tone, with the same sense of building to a grimly inevitable conclusion. Allergic people, MacPhail says, are the \u201ccanaries in the environmental change coal mine\u201d; the way we live is making allergies worse. MacPhail, a medical anthropologist, has spent years researching allergies: what they are, why we have them and what, if anything, we can do to avoid them. The task is difficult because of the lack of standardisation of almost everything. The levels of allergens in skin-prick tests vary widely. So do immunotherapy treatments. Experts she spoke to couldn\u2019t even agree what an allergy was. In one study, depending on which definition was used, \u201cup to 39% of children went from having asthma to not having it\u201d. Almost everyone she interviewed agreed that allergies are becoming both more prevalent and more severe, but there\u2019s no agreed-on way to measure them. It seems that some humans have always had allergies. The Egyptian king Menes is thought to have died from an insect sting in around 3000BC. They were defined, medically, in 1819, and the first skin-prick test was developed in 1865, not having improved much in accuracy since. But in our modern, industrialised world, allergies have escalated. Hay fever rates increased first, \u201cthen asthma began to spike in the 1960s and 70s, and then eczema and food allergy rates reared their ugly heads in the 1980s and 90s.\u201d MacPhail attributes this to a complicated combination of genetic, environmental and human-made factors. She explains how pollen and diesel particulates interact to make allergic conditions more likely, and how climate change lengthens pollen seasons and introduces new allergens into our systems. As the world becomes increasingly developed, everything from the crops and trees we grow to the fuels we burn to the chemicals we use and the bacteria and fungi we encounter plays a role in our health. Some of these factors we can do something about: \u201cresearch suggests that less frequent changing of bed linens may be beneficial to the health of our nasal and airway microbiome\u201d. Others are harder to address, such as the worrying finding that \u201ckids who were exposed to the highest level of air pollution early in their life were more likely to develop asthma by age seven\u201d. In a booming market, allergy medicine is big business, and that raises tough questions about how to care for people whose health is damaged by the way we all live now, and who should pay for that care \u2013 especially as experts believe that by 2030 50% of the world\u2019s population will have allergies. MacPhail finds that in the US 52% of adults with life-threatening allergies don\u2019t carry the EpiPens they have been prescribed. \u201cAs an interesting and pertinent aside,\u201d she writes, \u201cwhile researching this book, I learned new information about my father\u2019s death \u2026 His doctor had given him a prescription for an EpiPen \u2026 But [his] insurance would not cover the cost.\u201d There is some good news, mostly in the form of Dupilumab, a new antibody treatment for eczema and maybe more. (\u201cIt was the itch data that blew us away\u201d), boasts the company that makes it. But on the whole, MacPhail is not optimistic. Changing our sheets is one thing. If we really want to prevent allergies ruining more lives, we\u2019re going to have to completely change the way we live. \u2022 Allergic: How Our Immune System Reacts to a Changing World is published by Penguin (\u00a325).

Since the International Organization for Migration launched its missing migrants project in 2014, an estimated 27,000 people trying to reach Europe have been recorded as dead or disappeared while trying to cross the Mediterranean. More than 21,000 of those deaths have occurred on the route from Libya or Tunisia north to Greece or Italy.

His birth opens the 2023 festival in David McNeish\u2019s powerful if static new play, Thora, gives a voice to the mother of the patron saint of Orkney. Magnificently brought to life by Isabella Jarrett, Thora, in her old age, tells her own story including the brutal rape that begat her son, whose own life ended in violence and whose skull is in Kirkwall\u2019s 12th cathedral that bears his name. The St Magnus festival was co-founded by Maxwell Davies, Orcadian poet George Mackay Brown, arts campaigner Marjorie Linklater and Norman Mitchell, music teacher and cathedral organist. Ticket sales have always been split equally between visitors and residents, but the local community was and remains at its heart, and the islands\u2019 rich past is a tangible part of the midsummer festival, which takes in classical, contemporary and traditional music, literature and dance as well as drama. For Maxwell Davies, education was key. Alasdair Nicolson, director since 2010, has broadened that focus to the wider community. \u201cIn the earliest days of this festival music education wasn\u2019t really a thing,\u201d he tells me, \u201cand to go into schools was quite novel. But the landscape has changed \u2013 there is more activity in school education these days. Now every orchestra, theatre and ballet company is out doing work in education all year round. There\u2019s also the issue that it\u2019s no longer straightforward to ask a class to clear their timetables to do a show.\u201d Under Nicolson, the festival has worked with groups including autistic children, undertaken a photography project with Women\u2019s Aid, and most recently there has been a collaboration with Age Scotland Orkney working with dementia patients. Volunteers \u2013 well over 100 of them \u2013 are the welcoming and friendly faces of every festival experience, without whom nothing could function. \u201cThey\u2019re council workers, lawyers, all sorts \u2013 most take a week\u2019s holiday to do this,\u201d says Nicolson. The 90-strong St Magnus Festival Chorus, meanwhile, is an un-auditioned group drawn from the local community. In the austere beauties of the 12th-century St Magnus Cathedral they performed a thoughtful programme that interspersed Orcadian poetry with songs ranging from Gibbons to Whitacre before Faur\u00e9\u2019s Requiem. \u201cI like to mix art forms or programme events where the walls come down a little, so that things don\u2019t feel too stuffy and you\u2019re brought in,\u201d says Nicolson. \u201cFestivals have to be slightly different and magical, otherwise what\u2019s the point if you only do the repertoire that everyone does.\u201d Over eight days, 34 events are spread across 13 venues on Orkney\u2019s mainland as well as the smaller islands of Hoy, South Ronaldsay and Shapinsay. St Nicholas irk in Holm, the south-east corner of the mainland, is a disused church that\u2019s been bought by local people who didn\u2019t want to see it become ruins; housing events gives it new life and might help with accessing funds for renovation. Saturday\u2019s concert with the exciting young Scottish cellist Findlay Spence involved a 30-minute ferry crossing to Hoy (where Maxwell Davies lived for many years), then a recital in the pump room of the fascinating Scapa Flow museum (a finalist for this year\u2019s Museum of the Year) before a minibus ride across the glorious landscape to Hoy Kirk for soup and sandwiches made and served by local people, and a longer recital pairing Britten\u2019s intensely personal Cello Suite No3 with Beamish\u2019s Gala Water and Ukrainian composer Silvestrov\u2019s In Memoriam JS Bach. Spence is an engaging and profoundly musical performer, taking time to introduce each work beforehand. The Dutch Ragazze Quartet, likewise, spoke to their audience at their afternoon recital in Stromness town hall, a programme of Mozart, Widmann and Schubert (a blistering performance of Death and the Maiden). It\u2019s an approach that pays huge dividends, particularly in helping an audience to engage with contemporary music. \u201cYou\u2019re going to hear us make unusual sounds,\u201d warned violinist Jeanita Vriens-van Tongeren ahead of the Widmann, demonstrating the bow on wood sound, the swish of it slicing through the air, and even the scored noise of the quartet\u2019s inhalations and exhalations, all part of his 4th String Quartet. The festival has always positioned emerging artists, says Nicolson, who also cites Dutch pianist Nikola Meeuwsen as among the names to watch. \u201cSometimes I feel like it\u2019s a bit like being a football scout. Come to my world before I can\u2019t afford you!\u201d he laughs. Previous performers who came at the beginning of their now stellar careers have included Sean Shibe, Pavel Kolesnikov and Samson Tsoy, and a teenage Nicola Benedetti. Contemporary music is less of a presence than it was in Maxwell Davies\u2019s day; this year\u2019s festival features only a single premiere, from the Scottish composer P\u00e0druig Morrison. \u201cMax\u2019s music comes and goes from the programming when it\u2019s appropriate,\u201d says Nicolson. \u201cI want to do things that aren\u2019t just a token throw in; things that aren\u2019t done very often, such as the Medium that was performed last year, a 50-minute unaccompanied monodrama for soprano. It\u2019s an extraordinary and fascinating piece but very rarely done.\u201d But Max\u2019s love of and honouring of his community is evident in every corner of the festival. Each performer is booked for two or three events, there are chamber music collaborations, and the Faur\u00e9 Requiem\u2019s scratch orchestra included Hebrides Ensemble musicians alongside Spence and Friend on cello. \u201cThere\u2019s no point coming here just to do one thing. Blowing in and out doesn\u2019t work \u2013 financially! Performers get all that, and they live and play here for these two or three days alongside their audience. That\u2019s the joy of the thing. Everyone is part of the community,\u201d says Nicolson. \u2022 St Magnus festival continues until 23 June. Highlights from the festival will be broadcast on BBC Radio 3 from 4-7 July and then on demand on BBC Sounds."}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db551", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/21/football-transfer-rumours-tottenham-to-sign-galatasaray-defender", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Football transfer rumours: Tottenham to sign Galatasaray defender Nelsson?

Davinson S\u00e1nchez is rumoured to want out and Cl\u00e9ment Lenglet\u2019s future is uncertain, with the centre-back not knowing whether or not he is heading back to Barcelona. One name emerging as a potential arrival in north London is Galatasaray\u2019s Victor Nelsson, who would cost in the region of \u00a322m after a couple of great seasons in Turkey. The Danish international finished the season with the Turkish title and would be keen on making the step up to the Premier League. Speaking of the Super Lig champions, Galatasaray have enquired about the Chelsea striker David Datro Fofana to see if there is something to be done there. They had a look at the Ivorian in January but a deal could not be done, so they are back again. When Manchester United beat rivals City to the signing of Fred five years ago, the fans must have thought they had acquired a man who would one day have a statue outside Old Trafford. Half a decade on, the midfielder has expressed a desire to be a more important figure after becoming a bit-part player under Erik ten Hag and his predecessors. Fulham are monitoring the Brazilian in the hope of luring him to London with the vague promise of more time on the pitch. Another potential Craven Cottage target is the Norwich right-back Max Aarons, who has been linked with an exit from Carrow Road ever since he played his first game for the club. Could this be the year? With the possibility Jordan Pickford is off to Manchester United, Everton need to come up with a cunning plan to replace him. The most natural thing to do at this stage would be to find another English goalkeeper, therefore Sean Dyche has his eyes on Crystal Palace\u2019s Sam Johnstone. Crysencio Summerville may not fancy life in the Championship with Leeds and Everton and Feyenoord are willing to offer him top-flight football. Ellis Simms could be on his way out of Goodison Park with three clubs supposedly interested in the striker who struggled to make an impact during the later stages of the season. Ipswich and Sunderland are thought to be keen on him. Despite relegation, James Maddison is still a Leicester player. One reason for this is that they want a whopping fee in excess of \u00a350m for the England midfielder. The question is whether Tottenham and Newcastle are willing to go that high. Nottingham Forest, Newcastle, Fulham and West Ham have, according to reports, stuck the Brazilian Pablo Maia on their list of targets, but they could miss out with Napoli desperately keen to land the S\u00e3o Paulo man. After falling short in the title race, Arsenal are aiming to make some marginal gains. These mainly involve allowing Thomas Partey and Granit Xhaka to leave and replacing them with better players. Most notably, and this rumour might not yet have been covered in these pages, Declan Rice and Southampton\u2019s Rom\u00e9o Lavia. Nicol\u00f2 Barella may not be swapping Inter for Newcastle after all. Do not worry, north-east-based lovers of Italian midfielders, Eddie Howe could be teaming up with Milan\u2019s Sandro Tonali after bidding a whopping \u20ac60m or \u20ac50m, depending on who you believe, for the Italy international. One likely arrival at St James\u2019 Park is Derry Scherhant from Hertha Berlin. The German is a mere 20 years old and the Champions League club think he could be a smart bit of business in the long-term."}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db552", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/21/afternoon-update-cause-for-hope-in-titanic-sub-rescue-kfc-hikes-prices-by-up-to-25-and-taylor-swift-tour-info", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Afternoon Update: \u2018Cause for hope\u2019 in Titanic sub search; KFC hikes prices by up to 25%; and Taylor Swift tour info", "lead": "US media reports cite government memos saying aircraft detected banging sound at 30-minute intervals", "author": "Antoun Issa", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 07:04:14", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.990327", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/c9f8f8e53946228332638d5631252f1e538063a6/0_0_1600_960/500.jpg", "body": "Good afternoon.

Swift will perform at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Friday 16 and Saturday 17 February 2024. She will then travel to Sydney for three shows at Accor Stadium Friday 23, Saturday 24 and Sunday 25 February. General ticket sales will go live on Friday 30 June, 10am local time for Sydney and 2pm local time for Melbourne. Deaths in custody reporting upgrade | State and federal governments will be held more accountable for their criminal justice systems with the launch of a real-time reporting dashboard of deaths in custody. Since the royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody released its report in 1991, there have been more than 540 First Nations deaths in custody. Victoria criticised for MP pay rise | The premier, Daniel Andrews, has defended a 3.5% pay rise for Victorian MPs \u2013 0.5% more than other state public sector workers \u2013 amid criticism from the Greens and Liberals. Andrews is the highest-paid premier in the country, earning about $480,000 a year. RBA wants more unemployment | The Reserve Bank\u2019s deputy governor, Michelle Bullock, made clear at a speech in Newcastle that the RBA wants more people to lose their jobs in order to bring inflation under control. \u201cOur goal is to return the labour market (and the market for goods and services) back to a level consistent with full employment \u2013 something like the endpoint in our forecasts\u201d. The desired target is an unemployment rate of 4.5% by 2025, which the Australia Institute says would leave an extra 140,000 people without work. Deadly Honduras prison riot | At least 41 women have been killed after an outbreak of violence between gangs at a prison in Honduras. Some of the victims had been shot to death and at least seven female inmates were being treated at a hospital for gunshot and knife wounds. Iceland suspends whale hunt | The annual hunt has been suspended until the end of August, with the government citing animal welfare concerns. The decision is likely to bring the controversial practice to an end. Iceland, Norway and Japan are the only countries that have continued whale hunting in the face of fierce criticism from environmentalists and animal rights defenders.

I have never been in a relationship, kissed anyone or even held someone\u2019s hand in a romantic way. It has never happened for me. I feel so much shame about this, as if I have done something wrong. When people ask me why I have never had sex, I usually reply that no one has ever expressed any interest. But I hate the fact that people can sometimes tell I am a virgin without me saying so, and wonder what it is that gives it away. The only sexual experiences I have had, I didn\u2019t consent to. The first time a boy saw me naked was without my consent; I have been groped in nightclubs; men have asked me for sexual favours and told me that they thought of me while masturbating. But no one has ever initiated any consensual intimacy and I suppose I have been so scared of doing it wrong that I haven\u2019t either.

You do not have to reveal anything about your virginity to anyone, ever. At 25, you are still extremely young, and many people will think you are simply discerning and focused on other things. In any case, it is none of their business. But do ask yourself, are you interested in sex, or are you just acting out what you believe is expected, conventional behaviour?

You have a right to be who you are \u2013 even if that is someone who simply does not wish to be sexual with anyone, ever. Above all, don\u2019t let peer pressure push you into doing something you don\u2019t want to do. There is no rule that says you have to lose your virginity. Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.

After all, it\u2019s 30 years (for them, four for us) since lady superhero Carol Danvers\u2019 time in the Marvel Cinematic Universe was deemed to have come. Well, wonder no more, my friends. The ninth/10th/ 11th/12th-ish television show in the MCU, depending on how you count these things, has arrived on Disney+ to explain everything. Or most things. Or some things and then shapeshift away into a variety of other possible answers, too. You know what they\u2019re like. Anyway. The new six-part series, Secret Invasion, has a grizzled Samuel L Jackson return as present-day Nick Fury, who is summoned back from his recuperative stint at Saber \u2013 an intergalactic space headquarters to you, a virtual spa for the head of Shield \u2013 to deal with growing unrest among said Skrulls. Talos (Ben Mendelsohn, whose strange growl of a voice should get separate billing) regretfully informs him that his fellow Skrulls are fed up waiting. Some of them settled on Earth after Fury promised them that, in return for helping him keep the peace on our little blue marble, he would help them find a habitable planet of their own. Led by a charismatic, ruthless figure named Gravik (Kingsley Ben-Adir), they have decided that Earth will do fine as that habitable planet and are about to embark on a brutal campaign to make it so. Game of Thrones\u2019 Emilia Clarke plays G\u2019iah, a Skrull agent with a secret. For those whose overwhelming sensation when watching any MCU instalment is the urge to shout \u201cSettle! Settle!\u201d at the frenetic screen, Secret Invasion is a fine case of needing to be careful what you wish for. Yes, there are some glorious scenes between Olivia Colman, as the professionally sociopathic MI6 agent Sonya Falsworth, and Samuel L Jackson, reminding us that brilliant actors elevate basic material and each other in ways that are always worth watching. And yes, there are some well-executed, if visually uninspiring, set pieces here and there. The first episode centres on a dirty bomb detonated in Moscow by the Skrull resistance/terrorists/freedom fighters, posing as Americans and implicating Fury and his deputy, Maria Hill, in the hope that Russia retaliates and the resulting war destroys us humans and leaves the place free (and in tip-top shape for the radiation-immune Skrulls) for new tenants. But, because the Skrulls have infiltrated the highest levels of global government, the rest is firmly set in conspiracy and political thriller territory that is \u2026 not very thrilling. There are car chases through dark streets, people chasing after backpacks or being bundled into vans, scenes entirely composed of exposition \u2013 usually about the Skrulls\u2019 resentment of Fury, or the aliens\u2019 plans to take over the Earth by (I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve heard?) kicking off a war between the US and Russia to leave the path clear for the Skrull takeover because (I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve heard?) they are furious at Fury for not fulfilling his promise after 30 years of waiting. The script is no more than serviceable. After the admittedly unexpected killing of one character, the deceased\u2019s mother (Juliet Stevenson, in what looks to be a role so small it reminds you of Brando turning up to do his 10 seconds as Jor-El in the original Superman) tells Fury that they \u201cbelieved in you \u2026 Don\u2019t let their death be for nothing.\u201d There is plenty more stirring stuff where that came from. Perhaps by putting away childish, crashy-bangy CGI things, Secret Invasion is declaring its intention to be a darker MCU show, concentrating on ambiguity rather than heroes and villains. It poses the question of what happens if humans and aliens are alike under the skin, but not just in the happy, wholesome ways we are always promised. Unfortunately, it needs deeper thought and better writing than this. That said, I did enjoy Talos \u2013 entering his 40s \u2013 musing on going on a midlife-crisis shopping spree and asking Fury what he got for his 40th. \u201cThe Avengers,\u201d comes the reply. The Avengers, by the way, aren\u2019t going to be coming to Fury\u2019s aid as would seem obvious, because there is too much danger of the shapeshifters mimicking them and becoming supervillains. OK, then. I hope you\u2019re utterly satisfied with that. Only two episodes were available for review, so it\u2019s possible that there are far more and better-paced twists and turns to come in the second two-thirds than there were in the first. But it\u2019s been a hell of a lot of throat-clearing if so.

Let\u2019s start with a famous groundshare from the 1980s: \u201cCharlton Athletic moved from The Valley after a 2-0 win over Stoke on 21 September 1985 \u2013 Rob Lee scored the winning goal \u2013 and returned after more than seven years\u2019 exile at Selhurst Park and Upton Park,\u201d writes Michael Haughey. \u201cThey celebrated their return to The Valley with a 1-0 win over Portsmouth on 5 December 1992.\u201d It\u2019s a while since the Luftwaffe were last mentioned in the Knowledge, but this question is right up their street. \u201cDespite being requisitioned by the military and being a bit bombed by the Luftwaffe, Old Trafford was still used by Manchester United (on and off) until 8 March 1941, when they beat Bury 7-3 in a War League game,\u201d notes Jim Hearson. \u201cThree days later, the bombers came back and pretty much finished the job, causing United to share with City for a while. I say a while, their first game back was on 24 August 1949, some 428 weeks after their last.\u201d Duncan Richer has tweeted about England, who had a gap of nine years and three days between competitive matches at Wembley from 1938 to 1947*. This one needs the asterisk, as England played internationals at Wembley throughout the war. But they were all unofficial games, either War-Time or Victory Internationals. England went six years and seven months between internationals at Wembley while the new stadium was being built between 2000 and 2007. It was six years and 11 months between competitive games. John Brewin checks in: \u201cJuventus and Torino started to play in the new-build Stadio Delle Alpi in May 1990. They then returned to their previous Stadio Communale, now called the Stadio Olimpico (after the Turin Winter Olympics of that year) in 2006, while the Juventus Stadium was built on the site of the unloved Delle Alpi and opened in 2011. Torino stayed on in the Olimpico. \u201cThat first May 1990 game at the cavernous Delle Alpi was when a joint Juve-Torino team defeated Porto 4\u20133. The first competitive game back at the old Communale saw Torino, up in Serie A, draw 1-1 with Parma on 10 September 2006. The next week, Juve, relegated to Serie B after the Calciopoli scandal, beat Piacenza 2-1, David Trezeguet and Alessandro del Piero getting the goals. So that\u2019s 16 years and four months.\u201d Next, to Colombes in France. But the best answer we have received so far comes from west London. \u201cQueens Park Rangers went more than 29 years between home games at White City Stadium,\u201d writes Alun Thomas. \u201cThey ended the 1932-33 season with a home game against Torquay on 6 May, and finally returned against Notts County on 6 October 1962. They also had a 19-year gap between using the stadium in 1912 and the start of the 1931-32 season.\u201d You wonder to yourself \u2026 \u201cWhich player has played for the most clubs in places name-checked in Panic by the Smiths?\u201d tweets Kris Foster. Panic was released in the summer of 1986, reaching No 11 on the hit parade. It\u2019s best known for the repeated lyric \u201cHang the DJ\u201d \u2013 later co-opted by Manchester United fans to extol the great Eric Djemba-Djemba \u2013 but at the start of the song Morrissey lists a number of places where there is panic on the streets \u2013 London, Birmingham, Carlisle, Dublin, Dundee and Humberside \u2013 with Leeds and Grasmere mentioned in slightly different context. He also cites \u201cprovincial towns that you jog round\u201d, an ostensibly meaningless aside that will make more sense when (or if) you read the next paragraph. \u201cThe best I could find was Nick Barmby,\u201d writes Nick Williamson. \u201cHe played for Hull (Humberside), Leeds, Spurs (London) and Middlesbrough (a provincial town).\u201d We\u2019re going to be really boring and disqualify Middlesbrough, which puts Barmby on three clubs, but Hannah Williamson can go one better. \u201cSome that manage to reach four clubs are Jermaine Beckford (began his senior career at Wealdstone in London, before moving to Leeds, as well as spending time on loan at Carlisle and Scunthorpe in Humberside); Robert Snodgrass (had a four-year spell at Leeds and a three-year spell on Humberside with Hull before moving to West Ham in London, while also spending time on loan at Aston Villa in Birmingham); and Marlon King (began his career in London with Barnet, later had loan spells with Leeds and Hull, as well as a spell with Birmingham later in his career). \u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019s someone who\u2019s managed to hit five or more,\u201d continues Hannah, \u201cbut I\u2019ve already put too much time into researching this so hopefully someone other than me can find a better answer.\u201d That\u2019s what Team Knowledge is here for. It\u2019s maybe not entirely in the spirit of the question, but Scott Parker played for five London clubs: Charlton, Chelsea, West Ham, Spurs and Fulham. And that particular loophole can only lead us to one man. \u201cClive Allen has to be in with a shout,\u201d tweets MSJM. \u201cSeven different London teams and Carlisle United.\u201d Those London clubs, since you asked so politely, were QPR, Arsenal (Allen did play for them during his 62-day stay, though only in friendlies), Crystal Palace, Spurs, Chelsea, West Ham and Millwall. Oh, and the London Monarchs American football team, but they don\u2019t count. So, Clive Allen has a Panic score of eight. If you can beat it, you know what to do. Dida\u2019s diverse delights \u201cAfter adding a treble with Manchester City to the World Cup with Argentina, J\u00falian \u00c1lvarez has now won 12 trophies \u2013 each in a different tournament \u2013 at the age of 23,\u201d writes Niall McVeigh. \u201cAre there any other players with such a diverse honours list?\u201d No surprise that the best answer to this question is another South American player who collected multiple honours at home and then moved to Europe. \u201cAlthough not as quickly as \u00c1lvarez, the former Brazilian goalkeeper Dida collected an impressive and diverse trophy cabinet by the age of 30,\u201d writes Dirk Maas. Here\u2019s the full list: Copa de Oro 1995 Copa do Brasil 1996 and 2002 Copa Libertadores: 1997 Fifa Confederations Cup: 1997 Copa Am\u00e9rica: 1999 Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A: 1999 Fifa Club World Cup: 2000 Torneio Rio-S\u00e3o Paulo: 2002 Fifa World Cup: 2002 Uefa Champions League: 2003 Coppa Italia: 2003 Uefa Super Cup: 2003 Serie A: 2004 Supercoppa Italiana: 2004 Foreign cup triumphs (2) In last week\u2019s Knowledge we looked at teams winning competitions in other countries or regions. And we forgot a biggie. \u201cYou missed Cardiff being the only non-English side to win the English FA Cup, in 1927,\u201d writes Neil Smith. \u201cWhen I was young I admired an oil painting in Cardiff Central Library of the ball slipping off the Arsenal goalie\u2019s new shirt and into the net, the only goal of the match. Ever since then the Arsenal goalie has worn a used jersey. My grandfather was in attendance.\u201d \u201cMexican teams competed with some degree of success in the South American club competitions for 16 years from 2000,\u201d adds Duncan Kesseler. \u201cMany reached finals, but the only winner was Pachuca, who defeated Colo Colo 3-2 on aggregate in the final of the 2006 Copa Sudamericana (the South American Europa League \u2026).\u201d And finally \u2026 Knowledge archive \u201cHave Scotland ever been higher than England in the Fifa rankings and if not what\u2019s the closest the two nations have come?\u201d wondered Colin Young in 2007. The answer was yes, Colin. Scotland\u2019s sole month when they were ahead of their old rivals came in June 1995, when they ranked 21st with England 22nd. At the time of writing, Scotland are enjoying their highest ranking (13th), a far cry from their hapless form of 2005, when they plunged to a record low of 88th. England\u2019s best effort is a respectable fourth, which they achieved as recently as 2006, while their worst performance sent them dropping to 27th in 1996. [Note: Scotland haven\u2019t been above England since this question was asked 16 years ago, though they came very close in the summer of 2008.] Can you help? \u201cScotland\u2019s comeback against Norway was the first time since 1889 they had won a game after trailing with 10 minutes to go. Surely that 134-year gap is a record,\u201d ponders Stevy Toal. \u201cIt amazes me that elite footballers are still regularly seen chewing gum during matches,\u201d writes Gregg Bakowski. \u201cIsn\u2019t it a choking hazard? Or is there a psychological or physiological benefit to it that I\u2019ve clearly missed?\u201d \u201cWatching the Croatia-Spain Nations League final, it was brought to my attention that Luka Modric has never missed a penalty in a shootout,\u201d notes James Sutherland. \u201cAre there any other players with similarly unblemished records (perhaps minimum three shootouts) and who is the \u2018anti-Modric\u2019 with the worst record?\u201d \u201cWhen was the last recorded instance of an orange ball being used for an English top-flight game when it wasn\u2019t (and hadn\u2019t been) snowing?\u201d asks Chris Oakley. \u201cOrange balls were commonly used in the early 1970s, but I wonder when we finally saw them replaced by the more traditional white alternative?\u201d \u201cWith the last of this season\u2019s Euro 2024 qualifiers taking place on 20 June, and the first games of the Champions League preliminary round scheduled for 27 June, does that make this the shortest close-season in Europe? If so, what\u2019s the next shortest? And, related: which European-based player(s) will have the shortest time between their last game of 2022-23 and first of 2023-24?\u201d wonders Derek Robertson.

Members of Brazil\u2019s superior electoral court will gather on Thursday to consider the first of 16 cases being brought against the far-right former president, who failed to win a second term after losing last October\u2019s election to leftist Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva. If an absolute majority of the court\u2019s seven judges find Bolsonaro guilty of misusing his presidential powers in order to boost his re-election campaign, he could be barred from seeking office for eight years. That would rule Bolsonaro out of Brazil\u2019s next general election, in 2026, and mean the Donald Trump-emulating radical, now 68, would be 75 by the time he could seek the presidency again, in 2030. He would also miss municipal elections in 2024 and 2028. \u201cThe signs aren\u2019t good but I\u2019m relaxed,\u201d Bolsonaro told supporters last weekend as his backers braced for the judgment. Political observers believe a guilty verdict is assured but likely to be delayed, possibly until September, if a judge asks for more time to consider evidence. The case relates to Bolsonaro\u2019s decision to summon dozens of foreign diplomats to his residence before last year\u2019s election to make unfounded claims against Brazil\u2019s electronic voting system. But judges will also consider more recent events surrounding the 8 January 2023 riots in Bras\u00edlia, including the police discovery of a blueprint for a military takeover at the home of Bolsonaro\u2019s former justice minister. Last week it emerged that police had found documents outlining plans for a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat on the mobile phone of one of Bolsonaro\u2019s closest aides, Lt Col Mauro Cid Barbosa, who was arrested last month. \u201cBolsonaro must be removed from the political arena because he broke the rules of the political area \u2013 he tried to destroy the political arena,\u201d said Bruno Boghossian, a columnist for the Folha de S.Paulo newspaper. \u201cSomeone who tries to stay in power after losing an election shouldn\u2019t be competing in an election. They aren\u2019t following the rules of the game \u2026 so they should be removed from the game,\u201d Boghossian added. Bolsonaro\u2019s anticipated banishment will be celebrated by millions of detractors who were horrified by the onslaught against democracy, the environment and the arts that unfolded during his 2019-2023 presidency. But some fear the decision could strengthen the former president, allowing him, like Trump or Boris Johnson, to pose as a political martyr being persecuted by a witch-hunt or kangaroo court. Others believe Bolsonaro\u2019s sidelining could help the right. Thomas Traumann, a Brazilian journalist and political expert, said he suspected some Lula allies would have preferred to face a profoundly polarising candidate such as Bolsonaro in the 2026 election, just as some within the UK\u2019s Labour party would rather have faced Johnson than Rishi Sunak. \u201cThey\u2019ll never admit this, but it\u2019s obviously \u2026 much better to face an opponent like [Bolsonaro] than an opponent who is able to move between the far right and the centre,\u201d Traumann said. Should Bolsonaro be stripped of his political rights, the person widely tipped to fill his shoes is Tarc\u00edsio de Freitas, the 48-year-old governor of S\u00e3o Paulo and Bolsonaro\u2019s former infrastructure minister. \u201cTarc\u00edsio won\u2019t create the same excitement \u2026 or the same spectacles [as Bolsonaro],\u201d Traumann predicted. But Freitas could prove a greater threat to Lula\u2019s left by attracting moderate conservatives and centrists turned off by Bolsonaro\u2019s extremism. The swiftness with which electoral authorities have moved against Bolsonaro contrasts with sluggish efforts to hold his ally Trump accountable for his alleged role in inciting the 6 January riots. Boghossian said he thought Brazil\u2019s centralised and independent electoral authority gave it an advantage over the US\u2019s decentralised system. He said he also believed senior members of Brazil\u2019s judiciary had decided to act quickly to signal that Bolsonaro\u2019s anti-democratic behaviour was intolerable and needed punishing. Traumann also attributed the swift response to the ferocity with which Bolsonaro targeted supreme court judges, whom he called bastards, scoundrels and imbeciles. \u201cHe made this a personal matter,\u201d Traumann said."}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db557", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/21/ukraine-vladimir-putin-russia-rebuild-pay", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Who will pay to rebuild Ukraine after all this death and destruction?

But when the war is over, the big question will be who will pay for its consequences? Who will pay for the reconstruction of Ukraine? Today an international Ukraine recovery conference begins in London. This is how we see it. There is not a snowball\u2019s chance in hell that Putin\u2019s Russia will pay Ukraine reparations for the destruction. According to the World Bank, $411bn (\u00a3320bn) is needed to rebuild Ukraine. That far exceeds our country\u2019s GDP in 2022, and that isn\u2019t the final amount. Russia has already killed or injured over 22,000 Ukrainian civilians, destroyed and damaged 1,500 hospitals, hit 10% of our education infrastructure and 50% of our energy infrastructure; 2.4 million people have had their homes damaged or completely destroyed. Because of the Russian army\u2019s actions, about 30% of Ukraine\u2019s territory may be contaminated with mines and shells. That is an area roughly the size of Great Britain. The scale of destruction is unlike anything Europe has seen since the second world war. For the first time in history, we have the chance to put into effect the principle of just retribution, whereby the aggressor finances the reconstruction of what has been destroyed. We must seize this opportunity and create a new beacon of hope for Ukraine and for other states that could potentially become victims of aggression. After the large-scale Russian invasion, more than $300bn in foreign exchange reserves held by the Russian central bank were frozen in the west. Searches for and seizures of Russians\u2019 private assets continue. The international taskforce dealing with the seizure of assets of sanctioned individuals and companies had found $58bn in Russian funds by March this year. Detecting and blocking is only half the battle. Russia\u2019s assets should work for Ukraine. Under no circumstances should they be allowed to return to the Russian Federation. This would mean the defeat of the free world and maximum injustice to Ukraine: Russia will use these resources for new wars and our country will be in ruins. Russia\u2019s money should become a major source of recovery. It should not be funded by Ukrainians, partner state taxpayers or international financial organisations. Russia must pay. That would be logical, fair and just. In November 2022, the general assembly of the UN adopted a historic resolution on the creation of an international mechanism to ensure Ukraine is compensated for its losses. The first practical step was taken at the summit of Council of Europe member states in Reykjav\u00edk, where a register of damage was launched. A digital record of the destruction caused by Russian aggression is the first element of the international compensation mechanism. In this way, we will carefully record and verify all losses in order to hold Russia accountable. There are four more important steps ahead. First, an international commission to determine the amount of compensation to be paid to victims on the basis of the data in the register must be established. Second, partner states must amend their legislation to allow the diversion of \u201cfrozen\u201d Russian assets to Ukraine. Third, a compensation fund in which the money will be collected must be set up. Finally, the practical implementation of confiscations and payments for reconstruction will be needed. We are aware that we are pioneers. So far, no one has done anything similar. We understand the fears of our partners, but Russia\u2019s criminal actions are so unprecedented that fundamentally new, courageous decisions are needed. These decisions will be important not only for Ukraine, but for the whole world. We propose to create a universal system whereby the internationally recognised aggressor and perpetrator of war pays for its crimes. This will be a fully legitimate mechanism based on the relevant international agreement. Today the ball is in our partners\u2019 and allies\u2019 court. It depends on them how quickly we move from an idea to its implementation. We call on our partners, especially from the US, the UK, the EU and Canada, to show leadership and take practical steps to seize relevant assets for the reconstruction of Ukraine. On Monday, the UK government unveiled new legislation that would maintain the imposition of sanctions on Russia until and unless Putin pays adequate compensation to Ukraine. In that way, frozen Russian assets can be donated to Ukrainian reconstruction. That is a start. And Ukraine is leading by example. At the start of a full-scale war, we took decisive steps to seize Russian assets. So far, the assets of some 6,800 individuals and legal entities linked in one way or another to the aggressor state have been frozen, with some of them already confiscated. Every Russian state dollar found and confiscated relieves the budgets of partner states. Instead, it increases our ability to rebuild the economy and infrastructure on the principle of \u201cbuild back better\u201d. The seizure of Russian assets is in the national interest of states seeking lasting peace and global prosperity in a world in which autocratic regimes are afraid to attack their neighbours. For they will know that they will be forced to pay for everything. Denys Shmyhal is the prime minister of Ukraine Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

You can follow the latest developments on our new live blog: Robotic vehicles and deep sea tourism \u201cThere are significant risks associated with deploying vehicles at these depths,\u201d Prof Stefan Williams, University of Sydney director digital sciences initiative, tells the Guardian of the missing submersible. It is relatively recently that robotic vehicles have been considered and used for deep sea tourism. Williams points to the 1970s as the start of \u201cthese sorts of vehicles\u201d being used to support scientific research. \u201cThey have made some important contributions to our understanding of the deep sea.\u201d Uncrewed robotic vehicles are used routinely for supporting deep sea research as well as in the offshore industry, with a relatively limited number of crewed vessels used for scientific research, Williams says. Crewed vessels allows experiencing environments firsthand, but the pressured involved limits viewpoints \u2013 crewed vessels have to rely on cameras and sensors to survey the environment. Even though advances in communication systems, navigation instruments, engineering design tools and new materials have contributed to innovation in the design of these platforms, Williams says operating in depths of 4000m and beyond remains a challenge \u2013 especially if the expedition is for tourism: The move into deep sea tourism may introduce new risks. There may be more commercial pressure to be turning the vehicles around quickly in preparation for dives and new designs need extensive testing to ensure that they are meeting their design specifications and performance requirements. Here\u2019s a recap of today\u2019s developments: Underwater noises have been detected by a Canadian aircraft in the search area for the missing submersible, according to the US Coast Guard. Searches yielded negative results but will continue. The data has been shared with the US Navy experts for further analysis, the Coast Guard said. Search crews have heard banging sounds at 30-minute intervals, according to US media. CNN and Rolling Stone cited internal government memos saying banging had been detected, and reported that after additional devices were deployed four hours later, noises were still heard. The memos did not clarify when on Tuesday the banging was heard, or for how long. The Explorers Club, of which two passengers in the missing sub are members, says there is \u201ccause for hope\u201d based on field data, asserting that \u201clikely signs of life have been detected at the site\u201d. The submersible\u2019s hatch appears to be bolted from the outside. So even if the sub has surfaced and is spotted by search operations, the danger is not over, as the crew inside would still need to rely on emergency oxygen to breathe until the hatch is opened by rescue teams. The Titan crew is estimated to be down to about 30 hours of breathable air. Ten hours ago, Coast Guard officials said the crew of the missing submersible had about 40 hours of breathable air left. So far, more than 25,900 square kilometres of sea has been searched by aircraft for the missing vessel \u2013 part of a unified command of aircraft and ships of the US Coast Guard, US Navy, Canadian Coast Guard and OceanGate Expedition. What is being done to find Titan? US Coast Guard captain Jamie Frederick has told reporters that US and Canadian aircraft have searched more than 25,900 square kilometres of sea for the submersible vessel Titan \u2013 which was carrying five people when it went missing during a voyage to the Titanic shipwreck on Sunday. The Titanic shipwreck lies 1,450 km east of Cape Cod, Massachusetts, and 644 km south of St. John\u2019s, Newfoundland. Canada\u2019s Polar Prince ship has been conducting surface searches alongside a Canadian Boeing P-8 Poseidon reconnaissance aircraft, Associated Press reports. The Canadian military has dropped sonar buoys to listen for any possible sounds from the Titan. An underwater robot is also searching in the vicinity of the Titanic. Two US Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft have been conducting overflights. To aid the search, three C-17s from US Air Mobility Command have moved another commercial company\u2019s submersible and support equipment from Buffalo to St. John\u2019s. A Royal Canadian Navy ship carrying a medical team specialising in dive medicine and a six-person mobile hyperbaric recompression chamber was also en route today. The New York based Explorers Club has told the Guardian that they are \u201cwaiting for updates from the Coast Guard\u201d before commenting further on reports that noises were detected in the search area. In an earlier statement, the club said that there was cause for hope: \u201cBased on data from the field \u2013 we understand that likely signs of life have been detected at the site,\u201d the club\u2019s president, Richard Garriott de Cayeux, said in a statement released late on Tuesday. Billionaire Hamish Harding and dive expert Paul-Henri Nargeolet who are among the missing passengers on the Titan submersible are both members of the Explorers Club. The underwater noises detected by a Canadian aircraft have been shared with US Navy experts for analysis, US Coast Guard\u2019s Northeast District tweets: Underwater noises have been detected by a Canadian aircraft in the search area for the missing submersible, the US Coast Guard\u2019s Northeast District has announced. Searches yielded negative results but will continue. Hope that the missing submersible will be found on the ocean\u2019s surface decreases with each passing day, Prof Stefan Williams, University of Sydney director digital sciences initiative, tells the Guardian. The best case scenario is that the sub has had a malfunction of its communication and tracking equipment and has made its way back to the surface, he says. If it is floating on the surface, and the aerial survey and ships in the vicinity can find it in the next day or so, then they would seek to open the sub and free the crew. However, Williams says this outcome is not guaranteed. Given that it is now well beyond the sub\u2019s intended dive time and that searches have been underway for several days, this scenario is looking increasingly unlikely. There is still some hope that the submersible will be found on the surface, but it decreases with each passing day. A lack of evidence of the sub on the surface means it is possible that it has suffered a catastrophic failure of one of its systems, Williams says. \u201cThis might include the complete failure of the pressure vessel housing the crew or potentially some other failure of the submersible\u2019s systems which has prevented them from surfacing.\u201d Extreme medicine expert Dr Glenn Singleman told the Guardian about the challenges of submarine expeditions: All of these extreme environments have incredible risk. The pressure down at the Titanic is like having a car standing on your wrist, or something like that. Singleman has been the expedition physician on several deep-sea exploration projects, including for James Cameron\u2019s Last Mysteries of the Titanic live documentary in 2005, Cameron\u2019s Deepsea Challenger expedition to reach the deepest-known point on Earth in 2012, and Victor Vescovo\u2019s Five Deeps expedition. Singleman said the closed-loop environment inside a deep-sea submarine posed specific technical challenges: You\u2019ve got to control your oxygen flow and you\u2019ve got to remove carbon dioxide and you\u2019ve got to remove water vapour. They\u2019re the three things about the environment internally that you\u2019ve got to control. The fourth thing is temperature \u2026 the water temperature down there is 0 to 1C. All submarines and submersibles have to do that \u2026 The difference is the pressure of the water around. Most navy submarines can go to about 900m maximum before they run the risk of imploding, but these [deep-sea] vehicles are going 4, 5, 6km. Singleman has previously visited the Titanic wreck, on a vessel built and operated by the Russian Academy of Sciences: When I went down to the Titanic myself I was visitor 428 on that particular vehicle. That\u2019s a signal of how reliable and how safe, how tested that particular program was \u2026 unfortunately [it] is no longer in operation. A visual depiction of the search patterns used during the rescue operation for the missing submersible Titan has been made available by the US Coast Guard. As of Tuesday morning, a total of 10,000 square miles have been searched, and the US Coast Guard, US Navy, Canadian Coast Guard and OceanGate Expeditions have established a unified command to continue its search and rescue response. US media is reporting that search crews have heard banging sounds at 30-minute intervals. Rolling Stone were first to report the news on Tuesday night, followed by CNN. Both cited internal government memos, and reported that after additional sonar devices were deployed four hours later, banging was still heard. The Guardian has not been able to confirm the reports. The memo does not clarify when on Tuesday the banging was heard, or for how long. A later update, cited by CNN, sent that night described more sounds: Additional acoustic feedback was heard and will assist in vectoring surface assets and also indicating continued hope of survivors. On Tuesday, the New York Times published a letter written in 2018 by industry leaders in the submersible vessel field, warning Stockton Rush of possible \u201ccatastrophic\u201d problems with Titan\u2019s development. Rush is creator of Titan, CEO of OceanGate, and one of the five people on the missing vessel. The Marine Technology Society \u2013 an industry group made up of \u201cocean engineers, technologists, policymakers, and educators\u201d \u2013 expressed \u201cconcern regarding the development of Titan and the planned Titanic Expeditions\u201d. They warned against the \u201ccurrent experimental approach adopted by OceanGate.\u201d At issue was whether or not the Titan vessel would be independently assessed by industry regulators or risk assessors. Almost a year after the letter was sent, OceanGate published a blog post explaining why it would not have Titan certified. In the post, the company acknowledges that classing assures \u201cvessels are designed, constructed and inspected to accepted standards,\u201d but do little to \u201cweed out subpar vessel operators\u201d. The company was also concerned that the classing process could slow down development and act as a drag on innovation. Read the full story from Jonathan Yerushalmy here: What is the Explorers Club? The Explorers Club is a multidisciplinary professional society that works to promote scientific exploration and field study. The club was founded in New York City in 1904, and is now international. Its chapters host lectures and seminars, award field-research grants to students, publish newsletters and organise expeditions, field trips and educational events. The club celebrates five notable times its members completed a \u201cfamous first\u201d achievement \u2013 including Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin\u2019s landing on the surface of the moon in 1969. Richard Garriott, president of Explorers Club, has issued a hopeful statement on the Titan sub search and rescue mission: There is cause for hope, based on data from the field \u2013 we understand that likely signs of life have been detected at the site. We believe [the US Coast Guard] are doing everything possible with all resources they have Passenger on the missing Titan sub Hamish Harding was a founding member of the Board of Trustees of the Explorers Club. In a statement released on June 19, Garriott said \u201cwhen I saw Hamish last week \u2026 his excitement about this expedition was palpable. I know he was looking forward to conducting research at the site\u201d. The Explorers Club is a multidisciplinary society based in New York dedicated to field research, scientific exploration and resource conservation. The Guardian cannot verify the Explorers Club\u2019s claim. Paul-Henri Nargeolet, one of the five people on board the missing Titan submersible vessel, has been described as a \u201clegend\u201d in the submersible community and \u201cone of the leading experts\u201d of the Titanic wreck. Dr Glenn Singleman, an extreme medicine expert who has personally visited the Titanic wreck, told the Guardian: Everybody in the submersible community knows PH. PH is a legend. He was the co-leader of the expedition that found the Titanic \u2026 he set up the whole French navy submersible programme. His passion is the Titanic, and he\u2019s visited that wreck more than 100 times in submersibles. Everybody says: why would you go on such a risky venture? The reason is because it\u2019s his passion. This is who he is. He\u2019s spent a lifetime in submersibles going to these extreme environments, exploring unknown places and bringing back these incredible photographs and incredible stories of what\u2019s possible. I\u2019ve talked to PH many times about it. That\u2019s worth the risk. Back to assessing the best and worst case outcomes of the missing Titan submersible. In a better-case scenario where the sub has not become stricken on the seafloor or suffered a catastrophic failure, it will have surfaced in the ocean. However, even if the bus-sized sub has surfaced and is spotted by search operations, the danger is not over, according to Ian Sample, Guardian\u2019s science editor. The submersible\u2019s hatch appears to be bolted from the outside \u2013 which would mean there is no way out from the inside. The crew inside would still need to rely on emergency oxygen to breathe. The Titan crew were down to 40 hours of breathable air, the US Coast Guard said eight hours ago. Breathable air supply is now closer to 30 hours. The missing Titan sub is landing on the front page of UK newspapers. The Mirror and Daily Express are praying for a miracle: And Daily Mail declares a 24 hour window to save the sub\u2019s crew: The search and rescue operation for the Titan sub is up against an array of potential complications \u2013 potential battery failure, limited communication with the surface, weather conditions, pressure 380 times greater than what we\u2019re used to on earth\u2019s surface, and a timer on oxygen supplies \u2013 Prof Stefan Williams writes in The Conversation. Rescuing the Titan and its passengers will not be an easy feat, he writes: Finding an underwater vehicle the size of a small bus in this vast and remote expanse of ocean will be no small feat. Williams writes that safety risks around manned submersibles has been the topic of scientific debate: There\u2019s an ongoing debate in scientific circles regarding the relative merit of manned submersibles, wherein each deployment incurs a safety risk \u2013 and the safety of the crew and passengers is paramount. Currently, most underwater research and offshore industrial work is conducted using unmanned and robotic vehicles. A loss to one of these vehicles might compromise the work being done, but at least lives aren\u2019t at stake. In light of these events, there will likely be intense discussion about the risks associated with using these systems to support deep-sea tourism. Passenger Hamish Harding was excited for the Titan\u2019s expedition to the Titanic wreck, friend Terry Virts told NBC News: He was excited. The text I got was \u2018hey, we\u2019re headed down to Titanic today, exclamation point\u2019. Virts, a former NASA astronaut and Air Force pilot, told NBC he received the text from Harding early Sunday morning. Harding, one of the five passengers missing onboard the Titan, is an aviator owner of Action Aviation. He was aware of the risks, but not worried about them, according to Virts. Virts and Harding\u2019s family are hopeful: \u201cThe really good news that we have is that we haven\u2019t heard bad news \u2014 they haven\u2019t found a wreckage, they haven\u2019t found debris floating, the sonar didn\u2019t pick up any kind of crushing or exploding noise,\u201d he told NBC. \u201cSo there\u2019s definitely hope that the crew is alive in the submersible.\u201d An old PDF promoting the Titan, showing seating configuration for five people in the sub, has been shared by NBC News deputy tech editor Ben Goggin. \u201cOnly one person can extend their legs. This looks like hell folks,\u201d he writes: Joint Rescue Coordination Centre Halifax \u2013 the air and marine search and rescue response in Atlantic and Canada \u2013 are preparing air vessels to aid the search for the missing sub. The Royal Canadian Air Force CP-140 Aurora aircraft has surface search and sub-surface acoustic detection capabilities. It will provide continuous on scene support with additional aircrews and assets. The Royal Canadian Navy ship HMCS Glace Bay will provide a medical team specialising in dive medicine, as well as a six person mobile hyperbaric recompression chamber. It is expected to be on scene by midday 22 June. The Canadian Coast Guard Ship (CCGS) John Cabot is expected to arrive later today. CCGS Terry Fox is currently in St. John\u2019s Newfoundland and Labrador, and the CCGS Ann Harvey is currently enroute. A long list of onboard systems, and environmental hazards, would have been identified and assessed before the Titan\u2019s expedition began, and before the submersible and its five occupants slipped beneath the waves near Newfoundland. But at 3,800 metres below sea-level the pressure is crushing, and at a site nearly 400 miles off the coast there is a real potential of getting lost. Guardian\u2019s science editor Ian Sample dissects the best and worst case scenarios that could explain the missing Titanic sub\u2019s loss of contact with surface. You can read his full analysis here: Five people were onboard the Titan submersible vessel when it went missing during an expedition to the wreck of the Titanic in the Atlantic Ocean. Here we take a look at who they are: According to the US Coast Guard, several more vessels will be joining the search. The US\u2019s Sycamore ship, as well as the Canadian John Cabot and a French research vessel with an exploration robot will be joining the search. Meanwhile, the five people onboard the submersible that went missing have less than 40 hours of breathable air left, according to the Coast Guard. The Titan submersible is not classed according to normal industry standards, a 2019 post on owner Oceangate\u2019s website says. The company\u2019s justification for operating the submersible despite falling outside regular industry safety regulations is \u201cinnovation\u201d. \u201cWhen OceanGate was founded the goal was to pursue the highest reasonable level of innovation in the design and operation of manned submersibles. By definition, innovation is outside of an already accepted system. However, this does not mean that OceanGate does [not] meet standards where they apply, but it does mean that innovation often falls outside of the existing industry paradigm,\u201d the post on the website reads. According to Lloyd\u2019s Register, a company that specializes in engineering and technology for the maritime industry, classification for submersibles is \u201cconditional upon strict observation of the restrictions imposed on service operation, and upon the proper maintenance of the submersible or chamber and identified ancillary equipment which is required to comply with the Rules.\u201d The New York air national guard is now assisting with search and rescue efforts, Governor Kathy Hochul announced on Tuesday afternoon. Hochul said: \u201cThe women and men of New York\u2019s air national guard are always ready to lend a helping hand. I commend the members of the 106th rescue wing for their efforts to assist the US Coast Guard in this search and rescue operation.\u201d The 106th Rescue Wing, based in Westhampton Beach on Long Island, is now part of the joint operation in the Atlantic to locate the missing sub before oxygen runs out. As of Tuesday afternoon, the coast guard estimated there were 40 hours of breathable air. The 106th flies fixed-wing search and rescue aircraft and helicopters, and has a unit of pararescue jumpers trained for sea and land. On Monday afternoon, the rescue wing launched a search and rescue aircraft of 13 airmen and a team of pararescue jumpers at the request of the US Coast Guard. More efforts continue today. The search for the missing Titan sub is now more of an underwater operation, US Coast Guard rear admiral John Mauger told CNN this afternoon. Up until this point, search and rescue operations were primarily on the surface of the water and in the air. Mauger told the network: \u201cOur thoughts as we continue on with this search are with the crew members and their family members right now. If there\u2019s any chance, we\u2019re going to work as hard as we can to make sure we locate that submersible.\u201d He continued: \u201cWe\u2019ve been working through the night with a broad group of partners to bring all capabilities to bear, looking on both the surface and now expanding to a sub-surface search in the area.\u201d The expanded search includes four additional vessels and five remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), which have the capability to go underwater, although it\u2019s not immediately clear to what depth, or other details of how those will be used. Here\u2019s a recap of today\u2019s developments: The crew of the submersible Titan, which went missing in the Atlantic during a dive to the wreck of the Titanic, have about 40 hours of breathable air remaining, if they are still alive, US Coast Guard officials said on Tuesday afternoon. Rescue teams are racing against time to locate the 22ft-long (6.7-metre-long) vessel, which had a 96-hour supply of oxygen when contact was lost on Sunday at one hour and 45 minutes into its descent to the wreck site 12,500ft (3,800 metres) beneath the ocean\u2019s surface, about 370 miles (600km) from the coast of Newfoundland. A massive sea and air search that began on Sunday night for the vessel and five men aboard, and which has so far covered 7,600 sq miles of a remote area of the ocean, had \u201cnot yielded any results\u201d, Capt Jamie Frederick also told reporters at a media briefing on Tuesday afternoon. On Tuesday morning, military authorities said the search was expanding to under the water, using sonar and other hi-tech equipment, enhancing surface operations that had continued through the night. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, ordered the dispatch of research ship Atalante to join the international search for the missing Titan sub, the French government confirmed. The ship is expected to arrive on site by Wednesday evening local time. Five crew members are aboard the carbon fiber and titanium submersible Titan. They include Hamish Harding, 58, a British explorer and pilot who has previously taken a suborbital spaceflight; British Pakistani businessman Shahzada Dawood, 48; and his son Suleman, 19. The British Foreign Office has confirmed it is in contact with the families of three British nationals on the sub. Also aboard are Paul Henri Nargeolet, a former French navy commander, deep diver and submersible pilot widely considered the leading authority on the Titanic wreck site, and Stockton Rush, the founder of OceanGate. US President Joe Biden is \u201cwatching events closely\u201d surrounding the missing submersible, the White House\u2019s spokesperson John Kirby has said. It is understood that King Charles has asked to kept fully up to date on the situation regarding the missing submersible. A former employee of Oceangate, the company that owns the missing sub and runs tourist expeditions of the Titanic wreck, voiced concerns about the safety of the sub as early as 2018, according to a report. Court documents obtained by The New Republic show the employee was concerned about \u201cthe potential danger to passengers of the Titan as the submersible reached extreme depths\u201d. This post was amended on 21 June 2023 to correct the spelling of Suleman Dawood\u2019s name. King Charles has asked to kept fully up to date on the situation regarding the missing submersible, Sky News understands. The king\u2019s thoughts and prayers are with the Dawood family and all those involved in the attempted recovery operation, it says. The US navy is sending a Flyaway Deep Ocean Salvage System (FADOSS), as well as subject matter experts, to assist in the search of the submersible that went missing while trying to travel to the wreck of the Titanic, a US navy spokesperson has said. A statement by the US navy said the FADOSS is a \u201cmotion compensated lift system designed to provide reliable deep ocean lifting capacity for the recovery of large, bulky, and heavy undersea objects such as aircraft or small vessels\u201d. Both the salvage system and subject experts are expected to arrive at St John\u2019s, Newfoundland, Canada, tonight. US President Joe Biden is \u201cwatching events closely\u201d surrounding the missing submersible, the White House\u2019s spokesperson John Kirby has said. At a briefing, Kirby pointed to the ongoing search efforts by the US coast guard, Canadian officials and other agencies. The US navy is also on standby \u201cshould they be needed because they have some deep-water capabilities that the coast guard wouldn\u2019t necessarily have\u201d, he said. Kirby added: All of us, including the President express our thoughts to the crew on board, as well as to the no doubt worried family members back on shore. A former employee of Oceangate, the company that owns the missing sub and runs tourist expeditions of the Titanic wreck, voiced concerns about the safety of the sub as early as 2018, according to a report. Court documents obtained by The New Republic show the employee, David Lochridge, was concerned about \u201cthe potential danger to passengers of the Titan as the submersible reached extreme depths\u201d. Lochridge was reportedly OceanGate\u2019s director of marine operations at the time, \u201cresponsible for the safety of all crew and clients\u201d. The documents allege that he was wrongfully terminated after he raised safety complaints over the sub, and claim that OceanGate terminated his employment \u201cin efforts to silence Lochridge and to avoid addressing the safety and quality control issues\u201d. The documents allege that Lochridge \u201cidentified numerous issues that posed serious safety concerns, and offered corrective action and recommendations for each\u201d. He was particularly concerned about \u201cnon-destructive testing performed on the hull of the Titan\u201d, they say. The court filings also allege: The paying passengers would not be aware, and would not be informed, of this experimental design, the lack of non-destructive testing of the hull, or that hazardous flammable materials were being used within the submersible. The case between Lochridge and OceanGate was settled out of court in November 2018. Promotional materials for the Titan submersible reveal the tight quarters the five passengers are currently in. NBC News\u2019 Ben Goggin has shared the diagram of the ship, which shows that only one of the passengers is able to fully extend their legs at one time. Stockton Rush, the chief executive of OceanGate Expeditions, was warned by leaders in the submersible vehicle industry that the \"company\u2019s current \u2018experimental\u2019 approach\u201d could result in problems \u201cfrom minor to catastrophic\u201d. The warning came in a 2018 letter to Rush, obtained by the New York Times. A reporter from the Times visited OceanGate\u2019s main office, based in Everett, Washington, where he said \u201cthe entrance door was locked, and nobody responded to knocking\u201d. It is too early to say what has happened but experts have offered several of the most likely scenarios, from becoming tangled in wreckage of the Titanic, to a power failure or an issue with the sub\u2019s communications system. The wreckage of the Titanic, which lies about 3,800 metres (12,500ft) down on the ocean floor is surrounded by debris from the disaster more than a century ago. \u201cThere are parts of it all over the place. It\u2019s dangerous,\u201d said Frank Owen OAM, a retired Royal Australian Navy official and submarine escape and rescue project director. Contact was lost 1 hour 45 minutes into the Titan\u2019s trip, suggesting the crew may have been close to, or at, the bottom, says Owen. The Titan has a maximum speed of three knots, but would be slower the deeper it goes. In the case of becoming tangled, or a power or communications failure, the Titan would be equipped with drop weights, which can be released in an emergency, creating enough buoyancy to take it to the surface. The Titan has an array of signals, lighting, reflectors and other equipment it can use once on the surface to attract attention. Another scenario is that there has been a leak in the pressure hull, in which case the prognosis is not good, said Alistair Greig, a professor of marine engineering at University College London. \u201cIf it has gone down to the seabed and can\u2019t get back up under its own power, options are very limited,\u201d Greig said. \u201cWhile the submersible might still be intact, if it is beyond the continental shelf, there are very few vessels that can get that deep, and certainly not divers.\u201d Chris Parry, a retired rear admiral with the British Royal Navy, told Sky News a seabed rescue was \u201ca very difficult operation\u201d. \u201cThe actual nature of the seabed is very undulating. Titanic herself lies in a trench. There\u2019s lots of debris around. So trying to differentiate with sonar in particular and trying to target the area you want to search in with another submersible is going to be very difficult indeed.\u201d The French president, Emmanuel Macron, ordered the dispatch of research ship Atalante to join the international search for the missing Titan sub, the French government has confirmed. The vessel was sent \u201cat the request of the President of the Republic Emmanuel Macron and in response to a request from the American authorities\u201d, a statement from France\u2019s maritime ministry said. France\u2019s secretary of state in charge of Sea, Herv\u00e9 Berville, told BFMTV that the ship is equipped with an underwater robot that can reach as deep as 4,000 metres and the robot\u2019s operation team has departed from the French city of Toulon. He added: The idea and our wish are for the ship to arrive as soon as possible, which should be Wednesday at 8pm local time. Coast guard petty officer first class Robert Simpson told journalists at the Tuesday lunchtime briefing that weather conditions in the search area, about 370 miles from the coast of Newfoundland, were improving: The weather on scene today was five to six feet seas, wave height. I believe it was 50 knot winds. Visibility was very foggy yesterday but increasing today, and they were expecting much better conditions from an aerial search perspective. He wouldn\u2019t be drawn on the Titan crew\u2019s chances of survival, or likelihood of success of any rescue operation, should the submersible be located. Earlier in the briefing, coast guard captain Jamie Frederick said the search operation had been ongoing since Sunday night, and had covered a huge area: Since Sunday, the coast guard has coordinated search efforts with the US navy, coast guard, air national guard and the Polar Prince [OceanGate Expeditions\u2019 support vessel], searching a combined 7,600 square miles, an area larger than the state of Connecticut. He detailed resources coming from Canada, including a P3 aircraft currently searching the area, and Canadian and US coast guard vessels arriving this afternoon or this evening: Additionally, numerous private vessels were en route to assist the search and recovery efforts, he said. He added: I want to reiterate this is a very complex search and the unified team is working around the clock to bring all available assets and expertise to bear as quickly as possible in an effort to solve a very complex problem. Stockton Rush, the chief executive of OceanGate Expeditions \u2013 the organisers of the Titan dive mission \u2013 is aboard the missing sub, the company has reportedly confirmed. He is on board as a member of the crew, NBC News is reporting, citing the company. Coast guard officials say the crew of the missing submersible Titan have about 40 hours of breathable air left, if they are still alive. Captain Jamie Frederick was addressing reporters at a just-concluded lunchtime briefing in Boston on the third day of the search for the vessel and its five crew members that disappeared Sunday on a dive to the wreck of the Titanic, 12,500ft below the surface of the Atlantic. We know from the data that we were using as a starting point, [their available air] was 96 hours. We know at this point, we\u2019re approximately about 40, 41 hours,\u201d he said. He stressed that a \u201ccomplex\u201d search and rescue operation, so far covering 7,600 square miles, and involving coast guard and US navy aircraft and vessels, and resources from the Canadian military, was so far fruitless: The search efforts have focused on both surface, with C-130 aircraft searching by sight, and with radar and subsurface with p3 aircraft were able to drop monitor sonar buoys today, those search efforts have not yielded any results. A \u201cunified command\u201d, led by the coast guard, was set up Monday: This is a complex search effort, which requires multiple agencies with subject matter expertise and specialized equipment. While the US Coast Guard has assumed the role of search and rescue mission coordinator, we do not have all the necessary expertise and equipment required for a search of this nature. The unified command brings that expertise and additional capability together to maximize effort in solving this very complex problem. Coast guard officials are giving a press conference now about the \u201ccomplex\u201d search and rescue operation under way in the Atlantic to locate the missing submersible Titan, but say \u201cthose search efforts have not yielded any results\u201d. \u201cWe offer our most heartfelt thoughts and prayers for the five crew members, their families and their loved ones,\u201d coast guard captain Jamie Frederick told reporters. Our crews are working around the clock to ensure that we are doing everything possible to locate the Titan and the five crew members. I want to reiterate this is a very complex search and the unified team is working around the clock to bring all available assets and expertise to bear as quickly as possible in an effort to solve a very complex problem. Frederick says there are about \u201c40 hours of breathable air\u201d remaining \u2013 IF the crew are still alive. He began the press conference by announcing a \u201cunified operations center\u201d was set up on Monday, the coast guard leading the effort with help from the US navy, Canadian armed forces and Titan\u2019s parent company, OceanGate Expeditions. Capt Jamie Frederick is asked how many hours of oxygen is left on the Titan sub. He replies: We know from the data that we were using as a starting point was 96 hours. We know at this point, we\u2019re approximately about 40, 41 hours. He reiterates that that estimate of 40 hours is based on the initial report of 96 hours. Capt Jamie Frederick of the First Coast Guard District, starts by offering the US coast guard\u2019s \u201cheartfelt thoughts and prayers\u201d for the five crew members on board the missing sub and their families. Crews working on the search efforts are \u201cworking around the clock\u201d to ensure that everything possible is done to locate the Titan and its crew members, he says. The US Coast Guard is giving a news conference to discuss the search efforts to locate the missing submersible. We\u2019re expecting a press conference from the US Coast Guard at the top of the hour but, as often happens with these kind of events during developing news, it looks like it will be a few minutes behind schedule. We have access to a video link to stream the presser live and we\u2019ll bring it to you at the top of this blog, it will probably start in about 10 minutes. So stick with us for all the unfolding developments, as they happen. The disappearance of Titan has left the deep sea exploration community \u201cshattered\u201d, a famed Canadian scientist and veteran explorer has said. \u201cThis is the day that we have been fearing for a long, long time \u2013 when you lose a sub in really deep water,\u201d Joe MacInnis, a member of the first expedition to locate the wreck of the Titanic in 1985, told the Guardian on Monday night. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look good.\u201d MacInnis is a veteran deep sea explorer who has completed 17 trips to the famed wreck with a Russian crew, as part of making the 1992 Imax documentary Titanica. He is also a close friend of filmmaker James Cameron who he introduced to the Russian submersible pilots involved. \u201cThe next thing you know Jim hires them and makes all his dives to the Titanic before he makes his big film,\u201d he said, referring to the 1997 mega-blockbuster feature, Titanic, that Cameron directed. Titan had been out of contact for more than 30 hours by Monday night. \u201cThat\u2019s a big concern, especially as time ticks on,\u201d he said. MacInnis added: \u201cWe\u2019ve feared this for a long time,\u201d noting that the news has rocked a tight-knit community of scientists and explorers who have spent much of their lives pushing further into the darkness of the deep sea. \u201cBut this is the reality of the ocean, especially in its deeper waters. It really is a place of scorching fear. And it is a place of fugitive beauty,\u201d he said. Read the full, exclusive interview here. It\u2019s shortly after midday on the east coast of the US and Canada as the frantic search continues by sea and air for the submersible that has been missing since it dived on Sunday towards the wreck of the Titanic, off Newfoundland. We\u2019ll continue to bring you coverage as it happens. Here\u2019s where things stand: Last known pictures of the sub, Titan, have been released, taken on Sunday just before it dived into the North Atlantic, and released by Action Aviation, the company run by passenger Hamish Harding. Titan, the tourist submersible missing with five people aboard, is designed to be piloted with a video-game controller and fitted with \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d components, CBS previously reported. France will send a ship equipped with a deep-sea diving vessel to assist in the search for the Titan, the French education ministry has said. The British Foreign Office has confirmed it is in contact with the families of three British nationals on the sub, Hamish Harding, Shahzada Dawood and his son Suleman Dawood, the BBC reports. Authorities are expanding the search into deeper waters for the submersible, Rear Adm John Mauger, commander of the First Coast Guard District. They\u2019ve been searching through the night. UK prime minister Rishi Sunak\u2019s thoughts are said to be with the families of those involved in the missing Titan submersible. The prime minister\u2019s official spokesman also said that Sunak \u201cclearly wants to pass on his thanks to those that are responding\u201d to the situation. Rescue teams are continuing the search for the Titan submersible that was reported missing on Sunday after diving towards the wreck of the passenger liner Titanic in the North Atlantic. Titan has five people aboard. The Titanic sank in 1912 after hitting an iceberg en route from England to the US, with more than 1,500 souls lost. The wreck was not found until the mid-1980s, almost 4,000m (13,000 ft) down in a deep part of the ocean. This post was amended on 21 June 2023 to correct the spelling of Suleman Dawood\u2019s name. These pictures, taken on Sunday and released by Action Aviation, show the submersible Titan prepared for the dive into a remote area of the Atlantic Ocean. A friend of the British billionaire Hamish Harding has said she is \u201cterrified\u201d over the possibility that the Titan crew are at the bottom of the ocean running out of air. Speaking to Sky News, explorer Jannicke Mikkelsen said Harding was no stranger to \u201celaborate expeditions\u201d and that his \u201ccalm and collected\u201d nature meant he would be an \u201cimportant asset to the team\u201d on board. The US coast guard will hold a news conference at 1pm EST (1700 GMT) to discuss the search efforts to locate the missing submersible. The Titan is a research and survey submersible that can carry five people, usually a pilot and four \u201cmission specialists\u201d who can include archaeologists, marine biologists or anyone who can afford the experience as a tourist. Made of \u201ctitanium and filament wound carbon fibre\u201d, the 6.7-metre (22ft) craft weighs 10,432kg (23,000lbs), equivalent to about six average-size cars, and is capable of diving to depths of 4,000 metres (13,120ft) \u201cwith a comfortable safety margin\u201d, according to operator OceanGate. It uses four electric thrusters to move around, and has a battery of cameras, lights and scanners to explore its environment. OceanGate says Titan\u2019s viewport is \u201cthe largest of any deep diving submersible\u201d and that its technology provides an \u201cunrivalled view\u201d of the deep ocean. It uses Elon Musk\u2019s Starlink satellite technology to communicate, though it is unclear if it was the cause of the loss of contact. OceanGate tweeted last week: Without any cell towers in the middle of the ocean, we are relying on @Starlink to provide the communications we require throughout this year\u2019s 2023 Titanic expedition. It has a 96-hour bottled oxygen supply, as of roughly 6am Sunday local time, according to David Concannon, an adviser to trip operator OceanGate, which would in theory last until Thursday morning . However, that limit would be affected by the breathing rate of those inside the craft, especially if there are tourists onboard with limited diving experience. The tour firm responsible for the missing Titan submersible with five people on board took eight hours to report it to the US coastguard, according to a report. Contact between the sub and its mothership, Polar Prince, was lost at 9.45am, an hour and 45 minutes into its dive to the wreck of the Titanic on Sunday afternoon. But the sub was not reported as missing to the US coast guard until 5.40pm, and not to Canada\u2019s coastguard until 9.13pm on Sunday night, the Daily Mail has reported. OceanGate Expeditions charges guests $250,000 (\u00a3195,270) for a place on its eight-day expedition to see the famous wreck, which lies on the ocean floor at a depth of almost 4,000m and about 370 miles off the coast of Newfoundland. Titan, the tourist submersible that went missing while carrying five people to the Titanic wreck, was designed to be piloted with a video-game controller and fitted with \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d components. In a CBS News segment aired in November, OceanGate Expeditions took CBS correspondent David Pogue aboard the Titan. The trip had several starts and stops, attributed to bad weather and issues with communication, and the submersible even got lost for a few hours. Pogue said he \u201ccouldn\u2019t help noticing how many pieces of this sub seemed improvised, with off-the-shelf components\u201d. OceanGate Expeditions CEO Stockton Rush said the sub featured a light fixture from CamperWorld and a makeshift toilet with a plastic bottle. He said: We only have one button, that\u2019s it. It should be like an elevator, it shouldn\u2019t take a lot of skill. Rush brought out a Logitech game controller, saying that \u201cwe run the whole thing with this\u201d. He reassured Pogue that it was safe, adding that his team had worked with Boeing, Nasa, and the University of Washington to create a vessel capable of withstanding deep-sea pressure. He said: Everything else can fail. Your thrusters can go, your lights can go. You\u2019re still going to be safe. France will send a ship equipped with a deep-sea diving vessel to assist in the search for the tourist submersible that went missing while attempting to reach the wreck of the Titanic, the French education ministry has said. The ship, called the Atalante, is managed by the Ifremer research institute which acts under the ministry\u2019s authority, Reuters reports. A statement by Ifremer said the ship was expected to arrive on site by Wednesday evening local time. It added: It carries the Victor 6000 autonomous robot, capable of descending to a depth of 6,000 metres, beyond the 3,800 metres of the wreck\u2019s position. A French government source added that a French national was among those on board the vessel. The family of Paul-Henri Nargeolet have reportedly confirmed that he was aboard the vessel. A deep water search-and-recovery expert has said a commercial pipe-laying ship has arrived in the area where the missing submersible was last reported. David Mearns, a marine scientist who knows two of the passengers on board the sub, told the BBC earlier today: Just in the last hour or so \u2026 another commercial vessel, a very capable pipe laying vessel, modern ship, with ROV (remotely operated underwater vehicle) capabilities, is actually over the site now and we\u2019re just hoping that it has the capabilities to reach those kind of depths \u2013 3,800 metres \u2013 to search for the submersible and have the ability to recover it. There is some hope that that could happen. The UK has not been approached to offer assistance in the search for the tourist submersible that disappeared in the Atlantic Ocean on Sunday, a spokesperson for the UK\u2019s Ministry of Defence has said. A MoD spokesperson told ABC News in a statement: As the host nation for Nato\u2019s multinational submarine rescue capability, we continue to monitor the incident in the North Atlantic and will guide and assist in any response activity as appropriate. A colleague of Paul Henri Nargeolet, the French diver known as \u201cMr Titanic\u201d who is among the five passengers on board the missing sub, has said \u201ctime is against us at this point\u201d. David Gallo, senior adviser for strategic initiatives at RMS Titanic Inc, told CNN: Something we always think about as explorers and scientists \u2026 we\u2019ve always known something like this could happen and now it\u2019s happened. But we\u2019re still pretty much in shock. Gallo described as Nargeolet as his \u201cclosest colleague\u201d and someone who is \u201cthe best\u201d at deep-sea searching. \u201cEverything that can be done, is being done\u201d to find the missing sub, Gallo said. He added: You begin on the surface in a light blue, pretty color blue that we\u2019re familiar with. It takes two and a half hours to get to the bottom roughly, and you start to drift down slowly through that water column. You leave the blue behind. It gets medium blue, deep blue, dark blue, and then black for about two hours. And this is a place that\u2019s been eternally cold and pressure is building David Mearns, a deep water search-and-recovery expert who knows two of the passengers on board the missing Titan submersible, has said he is \u201cvery worried\u201d by the situation. Mearns, a marine scientist and oceanographer who specialises in searching for shipwrecks, is friends with the British billionaire Hamish Harding and knows French diver Paul-Henri Nargeolet professionally. He described Harding as very charming\u201d and \u201cvery adventurous\u201d, and said Nargeolet was \u201cvery well known\u201d in the Titanic community. Speaking to Radio 4\u2019s World At One, Mearns said: This also happens to be my field, search and recovery, but when it\u2019s involving with people you know personally, the impact of it is bigger. When I found out initially that Hamish was on board that was very upsetting and then when later in the day that PH was also with him on the sub, which was almost a typical thing to expect, they would have got on fantastically well these two characters, that really started to make the day a lot worse. He added: When something does go wrong and it is missing, that is dire. And we\u2019re all very very worried and concerned for our friends and the other people on board. A Canadian aircraft has joined the search for the missing Titan submersible, the US coast guard has said. The family of Hamish Harding, the British billionaire on board the Titan, have said they are very grateful for the kind messages they have received since the submarine\u2019s disappearance on Sunday. A statement by the private plane company Action Aviation, which is chaired by Harding, reads: Both the Harding family and the team at Action Aviation are very grateful for all the kind messages of concern and support from our friends and colleagues. We are thankful for the continued efforts of the authorities and companies that have stepped in to aid in the rescue efforts. We put great faith and trust in their expertise. The statement described Harding as a \u201cliving legend of aviation\u201d, \u201ca three Guinness World Records-holder\u201d and \u201can extraordinarily accomplished individual\u201d. It continued: The team at Action Aviation are extremely proud of Hamish and we look forward to welcoming him home. Mike Reiss, who went on the missing Titanic sub last year, has said that \u201cyou sign a massive waiver that you could die on the trip\u201d. Reiss, an American television writer and producer, told BBC Breakfast earlier today that he did three separate dives including one to the Titanic. He said: You sign a massive waiver that lists one way after another that you could die on the trip. They mention death three times on page one so it\u2019s never far from your mind. He added: As I was getting on to the sub my thought was this could be the end. The UK\u2019s Foreign Office has confirmed it is in contact with the families of three British nationals on the submersible that went missing during a voyage to the Titanic shipwreck. Among those on board the submersible is the British billionaire explorer Hamish Harding, the chair of the private plane firm Action Aviation, which said he was one of the mission specialists on the OceanGate Expeditions vessel. The Pakistani businessman Shahzada Dawood and his son Sulaiman Dawood, who are also on board the sub, are British citizens, the BBC has reported, citing a spokesperson for the Dawood family. In a statement, the Foreign Office said: We are in contact with the families of three British nationals following a submersible going missing off the coast of North America and are in touch with the local authorities. The UK\u2019s foreign secretary, James Cleverly, at a joint press conference with his US counterpart, Antony Blinken, said the thoughts of the British government were with \u201cthose individuals who are currently in the submersible in the North Atlantic\u201d. Cleverly said: We wish them all the luck, and of course we hope that they will be swiftly found and returned to their loved ones. Authorities are expanding the search into deeper waters for the submersible, Rear Adm John Mauger, commander of the First Coast Guard District. Speaking to CNN, Mauger said: As we continue on with this search... we\u2019ve been working through the night with a broad group of partners to bring all capabilities to bear looking on both the surface and now expanding to a subsurface in the area. Crews from the US coast guard have flown over an area \u201cabout the size of Connecticut\u201d to search for \u201cany signs of surfacing\u201d from the missing submersible, according to the US coast guard commander leading the search. The unified command team is expanding its capabilities to be able to search under the water as well, Rear Adm John Mauger, commander of the First Coast Guard District, told ABC News. He said: We have a commercial vessel that\u2019s on scene now, that has remote operated vehicles, that will give us the ability to search under the water as well. Crews have been working \u201caround the clock\u201d to locate the submersible since it lost contact with its operator on Sunday morning, he said. The team is also using a Canadian aircraft which has been dropping sonar buoys into the water to listen out for any sounds the submersible may be emitting. Downing Street said the government was ready to provide support and assistance, but was not aware of a request from the family of Hamish Harding for help. \u201cWe are ready to provide assistance. At this stage I\u2019m not aware they\u2019ve specifically requested assistance from our capacity, which is based in Clyde in the the naval base there. \u201cClearly it is a complex rescue mission at significant depth,\u201d the prime minister\u2019s official spokesman said. \u201cWe would wait to see what may or may not be required. \u201cWe are in contact with the relevant authorities and are ready to provide assistance, but clearly it is an unusual rescue operation given the depths involved.\u201d No 10 has said the UK Foreign Office is in contact with the family of Hamish Harding, as the rescue operation for the tourist submersible off the coast of Canada continues. The UK prime minister\u2019s official spokesman said: \u201cThe FCDO are in contact with Hamish Harding\u2019s family and the local authorities. \u201cWe stand ready to provide any additional assistance, including as our capacity as the host nation for Nato\u2019s multinational submarine rescue capacity.\u201d The UK prime minister Rishi Sunak\u2019s thoughts are said to be with the families of those involved in the missing Titan submersible. The prime minister\u2019s official spokesman said: \u201cThe families involved will be deeply concerned and his thoughts are with them and the Foreign Office is providing support.\u201d He said that the prime minister \u201cclearly wants to pass on his thanks to those that are responding\u201d to the situation. Among those believed to be on board the submarine is Paul-Henri Nargeolet, a 77-year-old former French navy commander known as \u201cMr Titanic\u201d. He has been studying the Titanic for 35 years and has been involved in several submarine expeditions to the wreckage and what have been described as hundreds of hours of observation. In 1987 he was part of the team that brought up a series of objects from the wreckage. In an interview with Le Parisien last year, he described the first time he saw the wreck which lies in total darkness, covered with coral. He said he glimpsed it from inside his submarine, detected with sonar and lit by projectors and said he and the team were left speechless. \u201cFor 10 minutes, there was no sound on the submarine.\u201d Nargeolet, who has been based in Connecticut in the US for many years, has described the wreckage as a \u201ctime capsule\u201d where life suddenly stopped, endlessly fascinating to so many people for different reasons. \u201cSome are interested in its construction, others in the history of immigration to the US, others are interested in the millionaires on board, the stars of the era.\u201d He told Le Monde last year of the vast number of species of marine life living around the wreck, saying: \u201cThe Titanic is an oasis in an immense desert.\u201d A writer who took the Titanic submersible trip last year said he is \u201cnot optimistic\u201d over the search for the missing OceanGate craft. Mike Reiss told BBC Breakfast communication was also lost during his dive down to the Titanic. Reiss said: \u201cI\u2019m not optimistic just because I know the logistics of it. And I know how vast the ocean is, and how very tiny the craft is. He added: \u201cSo the idea is, if it\u2019s down at the bottom, I don\u2019t know how anyone\u2019s going to be able to access it, much less bring it back up. \u201cThere is a hope that it\u2019s at, or near, the surface. \u201cI did three separate dives. I did one dive to the Titanic and two more off the coast of New York. \u201cEvery time they lost communication and again, this is not a shoddy ship or anything.\u201d The search is being led by the US Coastguard 1st District, which is based in Boston, Massachusetts, where it is currently 5.30am. Hamish Harding, 58, is one of the five missing with the OceanGate Expeditions vessel, which was reported overdue on Sunday evening about 435 miles south of St John\u2019s, Newfoundland. Harding is the chair of the private plane firm Action Aviation. His wife is called Linda, and he has two sons named Rory and Giles, as well as a stepdaughter named Lauren and a stepson, Brian Szasz. As a student, he left Cambridge with a degree in natural sciences and chemical engineering. Harding is an aviator, holding an airline transport pilot\u2019s licence and business jet type ratings, including the Gulfstream G650. He is also a skydiver, was inducted into the Living Legends of Aviation in 2022, and is a trustee of the Explorers Club. He also previously worked with the Antarctic VIP tourism company White Desert to introduce the first regular business jet service to Antarctica. Harding has made many trips to the south pole and, in 2016, accompanied Buzz Aldrin, who became the oldest person to reach the south pole at 86. He also went into space last year with Jeff Bezos\u2019 Blue Origin company. Harding is the current holder of three Guinness world records, relating to his work as an adventurer. In 2019, he was commended for the fastest circumnavigation of the Earth via both poles. As part of a crew of eight astronauts and aviators in a Qatar executive Gulfstream G650ER ultra-long-range business jet, Harding led the mission to mark the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin. He achieved the feat in 46 hours, 40 minutes and 22 seconds. In 2021, he achieved the greatest distance covered at full ocean depth and the greatest duration spent at full ocean depth. Alongside Victor Vescovo, Harding dove in a two-man submarine to the lowest point in the world\u2019s oceans, the deepest point of the Mariana Trench, the Challenger Deep \u2013 a depth of about 36,000ft. What can be done to find it? US and Canadian aircraft are searching the area, as well as large ships, but the hunt was \u201ccomplex\u201d because crews do not know if the vessel has surfaced, meaning they must scour both the surface and the ocean depths, said Rear Admiral John Mauger, first district commander of the US Coast Guard, overseeing the search-and-rescue operation. Concannon said officials were working to get a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) that can reach a depth of 6,000 metres (about 20,000ft) to the site as soon as possible. These ROVs are dropped over the side of a vessel, to which it is connected by a \u201cumbilical cord\u201d that enables a pilot to operate its thrusters and also relay data in real-time from its sonar and camera systems. However, the amount of wreckage of the Titanic on the ocean floor means it could take time to discern what is debris and what is the Titan. The search teams do at least have a starting point; the vessel\u2019s position would have been tracked until the moment contact was lost. The company\u2019s managing director, Mark Butler, told the AP: \u201cThere is still plenty of time to facilitate a rescue mission, there is equipment on board for survival in this event,\u201d Butler said. \u201cWe\u2019re all hoping and praying he comes back safe and sound.\u201d It is too early to say what has happened but experts have offered several of the most likely scenarios, from becoming tangled in wreckage of the Titanic, to a power failure or an issue with the sub\u2019s communications system. The wreckage of the Titanic, which lies about 3,800 metres (12,500ft) down on the ocean floor is surrounded by debris from the disaster more than a century ago. \u201cThere are parts of it all over the place. It\u2019s dangerous,\u201d said Frank Owen OAM, a retired Royal Australian Navy official and submarine escape and rescue project director. Contact was lost one hour 45 minutes into the Titan\u2019s trip, suggesting the crew may have been close to, or at, the bottom, says Owen. The Titan has a maximum speed of three knots, but would be slower the deeper it goes. In the case of becoming tangled, or a power or communications failure, the Titan would be equipped with drop weights, which can be released in an emergency, creating enough buoyancy to take it to the surface. The Titan has an array of signals, lighting, reflectors and other equipment it can use once on the surface to attract attention. Another scenario is that there has been a leak in the pressure hull, in which case the prognosis is not good, said Alistair Greig, a professor of marine engineering at University College London. \u201cIf it has gone down to the seabed and can\u2019t get back up under its own power, options are very limited,\u201d Greig said. \u201cWhile the submersible might still be intact, if it is beyond the continental shelf, there are very few vessels that can get that deep, and certainly not divers.\u201d Chris Parry, a retired rear admiral with the British Royal Navy, told Sky News a seabed rescue was \u201ca very difficult operation\u201d. \u201cThe actual nature of the seabed is very undulating. Titanic herself lies in a trench. There\u2019s lots of debris around. So trying to differentiate with sonar in particular and trying to target the area you want to search in with another submersible is going to be very difficult indeed.\u201d What is the Titan sub and what can it do? The Titan is a research and survey submersible that can carry five people, usually a pilot and four \u201cmission specialists\u201d who can include archaeologists, marine biologists or anyone who can afford the experience as a tourist. Made of \u201ctitanium and filament wound carbon fibre\u201d, the 6.7-metre (22ft) craft weighs 10,432kg (23,000lbs), equivalent to about six average-size cars, and is capable of diving to depths of 4,000 metres (13,120ft) \u201cwith a comfortable safety margin\u201d, according to operator OceanGate. It uses four electric thrusters to move around, and has a battery of cameras, lights and scanners to explore its environment. OceanGate says Titan\u2019s viewport is \u201cthe largest of any deep diving submersible\u201d and that its technology provides an \u201cunrivalled view\u201d of the deep ocean. It uses Elon Musk\u2019s Starlink satellite technology to communicate, though it is unclear if it was the cause of the loss of contact. OceanGate tweeted last week: \u201cWithout any cell towers in the middle of the ocean, we are relying on @Starlink to provide the communications we require throughout this year\u2019s 2023 Titanic expedition.\u201d It has a 96-hour bottled oxygen supply, as of roughly 6am Sunday local time, according to David Concannon, an adviser to trip operator OceanGate, which would in theory last until Thursday morning . However, that limit would be affected by the breathing rate of those inside the craft, especially if there are tourists onboard with limited diving experience. Welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the search for the submersible vessel Titan that went missing during a voyage to the Titanic shipwreck. Rescue teams are continuing the search for Titan which went missing with British billionaire Hamish Harding among the five people aboard. Harding, is the chair of private plane firm Action Aviation, which said he is one of the mission specialists on the five-person OceanGate Expeditions vessel reported overdue on Sunday evening about 435 miles south of St John\u2019s, Newfoundland. Pakistani businessman Shahzada Dawood and his son Sulaiman Dawood have been named as two of the other people on the submersible in a family statement. The other two passengers have been widely reported as being French explorer Paul-Henry Nargeolet and OceanGate chief executive and founder Stockton Rush. It is understood there were 96 hours \u2013 four days \u2013 worth of oxygen supply on board which would have started on Sunday morning. We\u2019ll provide updates on the search when they are available."}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db559", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/21/are-debt-for-nature-swaps-way-forward-for-conservation-aoe", "primaryCategory": "environment", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Are debt-for-nature swaps the way forward for conservation?", "lead": "Agreements to reduce developing countries\u2019 debt burden in exchange for spending on nature will be on the agenda at a finance summit in Paris this week", "author": "Patrick Greenfield", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 06:30:05", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.990454", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/6935d962ef10c358fb1c61dbcfa0e7af1fac257c/0_280_9504_5702/500.jpg", "body": "After decades in the wilderness, and familiar to only those in the know, \u201cdebt-for-nature swaps\u201d are becoming one of the hottest things in conservation finance. Last month, Ecuador struck the biggest deal of its kind: refinancing $1.6bn (\u00a31.3bn) of its commercial debt at a discount in exchange for a consistent revenue stream for conservation around the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. Other nature-rich countries that are struggling to pay their debts have taken notice and deals are rumoured in Gabon and Sri Lanka. The market for debt-for-nature swaps is poised to exceed $800bn, according to Bloomberg, prompting fierce competition between banks as demand for green investments increases. Debt-for-nature swaps mean reducing a developing country\u2019s debt burden in exchange for guaranteed finance for nature. Supporters of the concept \u2013 which has its roots in the 1980s debt crisis and an idea from the late \u201cfather of biodiversity\u201d, Thomas Lovejoy \u2013 say it is a win-win for financiers, countries and conservationists. This week, the subject will be on the agenda at the Summit for a New Global Financing Pact in Paris, spearheaded by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the prime minister of Barbados, Mia Mottley. Barbados entered into its own $150m debt-for-nature deal in 2021. \u201cThe world is facing a biodiversity, climate and debt crisis, which is even more pronounced in the developing world,\u201d says Slav Gatchev, managing director of sustainable debt for the Nature Conservancy (TNC), which is often involved in facilitating deals. \u201cThere is an overlap between biodiversity hotspots in the tropics and excessive levels of debt,\u201d he says. \u201cTypically, countries approach us because they\u2019ve seen that these deals can be done at scale. \u201cYou can move the needle in terms of financial pinch points, resolving liquidity constraints before they become solvency problems and, because of our role as a conservation organisation, we can be an honest broker when it comes to implementing these programmes on the ground.\u201d But detractors of the deals warn of greenwashing, and have criticised agreements in which banks often take large fees with comparatively small amounts going to conservation. In a note to investors in January, Barclays questioned the green credentials of debt-for-nature swaps \u2013 often sold as ESG (environmental, social and governance) investments \u2013 because only a small fraction of the deal size ends up with conservation. This claim is strongly disputed by the banks involved. Separately, Daniel Ortega Pacheco, a former Ecuadorian environment minister, is concerned about the potential implications of the agreements for sovereignty. Last month\u2019s Gal\u00e1pagos agreement requires Ecuador to provide about $18m a year to conserve waters near the islands, mostly for a new Hermandad marine reserve that hosts whale sharks, blue whales and leatherback turtles. \u201cWhen you take a closer look at nature-for-debt swaps, Moody\u2019s actually says they count as a default. [A deal] might prejudice developing countries in the long term and there are restrictions on how the money can be spent. Even after the second world war, Germany was free to decide where to invest,\u201d he says. The concerns are echoed by Katie Kedward, a UCL research fellow, who says the agreements do not go far enough. \u201cThe pandemic has brought debt restructuring back into the conversation. In terms of sovereign debt burdens, those constraints are preventing countries from investing in conservation and adaptation to the increased risks of climate change. \u201cI would argue that we need to go further and look at debt forgiveness. I am hugely sceptical about how debt-for-nature swaps are being implemented in practice,\u201d she says. Gatchev says these concerns are unfounded, pointing to case studies by TNC of deals in Belize and Barbados, which he says show that the benefit accrues to the countries. The deals are specific to the requirements of each country and try to anticipate potential problems. The Belize agreement includes natural disaster insurance, intended to avoid the scenario where the country is forced to pay for conservation instead of rebuilding after a hurricane. The reasons for entering the agreements bear striking parallels to the arguments of Lovejoy in 1984, when the idea was first developed. \u201cAs debtor nations cut back on government spending, programmes for protecting natural resources are among the first to go,\u201d Lovejoy wrote in the New York Times at the time. \u201cCosta Rica\u2019s superb national park system cannot be staffed or enlarged without private donations from outside the country. \u201cBrazil\u2019s equivalent of the Environmental Protection Agency can do little more than pay the salaries of its employees; when fires recently broke out in its national park system, there were few guards around to fight them,\u201d he said. In Paris, Mia Mottley\u2019s Bridgetown agenda will attempt to reform global finance for the environmental crises of the modern age. For some, the nature-for-debt swap is part of the answer.

Hoffman had had the temerity to give Ford\u2019s third novel, The Sportswriter, a middling review in the New York Times. Ford at the time believed The Sportswriter to be his masterpiece. It tells the story of Frank Bascombe, once an author of short stories, now, in his late 30s, a sportswriter living a middle-class life in the ordinary town of Haddam, New Jersey. Frank is, when we first meet him, divorced and mourning the death of his nine-year-old son, Ralph. The action of the novel begins in a cemetery, where Frank and his ex-wife pay a dawn visit to Ralph\u2019s grave. Nonetheless, The Sportswriter is about that great American theme, the pursuit of happiness. Can you be happy in the face of the horrors that life throws at you? Frank\u2019s answer is a provisional yes. Hoffman, in her review, suggested that Frank\u2019s happiness was just a project of denial \u2013 that he was an egoist who \u201cchooses to ignore tangled, emotionally charged family relationships, fixating instead on non-relationships and non-events\u201d. Now that Frank\u2019s story has fattened into a sequence spanning four decades and five books, it is easier to perceive that Hoffman\u2019s review may have missed The Sportswriter\u2019s point (though shooting her book in retaliation still seems excessive). As you progress through The Sportswriter and its sequels \u2013 Independence Day (1995), The Lay of the Land (2006) and the title novella in the collection Let Me Be Frank With You (2014) \u2013 it becomes clearer and clearer that these are, indeed, books about happiness as a project of conscious denial. Frank, in his own way, does what the alien Tralfamadorians tell Billy Pilgrim to do in Kurt Vonnegut\u2019s Slaughterhouse-Five: he lives only in the happy moments. In case we, like Hoffman, miss the point, Be Mine, the fifth and (I don\u2019t think it really spoils anything to say) final Bascombe book, begins with a prologue entitled Happiness. Frank, \u201cb 1945\u201d, is \u201capproaching my stipulated biblical allotment\u201d. In this overture, he attends his high-school reunion, where he meets Pug Minokur, once the class basketball champ. Pug now has dementia and remembers nothing. \u201cI\u2019m really happy,\u201d Pug says, before being led away by his grandson. Age, forgetting, fathers, children, happiness: the scene is set. We switch to Rochester, Minnesota, where Frank\u2019s unpleasant 47-year-old son Paul is taking part in a clinical trial at the Mayo Clinic. Paul has a form of motor neurone disease; his prognosis is terminal. Frank cares for him; Paul resents his care. They are \u201cjoined unwillingly at the heart\u201d. The action of the novel shows Frank taking Paul in a rented RV to see America\u2019s stone presidents at Mount Rushmore \u2013 one last performance in \u201cthe theatre of lasts\u201d. There can be no happy ending here, and Frank knows it. But \u201cI happen to believe there\u2019s plenty to be said for a robust state of denial about many things \u2013 death being high on the list\u201d. Looking away from Paul\u2019s death, Frank looks instead at America \u2013 Ford\u2019s other great subject in the Bascombe books, which now essentially constitute a social history of Ford\u2019s own boomer generation from midlife to end times. Once again, Ford sends Frank out into ordinary America and has him report back. Frank\u2019s brief is every little thing: the contents of local newspapers (\u201cThere is a moose loose on a golf course\u201d), the occupants of a neurology ward waiting room (\u201chalf-camo\u2019d veterans \u2026 a burly nun\u201d), the shops in a midwestern mall (\u201cA Footlocker. A Caribou coffee. A Nordic Shop. A sunglasses kiosk\u201d). He tracks also his feelings, ideas, half-formed responses. As of Be Mine, Frank is back in the real-estate business but his true job is, in the closing words of The Lay of the Land, \u201cto live, to live, to live it out\u201d. Realism, in these books, is an act of worship, but not complacent worship. John Banville once called Ford \u201ca relaxed existentialist\u201d. It\u2019s true. His is a realism shorn of metaphysical certainties \u2013 a 20th-century realism. Ford\u2019s world is contingent, frightening, beautiful, comically manifold. It\u2019s one thing piled on top of another. Hence all the catalogues, the trivia, the teeming sensory details: American abundance on the page. It\u2019s now a somewhat soiled and tattered abundance, actually, hedged around with dangers. In the Comanche Mall, \u201cas in many public places now \u2013 and for perfectly supportable reasons\u201d, Frank feels that \u201csomeone from somewhere may be about to shoot me\u201d. The RV rental place Frank visits is called A Fool\u2019s Paradise. This, of course, is what America is. It is also what Frank has always knowingly tried to cultivate. As he says: \u201cThe ability to feel good when there\u2019s almost no good to feel is a talent right up there with surviving loss.\u201d The ironies here aren\u2019t cynically deployed. A fool\u2019s paradise may be the only paradise we get. Resolutely uncynical, blessed with the perceptual gifts of his creator, Frank Bascombe incarnates an old idea of America, now waning; and he knows it. The Mount Rushmore presidents, finally reached, have something \u201cdecidedly measly about them [\u2026] the great men themselves seem unapologetically apart, as if they\u2019ve seen me, and I\u2019m too small.\u201d If that seems a bit on the nose, well, neither Frank Bascombe nor Richard Ford have ever shied away from the obvious \u2013 the obvious being, like everything else, part of the job. \u2022 Be Mine by Richard Ford is published by Bloomsbury (\u00a314.99).

Some call it a catastrophe. Others prefer crisis, \u201cticking timebomb\u201d or a plain, old-fashioned nightmare. Whichever disaster movie term you prefer, this week\u2019s news from the UK mortgage market is not at all good, with lenders\u2019 interest rates soaring and millions of homeowners facing a huge jump in their monthly payments when their fixed-rate terms expire. Brand new inflation figures released just minutes ago \u2013 the reason this email is a few minutes later than usual, in fact \u2013 show no change in the annual rate for May, still stubbornly stuck at 8.7%. That\u2019s a surprise \u2013 analysts were expecting a slight dip. And it remains far, far above the government\u2019s target of just 2%. The economics of all this may be complex, but what it means is simple: a likely further rise in Bank of England interest rates tomorrow, and lots more mortgage pain ahead. I spoke to Richard Partington, the Guardian\u2019s economics correspondent, about how this situation arose \u2013 and what worried homeowners can to do about it. First, the headlines. Five big stories Titanic submarine | Canadian aircraft have detected \u201cunderwater noises in the search area\u201d of the missing submersible Titan, the US Coast Guard has said, amid US media reports of regular \u201cbanging sounds\u201d. Search efforts for the five people on board continue, but the air supply is dwindling, if they are still alive. Andrew Tate | Romanian prosecutors have sent Andrew Tate, his brother Tristan and two other suspects to trial on charges of human trafficking, rape and forming a criminal gang to sexually exploit women. The controversial influencer denies all allegations. Media | The Conservative party has been accused by 300 news organisations from around the world of setting a \u201cdangerous precedent\u201d internationally, after it introduced a \u00a3137 fee to report on its annual conference. Farming | An investigation has found that a major supplier of chicken to UK supermarkets is sourcing birds dosed with antibiotics \u201ccritical to human health\u201d, as concerns grow about the spread of deadly superbugs. US news | Hunter Biden, the son of Joe Biden, will plead guilty to three federal crimes according to the US justice department. Biden is pleading guilty to two counts of wilful failure to pay income tax and a separate federal firearm offence, reports Reuters. In depth: \u2018Going into an election cycle, there is huge pressure on the government to react\u2019 This time last year, homeowners wanting to take out a new, two-year fixed-rate mortgage could borrow money at a rate of 3.14%, at a time when the Bank of England base rate was 1.25%. This week, that same deal was on offer at 5.98%, with the average price for two-year fixes above 6%; the base rate currently is 4.5%. When the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee meets tomorrow, it is widely expected to raise that base rate further, for the 13th time since December 2021, to 4.75%. Observers now think it may top 6% by Christmas. You don\u2019t have to understand complex monetary policy to find those numbers alarming \u2013 and millions of people are already experiencing their real-life effects. When the Bank of England\u2019s rate rises, so do the rates charged by mortgage lenders. But because most people with homeowner mortgages in Britain are on fixed-rate deals, the effect is usually delayed until those deals expire. When they do, however, the increase in cost can be enormous \u2013 a \u00a32,900 jump for the average household remortgaging next year, according to one thinktank. And between now and the end of 2024, more than 2.4m fixed-rate deals \u2013 that\u2019s more than a quarter of those with that type of mortgage \u2013 will expire. That means a potentially terrible financial hit for many, and a huge political headache for the government. *** How did we get into this mess? \u201cThe mortgage market is being heavily affected by the Bank of England raising interest rates, in response to the highest rates of inflation since the early 1980s,\u201d says Richard. Much of this has been outside the government\u2019s control, he says, driven in part by the disruption of the global supply chain due to Covid and the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on energy prices. The UK\u2019s inflation is the highest of any G7 nation, however \u2013 in large part because of the extremely tight jobs market and high numbers of vacancies, which has inevitably been affected by Brexit. The issue has become particularly acute in recent weeks, he says, because new growth data and figures on consumer spending have suggested inflation will be harder to control than expected. That means even higher interest rates to come. \u201cA couple of weeks ago, the financial markets thought the Bank of England had almost finished raising interest rates. Now, they think inflation will be more stubborn in the UK than we hoped. The high street lenders have responded by putting up the rates that you can get on a new mortgage.\u201d *** What happens next? For many people, an awful lot of financial pain. The problem is particularly acute in Britain, says Richard, because so many people are on a fixed-rate mortgage, and a lot of them secured their latest deal a few years ago when rates were at record lows \u2013 hence so many expiring around the same time. They may have been able to afford huge loans in the interim, but with the jump in rates, they are being clobbered. There\u2019s no doubt that this will have huge political consequences \u2013 remember, the next general election must be held no later than 28 January 2025. Tory MPs in marginal seats have been warning that angry voters struggling to meet mortgage payments will blame the government. Labour, inevitably, are calling the mortgage rise the \u201cTory mortgage penalty\u201d. House prices are already faltering and may fall by up to 10%, says Richard. \u201cThat might sound a lot, but it\u2019s only going to take us back to where we were a couple of years ago, because of the way house prices really rocketed over the past couple of years. And then most economists think there\u2019ll be a stabilisation in house prices, and then modest growth in future years.\u201d But despite the soaring costs, analysts are not expecting widespread repossessions, he says, as the rules on initial lending have got stricter in recent years. *** What is the government going to do about it? They stepped in with emergency measures when fuel prices rocketed, so surely the government will help people struggling now? Don\u2019t count on it. Rishi Sunak has ruled out offering any extra help, saying the government needed to \u201cstick to the plan\u201d to reduce inflation. That\u2019s because \u2013 put brutally \u2013 the whole point of raising interest rates is to ensure people have less free cash, so they spend less and thus cool down the economy. \u201cBut that\u2019s the cold-headed economics,\u201d says Richard. \u201cIn politics, there are many other considerations, and going into an election cycle there is going to be huge political pressure on the government to react because they\u2019ll get punished at the ballot box.\u201d Tory MPs are split over whether to intervene, perhaps with tax relief on mortgage interest, Richard reported yesterday: \u201cIf we don\u2019t help families now, all the other money that we have spent to help them will have been wasted if they lose their home,\u201d backbencher Jake Berry told parliament on Tuesday. The government has said it is leaning on banks and building societies to do more for those struggling \u2013 Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, will meet major lenders on Friday \u2013 but may have to take other steps, too. \u201cI expect they will have to do something before the next election, whether it\u2019s supporting first-time buyers or the construction of new affordable homes, or whether it\u2019s something for the lowest income households that are affected by fast-rising mortgage rates.\u201d *** I\u2019m worried. What can I do? It\u2019s undoubtedly difficult out there, but there\u2019s plenty of advice around.

Cartoon of the day | Nicola Jennings The Upside A bit of good news to remind you that the world\u2019s not all bad The haenyeo are a tribe of South Korean female freedivers whose livelihoods are dependent on gathering oysters, seashells and other marine life by hand. More than half of the North Gyeongsang region\u2019s divers are more than 70 years old (9.2% were aged 80 years or more). For a long time they were the only people preserving the ancient but soon-to-vanish tradition. That was until a wave of new recruits joined their ranks, after Unesco added them to the intangible cultural heritage list, which recognises and protects practices and communities from around the world. The community of divers realised that if freediving culture was to survive, potential recruits needed a place to learn. And so the Geoje Haenyeo academy was born, making it possible for women who weren\u2019t born into the practice to access the community and learn its skills. So far, the academy has had more than 100 graduates, with 15 women going on to become full-time divers. Shin Ho-jin, a new recruit, says: \u201cThe older freedivers know the cycle of mother nature and follow the rules to keep it alive as they can.

Cummins came to the crease on the final day of play in the first Test at Edgbaston with Australia needing 72 runs to win, but with just three wickets in hand. The match was still finely poised, although England certainly had the edge. Then Cummins took matters into his own hands, going after the bowling of Joe Root and hitting two sixes in an over that reaped 14 runs, alongside Nathan Lyon. The pair dug in with a gutsy display of tail-end batting, completing their unlikely run chase just before 4:30am on the eastern Australian seaboard. Cummins, in his first Ashes Test in England as captain, ended unbeaten on 44, and Lyon chipped in with 16 not out in an invaluable partnership of 55. \u201cToday in workplaces around Australia there will be a few yawns, I suspect, because overnight there was quite a remarkable result in one of the greatest Test matches of all time,\u201d Anthony Albanese said. \u201cAnd to our captain Patrick Cummins, what a remarkable show of leadership. I think one of the best things about it was the fact that they smiled all the way through. They enjoyed it so much and it was as if there was no pressure whatsoever. \u201cHe is a legend and a great Australian on and off the field. Pat Cummins represents his nation on and off the field with dignity and commitment, and we are very proud of him and the entire team today.\u201d The prime minister also paid his dues to man-of-the-match Usman Khawaja, who compiled 206 runs over the course of the match, including a brilliant first-innings 141. The opener was also labelled a \u201cgreat Australian\u201d by Albanese, whose local club, Randwick Petersham, Khawaja played for. Albanese said he has been in communication with his opposite number in the UK, Rishi Sunak, who had sent a message of congratulations. Albanese conveyed to him that in employing Bazball, England played with \u201ccourage and conviction\u201d and \u201cshowed the sort of spirit and sportsmanship which their team is certainly known for\u201d. \u201cWe look forward to a great series,\u201d Albanese said. \u201cThis has been an extraordinary beginning and we look forward to the next four Tests.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db55d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/may/24/uk-inflation-calculator-how-much-price-rises", "primaryCategory": "business", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Inflation calculator: find out how much UK household price rises affect you", "lead": "This online tool will help you discover what is contributing to your household\u2019s cost of living increases", "author": "Ashleigh Carr and Ashley Kirk", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 06:08:59", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.990524", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/2caa6c0f7bafaa564007e8590cf9b6c5ac751ca0/0_0_5000_3000/500.jpg", "body": "Inflation has been soaring in the UK, with people being hit by higher prices for everyday essentials.

What has emerged is a buoyant and good-humoured LGBTQ+ parable, set in a kind of retro-futurist kingdom, super-modern and hi-tech in every way but with a medieval-style queen and a court of knights who have competed hard for the honour of the title \u201csir\u201d. One of these is Ballister Boldheart (voiced by Riz Ahmed), a lowborn person of colour in love with fellow knight Sir Ambrosius Goldenloin (Eugene Lee Yang), and Ballister is about to be officially dubbed in a gigantic stadium ceremony halfway between the Hunger Games and the Super Bowl. But just as he kneels before the Queen, his sword emits a terrifying green death ray which kills the Queen and in the ensuing chaos, Ballister flees the scene, now unjustly wanted for regicide. But who could have tampered with his sword? While hiding out in a ruined castle, Ballister is befriended by bizarre shapeshifting child imp-demon Nimona (voiced by Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz) who is excited by his undeserved badass reputation for villainy and offers to be his sidekick. But she, too, has an emotional wound, connected to people who hate and fear all those who are different. The cityscape is entertainingly imagined, particularly the quasi-London tube station Vanquisher Square, which looks like a station on the Elizabeth line. Moretz gives the lead character some attitude; perhaps her classic movie Kick-Ass, which famously featured some mayhem to the accompaniment of the Dickies\u2019 punky cover version of the Banana Splits theme tune, has inspired Bruno and Quane to use the music once again here. Nimona is likable and engaging entertainment that finds its way through self-created chaos to some humane life-lessons. \u2022 Nimona is released on 23 June in UK cinemas, and on 30 June on Netflix."}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db55f", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/jun/21/stone-circles-and-tombs-cornwall-uk", "primaryCategory": "travel", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018It stands over us like a giant\u2019s dining table\u2019: on the trail of the UK\u2019s ancient stones", "lead": "No longer just for solstice, a new type of tourism means these mysterious rock formations are being visited year round.

Here the landscape is a morass of knotted bracken and bristly gorse, a soft marigold tinge signalling warmer summer days. A grey smudge of cloud sags on the horizon and the wind whirs like white noise, a low and disorientating murmur. The topography is a palimpsest, with working farms etched over ruinous mines and prehistoric settlements. And at its heart is a scattering of ancient stones, the enigmatic quoits, barrows and stone circles that have captivated and confounded societies for millennia. It\u2019s an enchanting place just to wander, but to help me dive deeper into the mysteries of the moors, I am meeting artists and stone enthusiasts Lally MacBeth and Matthew Shaw. Almost immediately I feel underdressed in hiking boots primed with mud and a hardy waterproof \u2013 in Cornwall, we come perpetually prepared for the threat of showers. MacBeth, on the other hand, looks the part of an antiquarian in an emerald-green blazer and matching beret finished with a swipe of ruby lipstick. The only muted part of her outfit is a monochrome badge, the size of a small pebble, that reads: \u201cThe Stone Club\u201d. As founders of a community of stone fans, the couple are no strangers to a good stone stomp. What began in 2021 with a laptop and badge-maker in their living room in Penryn, Cornwall, has evolved into a network of almost 3,000 members. Although the pair run ad hoc walks and events, the Stone Club is mostly a forum for stone fans around the country to share tips and tales about their favourite formations (and with more than 1,000 stone circles in Britain, there\u2019s plenty of scope). Members, who range from ages two to 80, advise each other on particularly fascinating routes, whether wellies are required and where the nearest watering hole or country pub can be located. The club also acts as an informal identification service where a grainy Polaroid from a long-ago walk is pulled from an attic box and posted to social media for other members to situate the stones. Interest took off during lockdowns and has continued to blossom, says MacBeth. \u201cPeople were desperate to get out and about again \u2013 they wanted to learn about their landscape and take pride in it. Many felt they had found a new community, that they had found their people.\u201d The route the Stone Club has curated for me today weaves past five landmarks because \u201cconnecting the sites gives a more meditative sense of the changing landscape and weather,\u201d says Shaw as we skirt a path cratered with puddles. First we approach M\u00ean-an-Tol, a cluster of four standing stones, one hollowed out in the shape of a broad granite ring. Known locally as Crick Stone, this has become a magnet for folklore, beckoning visitors due to its remedial powers. For rickets, legend says a baby must be passed through the stone three times; for a woman struggling to conceive, seven, bathed in the light of the full moon. We recount this rumour to a man who watches his teenage daughter laugh as she shuffles through the stone backwards. \u201cOnce is enough,\u201d he tells her curtly. Further along the path we reach Ding Dong Mine, one in a constellation of mouldering engine houses studding Cornwall which trace its faded fortune. This mine, Shaw says, was favoured by the writer Daphne du Maurier, a patron of Cornish heritage. \u201cThis is the Cornwall many people don\u2019t see \u2013 a landscape ravaged by mining \u2013 beyond the beaches of St Ives,\u201d adds MacBeth. As Cornwall becomes more polished with the passing of each summer season, stones are a rare free activity \u2013 requiring only money for petrol or a bus fare, she says. Before moving on we peer once more into the vertigo-inducing mine shaft, searching for silhouettes of the past. Soon after we reach Bosiliack Barrow, a tumble of stones thought to be a Neolithic tomb and a portal to a distant world. At first glance, their arrangement looks arbitrary, until I\u2019m told that each slab was carefully positioned to face the winter sun. On the shortest day of each year, the stones are illuminated, dazzling with solstice light. It was in this spot that the idea for Stone Club was conjured, and it still symbolises much of its ethos. \u201cHistory can\u2019t just be studied in a linear textbook,\u201d says MacBeth. \u201cThere are always oddities.\u201d The club formed at a perfect time, as political fissures tore holes through society in 2021. Brexit, culture wars, Covid vaccines \u2013 stones supersede these tensions. They are so old they are ultimately unknowable. They leave space for multiple interpretations \u2013 and going on a stone hunt adds another dimension to getting out into the countryside. Sure enough, as we turn to leave it\u2019s as if someone has lifted a lid on the sky, and the sun breaks through the clouds. We climb another hill to reach Lanyon Quoit, the majestic dolmen recognisable from postcards and fridge magnets across Cornwall. At about 1.5 metres tall, it stands over us like a giant\u2019s dining table, though it\u2019s more likely another prehistoric mausoleum. Iconic stones like these are a great talking point \u2013 an axis for engagements, friendships and gatherings. MacBeth knows a couple who matched, and are in a long-term relationship, because they both proudly listed Stone Club in their dating profiles. While puzzling over the quoit, we get talking to Wolfgang Lorenz, a German man who is touring Cornwall in his motorhome with his teenage son. For him, hunting old stones is a ritual that originated with his parents. He has visited prehistoric sites in France, Denmark and Holland, but retracing once-trodden routes brings something new each time. \u201cThings change in your perception,\u201d he says. As we close our circuit, the weather turns. Our shoes go from squelching to sinking, our skips become large leaps over boggy ground. We come to our last stone, M\u00ean Scryfa, which means, simply, the inscribed stone. Shaw takes out his smartphone and overlays an illustration of the original stone on to its now mottled markings \u2013 a gesture of how seamlessly past and present knit together in the Stone Club. After three hours on the moors, it\u2019s time to retreat to the shelter of our cars. Once more we bump into Lorenz, who is battling the rain to see one more site, though this time without his son. \u201cPuberty,\u201d he shrugs, justifying his absence. We like to think his son will be back in 30 years\u2019 time, retracing the steps he took with his father, knowing that the same stones will still be there, inscrutable and unchanged.

There is, however, a timescale for complaints handling that all financial firms must abide by. If a case is not resolved within eight weeks, customers can ask the Financial Ombudsman Service to investigate, which can take a further few months.

Forced off the street into a deserted spot, they took all her belongings and attacked her at knifepoint. Two hours later, when it was dark, they let her go. She made her way to the house of a friend, who accompanied her to a police station to file a report, and later to a nearby hospital. It marked the start of a long and exhausting journey trying to get help she should be entitled to under Kenyan law. Doyin, who has shared her ordeal on TikTok, says she experienced a rapid decline in her mental health since last year\u2019s attack, going from being cheerful, sociable and outspoken to feeling reclusive, anxious and drained. But according to the Survivors of Sexual Violence Network in Kenya (SSVKenya) and Physicians for Human Rights (PHR), mental health provision is in a dire state. The organisations used PhotoVoice \u2013 a charity that encourages survivors to reflect on and document their experiences using cameras and recordings. The 223 photos and 99 WhatsApp voice notes that came back highlighted significant barriers to mental health services, including cost, stigma, a lack of privacy where therapy is offered and a lack of compassion and sensitivity from poorly trained medical staff. At least 13% of women and girls aged 15 to 49 have experienced sexual violence, according to last year\u2019s Kenya Demographic and Health Survey. The true figure is likely to be significantly higher, as many cases go unreported, partly due an expectation that rape will not be successfully prosecuted. On one TikTok post, Doyin describes facing a barrage of questions from police when she went to report her attack, such as what she had worn and why she was out at that time. \u201cIronically, I had worn a dera [a loose kaftan-like dress] and a trenchcoat,\u201d she says, dismissing the \u201charmful\u201d notion that clothing can invite violence. Rights groups say rape survivors can be seen as having \u201clost their dignity\u201d. Some women are left by their partners, especially if they keep a child conceived from rape. One female officer warned Doyin not to tell her boyfriend about the attack. \u201cI think that was the point I just gave up,\u201d Doyin says. She left them the clothes she was wearing when she was attacked and her mobile phone details. She never heard from them again. Doyin says the most difficult part comes after reporting the case. \u201cYou\u2019re done moving up and down, and now it\u2019s just you, and the memories of the whole thing. Now you have to seek therapy, plus patient therapy costs around 5,000 shillings [\u00a328].\u201d Doyin scoured the internet looking for online support services. Most were unavailable in Kenya or too expensive. \u201cIt made the help that I needed feel so far away from me,\u201d she says. \u201cI have so many numbers that I called just trying to look for help. But I wasn\u2019t getting any at all.\u201d The insensitivity she experienced in private and public hospitals made Doyin unwilling to return to either for mental health support. The private facility kept her waiting in line for two hours in her clearly traumatised state. \u201cMy hair was messed up, my nails were broken, my clothes were torn, and I had sand in every place in my body,\u201d she says. She was finally examined and put on PEP (post-exposure prophylaxis) to prevent HIV infection, but was then told she would have to go to a public hospital to have DNA samples taken and her post-rape care forms stamped, all of which are needed to bring a prosecution. \u201cWe need to find a way to merge the process between the police station and the hospital, to make it simpler for the survivors \u2013 this is a person who has just been through a traumatic experience.\u201d She says \u201cproper\u201d and \u201chumane\u201d mental health support should be integrated into the process. Naitore Nyamu-Mathenge, head of PHR\u2019s Kenya office, says health practitioners tend to focus on the physical impacts of sexual violence. \u201cMore often than not, you\u2019ll see a number of clinicians and nurses will indicate \u2018nothing observed\u2019 [in the post-rape care form], because either they do not have the capacity to assess the impacts, don\u2019t know how to fill it out or that\u2019s not a priority to them,\u201d she says. PHR and SSVKenya want the government to invest in mental health services. In particular, they are calling for health workers to be better trained, including documenting the psychological impact of rape. Doyin was told by one counsellor that cases such as hers were \u201cvery common\u201d \u2013 and she was kept waiting for hours once again, as key personnel spent much of the day in an \u201cimportant\u201d meeting, prompting her to barge in and demand medical attention. \u201cWhat I could read is that, for them, this was a normal occurrence. That\u2019s why they wouldn\u2019t treat the case with the speciality it needs. But we don\u2019t get sexually assaulted every day \u2013 for us, it\u2019s life-changing.\u201d The attitude stretches far beyond hospitals, though. On the street, \u201cnot a single person\u201d asked if she was all right or offered help as she stumbled along after the attack. In Kenya, jokes or misogynistic comments trivialising sexual assault are commonplace. Last week, David Ole Sankok, a member of the East African Legislative Assembly, part of the regional East African Community, stirred online outrage over comments he made promoting a tree-house \u201clovers\u2019 nest\u201d at a country lodge. In a video, he declared that once romantic partners were settled inside, the ladder would be removed so no one could change their minds and the man could \u201cget the value for his money\u201d. Rights groups hit out, saying that such comments implied that women did not have to give consent and normalised the idea that women were obliged to provide sex for financial favours. In 2021, a woman was allegedly thrown off the 12th floor of a building by a man after she refused his sexual advances on their first date. Three radio hosts were sacked for \u201cvictim-blaming\u201d comments about the case. \u201cI think as a country we are at a place where we\u2019ve numbed out our emotions,\u201d says Wangu Kanja, convener of SSVKenya. \u201cThere are too many negative things happening, so we have kind of normalised things that are not normal as normal. We need to change.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db562", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/21/local-swifties-and-even-the-taylor-swift-adjacent-are-losing-their-minds-trying-to-get-australian-tickets", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Local Swifties and even the Taylor Swift adjacent are losing their minds trying to get Australian tickets | First Dog on the Moon", "lead": "The mind-bogglingly huge superstar is coming in February!

Speaking to students and staff on Tuesday evening, Maskell said it had become \u201csadly fashionable\u201d to assume students taking out loans to pay for university was a \u201cnatural order of things\u201d, rather than a policy decision. University was free in Australia from 1974 until the introduction of the Higher Education Contribution Scheme (Hecs) in 1989. Maskell, who is currently the highest paid vice-chancellor in Australia, was a beneficiary of the policy. He said it was \u201cunequivocally true, coming from my background, that if I had been required to take out a loan I would not have gone to university\u201d. \u201cI suspect that the prospective burden of significant debt is still a big factor in people choosing not to go to university,\u201d he said. Since changes made under the Coalition\u2019s job-ready graduates package, single courses cost anywhere between $4,000 and $14,500. After Labor won the 2022 federal election, the sector has been engaging in policy discussions to inform the upcoming universities accord process, poised to be the biggest reform to higher education since 2008. An interim report is expected this month. The chair of the Australian Universities Accord Panel, Mary O\u2019Kane, has urged the sector to be \u201cbig, bold and radical\u201d in its submissions, while the education minister, Jason Clare, says improving equitable access to higher education is a key element of discussion in the accord. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \u201cOne of the most important radical changes that could be made to facilitate this would be once more to make education free to the Australian domestic student,\u201d Maskell said. \u201cSince the introduction of student fees we have not solved the problem of disadvantaged people having access to higher education. \u201cWhat we have done by normalising the business of the students paying their university fees, is to entrench in our culture the idea that university education is only of private benefit to individuals \u2013 not public benefit to societies. This is a gravely mistaken emphasis.\u201d The latest research shows Australia is falling 25,000 short of the 2030 target for 20% of total university enrolments to be students from low socioeconomic backgrounds. Several countries including Germany, Norway, Sweden, Poland, Chile, Mexico, Latvia and Estonia offer domestic students free tuition, while in New Zealand, the first year of study is free. In response to suggestions the cost of free university \u2013 estimated at around $69bn over 10 years \u2013 was too high, Maskell said the future positives of driving up university admissions would outweigh the economic burden. \u201cThis is in fact a point made by successive ministers for education, usually in defending student debts against criticism that they are too burdensome to students,\u201d he said. \u201cYear-on-year public revenue at stake in funding student learning is not the main issue. This is fundamentally about the kind of population that we want to shape for the future in this country. \u201cThe private benefit is not, and should not be the whole story that determines our policy choices.\u201d The issue of student debt has been in the spotlight in recent weeks after a decades-high indexation rate of 7.1% came into effect, increasing average student debts of $24,770 by about $1,700. Maskell said the federal government also needed to address the issue of competitive research grants, which came \u201cnowhere near\u201d to meeting the cost of research. Australia\u2019s gross domestic spending on research and development is 1.8% of GDP, lagging below the OECD average of 2.7% and a fall from 2.25% in 2008. Bachelor degrees at the University of Melbourne are estimated to cost between $100,000 to $180,000 for international students."}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db566", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/jun/21/moss-superheroes-plant-world-air-pollution", "primaryCategory": "science", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Why mosses are superheroes of the plant world", "lead": "Vilified as the scourge of perfect lawns, these tiny plants fight air pollution and keep soils healthy", "author": "Paul Simons", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 05:00:04", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.990687", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/dce75b25f65c210f436ac26f4db42e68f778a2ae/0_62_5120_3072/500.jpg", "body": "Mosses are tiny plants often ignored or treated as the scourge of perfect lawns, and yet they are superheroes of the plant world.

They soak up to 20 times their own weight in water, and when this evaporates it cools the surrounding air by up to 2C. A recent global survey found that mosses were estimated to take up and store 6.43bn tonnes more carbon in the soil layer than is stored in bare patches of soil, representing six times the annual global carbon emissions caused by changes in land use such as agriculture, global deforestation, urbanisation and mining.

A record half a million pupils have an education, health and care plan (EHCP), a legal document setting out a child or young person\u2019s special educational needs, the support they need, and the outcomes they would like to achieve. Councils say government changes unveiled earlier this year to address the growing crisis in the special educational needs and disabilities (Send) system will do nothing to \u201cstem the tide of demand\u201d that is busting their budgets. Lawyers, meanwhile, say too many children are still not receiving the specialist support to which they are entitled. With thousands of young people approaching councils for specialist support, the number of pupils on EHCPs in England stands at 517,026 \u2013 more than double the total in 2015 (240,183), according to analysis by the County Councils Network (CCN), which represents 20 county councils and 17 unitary councils. Last year, 66,356 children and young people started new EHCP plans \u2013 the largest ever number \u2013 according to the CCN, which equates to an average of 182 children each day. The child\u2019s school is required to pay the first \u00a36,000 in support, with the local authority financing the rest, which can be extremely costly. Last year the deficit accrued in local authority Send budgets stood at \u00a32.4bn, with councils in county areas accounting for half of this. Left unchecked, the national deficit for all 152 councils in England is expected to rise to \u00a33.6bn, the CCN says. The government\u2019s long-awaited Send improvement plan, published in March, sets out new national standards to clarify the support available to children and their families and promises thousands more specialist school places. Ministers are also working with individual councils as part of its \u201csafety valve\u201d programme, providing funding to reduce deficits while implementing Send changes locally. Council leaders say, however, the proposals still do not address core demand and cost issues within the system Cllr Liz Brighouse, CCN spokesperson for Send, said: \u201cDespite the government\u2019s reforms package for Send services outlining some important changes which are beginning to be implemented, demand has continued to rise sharply, with councils under extreme pressure to ensure every child gets the support they need, with 182 EHCPs starting each day on average in last year compared with less than half that number in 2015. \u201cWe remain concerned that these reforms will not stem the tide of demand that local authorities are facing, and whilst the legislative changes in 2014 were right in that they expanded eligibility and raised parental expectations, councils have increasingly been left to pick up the bill, which has increased their deficits to unmanageable levels. \u201cAction is needed urgently to address this, and we are calling on government to fully fund these reforms and ensure that councils do not continue to accrue significant deficits that would be impossible to pay down without insolvency.\u201d Catriona Moore, policy manager at Send legal advice charity Ipsea, said too many pupils with Send did not receive the support they needed and to which they were entitled. \u201cIt\u2019s problematic to talk about \u2018demand\u2019 for special educational provision and support for children who need it,\u201d she said. \u201cThe law is clear that children and young people with Send have the right to receive support that meets their needs and enables them to receive an education. The issue isn\u2019t that too many children and young people with Send are receiving costly provision that they don\u2019t need, but that too many aren\u2019t receiving the support they do need. \u201cThe government\u2019s Send improvement plan promises transformation but is not transformative. The key to resolving the Send crisis lies in making sure that local authorities fulfil their statutory duties to children and young people, and that schools and colleges become genuinely inclusive.\u201d A Department for Education spokesperson said: \u201cOur special educational needs and disabilities and alternative provision improvement plan, published earlier this year, committed to a wide range of actions to make sure education, health and care plans are available in a timely way for those who need them. \u201cWe\u2019re creating bespoke plans with almost half of all local authorities to improve their Send services, building new special schools where they are needed, cutting bureaucracy in the education, health and care plan process, and improving mediation for when families disagree with a local authority decision.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db568", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/21/air-pollution-aged-hospital-covid-patients-by-10-years-study-shows", "primaryCategory": "environment", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Air pollution \u2018aged\u2019 hospital Covid patients by 10 years, study shows", "lead": "Patients exposed to dirty air spent four days longer in hospital, the same impact as if they had been a decade older", "author": "Damian Carrington Environment editor", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 05:00:03", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.990722", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/030b239c328ff6336fd812507da7894900013685/0_42_4860_2916/500.jpg", "body": "People exposed to air pollution experienced Covid-19 as if they were 10 years older, according to research. It found people recently exposed to dirtier air before contracting the illness spent four days longer in hospital, the same impact as on those 10 years their senior. The Belgian study also showed that air pollution levels measured in patients\u2019 blood were linked to a 36% increase in the risk of needing intensive care treatment. A separate study in Denmark showed air pollution exposure was linked to a 23% increase in the risk of death from Covid-19. In both studies, the level of air pollution was below legal EU standards. Previous research suggested that air pollution worsened Covid outcomes but, rather than assessing groups of people together, the new studies followed individual patients and therefore give much more confidence in the results. Air pollution is known to be a major risk factor in aggravating respiratory diseases. It increases inflammation in the lungs and weakens immune defences, and causes pre-existing lung problems that worsen the outcomes of new infections. The new research shows cutting air pollution is a crucial measure for reducing illness and deaths during future outbreaks of respiratory diseases, including the annual flu season. Cleaner air brought health benefits almost as great as some of the medical treatments given to the Covid-19 patients, the research showed. \u201cReducing air pollution, even when at relatively low levels, increases the health of the population and makes them less susceptible to future pandemics,\u201d said Prof Tim Nawrot, at Hasselt University in Belgium. \u201cThe pandemic placed an enormous strain on doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers. Our research suggests that air pollution made that burden even greater.\u201d Dr Zorana Jovanovic Andersen, at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark, and senior author of the Danish study, said: \u201cThese results show how air pollution can compromise our immune system and leave us vulnerable. Reduction of air pollution should be at the heart of preventive measures for current and future pandemics, as well as a strategy for dealing with seasonal influenza pandemics.\u201d Many previous studies assessing the link between Covid and air pollution were what epidemiologists call \u201cecological studies\u201d, which assess the relationship using averaged data for a whole population. These could be completed quickly and some factors that may influence the link could be taken into account. But hidden factors could not be ruled out and the variation of air pollution over short distances could not be accounted for. In contrast, the new studies followed the illness and air pollution exposure in individual people. The Belgian study, published in the European Respiratory Journal (ERJ), followed more than 300 patients who were hospitalised with Covid-19 between May 2020 and March 2021. Data on the levels of three pollutants \u2013 fine particles, nitrogen dioxide and soot \u2013 at the patients\u2019 homes were gathered and the amount of soot in the patients\u2019 blood was also measured. Other factors known to affect Covid-19 disease, such as age, sex and weight, were taken into account. The difference in air pollution used in the studies to assess the impact on Covid-19 was based on the range of pollution levels recorded. The higher level used was midway towards the top of the range \u2013 at the 75% mark \u2013 and the lower level was towards the bottom of the range \u2013 at the 25% mark. The researchers found people exposed to the higher level a week before hospital admission went on to spend about four more days in hospital. They also found the lower level of air pollution resulted in health improvements equivalent to 40-80% of the benefits of medicines used to treat Covid, such as remdesivir. The Danish study, also published in the ERJ, used Denmark\u2019s national Covid-19 surveillance system to follow all 3.7 million people in the country aged 30 or older over the first 14 months of the pandemic. It found patients exposed to the higher level of small particle air pollution in 2019 were about 23% more likely to go on to die from Covid-19. A similar recent study in New York City found the increased risk of death was 11%. Prof Charlotte Suppli Ulrik, head of the European Respiratory Society assembly on the environment and epidemiology, said: \u201cWe are finding more and more evidence that breathing polluted air is contributing to lung diseases, including infections. Although the Covid-19 global health emergency is over, the impact of pollution on our health is continuing and we need governments to take action for the sake of our health and our health services.\u201d Prof Jordi Sunyer and Dr Payam Dadvand, at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health and commenting on the Belgian study, said it showed that cutting air pollution would be \u201ca very effective way to protect our population\u201d from Covid-19 and other respiratory infections. \u201cDespite the evidence, the air quality standards are still above harmful values and even these rather lax standards are still not met in most cities in the world, including many European cities,\u201d they said."}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db569", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/21/rishi-sunak-boris-johnson-toxic-legacy-partygate-cowardice", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Sunak had a chance to rise above Johnson\u2019s toxic legacy \u2013 and he blew it | Rafael Behr", "lead": "A politician who came to office promising integrity and accountability has shown the stupidest kind of cowardice, says Guardian columnist Rafael Behr", "author": "Rafael Behr", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 05:00:03", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.990739", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/42ce54589d639e1978d46cffddffc14942029021/0_26_2161_1297/500.jpg", "body": "Rishi Sunak sits in the office of prime minister as if placed there on secondment from some other Conservative party \u2013 one that hasn\u2019t been in power for 13 years. If there is credit for trying to fix things that are broken about Britain, he will claim it, but accountability for the breakage is not his concern. He chose not to express a view on Monday when MPs endorsed the report that censured Boris Johnson for lying wilfully and repeatedly to parliament. Sunak said he respected the committee that investigated his predecessor but, speaking as head of the government, preferred not to meddle in matters for the legislature. That excuse doesn\u2019t even work as a constitutional fig leaf. The prime minister is also an MP and a citizen. He is allowed an opinion on whether politicians should tell the truth. As leader of his party, mindful of public opinion, he might also have wanted to signal that Johnson\u2019s duplicities deserve formal rebuke. Even if the ethical imperative passed him by, he could have spied an electoral advantage in siding with the people who felt the personal sacrifices they made for Covid lockdowns were derided when the man who wrote the rules also flouted them. The real reason for Sunak\u2019s abstention was hope of an end to hostile manoeuvres from Johnson and his allies. To choose appeasement of implacable foes over alignment with millions of voters is gutlessness without guile; the stupidest kind of cowardice. As a rule, if a prime minister\u2019s first pledge in office is to govern with \u201cintegrity, professionalism and accountability\u201d, and he is later asked if that commitment still stands, the answer should sound something like yes. Sunak\u2019s promise of probity on the threshold of No 10 always had a whiff of John Major\u2019s \u201cback to basics\u201d campaign about it \u2013 a piety so vague and vast as to be meaningless, except as a device for organising every subsequent scandal and mishap into a pattern of systemic hypocrisy. Every prime minister wants to signal a fresh start, and for Sunak there was the added urgency of burying Liz Truss\u2019s short, calamitous reign. That was more than a party-political mission. Truss\u2019s adventures in budget policy cost Britain its credibility with financial markets. The country faced relegation from the tier of developed democracies that reliably manage their debts. Conservative MPs desperately needed a replacement prime minister with a reputation for economic sobriety. Sunak, the chancellor who navigated the pandemic to general acclaim and then watched from the backbenches as the economy went into a tailspin, was the obvious candidate. The contrast with Truss gave Sunak a more potent aura of renewal than he deserved. The expedient of short-term stabilisation after a financial emergency laundered memories of the new prime minister\u2019s loyal service to Johnson, whose disgrace receded momentarily from view behind the spectacular implosion of his successor. But Truss\u2019s premiership is better understood as an extension of the \u201cBoris\u201d franchise. She beat Sunak as a continuity candidate. Or rather Sunak lost because Tory grassroots members despised him as Johnson\u2019s assassin. What followed was like a disastrous spin-off show devoted to a minor character in a longer-running series. It was the familiar script of Johnsonian bluster but in the mouths of a weaker cast performing to an audience of unamused bond traders. Kwasi Kwarteng\u2019s \u201cmini-budget\u201d of September 2022 was reckless because it offered lavish tax cuts with no projection of compensating revenues beyond faith in the lucrative proceeds of growth to be conjured by the animal spirits of unleashed enterprise. But that alone might not have caused a financial derailment, had Truss and Kwarteng not also made a great show of contempt for what they saw as economic \u201corthodoxy\u201d. In her leadership bid, Truss had casually queried the Bank of England\u2019s independence in ways that alarmed the City. On arrival in Downing Street, she sacked Tom Scholar, the respected permanent secretary at the Treasury. The Office for Budget Responsibility was blocked from vetting Kwarteng\u2019s numbers. When markets flinched from his unfunded tax cuts, he went on television and promised \u201cmore to come\u201d. Flinch turned to flight, and the whole budget had to be scrapped. Britain is still paying the price. The current cost of living crisis has causes that predate Kwarteng soiling the national balance sheet, but the immediate cost to the exchequer was somewhere in the order of \u00a330bn. Interest rates would be rising anyway to contain inflation, but Trussonomics gave mortgage holders an early punch in the guts. Shredding trust among international lenders also limited future fiscal bandwidth. Having blown the right to mark their own economic homework, the Tories locked Britain on to a path of performative budget discipline that amounts to punitive austerity. Sunak is silent about both the economic pain that people are suffering and the reason. That might indicate deficient empathy, but it is mostly a function of his unwillingness to examine the causes of any problem that Britain faces when there is no way to tell the story without taking a portion of blame. It is the reason why he cannot call Johnson a liar or say, as some Tory MPs managed to do in the Commons on Monday, that deliberate lying from the dispatch box is an act of sabotage against democracy. He cannot articulate a simple constitutional principle \u2013 that a prime minister who is found to have broken the rules must be punished because the alternative is a system where executive power comes with an exemption from accountability. Johnson entered Downing Street with that spirit of contempt for anything that might restrain a leader\u2019s impulse, then passed it on to Truss. It is their combined legacy that Sunak will not repudiate, even as he presents himself as a different kind of leader from a different Conservative party. There is a way to rationalise the decision not to provoke Johnson with an explicit endorsement of the privileges committee\u2019s verdict. Although the former prime minister enjoys less support among Tory MPs than he might like, his base is noisy and effective at commanding media attention.

And even if Johnson\u2019s star wanes he represents a wider Tory tendency that needs Sunak\u2019s project to fail; that cares only about another Conservative party waiting to emerge on the other side of election defeat. That party will have to decide if it thinks integrity, professionalism and accountability matter in politics. It isn\u2019t a hard question.

In 2007 two of the UK\u2019s biggest lenders launched 25-year fixed-rate mortgages. They were responding to a call from the then chancellor, Alistair Darling, who suggested consumers would be better off if they did not have to find a new deal every two years, typically paying charges each time. The rates were not especially high for the time: Halifax and Nationwide both charged 6.39% on their deals, the Bank of England base rate was 5% and, according to data from Moneyfacts, the average two-year fixed-rate was 6.24%. Nevertheless, there was not exactly a stampede at either lender\u2019s branches. Nationwide would not say how many it sold, only that \u201chistorically, take-up of 25-year fixed mortgages has been low, with borrowers preferring the flexibility of shorter-term deals of two- to five years\u201d. In the intervening years, those who opted for a short-term fix will have felt vindicated. When the banking crisis hit in 2008, the Bank of England\u2019s response was to start slashing interest rates. Borrowers on variable-rate mortgages benefited immediately, but as low rates became the norm, those coming off fixed-rate mortgages were able to get cheaper and cheaper deals. By 2020, when the cheapest two-year fixed rates were below 1%, a borrower who had opted to ride the rollercoaster of rates would have made huge savings, offset only in part by any fees they paid along the way. On a \u00a3150,000 mortgage, for example, monthly repayments would have been \u00a31,003 on a rate of 6.39% \u2013 but \u00a3554 on the 0.83% that was on offer from Halifax two years ago. (Over 25 years, a borrower on the higher rate would have paid \u00a3300,757; the borrower on 0.83% would have paid \u00a3166,152, had that rate continued for 25 years.) It seems unlikely that many \u2013 if any \u2013 borrowers predicted the financial crisis on the horizon and made their decision with that in mind. Rather, at a time when house prices were increasing, they took a short-term choice and were lucky with their timing. The current cohort of borrowers on short-term deals have been equally unlucky. When, in 2003, Prof David Miles was asked by the Labour government to examine how the UK could develop a mortgage market in which long-term fixed rates were common, he described their advantages. Almost 20 years later, his words have new resonance. Among his conclusions was that if the market worked better \u201cmany more mortgages would be at rates that were fixed for periods longer than is currently common. More borrowers would then be insulated from the impact of unexpected changes in interest rates at times when the stock of their debt was large relative to their incomes and when the impact of charges in interest rates on the affordability of their mortgages is great.\u201d Now he says that the UK mindset seems to deter people from paying any more than they need to in the short term. \u201cI think there has been a mindset in the UK that getting on to the housing ladder is what matters and that tomorrow will (probably) be OK once you do that,\u201d he said. To make that happen in a country where prices are high relative to income, borrowers are inclined to go for the cheapest deal possible, whether it is a fixed-rate or variable deal. This is despite the fact that fixing for five years or more means fewer stress tests and might allow you to borrow more money. Miles notes that in the UK, the long-term fixed rates have tended to come with penalties, so you are stuck on a high rate if base rates go down. In the US, they counter this by allowing people to remortgage on to lower rate, but the cost is borne by everyone \u2013 rates are higher than they would otherwise be. \u201cIf you offered that re-financing option in the UK on long-term fixes, then it would mean that the fixed rate was more often than not above the variable rate \u2013 and people often just go for the lowest repayment at the initiation of the mortgage.\u201d As well as borrowers\u2019 desire for the cheapest deal possible, one industry source suggests that brokers have a role in keeping the market short-termist as they receive fees when a new deal is taken out, and have no incentive to tie in their customers for the long haul. Concern about keeping options open also seems to be a factor. Although many mortgage lenders now allow overpayments and for customers to \u201cport\u201d their loan if they move home, borrowers think short term equals flexibility. Neal Hudson, a UK housing market analyst at the consultancy BuiltPlace, said people might have been put off paying more for a longer-term deal because of expectations that prices would continue to rise and rates would continue to go down. He said: \u201cThe general experience over the past 40 years has been that \u2013 there may have been some short-term pain but in the medium term people have always ended up all right. \u201cThe market has clearly bottomed out now, so will we see a change? Maybe a long-term fix does become more appealing.\u201d But no one seems to be suggesting a sudden rush for the one 25-year deal currently available \u2013 Kensington\u2019s mortgage loan starting at 5.57%. Despite talking about forever homes on TV shows and increasingly extending the terms of our mortgages to three or even four decades, our relationship with rates seems to be resolutely short-term."}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db56b", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/21/billionaires-and-the-titanic-the-allure-of-extreme-expeditions", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Billionaires and the Titanic: the allure of extreme expeditions", "lead": "The more adventurous among the world\u2019s wealthiest take trips to the edge of space and Antarctica in their stride", "author": "Rupert Neate Wealth correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 05:00:03", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.990775", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/f227950389ee2c40a4715beebb1d5403dc3a5a50/80_0_1200_720/500.jpg", "body": "The disappearance of the submersible en route to the wreck of the Titanic has highlighted the businesses that offer extreme expeditions \u2013 and their clienteles. Among the five people on the missing Titan submersible are two billionaires \u2013 Hamish Harding, a 58-year-old businessman who made his fortune selling private jets and holds three Guinness world records for previous extremetrips, and the British-based Pakistani businessman Shahzada Dawood, 48, who is onboard with his 19-year-old son Suleman. In an Instagram post on Saturday, Harding said that he would \u201cfinally\u201d begin the 12,500ft dive at 4am on Sunday morning and it was \u201clikely to be the first and only manned mission to the Titanic in 2023\u201d. It wasn\u2019t Harding\u2019s first trip to the bottom of the seas. He has already navigated to the deepest point in the world\u2019s oceans, the Mariana Trench, a depth of about 10,925 metres (36,000 feet) in the Pacific. Harding has also been up very high. Last year, he was one of six people onboard the fifth human flight of Jeff Bezos\u2019s Blue Origin New Shepard rocket that reached an apogee (height) of 351,000 feet (66 miles or 107 km) above earth. These adventures do not come cheap. Tickets for the Titanic submersible cost $250,000 (\u00a3195,000). The trip is organised by Oceangate, an exploration tourism company founded and run by Stockton Rush, an American multimillionaire. He is also missing, as is Paul Henri Nargeolet, the French deep-sea diver, who has visited the wreck site more than 30 times and is known as \u201cMr Titanic\u201d. A video advert for the trip says: \u201cThis is not a thrill ride for tourists, it is much more, it is an eight-day one-of-a kind experience.\u201d Aaron Newman, a software security businessman who has been on a previous Titanic dive with Oceangate, said: \u201cIt\u2019s not a ride at Disney. There\u2019s a lot of real risk involved, and there\u2019s a lot of challenges. \u201cThis is definitely one of the most interesting, unique things I have ever done. I\u2019ve been to Everest, but this is more unique, this was a dream come true. This will, no doubt, be the best experience of my entire life.\u201d A trip to space costs even more. The price of two tickets on a Blue Origin flight was a reported $2.5m. The company has declined to comment on pricing. Sir Richard Branson\u2019s space tourism company Virgin Galactic has sold more than 800 tickets at $450,000-a-piece to people who want to fly 260,000ft (80km) above Earth and experience a few minutes of zero gravity. Several companies are dedicated to tailor-making expensive trips to some of the world\u2019s last wildernesses. Patrick Woodhead, a world record-breaking polar explorer, set up White Desert Antarctica to take rich clients on luxury trips to the south pole costing up to $98,500 per person. Woodhead on Tuesday described Harding as an \u201cincredible aviation explorer in his own right\u201d and said he had \u201ctravelled with us to Antarctica a number of times, including with astronaut Buzz Aldrin\u201d. Mountaineer Garrett Madison leads trips up Mount Everest at a cost of $93,500. He boasts that even up the 8,000m mountain, his guest can expect gas-powered showers and a world class chef cooking up t-bone steak, lamb chops or salmon fillets. On a episode of US TV show Secret Lives of the Super Rich he said: \u201cIt\u2019s definitely not a cheap hobby.

The deal would have resulted in TPG decommissioning about 700 Vodafone mobile sites in order to use 3,700 Telstra mobile sites in a network-sharing agreement across 4G and 5G. It would have increased the reach of Vodafone\u2019s mobile network in regional and remote parts of Australia \u2013 increasing coverage from 96% to 98.8% of the Australian population. Telstra would have also gained access to 169 TPG sites. It was initially struck down by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission in December, and appealed by TPG and Telstra earlier this year. In an appeal judgment on Tuesday, the competition tribunal president, Justice Michael O\u2019Bryan, said while the agreement would not materially affect TPG\u2019s position in the market, it would further increase Telstra\u2019s competitive position in the market. \u201c[The] agreement provides Telstra with substantial commercial and competitive benefits and would further increase Telstra\u2019s position of market strength in mobile telecommunications markets at both the retail and wholesale levels,\u201d he said. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup O\u2019Bryan said allowing the agreement would harm competition and undermine Optus\u2019s incentives to invest in its 5G network expansion. \u201cOver time, the network quality gap between the Telstra network and the Optus network would be likely to increase,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a consequence, the competitive constraint that Optus currently imposes on Telstra would be likely to weaken, which would enable Telstra to maintain higher prices and margins than would otherwise be the case. The reduction in competitive constraint would also reduce the pressure that Telstra faces to invest in and upgrade its network.\u201d O\u2019Bryan said the ruling was specific to the Telstra and TPG agreement alone, and said other network sharing agreements would potentially be allowed to improve mobile coverage in regional Australia. He also said that the ruling was not specifically aimed at protecting Optus, but overall competition. \u201cIn circumstances where the retail market is served by three principal mobile network operators is highly concentrated, and Optus is the second largest competitor, a material reduction in the competitive constraint able to be imposed by Optus would be likely to have the effect of substantially lessening competition in the market.\u201d The Optus CEO, Kelly Bayer Rosmarin, said the company was delighted by the decision. \u201cThis reinforces the importance of infrastructure-based competition and investment in our communications sector that will have lasting benefits for regional Australia,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cThis is a good outcome for our regional communities as it will mean they will continue to benefit from competition as Optus reaffirms its commitment to providing Australia\u2019s regional communities with a strong network and great service.\u201d The Telstra chief executive, Vicki Brady, said in a statement to the Australian Stock Exchange the outcome was disappointing and Telstra would closely consider the ruling. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve tried to do is take an innovative approach to improve experiences for our customers and to answer calls from stakeholders, including governments, to provide better mobile connectivity, more coverage and more choice for our customers. The agreement with TPG would deliver these benefits almost immediately and for the long-term,\u201d Brady said. Brady said policymakers needed to rethink how radio frequency spectrum access was allocated as more and more mobile data was used. \u201cSpectrum needs to be made available to those who can use it most effectively for the benefit of customers. All mobile network operators are facing the ongoing challenge of how to provide more capacity for customers to do all the innovative things they want using our mobile networks,\u201d she said. The TPG CEO, I\u00f1aki Berroeta, said in a statement to the ASX, the ruling entrenches the status quo in regional mobile coverage. \u201cWe are not giving up on regional Australia and will consider our options as well as advocating for policy reform that will deliver greater competition and choice in the regions that need it most,\u201d he said. TPG said it would consider an appeal to the federal court. Only a summary of the ruling has been made available, with TPG and Telstra being given time to redact commercially sensitive parts of the full decision before it is released publicly."}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db56d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/21/country-diary-the-hay-harvest-has-begun-and-the-air-is-vanilla-sweet", "primaryCategory": "environment", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Country diary: The hay harvest has begun, and the air is vanilla-sweet | Kate Blincoe", "lead": "<strong>Caistor St Edmund, Norfolk:</strong> We badly need rain on the farm, just not for the next five days", "author": "Kate Blincoe", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 04:30:02", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.990812", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/e8098e8ee7e7c58e366f73886e119f15004f6ee6/0_605_4032_2419/500.jpg", "body": "Like sentinels guarding a spot, three red kites slowly stir in the sky. My eyes trace downwards to a cloud of dust swirling up like a portal. A neighbouring farm has started cutting the long grass to make hay. As the habitat is razed, wildlife will be scattering \u2013 voles, mice, deer, hares. Back at High Ash farm, my brother consults the forecast. Should he too be cutting the hay? It\u2019s a high-risk crop. Most harvests remove the produce off the land the second it is cut, safely into the barn. With hay, you leave it on the ground at the mercy of the weather, where it requires five sunny days to dry out fully. Overnight, the dismal grey cloud that has shrouded Norfolk vanishes. The decision is made to cut a few fields and the machinery roars into action. Wildlife here takes precedence. All the wildflower \u201cpollen and nectar\u201d mixes will be left untouched until late August. Early cutting of hay is not ideal from a wildlife perspective, but nature-friendly mowing practices help reduce the impact. This includes cutting the field from the centre outwards, and having other uncut fields where animals can flee to. By contrast, in my dad\u2019s boyhood, terriers and lurchers would have been on hand to catch escaping creatures. Later, as I stroll across the freshly mown field, just a solitary red kite overhead, I inhale that distinctive sweet, almost vanilla hay aroma that epitomises summer. The scent is known as \u201ccoumarin\u201d and is found in sweet vernal grass. It becomes more aromatic as it dries. Coumarin has even been synthesised for use in best-selling designer fragrances. Going back a century or so, half this farm was hay crop, grown to fuel the working horses that laboured on the land. Today, it is needed for leisure horses. The irony is that many owners will need to soak the nutritious, energy-rich hay to remove sugars and avoid overweight horses. This summer, we\u2019re heading into drought conditions, with young trees already dead or showing signs of stress. But just for a few days we stop hoping for rain.

As a massive sports nut and also acknowledged Swiftie, this was a banner news morning. And for someone who has written on how household spending has hit a few speed bumps, the Taylor Swift tour also raises a few possibilities. Swiftonomics is currently surging across the US, with economists pondering the impact of her tour dates on spending and inflation and overall GDP. In Canada, Peter Armstrong asked: \u201cIs Taylor Swift saving the economy?\u201d Given \u2013 as I noted when reporting on the latest GDP figures \u2013 household spending is slowing at a rapid rate, and both Treasury and the RBA are forecasting GDP per capita is declining, will Taylor come to save us from a recession? The reason why Swifties are able to power such spending is not just the concert ticket sales \u2013 though these will be massive. If we take Ed Sheeran\u2019s concerts at the MCG in March, we can pretty much lock in 100,000 for both of the dates in Melbourne and around 80,000 for the three concerts at Accor Stadium in Sydney. Given the ticket prices range from $349.90 to $1,249.90, and tickets start at $79.90 but rise to $379.90 for a spot in A Reserve, we know even with a median of $120 in sales, we are looking at about $55m being spent. But it does not end there: at $70 a pop for a tour T-shirt, there will be a heck of a lot spent on merchandise. Of course, not much of this will remain in Australia. There\u2019s a reason this world tour will possibly make Swift a billionaire. But the spending will also be for hotels, eating out, travel and just general spending around town. Only holding concerts in Sydney and Melbourne means Swifties will be coming from other states and New Zealand, given there are no concerts to be held there, so that is some \u201cexport\u201d dollars for tourism. That will not be unwelcome given tourism numbers continue to struggle to get back to pre-pandemic levels. If the graph does not display click here The good news is the impact of the five concerts will not likely spur inflation \u2013 at least not in a manner that will affect interest rates. But you can certainly expect an increase in the prices of hotels in Sydney and Melbourne on those nights. I did a quick check of prices at a Sydney hotel I have previously stayed at near Central station. On the Friday night of 16 February you can book a room with two double beds for $325. But if you want to book the following Friday \u2013 the night of Taylor\u2019s first concert \u2013 you will have to pay $816. That\u2019s a 150% Taylor Swift markup. As I write, the air fares from Adelaide to Sydney have not changed for that weekend, but you wouldn\u2019t want to wait too long, given the experience of events like AFL grand finals. The Reserve Bank will, however, know that this is a one-off, but the spending will still happen. A good example of how one-off events can affect spending is the releases of the iPhone 6 and X in 2014 and 2017. Both times this one release caused a massive jump in sales of electronic goods. If the graph does not display click here The iPhone 6 saw a $150m jump in sales and it permanently raised the level of spending for that category of goods. Taylor Swift won\u2019t have the same ongoing impact. Hotels are not going to be able to charge Taylor Swift prices when she is not in town, and accommodation spending shows up in the national accounts rather than retail trade, so we likely will not see much of a bump. For those working in hospitality in Sydney and Melbourne, given the concerts are in February after the usual end of the summer boom, there will likely be a few more shifts to go around. But music and money are not unusual bedfellows. After all, the Beatles actually received their MBE for their services to export revenues. Taylor Swift might not be saving our economy but given by February households are expected to have significantly slowed their spending, for those working and operating in hospitality it will mean, at least for those in our two major cities, Christmas in February.

The disclosure prompted calls for the \u201cscandal\u201d of out of area placements in mental health care to end, with claims that it represents \u201canother broken government promise on the NHS\u201d. Chronic shortages of mental health beds have for years forced the health service in England to send hundreds of patients a month to be admitted for care, sometimes a long way from their own area. But in 2016 ministers and NHS bosses committed to end the use of \u201cinappropriate\u201d placements \u2013 those caused by a lack of beds and for which there is no clinical justification \u2013 by the end of March 2021, after an outcry over the damage they cause. Mental health campaigners, psychiatrists and patients\u2019 families have argued that being far from home can make already vulnerable patients feel isolated, deprive them of regular visits from relatives, increase the risk of self-harm and reduce their chances of making a recovery. Analysis of NHS data by the Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCP) has found that 8,925 new \u201cinappropriate\u201d placements occurred between April 2021 and March this year. Of those, 5,335 involved a patient being sent at least 100km (62 miles) from home. An average of 12 new placements a day started during that time, despite the pledge. \u201cIt\u2019s appalling that the government have not brought an end to the scandal of out of area mental health placements, two years after the deadline they gave themselves for doing exactly that\u201d, said Rosena Allin-Khan, the shadow cabinet minister for mental health, who is also an NHS doctor. \u201cTwo years on, this is another disgraceful broken promise on the NHS, with patients suffering far away from their loved ones and support networks.\u201d Since April 2021, a total of 695 patients \u2013 one in 14 of the total \u2013 have been sent to a mental health unit at least 300km (186 miles) away, according to the RCP\u2019s findings. They included one patient who was taken 605km (378 miles) away from their home in Plymouth, Devon to a residential psychiatric unit in Darlington, Durham in March due to the beds crisis. Dr Andrew Molodynski, a psychiatrist and the British Medical Association\u2019s (BMA) health policy lead, said: \u201cIt is shameful that mental health patients are being routinely let down by this government, who are now two years past their target of ending the practice of sending patients out of area for treatment by March 2021, and still failing miserably. \u201cThis isolating and dehumanising practice is a direct consequence of a fragmented and underfunded mental health care system that has been letting patients down for far too long,\u201d he added. The RCP and the BMA have written to Maria Caulfield, the mental health minister, recommending a major expansion of community-based services to help reduce the number of people ending up in a mental health crisis and needing inpatient care in the first place. Dr Adrian James, the RCP\u2019s president, said: \u201cThis unacceptable practice \u2026 risks patients\u2019 mental health to such a degree that they often remain in hospital for longer.\u201d The Department of Health and Social Care did not respond directly to the new figures. But a spokesperson insisted that it did still intend to end out of area care. \u201cEveryone should have access to safe mental health care close to home, and we are committed to ending inappropriate out of area placements for adult patients,\u201d they said. \u201cWe\u2019re investing an extra \u00a32.3bn per year in mental health services by March 2024, so that an additional 2 million people can get the support they need and investing an extra \u00a3150m to help people experiencing a mental health crisis.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db570", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jun/21/joanna-lumley-acting-travel-hatred-sex-scenes-we-had-take-our-tops-off", "primaryCategory": "culture", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018We all had to take our tops off\u2019: Joanna Lumley on acting, travel \u2013 and her hatred of sex scenes", "lead": "Born in India to a military family, Lumley found fame as a model and actor in the 1960s.

She has just tried and failed to open the windows of the hotel room in which we meet. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t bear the thought of a year without a suitcase.\u201d Lumley has become almost as known for her travel programmes as for her acting roles \u2013 though nothing, of course, will ever eclipse her gloriously awful Patsy Stone in the 90s comedy Absolutely Fabulous \u2013 and recently has been off again. This time she journeys from Indonesia to Jordan, via India, Zanzibar and Madagascar, for the four-part ITV series Joanna Lumley\u2019s Spice Trail Adventure. As ever, she is a great travel companion \u2013 enthusiastic about everything, beautifully polite and kind to everyone she meets \u2013 and I suspect you will never view your spice rack in the same blase way again after watching her programme. Hold a nutmeg in your hand and you are holding, according to one version of history, the kernel of the British empire. We\u2019ll get on to imperialism, but for now, Lumley talks with wonder about all the places she got to go to. \u201cI kept thinking, this is the very tippy-top, then you see something else.\u201d She loved visiting Madagascar. Also, \u201cthe Banda islands [in Indonesia] in general, and Hampi [the Unesco world heritage site in India]. It was huge, second to Rome, the richest city 2,000 years ago, with its temples and palaces. That was fascinating. I loved the backwaters of Goa, and all those people who step into a boat as quickly as you would jump on a bike, but you go by river, trading and travelling \u2013 the beauty of that.\u201d The spice trail is the story of colonialism, and the tone of that conversation has changed in the years since Lumley last made a travel programme. It is, of course, covered in this show \u2013 to an extent. \u201cBeing in this country, and being of this country, we hear about our own colonialism, but what you forget is the European colonialism which went to the far east to get these treasured spices,\u201d says Lumley. The brutalism, she says, shocked her very much. Lumley was born in Srinagar, India, the daughter of a soldier, in the last days of the British Raj \u2013 the partition, in 1947, came the year after she was born \u2013 and her family had a history in the country, and therefore the British empire, going back more than 200 years. Did making this show make her think more about that? Her father was in the army, as were others including her great-great-great-grandfather \u2013 in the 19th century, he was a major-general in the Bengal army, essentially the armed wing of the East India Company, the corporation described by the historian William Dalrymple in his book The Anarchy as \u201can aggressive colonial power\u201d with \u201craving territorial appetites\u201d. Lumley pauses and leans forward. \u201cDid you want to talk about this?\u201d I was interested in how she felt about that now. \u201cWhat can I say? These great-great-great-great-people in the distance. I don\u2019t know anything about them except that, as you have kindly pointed out, they were there. As we were all somewhere. My great-great-great uncle built a cathedral in what was then called Calcutta, Kolkata now. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s an evil thing to do in a Hindu country. Luckily, we now have Hindu temples here, so maybe it\u2019s sort of balanced. I\u2019m not a colonialist.\u201d That is, she says, what she thinks I\u2019m trying to say. \u201cDo you think I\u2019m a Tory toff?\u201d I don\u2019t, but I also don\u2019t understand how she can make these programmes without personally, if not publicly, considering the involvement of her forebears, or their legacy. I suspect she may think that what is more important now is to be, as she is, a kind and decent person \u2013 one who fights for the rights of retired Gurkha soldiers, and who has been an activist for animal welfare for decades, which contributed to her damehood last year \u2013 and that whatever horror some distant ancestor oversaw has nothing to do with her. From what little I know of her politics, she supports the Green party when she can. But it is a relevant subject, given her show, I point out. She softens, happier to talk in generalities. \u201cIt was this idea of the Europeans that you had to have stuff,\u201d she says. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t trade, you had to own these islands. It was a land grab.\u201d As she will know, the conversation about reparations is becoming louder. \u201cI don\u2019t know where you stop,\u201d she says. \u201cWho are you going to pay? Who are you going to say sorry to? I don\u2019t know who you give the money to now. I believe the reparation we can do is to change the way that we behave. The best thing we can put money into is education. If we taught people better, they\u2019d understand better, but education is very low on everybody\u2019s list.\u201d Education in general is, she says, the main thing she is interested in. \u201cWe think that you can get stuff off screens now. That\u2019s not education, that\u2019s getting answers, and you don\u2019t know how you got there. Some schools don\u2019t have libraries! They say you can access it on the web; you can\u2019t. So I\u2019m afraid we\u2019re stalking quite quickly back into the dark ages, but we volunteered to go there.\u201d Lumley was born, she says, \u201cin a suitcase\u201d. After Indian independence, the family went to Hong Kong, then Malaysia, and when she was eight, Lumley was sent to boarding school in England. She always wanted to be an actor, she says: \u201cI was a clown and a fool and an entertainer.\u201d She was rejected by the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts (Rada) while she was still at school. \u201cI knew I wouldn\u2019t get in because I could hear people doing [vocal exercising]. I\u2019d never done that, I\u2019d just been in a school play.\u201d Instead, she moved to London and became a model, which became \u201ca back window, as it were, and you climb in\u201d. Was she aware, as it was unfolding, that London in the 60s was amazing? \u201cOh God, yes. This was about 1964 and it was miniskirts, and Mary Quant, and the Beatles. If you were lucky enough to be taken to a nightclub, quite often the Beatles and the Rolling Stones would be there. It was normal.\u201d But she wasn\u2019t, she says, \u201creally in with the \u2018in crowd\u2019\u201d. She felt slightly outside, with an observer\u2019s view, mentally \u201crecording it, thinking how funny things were. And lots of it, of course, was useful for Patsy \u2013 remembering the insanity of those days, when Patsy had been a model and hung out with the rock crowd.\u201d When Lumley was 21, she gave birth to her son, Jamie (she had separated from his father, the photographer Michael Claydon; later, in 1986, Lumley married the conductor Stephen Barlow). There was a lot of stigma around being a single mother then, but less so for Lumley, she thinks. \u201cI came from a loving family, was in the arts world where people aren\u2019t quite so picky about things like that, and everybody couldn\u2019t have been sweeter to me. But I\u2019m terribly aware \u2026 how cruel the world was.\u201d She did get, she says, \u201cthe odd horrible remark, but not a lot. I was lucky.\u201d But life as a single mother, and trying to work, was tough in other ways and Lumley burnt out in her 20s, a period followed by a six-month recovery. She was 30 when she got her role as Purdey in The New Avengers, the ITV action series; before that, she\u2019d had small parts in shows including Coronation Street and Steptoe and Son, and appeared briefly in the 1969 Bond film On Her Majesty\u2019s Secret Service. The New Avengers changed her life, she says. \u201cIt was a proper big part in a series, made over the course of two years, so you have a real chance to get into a character and work all the time.\u201d Until that point, she had also battled the prejudice that she wasn\u2019t a proper actor because she had been a model. \u201cIt\u2019s the worst thing you could have been. They thought models couldn\u2019t speak, couldn\u2019t learn anything. So all that longing to do Shakespeare, it evaporates.\u201d She smiles. \u201cBut listen, either you can be mopey and sad about it, or you just go: \u2018I\u2019ll do whatever comes.\u2019\u201d She doesn\u2019t, she says later, hold on to bitterness or resentment about anything. In her 2004 memoir, she wrote about the expectation for actresses to strip. \u201cOh, everybody stripped,\u201d she says now. \u201cEverybody had to, from Diana Rigg to Julie Christie, we all had to take at least our tops off in something. It was standard and it was this, \u2018You\u2019re not a real actress unless you take your top off.\u2019 Nobody liked it, like nobody likes intimate kissing or sex scenes. All this ghastly stuff we have to pretend to do. Everybody knows it\u2019s pretending and it\u2019s kind of soft porn, and now we\u2019ve got coaches to teach us how to do it. Thank God I\u2019m beyond it now.\u201d Intimacy coordinators, she thinks, are \u201cprobably a nice thing\u201d but she\u2019d prefer sex scenes to be cut altogether. \u201cI find them intolerable! I think they\u2019re revolting, I don\u2019t know why people write them and I don\u2019t know why we watch them.\u201d She laughs. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have films of people sitting on the loo. There are some things which are private.\u201d How did she feel about being made to feel she had to go topless? \u201cYou do it with hatred. Not hatred, but sort of sullenly.\u201d Did it feel exploitative? \u201cOh, it always is,\u201d she says breezily. \u201cBut there are lots of other things you have to do in life which are horrible, and you never wanted to do them, and you find yourself caught up with them. Also remember, the world \u2026\u201d She pauses. \u201cWe [had been] four girls sharing a flat but we weren\u2019t allowed to sign the lease \u2013 a man had to. Men were always paid more, always top dog, and you could be sacked from a film if you didn\u2019t take your top off. So then a lot of people go, \u2018Shall I just take my top off and remain in the film?\u2019 It was a different world.\u201d She says she didn\u2019t feel vulnerable to the casting couch, as many other actresses did at that time, though there was sexual harassment everywhere. \u201cAt the tube, in the pub, in the shops, there was always whistling, bottom pinching, overfamiliar hand on shoulder, it happened all the time. You get used to it, you know how to do that.\u201d She pretends to slap a hand away. \u201cOr move away. You deal with it.\u201d Lumley seems resolutely resistant to complaining about any of it. In her early career, she often played, \u201ca \u2018pretty girl\u2019 or a secretary\u201d. She mentions her role as an attractive lab assistant in a 1987 episode of The Two Ronnies, \u201cwith a very stuffed-up-with-cushions chest. It\u2019s not funny now; now people say, \u2018How could you have done that?\u2019 You say, \u2018It was the Two Ronnies, and it was funny.\u2019 But lots of things aren\u2019t funny at all now, or not even tolerated.\u201d She has no time for the box-ticking style of inclusion. \u201cI don\u2019t think of Porridge and think, \u2018There should have been some women in that.\u2019 You go, \u2018No, it\u2019s about a men\u2019s jail.\u2019 We\u2019ve got to keep some part of our brain still active.\u201d I get the sense that she feels some aspects of political correctness have got in the way of human relationships, and that in Lumley\u2019s world, kindness and good intentions are paramount. \u201cI just think we\u2019ve made everybody uneasy,\u201d she had said earlier. \u201cWhereas we used to just be kind and friendly and helpful, we\u2019re afraid now about a lot of things that we\u2019re somehow crossing a line.\u201d Lumley and Absolutely Fabulous creator Jennifer Saunders have previously said the sitcom \u2013 which began more than 30 years ago \u2013 could not be made today because people are too quick to take offence. Maybe the drinking and smoking, casual approach to sexual assault and fat-shaming would get it cancelled now. In other ways, it still feels ahead of its time, not least in the sheer delight it took in its monstrous and unrepentant female characters. \u201cThey are women without brakes. It doesn\u2019t matter what they do, they don\u2019t care,\u201d Lumley says. \u201cI think people found that refreshing because women were usually anxious about things.\u201d Although she is quick to praise Saunders, and others on the show \u2013 \u201cYou\u2019re working with gold dust\u201d \u2013 Lumley was so perfect as Patsy that it\u2019s impossible to imagine anyone playing her better. It took her closer to who she wanted to be as a child. \u201cIt was back to clowning again,\u201d she says, \u201cback to making people laugh.\u201d \u2022 Joanna Lumley\u2019s Spice Trail Adventure is at 9pm on 5 July 9pm, ITV and ITVX"}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db571", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/21/lawyer-x-special-investigator-wants-own-office-abolished-over-dpps-refusal-to-lay-charges", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Lawyer X special investigator wants own office abolished over DPP\u2019s refusal to lay charges", "lead": "Geoffrey Nettle says Victoria\u2019s director of public prosecutions rejected his call for several key figures to face criminal action", "author": "Benita Kolovos", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 02:40:43", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.990886", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/bd4f82ae2759e5c48ef6582e6384b2cc37aa2f6f/0_0_2201_1321/500.jpg", "body": "Victoria\u2019s Lawyer X special investigator has threatened to quit because the director of public prosecutions refuses to charge several key figures involved in the scandal, including police officers. In a report tabled in state parliament on Wednesday, special investigator Geoffrey Nettle called for his office to be disbanded or he would resign, citing frustration with the director of public prosecutions (DPP), Kerri Judd, for refusing to approve criminal charges. \u2018\u2018In light of the director\u2019s past refusal of permission for OSI [office of the special investigator] to file charges of relevant offences \u2026 I consider that there is no longer any point in OSI persisting with investigating,\u201d Nettle, a former high court judge, wrote. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The OSI was created after a recommendation by the Lawyer X royal commission to investigate laying criminal charges against those involved in the scheme that saw gangland lawyer Nicola Gobbo recruited by police to inform on her own clients. The OSI was not given the power to prosecute cases itself, instead requiring the office of public prosecutions (OPP) to do so on its behalf. The use of Gobbo as an informer broke the convention of lawyer-client privilege and resulted in the overturning of three criminal convictions, including against drug kingpin Tony Mokbel. Nettle said during January 2022 the OSI had identified eight matters that it felt warranted prosecution and compiled a 5,000-page brief of evidence that included \u201cmany hours of audio recordings and multiple witness statements\u201d. \u201cEach of those eight matters concerned multiple suspected offenders in relation to a range of facts traversing a period of more than nine years,\u201d Nettle wrote. The OSI asked the OPP to file charges of attempting to pervert the course of justice against five identified persons in the brief of evidence, believing it had \u201cestablished a powerful case of offending\u201d. But in March 2023 Judd notified the OSI that \u201cshe had determined that a charge sheet should not be filed\u201d. Her justification, according to Nettle, was that \u201cshe did not consider that there was a reasonable prospect of conviction\u201d against the five alleged offenders. Nettle also revealed the OSI had compiled a brief of evidence against one individual over a perjury charge but the OPP had refused to prosecute the case, in part due to the personal circumstances of the alleged offender and the strong chance a non-custodial sentence would be imposed. The alleged offender went on to leave the jurisdiction, \u201cmaking it pointless to proceed with the brief\u201d, Nettle wrote. He said he met with the Victorian attorney general, Jaclyn Symes, on 1 June and told her he considered the chances of the DPP \u201capproving any brief of evidence that OSI might submit were effectively nil\u201d. \u201cAny further investigation of relevant offences by OSI appeared to me to be a waste of time and resources and that I believed that the appropriate course was to recommend to parliament that OSI be wound up,\u201d the report states. Nettle said if the government decided the OSI should continue he would resign, \u201cso that someone whose views more closely accord to the director\u2019s position may be appointed in my place\u201d. In a letter explaining her decision, attached to the report, Judd noted that Gobbo was registered as a police informant in 1995 and that most of the resulting alleged wrongdoing occurred between 1999 and 2009. \u201cAccordingly, a hypothetical trial would likely proceed some 15-25 years after the event it concerns,\u201d Judd wrote. \u201cThe passage of time will undoubtedly have a significant bearing on the prospects of conviction.\u201d She also noted police involved would be able to run a defence that \u201cany wrong or improper decisions \u2026 were made in good faith in an effort to solve and prevent serious criminality\u201d. The shadow attorney general, Michael O\u2019Brien, called for the OSI to be given powers to lay charges itself, describing the allegations made by Nettle in his report as \u201cvery concerning\u201d. \u201cThese are things that go to the heart of the justice system in this state. If people committed those offences, they should be held accountable for them,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. In a statement, the OPP said it was considering a response to Nettle\u2019s special report and \u201cwill respond in due course\u201d. Symes said laying charges was a \u201cserious step\u201d and needed to be \u201csupported by the most robust brief of evidence possible to ensure it holds up in court\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s critical that the office of the public prosecutions operates independently of government and statutory bodies like the investigator \u2013 to preserve and uphold this high benchmark,\u201d she said."}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db572", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/20/hunter-biden-plea-deal-republicans-donald-trump", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Republicans crying wolf over Hunter Biden have hurt their own cause", "lead": "The GOP is obsessed with the president\u2019s son, but the party\u2019s attacks make it difficult to discern legitimate concern from crazy conspiracies", "author": "David Smith in Washington", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 00:57:16", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.990903", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/7a545bacc0b45324a6782dd8863977a3e21dc0cd/0_0_2647_1589/500.jpg", "body": "\u201cSweetheart deal!\u201d \u201cTwo-tiered justice!\u201d \u201cMere traffic ticket!\u201d Republicans had their applause lines ready on Tuesday when Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter struck a plea deal over unpaid taxes, and gun possession while being a drug user, that is likely to keep him out of prison. But the Grand Old Party is like the Boy Who Cried Wolf. It has churned through so many wild allegations against the \u201cBiden crime family\u201d that its moment of self-righteous indignation risks getting lost in the noise. Presidents\u2019 families are inescapably part of the political package, often seen at their side at campaign events or state occasions. There have been past scandals involving Richard Nixon\u2019s brother Don, who was rescued from business failures by the eccentric businessman Howard Hughes, George H W Bush\u2019s son Neil, who directed a failed savings and loan, and Bill Clinton\u2019s half-brother Roger, who spent time in prison for a cocaine conviction. In such cases, it would be reasonable for any neutral observer to ask whether the commander-in-chief\u2019s family has received special treatment. Tuesday\u2019s court filing showed that Hunter, 53, will plead guilty to failing to pay more than $100,000 in taxes in both 2017 and 2018 after making more than $1.5m each year. He therefore avoids the politically nightmarish spectacle of a trial and is unlikely to spend time in jail based on the tax loss amount, his status as a first-time offender and his willingness to accept responsibility for his actions. Legal experts were less shocked than Republicans would have liked. The former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani, president of West Coast Trial Lawyers, says: \u201cPlea deals are very common in federal cases with just a very small number actually going to trial \u2013 only about 2%. Deals done this quickly are much less common and diversion deals are even rarer, but these sorts of charges are generally worked out in plea deals for the most part, so I don\u2019t find it unusual.\u201d Hunter also reached a probation agreement with the justice department that could enable him to avoid a conviction that he illegally possessed a Colt Cobra revolver in Delaware in October 2018 while \u201cknowing that he was an unlawful user of and addicted to a controlled substance\u201d. The former federal prosecutor Christine Adams, a partner at Los Angeles-based Adams, Duerk &amp; Kamenstein, says: \u201cIt is not uncommon for the DoJ [Department of Justice] to make these kinds of deals. When crimes are related solely to someone\u2019s addiction and not to some larger scheme and the individual is a first-time offender, DoJ may take these factors into account and offer the individual pre-trial diversion.\u201d It should also be noted that the charges resulted from a five-year investigation by David Weiss, the US attorney in Delaware \u2013 appointed by former president Donald Trump. Predictably, however, Republicans cried foul, arguing that Hunter \u2013 who has worked as a lobbyist, lawyer, consultant to foreign companies, investment banker and artist \u2013 had received favourable treatment because of his dad. Trump, recently indicted on federal criminal charges that he unlawfully kept national security documents when he left office, wrote on his Truth Social platform: \u201cWow! The corrupt Biden DOJ just cleared up hundreds of years of criminal liability by giving Hunter Biden a mere \u2018traffic ticket.\u2019 Our system is BROKEN!\u201d Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, also running for president, decried the \u201csweetheart deal\u201d and tweeted that, were Biden \u201cnot connected to the elite DC class he would have been put in jail a long time ago\u201d. Such attacks were amplified endlessly by Fox News, rightwing media and commentators such as Tucker Carlson, drawing a false equivalence with Trump\u2019s extremely different case. Notably, Hunter Biden has also never been a public official. Congressman James Comer, the Republican chair of the House of Representatives oversight committee, vowed to continue to investigate Hunter and the rest of the family \u2013 while turning a blind eye to allegations that Trump\u2019s children Ivanka, Don Jr and Eric and son-in-law Jared Kushner profited off their time in the White House. But Republicans have proved their own worst enemy by flooding the zone with attacks on Hunter, making it hard to discern legitimate concerns from crazed conspiracy theories about his business dealings in China and Ukraine. The fixation seems a kind of displacement. Republicans have never found targets as rich as Barack Obama, the first Black president, or Hillary Clinton, who aimed to the be the first female president. Biden never excited the base in the same way. Hunter and his troubles are a poor substitute. Trump\u2019s ravings about Hunter\u2019s laptop in the 2020 election failed to capture the dark magic of \u201cLock her up!\u201d four years earlier. Republicans have sought to raise questions about Biden\u2019s knowledge of his son\u2019s activities in Ukraine and China but never made a compelling connection. When Hunter described in a 2021 memoir dealing with substance abuse issues, including crack cocaine use and alcoholism, Republican attempts to exploit it again backfired. Many voters shrugged or expressed empathy, perhaps connecting with struggles in their own families. Nevertheless, the constant attacks might take a toll on Biden, who embodies the maxim that grief is the price we pay for love. His son Beau died in 2015 of cancer and his daughter Naomi Biden died as an infant after a car accident that also killed Biden\u2019s first wife.

Canberra\u2019s minimum temperature of -7.2C was its lowest since 2018 and the lowest for June since 1986, according to Ben Domensino, a meteorologist at Weatherzone. Sydney CBD\u2019s minimum temperature of 5.2C was the city\u2019s coldest June morning since 2010, Domensino said. The apparent (felt) temperature was below freezing, getting down to -1.4C in Sydney and -10C in Canberra, according the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM). Newcastle hit 4.3C shortly after 7am, its coldest morning in 23 years, Domensino said. Melbourne dropped to 4.2\u00b0C, which was its lowest temperature since September last year. Outside the capital cities, several places registered their lowest temperature in five years. \u201cBathurst (-7.5C), Mudgee (-6.9C), Orange (-6.6C), Dubbo (-4.7C), Campbelltown (-1.6C), Casino (-0.2C) and Gayndah (0.3C) all had their coldest morning in five years,\u201d Domensino said. \u201cPerisher Valley\u2019s -10.1\u00baC was Australia\u2019s lowest June temperature since 2019.

Miriam Bradbury, a senior meteorologist at the BoM, said Wednesday morning appeared to be the coolest of what had been very chilly conditions the entire week due to a very cold front moving across the south-east. The BoM forecast widespread areas below zero across inland Victoria, inland NSW in some parts of south-east Queensland on Wednesday. In Victoria the BoM predicted alpine areas would plunge below -5C, with -8C at Mount Hotham. \u201cBy Thursday, Friday, going into the weekend, it\u2019s coming much closer than average, even pushing a degree or two above average in some parts,\u201d Bradbury said."}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db574", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/21/i-am-an-oncologist-can-chatgpt-help-me-deliver-bad-news-to-a-patient", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "subCategories": "test", "title": "I am an oncologist.

No. How about your appetite? OK. Tired? I\u2019m managing. Anyone could administer the checklist, but I know that what she really hopes is that with her as my passenger, I might be able to steer the ship of uncertainty to a safe harbour. \u201cWill I see you again?\u201d Even my response comes from a checklist. \u201cWe can try but the public system is not always accommodating.\u201d My patient is stoic on the outside, but no doubt suffering on the inside. I can\u2019t let her leave the room like this. \u201cIs there anything else you would like to talk about?\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t have time.\u201d \u201cI have time.\u201d Suddenly the tears are coming. \u201cI guess you can\u2019t say how long I have got.\u201d My throat catches. How easy it would have been to fulfil the transactional routine and see her go home with the real issue untouched. Although I have broken bad news countless times, I cast around in my mind to find the right words. An old memory jars me. I am a trainee attending a communication skills program funded by the National Cancer Institute. In small groups led by an expert faculty, we are taught how to be more compassionate and communicative oncologists. Professional actors appear at different stages of their illness: we learn to talk to them using roadmaps to attend to the patients\u2019 priorities, spot opportunities for empathy and use silence with skill. On the final day, there is an exam. My simulated patient is a middle-aged man with advanced cancer who has exhausted all treatment options. I have got this, I think. Break the news gently but honestly to avoid confusion later. Pause. Look for cues. Use empathy. I can see this must be hard for you. Be honest. I too wish things were different. Above all, don\u2019t be clever, just be human. The clock starts. \u201cSo, doc, there is nothing else?\u201d The man\u2019s face crumples, and he starts crying. Actual tears. My pulse quickens. \u201cI am sorry.\u201d \u201cBut I have so much to live for.\u201d We could look at other treatments elsewhere. Stop, I can\u2019t say that. Silence. Interminable silence. \u201cAnd the holiday with my grandkids \u2026\u201d Seize the cue. Give him hope. Ask what he might do on the holiday. The learning is there but my words stick. We dance around metaphors. Thank God, I think, the man isn\u2019t truly sick. The feedback is brutal. From the time he met me, my patient felt bad. Unable to connect, burdened by my discomfort. How easy it was to destroy human spirit, even while pretending. Today, a gradually acquired repertoire of language and experience allows me to hold my nerve and help my patient discover a glimmer of hope and even relief, but I reflect on all the times I must have let patients down in the process of learning through trial and error. Communication errors are the most cited underlying cause of complaints in the Australian healthcare system. In one survey 85% of patients valued compassion over cost and waiting time. In the same survey, doctors agreed that compassion in medicine trumped cognitive prowess, observing that doctors who communicated well were more likely to have compliant patients. Given the unquestionable importance of doctor-patient communication it is surprising how little time goes in to teaching doctors to do it well. Training programs are scarce and considered optional; participants are self-selected; and sporadic instruction tends to have a temporary effect. Despite the evidence that communication is a learned skill, an ossified belief that doctors \u201ceither have it or they don\u2019t\u201d allows institutions to avoid tackling the issue with as much energy as say, falls prevention or hand hygiene. If I were a young doctor navigating today\u2019s challenging world of medicine, I would desperately want someone to help me get the communication right, knowing it is the key to patient satisfaction and professional longevity. As an older doctor, I would love an occasional coach and critic to save me from complacency and bad habits. Alas, to advocate for this kind of help for patients, amid a host of competing priorities, is like wanting a trip to the moon when the trains are down. Enter ChatGPT. I confess I am a latecomer to ChatGPT, cautiously viewing it as a competing columnist, although I am satisfied that it is not yet replacing me as an oncologist. But after reading a recent article, I recall my patient and type in a series of prompts: I am an oncologist, help me deliver bad news. What can I get wrong with my communication? I need tips to support my patients receiving bad news. The responses are detailed and helpful. They contain reminders to take time, avoid jargon, acknowledge emotion and be sensitive. There is sound advice but also specific language to consider, my favourite being: \u201cBefore we proceed, I want to make sure you are comfortable having this conversation now. Make sure to stop me. We can take this at your pace.\u201d I am embarrassed that I can\u2019t remember the last time I said those words, the patient\u2019s agenda easily hijacked by something else. Some might warn against an overreliance on artificial intelligence to do innately human tasks and indeed, the essence of good medicine is human connection. But everywhere you look, the obstacles in the way are causing moral distress. Sure, ChatGPT won\u2019t fix the doctor shortage. It won\u2019t resolve existential grief, offer a healing touch, or sense the tears and be ready with the tissues. But so long as there is no wave of humans with the time and expertise to teach doctors how to get better at giving bad news, I will be telling my trainees to open another browser and chat to ChatGPT in times of need. Rather a patient rescued with a little help from a chatbot than one devastated by a doctor. \u2022 Ranjana Srivastava is an Australian oncologist, award-winning author and Fulbright scholar.

In a report published on Wednesday morning, the commission argued that the use of hotels to incarcerate people remained a \u201cregularised\u201d part of Australia\u2019s immigration infrastructure, rather than a measure of last resort, even though the number of people detained \u2013 and the length of their detention \u2013 has steadily decreased.

Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The report found the negative mental health impacts of hotel detention grew progressively worse the longer confinement continued, and often exacerbated earlier traumas. \u201cHotels are not designed to detain people and lack the facilities required to properly care for a person\u2019s basic needs,\u201d said the human rights commissioner, Lorraine Finlay. \u201cPeople are cooped up all day, mostly confined to their rooms with little or nothing to do. Their windows don\u2019t fully open, they have limited social contact, their living arrangements don\u2019t allow privacy, there is no room to meet visitors, very few facilities, scant living space, and in some hotels there is no outdoor space.\u201d Finlay inspected detention hotels with Prof Suresh Sundram, the head of the department of psychiatry at Monash University, and found \u201centrenched boredom, loneliness, frustration and apathy\u201d among detainees. Some reported they felt they were better off in prison or immigration detention centres, where they had access to activities, exercise and fresh air. Finlay said: \u201cOne person told us: \u2018The sole purpose of being here seems to be to torture. To be made to suffer like this \u2026 two or three years ago I could think about life outside but now I am not capable of envisaging outside at all. I have no imagination, everything is blurry.\u2019\u201d Government figures show the number of people held in Alternative Places of Detention (Apods) \u2013 which also includes aged care and mental health inpatient facilities \u2013 has fallen from more than 100 in early 2022, to just over 40. Finlay welcomed that development and said the commission recognised the department faced a \u201cdifficult and complex\u201d task in managing detention. \u201cHowever, I am concerned by the fact that the use of [Apods] has become regularised within Australia\u2019s immigration detention system, rather than being limited to exceptional circumstances.\u201d The commission also reiterated concerns about the use of restraints, including handcuffs, when moving people outside detention hotels. The use of handcuffs has caused people to refuse transfers to vital medical appointments. The commission\u2019s report made 24 recommendations. In response the Department of Home Affairs agreed with two, disagreed with five, and noted the remaining 17. The department said it worked to minimise the use of hotels as places of detention. \u201cThe department\u2026 is actively working to reduce its reliance on hotel Apods for the placement of immigration detainees in held detention,\u201d the department said in its formal response. It said decisions on where to detain people were made on a case-by-case basis, but that \u201cfor some detainees, Apod accommodation is the most appropriate placement option for their circumstances\u201d. \u201cThe use of hotel Apods for detainee placements is always premised on the shortest possible time and has significantly reduced.\u201d The Australian Human Rights Commission recommended the department change its policies surrounding the use of force, to consider the health impacts on a detained person who refused to be moved off-site for a medical or other appointment, if that move required restraints, such as handcuffs. \u201cThe department acknowledges the commission\u2019s concerns relating to the use of mechanical restraints applied on people in detention who are taken off-site for routine and planned medical appointments and other non-urgent appointments, however disagrees with [that] recommendation.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db576", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/21/taylor-swift-australia-tour-tickets-to-go-on-sale-for-concerts-in-melbourne-and-sydney", "primaryCategory": "music", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Taylor Swift Australia Eras tour: tickets to go on sale for 2024 concerts in Melbourne and Sydney", "lead": "Pop superstar to perform The Eras Tour with shows at MCG and Accor Stadium in February 2024", "author": "Natasha May", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 23:09:09", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.990977", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/e27910d674a4a0cd7489b7a1b117e8bd24bcc0ad/0_189_2839_1704/500.jpg", "body": "It will be a cruel summer for Australian fans of Taylor Swift as they wait until the dying days of the season to see the singer-songwriter grace stages in Sydney and Melbourne.

The businesses were also forced to pay out \u00a34.9m to about 63,000 workers left out of pocket after violations of the rules were uncovered by inspectors at HMRC, varying from breaches related to asking workers to pay for aspects of their uniform to paying the incorrect apprenticeship rate. The 200 companies included fashion brands, car washes, hotels and takeaway businesses. The government said the decision showed that companies that did not pay staff properly would \u201cface the consequences\u201d. The legal minimum wage for those aged 23 and over rose to \u00a310.42 an hour in April, up from \u00a39.50, with the absolute minimum hourly rate now \u00a35.28, which applies to apprentices or under-18s. WH Smith, which was at the top of the list of those that fell short on payments, was found to have owed 17,607 workers more than \u00a31m, or \u00a358 each. The company said the mis-payment was identified as part of a 2019 review by HMRC, which found WH Smith, along with several other retailers, had misinterpreted how statutory wage regulations applied to uniform policy for store staff. The group had asked workers to wear their own trousers, skirts or shoes in a specific colour, along with uniform it provided. WH Smith has paid them back an average \u00a340 for money spent on the clothing items. \u201cThis was a genuine error and it was rectified immediately with all colleagues reimbursed in 2019,\u201d WH Smith said. LloydsPharmacy, which was second on the list, was found to owe more than \u00a3900,000 to nearly 8,000 workers. It also said its \u201cunintentional\u201d underpayment related to company uniform rules. A spokesperson said: \u201cAs soon as we were made aware of it we acted quickly to notify the affected colleagues and reimburse them. We also updated our uniform policy to ensure it did not recur.\u201d Marks &amp; Spencer was third on the list of those found to have incorrectly paid workers, owing 5,363 employees just over \u00a3100 each, or \u00a3578,000 in total. The food-to-fashion retailer said it had been named because of an \u201cunintentional technical issue from over four years ago\u201d related to weekly payments for some temporary workers. \u201cThis happened simply because temporary colleagues were not paid within the strict time periods specified in the national minimum wage regulations and was remedied as soon as we became aware of the issue,\u201d it said. \u201cOur minimum hourly pay has never been below the national minimum wage, it is currently above it and no colleagues were ever underpaid because of this.\u201d Sainsbury\u2019s, the owner of Argos, said its violation dated back to 2012 before the supermarket bought the catalogue chain. It had launched an investigation and corrected the problem when it was first identified in 2018. A spokesperson said: \u201cSince then we have completed the integration of Argos on to Sainsbury\u2019s systems which will prevent this from happening again. \u201cSince acquiring Argos, we have made significant investment into colleague pay and the Argos colleague hourly rate is now aligned with Sainsbury\u2019s, representing an increase of 53% over the last seven years.\u201d Kevin Hollinrake, the minister for enterprise, markets and small business, said that, while not all minimum wage underpayments were intentional, \u201cthere is no excuse for underpaying workers\u201d. \u201cPaying the legal minimum wage is non-negotiable and all businesses, whatever their size, should know better than to shortchange hard-working staff. \u201cMost businesses do the right thing and look after their employees, but we\u2019re sending a clear message to the minority who ignore the law: pay your staff properly or you\u2019ll face the consequences.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db578", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jun/21/the-new-national-portrait-gallery-review-its-the-same-old-cocktail-party", "primaryCategory": "artanddesign", "subCategories": "test", "title": "The new National Portrait Gallery review \u2013 \u2018It\u2019s the same old cocktail party\u2019", "lead": "We\u2019re told it has been changed utterly.

I wish I could say that I\u2019ve missed it. This is a museum with barely any great art in it, a peculiarly British institution that reflects our national cult of celebrity. Since 1856 it has amassed pictures of the great and good, as they were seen in their day, and consistently downgraded art: labels give the sitter first, then the artist. The NPG has always been surface, flash, fame and, artistically, nothingness. Now it is about to reopen, changed utterly, we\u2019re told. It makes a massive claim to have become a serious temple of art before you even get inside. Tracey Emin has etched female faces with stark intensity on the new bronze doors. This is her answer to Rodin\u2019s The Gates of Hell in Paris \u2013 a very personal hell, her pain preserved permanently, facing Leicester Square and the West End crowds. Her soul-baring is apparently a manifesto for the new National Portrait Gallery, an insistence that this is now a place that sees past celebrity to the inner self. As if. Once you go through the grand new entrance hall on the north side you quickly find it\u2019s the same old cocktail party. This is still a rum collection packed with paintings that are \u201cafter\u201d Holbein or \u201cstudio of\u201d Van Dyck, and dinosaur oddities such as Sargent\u2019s portrait of 22 first world war generals \u2013 you wonder how many youths they sent to their deaths between them. Immense effort has gone into showing these so-so paintings at their very best. The lighting is to die for, the curating erudite and thoughtful. It looks as if weeks of discussion went into every wall colour. There\u2019s a new logo and museum typeface \u2013 how much did that cost? \u2013 and a gravity worthy of a gallery with much greater things in it. I watched Sir Joshua Reynolds\u2019s Portrait of Mai, the Pacific islander who sailed to Britain with Captain Cook, being delicately manoeuvred into place in a gallery of Georgian paintings. The National Portrait Gallery has fought to buy this picture and its director, Nicholas Cullinan, calls it \u201cby far the most significant acquisition the gallery has ever made\u201d; but it\u2019s not a painting that holds your gaze long. Reynolds is such a cardboard artist. He gives Mai nobility, for sure \u2013 why wouldn\u2019t he? \u2013 but his style is so lacking in painterly nuance that all you can really do is \u201clike\u201d it and move on. Perhaps Reynolds has found his moment in the social media age when quick moral judgements are replacing ambiguous aesthetic encounters. Really loved this 18th century image of diversity! #Enlightenment. You would certainly have to look at art as superficially as that to rave about Yevonde, the early 20th-century photographer who gets a retrospective a couple of levels down. Her art is all surrealistic glamour and artificial colours, with images of women that we are told by the captions are hugely radical yet look the opposite. A 1938 picture of a young woman on a bike has a caption that hails \u201can active woman \u2026 as she travels astride a symbol of women\u2019s liberation\u201d. I don\u2019t see much difference between this and the kind of shallow exhibition the \u201cold\u201d NPG used to do of photographers such as Lord Snowdon and Mario Testino. The contemporary galleries, too, look oddly familiar under their veneer of reimagineering. Which is a shame because they really needed a proper rethink. Thomas J Price\u2019s statue of a young Black woman looking at her phone among marble busts of dead white people in the entrance hall promises a revolution, but it\u2019s still the same shoddy chaos. In one display a bunch of very ordinary portraits are all outclassed by a really good painting by Alex Katz of Anna Wintour. You can argue that representation is more important than artistic quality \u2013 but that leaves the NPG where it always was, a collection of notable faces with no regard for artistic depth. What is new is a mortal dread of being seen as cosy and middle class, bespeaking a loathing for its traditional audience and determination to woo a completely new crowd who may not even exist. Royal portraits have been scattered around furtively, inserting William and Kate in a wall of ordinary folk (some of us are royal \u2013 deal with it), while the late Queen appears with Prince Philip in a photo by Thomas Struth as if to cleanse the shame of royal portraiture with a shower of coolness, Struth being famous for his street photography in New York and D\u00fcsseldorf. It is absurd of the NPG to pretend that it\u2019s a highbrow avant-garde gallery. It is nothing of the sort. Its appeal is conservative and simple: pictures of great Britons. And it comes into its own \u2013 just as it did before the ostentatious closure \u2013 on the top floor, where portraits of the Tudor, Stuart and Georgian ages take you absorbingly into the past. The Tudor gallery is gorgeously tenebrous and enigmatic. Henry VIII towers up in Holbein\u2019s lifesize drawing for part of his lost Whitehall Mural, an original, not \u201cworkshop of\u201d. The monster monarch is a wall of a man, his codpiece bulging by his phallic dagger as tiny eyes skulk in his fleshy head. It\u2019s a portrait that has a resonance and profundity, of a multiple wife killer and despoiler of monasteries. The biggest bastard in the place still gets the greatest work of art. \u2022 This article was amended on 21 June 2023: it was the photographer Thomas Struth, not Ruff, who took a picture of the late Queen and Prince Philip. \u2022 The new National Portrait Gallery, London, opens on 22 June."}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db579", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/jun/21/tutoring-not-a-long-term-plan-to-help-english-pupils-catch-up-say-teachers", "primaryCategory": "education", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Tutoring not a long-term plan to help English pupils catch up, say teachers", "lead": "School leaders are considering dropping out of the government\u2019s post-pandemic scheme as it prepares to cut funding", "author": "Sally Weale", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 23:01:46", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.991031", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/fd69f529dfe08d443a1e67119cc4081f0cfe3dd9/0_400_6000_3600/500.jpg", "body": "Almost half of school leaders say the government\u2019s national tutoring programme (NTP), set up to help pupils in England catch up after Covid, is not cost-effective, according to a new survey. Most senior leaders who took part in the poll (58%) said they did not regard tuition as a long-term solution to closing the attainment gap for disadvantaged pupils. Those who have already quit the scheme or are considering doing so blame costs as the government\u2019s subsidy goes down, while problems sourcing tutors and the administrative burden of the scheme are also deterrents. Overall, seven out of 10 said their school was either currently using the NTP (52%) or had previously used it (18%). Of those still participating, almost two-thirds said they plan to continue in the academic year ahead, while a further 18% said they were planning to stop at the end of the current year. \u201cThis means that among the 70% of senior leaders who reported that they were currently or had previously used the NTP, more than half (51%) are likely to have dropped out by the end of the current academic year,\u201d the report said. That could change, however, after the government\u2019s recent decision to increase the subsidy from 25% \u2013 as planned for 2023-4 \u2013 to 50%. But it still falls short of the 75% paid by the government in 2021-2, at a time when school budgets are tight. Three-quarters (76%) of school leaders currently using the NTP believe it is improving the attainment of their disadvantaged pupils, but more than half of those surveyed (61%) think other types of support are more effective. Dr Ben Styles, the head of classroom practice and workforce for the National Foundation for Education Research, which carried out the poll among 400 senior leaders from primary and secondary schools, said: \u201cSchool leaders mostly believe the NTP is helping disadvantaged pupils, but many feel this support comes at too high a cost in terms of finances and administration. \u201cTutoring is not yet embedded in schools. Long-term financial support is needed alongside reductions to the administrative burden on staff. Overcoming these barriers is vital if tutoring is to win the hearts and minds of schools and be seen as a sustainable way of helping to close the attainment disadvantage gap.\u201d Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: \u201cSchools struggle to afford these costs because of years of government underfunding of the education system. As the government intends to reduce the subsidy next academic year \u2013 even though by less than it initially planned \u2013 the programme will obviously become unaffordable for an increasing number of schools.\u201d A Department for Education spokesperson said: \u201cAs this report shows, our national tutoring programme is helping those pupils most in need of support, with over 3 million courses started to date\u201d. \u201cSince the evidence from this survey was collected in March, we have announced that the subsidy will increase from 25% to 50% next year, having listened to feedback from schools. On top of this, we will also be supporting them more widely through a \u00a32bn boost in school funding which will be at its highest level in history \u2013 in real terms.\u201d The results of the poll have been published in a report called Tutoring Sustainability: Understanding the views of school leaders."}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db57a", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/21/macron-and-world-leaders-call-on-private-finance-to-help-reduce-global-poverty", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Macron and world leaders call on private finance to help reduce global poverty", "lead": "In lead up to Paris meeting on Thursday, open letter states that government loans and grants not enough to spur development", "author": "Phillip Inman", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 23:01:46", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.991049", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/3d47b5c748491165c0e0b1cc613d5c57053c2e9b/0_85_6000_3600/500.jpg", "body": "Private finance needs to play a significant role in supporting global development and reducing poverty by offering cheaper and more flexible loans, according to French president, Emmanuel Macron, and a group of fellow world leaders. In a message that is likely to dismay many anti-poverty campaigners, the group of leaders said in an open letter that government loans and grants will not be enough to spur development across low- and middle-income countries ravaged by the Covid-19 pandemic, mounting debts and rocketing food and energy prices. The billions of pounds needed to invest in green technologies and tackle the climate crisis will also depend on \u201cinnovative, and sustainable sources of finance, such as debt buybacks\u201d that allow governments to reduce historically high interest payments. World leaders will meet on Thursday in Paris to discuss climate finance, green growth, the debt crisis and how to tap private sector sources of investment. In the letter, the leaders said sectors of industry \u201cthat prosper thanks to globalisation\u201d will need to make a contribution to global development, in what is understood to be a shift towards forcing global tech giants, energy companies and multinational services firms to pay more tax in countries where they operate. The letter, published by the US-based media organisation Project Syndicate, is part of an effort by Macron to address growing disquiet about current systems of development finance, including overseas aid from rich countries. The French leader also hopes to encourage greater climate finance to help poor countries cut their greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the impacts of extreme weather. Signatories of the letter in addition to Macron include Mia Mottley, prime minister of Barbados, Brazil president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor, and UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak. Japan\u2019s prime minister, Fumio Kishida, is also a signatory with Kenya\u2019s president, William Ruto; the president of Senegal, Macky Sall; South Africa president, Cyril Ramaphosa; Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the president of the United Arab Emirates; and US president, Joe Biden. \u201cPublic finance will remain essential to achieving our goals,\u201d they said. \u201cBut we acknowledge that meeting our development and climate goals will require new, innovative, and sustainable sources of finance, such as debt buybacks, engagement from sectors that prosper thanks to globalisation, and more trusted carbon and biodiversity credit markets.\u201d Anti-poverty campaigners have been sceptical of efforts to use private finance to address longstanding issues of poverty and inadequate infrastructure, fearing that it will load already impoverished governments with extra debts. Mottley\u2019s Bridgetown agenda, which is aimed at massively expanding the funding available to developing countries, particularly those afflicted by the climate crisis, has received strong backing from Macron. Mottley has fiercely criticised the World Bank, IMF and similar institutions, most of which were set up in the final days of the second world war, calling them unfit for the 21st-century task of tackling the climate crisis and drawing countries out of debt and poverty. Calls have been growing from many countries, including the US, the EU and UK, for an overhaul of the World Bank. The former president of the institution, David Malpass, appointed in 2019 by the then US president, Donald Trump, resigned earlier this year after deepening controversy over his objections to a patent waiver for Covid-19 vaccines and apparent climate-sceptic views."}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db57b", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jun/21/doors-tracey-emin-national-portrait-gallerys-41m-rebirth", "primaryCategory": "artanddesign", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Slashed stone, daylight galore and doors by Tracey Emin: the National Portrait Gallery\u2019s \u00a341m rebirth", "lead": "Forty-five faces of women, scribbled by Emin, now beam out from bronze doors \u2013 all part of an astonishing revamp that has turned this once unloved London landmark into a great building", "author": "Oliver Wainwright", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 23:01:46", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.991069", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/29b70ce0bdd814da4a977eb53bf2e9578d7038dc/0_99_2953_1772/500.jpg", "body": "The National Portrait Gallery in London has always felt like the poor cousin of the National Gallery, an afterthought tucked around the back of the star attraction. It stands as an awkward rear extension, squeezed into an unloved armpit where the sticky chaos of Leicester Square spills into Charing Cross Road, while visitors have always been shuffled through an apologetic side entrance, as if being invited in to collect the bins. The reason it is so unwelcoming is that when the gallery was built in 1896 after its first years in temporary premises, it faced directly on to a slum \u2013 \u201ca neighbourhood of crime and vice\u201d, as architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner put it \u2013 and the insalubrious streets of Soho beyond. This regal repository of painted noblemen couldn\u2019t be seen to be fronting on to such a seedy district, so the architect, Ewan Christian, moved the entrance as far around the corner as he could, to face the more seemly setting of St Martin-in-the-Fields church. As a result, the building\u2019s front has always looked like its back, the palazzo-like facade of arched windows and roundels crucially missing a front door. Almost 130 years later, three momentous bronze portals have burst through the Grade I-listed stone walls, as part of the most radical transformation in the institution\u2019s history. In the hands of Jamie Fobert Architects and heritage specialists Purcell, new galleries have been opened up, learning spaces and restaurants added, and a public forecourt created, in a \u00a341.3m process of surgical slicing and stitching, giving the rambling warren a vital new lease of life. \u201cIt\u2019s the great building Londoners never knew they had,\u201d says Fobert, standing outside the gallery\u2019s new entrance. \u201cOur job was to open it up, tie its different eras together, and give it a new public face.\u201d As his work at Tate St Ives and Kettle\u2019s Yard attests, he is well positioned to accomplish such a task, free of the usual architect\u2019s urge to stamp his own signature too boldly. Where once there was a triangular scrap of fenced-off grass on the street corner, now stretches an inviting public space, providing a moment of pause between the bustle of Trafalgar and Leicester Squares. A chunky granite bench (mercifully free of anti-skating studs and anti-homeless bars) sweeps around an existing statue, echoing the curve of the road and merging into a broad set of stairs, while the pavement slopes up behind, bringing level access to the front door in a way that doesn\u2019t feel like a separate \u201caccessible\u201d ramp. On a recent visit, one wheelchair user asked where the ramp was \u2013 only to find they had already glided up it, unawares. It\u2019s a simple move, but one that is worlds away from the former indignity of being sent down a side alley to a separate ramped service entrance. \u201cThe idea was to make the experience the same for everyone,\u201d says Fobert, \u201cand intervene in ways that are almost imperceptible.\u201d You probably won\u2019t realise that a hefty concrete platform was craned in to bridge over a sunken lightwell to the new entrance, as the granite paving flows across it seamlessly. More noticeable are the sharply sliced openings, where the architects have taken their scalpel to the base of three windows and slashed through the Portland stone mouldings and granite plinth to expose the fresh interior of the rock, in striking contrast to its gnarled outer surface. It leaves the Victorian mouldings playfully truncated, echoing the staccato postmodern facade of Venturi Scott Brown\u2019s National Gallery Sainsbury Wing next door (currently undergoing its own less sensitive remodelling. The new four-metre high bronze doors have provided a happy opportunity to address the gallery\u2019s historic gender imbalance. Forty-five faces of women, scribbled by Tracey Emin, now beam out from the bronze panelling, as a foil to the row of 14 white male painters who look down, stony-faced, from the Victorian roundels above. It\u2019s a hint of what awaits: the rehang features 48% women in the 20th and 21st-century galleries, compared with the previous 35%. Inside, a sense of light, space and legibility has been flushed throughout the building, as if it\u2019s undergone a supercharged spring clean, banishing much of the former gloom. \u201cThe building had never had a holistic review,\u201d says Purcell\u2019s Liz Smith. \u201cThis was an opportunity to tidy everything up and make it more coherent.\u201d The entrance lobby is twice the size of the original, floored with a stunning marble and terrazzo carpet (inspired by Carlo Scarpa\u2019s patterns), Fobert\u2019s equivalent of Christian\u2019s intricate mosaic flooring, which has been meticulously restored by Purcell. A huddle of busts, hauled out of storage, stand assembled on a forest of marble plinths, while blocked-up windows have been opened, bringing daylight and views into the lobby and a new shop (reduced in size by a third, bucking the retail-thirsty trend). While the previous route to the galleries entailed traipsing through revolving glass doors, up some steps, past a ticket desk and up a three-storey escalator before you got anywhere near the free collection, now there is art on view as soon as you arrive. A gallery of recent acquisitions extends to one side of a ribbed walnut ticket desk, while a wall screens the glass escalator of a 2000s remodelling, helping to reduce the shopping mall vibes, and creating the surreal spectacle of disembodied heads drifting upstairs. The historic galleries feel invigorated and are now much easier to navigate. New openings restore the cruciform layout and fully connect the Victorian rooms to the Ondaatje Wing (added by Dixon Jones in 2000) for the first time. Larger than life monarchs hang at the end of long visual axes, staring each other down. Interpretation designers, Nissen Richards Studio, have brought a smart clarity to proceedings, updating the tired feel of the 1990s displays, while the grey-walled galleries upstairs have been lined with a rich rainbow of deeply dyed wool, each room a different hue, helping visitors find their way among the halls of Tudors and their murdered wives. Much of the previously fusty, dusty feeling has been brightened up by, quite literally, letting in the light. After extensive digital modelling by environmental wizards Max Fordham, blocked windows have been ripped open, bringing in bursts of daylight that help to prevent gallery fatigue (made possible by sophisticated UV film on the glass), while cumbersome lighting grids have been slimmed down. The engineers also applied their skill with ducts and pipes to a new suite of galleries \u2013 spaces that had been converted into offices, but can now be returned to their original use thanks to an air handling system, deftly inserted within the thickness of the walls. Purcell have replicated mouldings, doors and windows, meanwhile, making the difference between new and old imperceptible. It is a finely judged balance of faithful restoration and judicious intervention, with contemporary touches from Fobert, such as the sinuous two-sided gallery benches and elegant walnut display cases, adding an extra layer to the historical collage. His motif of chamfered corners \u2013 sampled from Christian\u2019s \u201cbeak chamfered\u201d columns and pilasters \u2013 appears throughout, on walls, display cases and furniture, and subtly helps to tie the different epochs together. Back downstairs, the former main entrance is now dedicated to school groups, which will enjoy three times more learning space than before, in what used to be a lower-ground storage area. It is reached by a sculptural concrete staircase, with a bronze balustrade motif that echoes the curve of the street outside, giving a sense of grandeur to a function that can often feel like an afterthought. The architects have cleverly removed a mezzanine from the building\u2019s original double-height kitchen to carve out lofty classrooms that open on to a sunken courtyard, planted with a pair of mature acer trees, while the area below the entrance bridge has been walled in with glass, creating an additional education pavilion and bringing more daylight. Astonishingly, this 70 square-metre room is the only \u201cnew\u201d space in the entire project \u2013 the architects managed to \u201cfind\u201d the other 950 square metres elsewhere in the building, as if playing Cash in the Attic on a grand scale. One such archaeological discovery was made in the east wing, where a previously off-limits rotunda has been revealed as part of a new bar, featuring mosaic that was buried under a suspended floor. The only bum note is that the museum\u2019s new dining establishments have been fitted out by the caterer\u2019s in-house design team, so the result is a gaudy eyeful of velvet and brass, reminiscent of a kitsch Soho boudoir. Fobert winces as we watch gold leaf being applied to the wall in abstract painterly streaks, worthy of Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen. \u201cThis is nothing to do with us,\u201d he notes, before moving swiftly on. \u201cYou can\u2019t win every battle.\u201d The National Portrait Gallery, London, reopens on Thursday 22 June"}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db57c", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/21/will-hundreds-of-australian-pharmacies-close-over-dispensing-changes-or-is-it-just-a-scare-campaign", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Will hundreds of Australian pharmacies close over dispensing changes or is it just a scare campaign?", "lead": "We look at how the claims of potentially 20,000 job losses, medicine shortages and billion-dollar revenue falls stack up", "author": "Tory Shepherd", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 23:00:46", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.991106", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/4e929e598fb89817549bb1cf15e7d1a9219d2e8e/281_509_4863_2920/500.jpg", "body": "The Pharmacy Guild of Australia has painted a \u201ccatastrophic\u201d picture in which 20,000 jobs will be lost and 650 pharmacies will close as they suffer a multibillion-dollar hit from filling fewer scripts and having fewer people wander in to buy anti-snoring devices. The guild\u2019s claims are outlined in a pair of reports it released this week \u2013 a technical report by Tulipwood Advisory and the Relational Insights Data Lab at Griffith University and a \u201ccompanion report\u201d by an economist and columnist at the Australian newspaper, Henry Ergas. But the health minister, Mark Butler, has accused the guild of a \u201cscare campaign\u201d over the switch from 30-day to 60-day medicine dispensing. So how do the report\u2019s findings stack up? Who is saying what? The pharmacy guild\u2019s president, Trent Twomey, has been a vehement and occasionally emotional critic of the government\u2019s plans to allow more than 320 different medications to have the longer prescription. \u201cThis independent report confirms the policy is catastrophic in its current form, leading to over 20,000 job losses, more than 650 pharmacies shutting, weekend opening hours drastically scaled back and millions of free services cut,\u201d he said. Butler says the government\u2019s policy will deliver cheaper medicines \u201cfor more than 6 million Australians\u201d. \u201cThis will halve the cost of more than 300 medicines for millions of Australians, including pensioners, who are living with a chronic condition during this cost-of-living crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the latest scare campaign from the pharmacy lobby group about the government\u2019s cheaper medicines policy.\u201d The government and the guild will likely continue to butt heads over the dispensing policy until its planned start date on 1 September, with the guild now pushing for it to be paused while consultations are undertaken. How much will pharmacies lose? The guild\u2019s report says pharmacies will take a $4.5bn hit in revenue because they won\u2019t be paid for filling millions of scripts \u2013 but that figure is based on some big assumptions. More on that below. The report also estimates that, for every lost visit, pharmacies will lose $20 in \u201cfootfall\u201d retail sales. That\u2019s $20 worth of goods people might pick up when they go in for a script \u2013 jellybeans, makeup, a verruca and wart remover and so on. It says that a $20 spend equates to a $6 profit, and that pharmacies now get about a third of their profit from retail sales. But, as the government points out, this assumes consumers will never stroll in to buy nappies unless they are redeeming a script. Will more than 20,000 jobs be lost? Before going anywhere near that 20,000 figure, it is important to point out that it\u2019s unknown how many GPs will switch to the new prescribing method, and when. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The report concedes it uses \u201csomewhat arbitrary\u201d figures to create various scenarios and that information on GP dispensing behaviour is \u201csomewhat tenuous\u201d. In the first year, it models as few as 45% of GPs switching, or as many as 80% \u2013 the \u201cminimum\u201d model. And by the fourth year, as few as 63% and as many as 95% \u2013 the \u201cmaximum\u201d model. So this critical factor, which will directly drive how big the impact of the change is, has quite broad parameters. The \u201ccentral\u201d scenario sees a 63% uptake next financial year, and up to 90% in four years. This is the scenario in which there are about 350m fewer scripts over four years, with a corresponding $4.5bn loss of revenue, as mentioned above. (The government estimates it will be 45% in the first year and 63% at year four.) The next thing to note is that the guild is talking about 20,000 individual workers, not full-time equivalents. Under the central scenario it\u2019s just under 5,000 FTE jobs lost (the report points out that\u2019s 10,863 \u201cactual jobs\u201d). To get to 20,818, the report adds in another factor \u2013 if the pharmacy has a debt to service or is obliged to supply a return on investment. In short, if it needs more money than just breaking even. Then, under their modelling, 20,818 individual workers \u2013 9,461 FTE \u2013 would lose their jobs. Will there be closures? Twomey said the policy would lead to 665 pharmacies closing and would put a further 900 put at risk \u201cdue to significant financial pressure\u201d. But according to the report, under the central scenario it would only be about 200. The report then uses a \u201cstylised assumption\u201d about pharmacies with debts to service or investments to return on, to add another 600. Then it adds another 65 closures by year four, assuming a 90% GP take-up. It came to those figures by using the $4.5bn claimed above and modelling how many individual pharmacies would be in strife under that scenario. Then it used a formula to work out how much pharmacies would have to reduce their wages costs by \u2013 such as by cutting hours or staff \u2013 to stop losing money. If they couldn\u2019t reduce costs enough to stop losing money, the report assumes they would close. A further 900 would be under strain and might have to close if they can\u2019t reduce costs. On the other hand, the government says it will return its savings to the pharmacies, committing an extra $655m. Will there be medicine shortages? The report raises the spectre of shortages if people can pick up twice as many medicines at a time but the government says only three of the listed medicines are at any risk. The Australian Medical Association says the shortages claim has been \u201cwidely debunked\u201d. \u201cWe think it\u2019s unfair on patients actually to still be holding this scare campaign,\u201d the AMA president, Danielle McMullen, said on Tuesday. Then there\u2019s a claim that there will be a cost to taxpayers of $2.5bn over four years in increased hospitalisations due to medicine mismanagement. The report refers to existing hospitalisation statistics and extends them using the assumptions worked through above. The media release accompanying the report says pharmacies will be forced to cut opening hours, including on weekends, and \u201cend free services for patients such as blood pressure monitoring, home delivery of medicines and diabetes and asthma programs\u201d. This is not detailed in the report. Is it all bad news for pharmacies? On the bright side, the report points out that most of those who lose jobs will find others, and that overall revenue will increase. \u201cAside from the significant reduction in dispensing revenue beginning in 2023-24, revenue may be expected to continue to rise as community pharmacies seek new revenue streams based on increasing citizen health consciousness, the increased demands of population ageing and the related increasing incident of people living with chronic illnesses,\u201d it says. \u201cMore pharmacies are positioning themselves as health hubs offering immunisations, weight management services, advice on a wide range of health devices, and home medicines reviews.\u201d Ergas noted: \u201cThere are many difficulties involved in an analysis of this type. The government, parliament and the Australian community may well feel more comfortable if the conclusions set out here are subject to further testing.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db57d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/20/starmer-eyes-dozens-of-new-peers-to-secure-labour-agenda-in-house-of-lords", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Keir Starmer \u2018eyes dozens of new peers to aid Labour government\u2019", "lead": "Party reportedly looking to increase share in Lords, as Tory majority \u2018could make life difficult\u2019", "author": "Nadeem Badshah", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 22:55:45", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.991124", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/5e917571c182b49d582af28871cc0905fcc9dffd/0_128_5358_3215/500.jpg", "body": "Labour is reportedly devising plans to appoint dozens of peers to the House of Lords to prevent a Keir Starmer government being stymied by the upper chamber.

The constitutional review by the former prime minister Gordon Brown suggested that the House of Lords would be reformed as an assembly of regions and nations, with a remit of safeguarding the constitution and with power to refer the government to the supreme court."}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db57e", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jun/20/dear-england-review-touching-funny-retelling-of-gareth-southgates-quiet-revolution", "primaryCategory": "stage", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Dear England review \u2013 touching, funny retelling of Gareth Southgate\u2019s quiet revolution", "lead": "<strong>National Theatre, London<br></strong>It\u2019s a game of two halves, but James Graham\u2019s dramatisation of Southgate rescuing a languishing England team delivers tension and movement", "author": "Arifa Akbar", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 22:47:36", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.991142", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/aced89150de306857ddaa5dd87a149c2e8c385f8/0_217_4458_2675/500.jpg", "body": "James Graham\u2019s story of the beautiful game and the travails of the England squad has some beautiful moments. It traces the team\u2019s fortunes from the moment their diffident, upstanding and quietly revolutionary manager, Gareth Southgate (Joseph Fiennes, bearing an uncanny resemblance), comes into their lives. It traces real world events, from penalty shootouts that bring a life-like tension to the aftermath of losing a game. The meat of the play is Southgate\u2019s inspirational leadership of an England squad that\u2019s languishing when he first takes over, and to which he gives new life, leading the team all the way to the semi-finals in the 2018 World Cup and onwards. But as endearing as it is, the production, directed by Rupert Goold, takes time to really lift off the ground, focusing on story rather than drama in the first half \u2013 and it does seem like a game of two halves. Southgate brings the psychologist, Pippa Grange (Gina McKee), into their training sessions and for a little too long there are fairly static classroom scenes showing Pippa and Southgate encouraging the lads to keep journals, to talk about their fear, to face it. It is touching, and has some very funny lines too, but lacks quite enough drama or conflict, despite Es Devlin\u2019s incredible set \u2013 luminous ovals simply yet excellently signifying a stadium, and plenty of movement within it. Better known for fictionalising the power play in politics, Graham cannot resist infusing football with politics too, with comic cameos from the likes of Theresa May and Boris Johnson, which are very amusing, almost Spitting Image-style imitations. There are quick glances to the pandemic and the Black Lives Matter movement too, along with an interrogation of Englishness and the flag \u2013 a little too brief though. Racism \u2013 within the footballing community or between team members \u2013 is touched upon rather than explored. There are not enough dramatic moments in the first half that grip: it is 50 minutes in, when Southgate recalls his terror at taking and missing a penalty in the Euro 96 semi-finals, that we feel we enter into his emotional world. We want and need more of this \u2013 and perhaps more conflict and drama between players themselves \u2013 rather than the Dead Poets Society-style \u201cseize the moment\u201d lectures. Fiennes\u2019s Southgate is slightly geeky, full of earnestness and quiet integrity, and channels more than just an impersonation. But we never really get beneath the skin of Southgate even though he is almost ever-present on stage. We only get snatches of his backstory \u2013 such as how he fell in love with the game by kicking a ball against a wall as a kid in Crawley. The players themselves are endearingly drawn, with actors doing very keen imitations of their real-life counterparts in the first half. Together they represent a group of talented, accidentally funny, immature boys rather than men in the first half, but gain individuality and depth in the second. The second act as a whole brings more emotional drama over simply telling the squad\u2019s story. The players come to life too, from the sweet, laconic Harry Kane (Will Close) to impassioned Raheem Sterling (Kel Matsena) and good-natured Marcus Rashford (Darragh Hand). We see them in their most nerve-racking moments of penalty-taking \u2013 the exhilaration or sense of failure afterwards \u2013 and the play implicitly unpicks a kind of masculinity that asks the men to swallow down their difficult emotions. In Southgate\u2019s reshaping of the squad, we also see something of a re-appraisal of what makes a good leader, too: he is the opposite of the strongman, and his argument is against strongman leadership. There is power in seeing the story of football told on the biggest stage of the National Theatre, with rousing moments in the second half, and it is beautiful from start to finish in its optics. So it scores, ultimately, even if it does not quite bend it like Beckham. Plays until 11 August at the National Theatre"}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db57f", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2023/jun/20/scotland-v-georgia-euro-2024-qualifier-live-score-updates", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Scotland 2-0 Georgia: Euro 2024 qualifier affected by rain delay \u2013 as it happened", "lead": "Callum McGregor and Scott McTominay continued Scotland\u2019s great start to qualification in a game that finished at 11.20pm", "author": "Rob Smyth", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 22:36:32", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.991160", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/fb2d23c9f43e15252a57f176c62ea8734fc2c044/458_363_4420_2653/500.jpg", "body": "That\u2019s it for tonight. Or is it this morning, I\u2019m not entirely sure. Either way, thanks for your company and emails, which enlivened a very strange evening. Scotland are so close to Euro 2024, already. Goodnight! Scott McTominay speaks \u201cScotland, France, England and Portugal are the only teams with a 100% record in Euro 2024 qualifying so far with four wins out of four,\u201d writes/weeps Simon McMahon. \u201cThat\u2019s not a sentence that I ever thought I\u2019d have to write. Less than a year now to the opening fixture in Munich\u2026\u201d Peep peep! Scotland move \u2013 and you\u2019ll like this - eight points clear at the top of Group A after a rain-affected win over Georgia. Callum McGregor scored before the players went off the field because of a waterlogged pitch, and the increasingly prolific Scott McTominay added a second just after half-time. Scotland were comfortable, and they have won the first four games in qualification for the first time in their history. Something will have to go badly wrong for them to miss out on a trip to Germany next summer. It was a poor penalty, spanked high over the bar. Gunn went the right way but it didn\u2019t matter because the ball was launched into the heavens. Penalty to Georgia! Another very modern penalty decision. Hickey was off balance because of a challenge with a Georgian player, and his arm was outstretched as a result. VAR check for a Georgia penalty! A dipping free-kick seemed to hit the arm of Hickey, and this may well be given. 90 min Four minutes of added time. 89 min Three and a half hours after it kicked off, the match is finally petering out. Ultimately, for all the fun and games, it has been a comfortable win for Scotland. 87 min Every cloud\u2026 86 min: Scotland substitution Kenny McLean, the hero of Oslo, replaces the quietly excellent Billy Gilmour. 85 min Georgia keep the ball for a minute or more, but they can\u2019t get behind Scotland. Eventually Mikautadze whips a decent shot from 20 yards that goes just over the bar. Gunn probably had it covered. 81 min Mikautadze clips a nonchalant through ball towards Davitashvili, forcing Angus Gunn to dive bravely at his feet. Fine goalkeeping. 79 min: Scotland substitutions John Souttar, Ryan Jack and Kevin Nisbet replace Kieran Tierney, Callum McGregor and Lyndon Dykes. 78 min McGinn finds Dykes in a bit of space on the edge of the area. His shot is well blocked by Kashia. 76 min \u201cI think I\u2019d put old No-Feet in the \u2018been quietly very good\u2019 column for tonight,\u201d writes James Humphries of Billy Gilmour, \u201cas he usually is for Scotland - won a few good balls near his own penalty area, constantly occupying two Georgian defenders, and heading long out-balls away from danger if he can\u2019t find a man. Like I said, I\u2019ve a lot of time for him! (We\u2019ll even pass discreetly over when he got put through on goal and immediately went \u2018what the hell are these things at the end of my legs\u2019.) I quite like that MGM midfield actually, they complement each other well. 75 min Gagnidze is booked for dissent. 75 min \u201cUnfortunately for Matt, it\u2019s looking as bad for Wales as it good for Scotland,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cHe\u2019ll always have 2016, mind. And if we make the semi-finals in Germany next year, I\u2019ll happily buy him three pints of Penderyn.\u201d 73 min: Chance for Georgia! A bit of a scare for Scotland. Kakabadze\u2019s fierce cross from the right is palmed away by Gunn, but only as far as Mikautadze, who swishes a volley into the side netting from 12 yards. He\u2019s usually a decent finisher and looks annoyed with himself. 72 min: Chance for Scotland! The corner is taken short and worked to Gilmour, whose inviting cross is headed over from eight yards by Porteous. That was a great chance. 72 min Hickey runs onto a good return pass from McGregor, forcing Gagnidze to come across and concede a corner. 70 min Scotland have Georgia at arm\u2019s length. I guess had the internet existed in 1978, somebody would have written \u2018Scotland have Iran at arm\u2019s length\u2019. But at the moment it doesn\u2019t feel like there is a nasty surprise round the corner. 70 min Hickey plays a reverse pass towards McGregor in the area. It\u2019s slightly telegraphed, which allows Kashia to shepherd the ball behind for a goalkick. 68 min And now Gocholeishvili is booked for fouling Hickey. 67 min Robertson is booked for a soggy foul on Davitashvili. 65 min: Georgia substitution Zuriko Davitashvili, who scored the winner against Cyprus on Saturday, replaces Saba Lobjanidze. 63 min McTominay\u2019s through ball to Dykes takes a slight but crucial touch off a defender, allowing Mamardashvili to come out and claim. McTominay has been a constant threat, certainly since half-time. 60 min Kiteishvili shoots over from 30 yards. It was beautifully struck but Angus Gunn had it covered. 59 min Billy Gilmour has been good tonight. Players of his ilk \u2013 the opposite of highlights players \u2013 tend not to get mentioned very often on liveblogs, but he\u2019s been busy and neat as usual. 58 min The rampaging McTominay shoots wide from the edge of the D, this time with his right foot. 56 min: Georgia substitution Giorgi Gocholeishvili and Budu Zivzivadze replace Nika Kvekveskiri and Lasha Dvali. 55 min McGregor tries to find McTominay in the area with a cute reverse pass. It\u2019s intercepted and rolls back to McGregor, who shoots high and wide from the edge of the area. He\u2019s annoyed with himself, because that was a chance. 55 min He hasn\u2019t done a huge amount tonight, but jeez Kvaratskhelia is a beautiful player to watch. 55 min Kvaratskhelia beats two players through sleight of hip and finds Mikautadze on the edge of the area. He moves it into the area for Kiteishvili, who tries to take on Robertson and is crucially tackled. 54 min On that note, apparently the trip to Norway was the first time Scotland had won a game after trailing with 10 minutes to go since the 19th century. 53 min Scotland are in control for the time being. I\u2019m pretty sure they have never won their first four games in qualification, so they are 37 minutes away from making history. 51 min \u201cIs McTominay just played out of position or something at Man United?\u201d says James Humphries. \u201cHe\u2019s a constant figure of fun, it seems, but he\u2019s been scorching for Scotland for a while now.\u201d He\u2019s been a decentplayer for United, for all the McFred nonsense, but yeah he has generally played as a defensive midfielder. There were a few times last season when Ten Hag used him further forward. I also think Scotland\u2019s system gives him a bit more freedom than he would get in a 4-2-3-1. 48 min That was a really neat finish from McTominay with his weaker foot, both imaginative and precise. It\u2019s McTominay\u2019s fifth goal in four games in this group, and he took it superbly. Robertson cut inside from the left and was tackled, with the ball bouncing up outside the area. McTominay charged onto it, controlled the ball deftly with his right foot and then shaped a superb left-footed shot from the edge of the area that beat Mamardashvili at the near post. The goal machine strikes again! 46 min Georgia begin the second half, kicking from left to right as we watch. The players are out for the second half. It\u2019s 10.28pm, local time, and Dr Death has probably seen off two or three already. Never mind. \u201cI mean, major tournaments are overrated,\u201d says our resident Wales fan Matt Dony. \u201cBut I hope Scotland continue this run and make it to Germany, if only for McMahon!\u201d Even if Scotland make the final of Euro 2024, only to lose on penalties to Georgia, Simon McMahon will struggle to match your tour de force during the Euro 2016 semi-final. Half-time reading After two and a half hours, the first half comes to an end. Scotland still lead through an early goal (in more ways than one) from Callum McGregor, and they have had the better chances since play resumes following a biblical downpour. See you in 15 minutes for the second half, hopefully. 45+4 min Hickey is booked for a late tackle on Kvekveskiri. He was going for the ball but didn\u2019t get it. 45+1 min Four minutes of added time. 45 min All of a sudden Scotland are rampant. McGinn connects properly with a vicious shot from 25 yards that hits the shoulder of Kvekveskiri and deflects over the bar. That was certainly on target. 43 min: Fine save by Mamardasvili! Scott McTominay almost gets his fifth goal in Group A. He received the ball from McGregor on the left side of the area, took a couple of touches to create a soupcon of space and then threaded a low shot across goal, through a crowd of defenders. Mamardashvili saw it late but plunged to his left to fingertip it round the post. That\u2019s a really terrific save. 41 min: Great chance for McGinn! Robertson surges infield from the left and slides a perfect angled pass to the unmarked McGinn, 12 yards out. He takes the shot first time but completely mistimes it, presumably because of the pitch, and ends up knocking the ball tamely to the feet of a Georgian defender. 40 min McGregor combines with Robertson on the left and then reverses a nice pass to Tierney on the left corner of the box. He flips a cross that is headed back across goal and wide by McGinn. A decent effort, though Mamardashvili had it covered. 39 min Georgia have had a lot of the ball in the last 20 minutes or so but it\u2019s been almost entirely in front of the Scotland defence. In fact, it hasn\u2019t been much of a game. The shenanigans were far more entertaining. 36 min \u201cScotland looking well on top,\u201d writes James Humphries. \u201cMcTominay rampaging, Dykes winning balls at left-back; Georgia equaliser just before half-time it is, then.\u201d 34 min Another fantastic cross from Robertson just evades McGinn and the diving Dyche on the six-yard line. Robertson has been superb in attack. 33 min This is looking\u2026 not ominous for Scotland, but maybe a little disquieting. When Georgia skulked onto the field I thought Scotland might run them ragged. Instead it\u2019s a pretty even game. 32 min \u201cSorry to hear you\u2019re on overtime duty this late summer evening,\u201d writes Gary Byrne. \u201cI can do you a MBM of Dr Death if that would suffice?\u201d Surely it would a DBD report? 31 min \u201cGiven tonight\u2019s events, I\u2019d imagine that a \u2018warm\u2019 welcome will await Scotland when the return fixture takes place in Georgia in November,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cThough a win tonight, and in the next qualifier against Cyprus, would mean that Scotland could probably forfeit the game and just have a couple of days sightseeing in Tbilisi instead. Seriously, a win tonight and then in Cyprus would likely guarantee qualification AFTER FIVE STRAIGHT WINS, RIGHT?!\u201d 30 min We\u2019ve been having some technical problems, apologies. You haven\u2019t missed much, just a dangerous cross from Robertson (I think) that was cleared at the near post. Georgia, who were only really on the field in body for the first 20 minutes, are having a lot more of the ball now. 25 min The first bit of skill from Kvaratskhelia, who rolls McTominay sweetly in the centre circle, then slips past Gilmour and is fouled. 24 min Georgia are enjoying their first extended spell of possession, although maybe \u2018enjoying\u2019 isn\u2019t the right word given their enthusiasm for coming back on the field. Scotland need to be careful, though; they\u2019re only 1-0 up. The night doesn\u2019t need any additional farce. 22 min Scotland have had 71 per cent possession so far, and it\u2019s not every decade you can say that. 21 min A rare Georgia attack ends with Mikautadze shooting miles wide from distance. 19 min Nothing comes of the corner. This still feels very weird. I was hoping to watch Dr Death on Channel 4 at 10pm. 19 min Scotland have been much the better team since the resumption. Gilmour wins a corner down the right, which will be taken by McGinn. 18 min An attempted clearance hits Dykes, 30 yards out, and flies wide of goal. The keeper Mamardashvili was scrambling, though it was nowhere near the goal. 17 min A deep cross from Tierney is met by Dykes, but he mistimes his header and the ball bounces off his shoulder and wide. Half a chance at best. 15 min The other match in this group finished Norway 3-1 Cyprus, with Erling Haaland getting two of the goals. He\u2019s now one behind Scott McTominay in the race for the imaginary Group A golden boot. 14 min \u201cHere in the USA! (etc), Fox decided to show us Iceland vs Portugal,\u201d writes Joe Pearson. \u201cIt\u2019s nice and sunny, and Portugal have a VAR delayed goal given at the death, with Iceland down to ten men. But, as I mentioned, it\u2019s SUNNY!\u201d 13 min There\u2019s still a lot of surface water splashing around, but the ball is moving okay. Robertson charges impatiently into the area from the left and drives a low cross that is pushed away by the diving Mamardashvili. Thankfully for Georgia it doesn\u2019t fall for a Scotland player. That was a statement run from Robertson. 11 min Lobjanidze has an early pop at goal, firing a cross-shot wide of the far post. 10 min Hang on, the game has restarted after 10 minutes, not seven, which is a bit strange. The last touch was McGregor\u2019s goal after six minutes. 7 min Peep peep! The match resumes with Georgia kicking off after Callum McGregor\u2019s goal. Okay. Both teams are on the pitch, the ball is moving freely. A football match is about to break out. I think that\u2019s the fourth time it\u2019s been put back. In the circumstances, the atmosphere is fantastic. The match should be finishing about now. Instead it\u2019s about to resume, six minutes old, with Scotland 1-0 up through Callum McGregor. \u201cIt\u2019s still 0-0 according to the score at the top of the page, even though McGregor has been credited with scoring in the sixth minute,\u201d writes Kevin Campbell. \u201cIs this a case of Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s goal or are we waiting to see if the game is abandoned before it is given?\u201d It\u2019s a case of Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s external feed that we can\u2019t fix from the office, but somebody is on the case. \u201cWet Wet Wet for some entertainment?\u201d wonders Nora Mulcahy. The Georgian players are booed onto the pitch. You might call it premature, but I\u2019m not entirely certain this game will end 11 v 11. The Scotland players make a point of applauding all the fans before going back into the tunnel. As they walk in, the Georgia players emerge from the dressing-room, oozing joie de vivre. \u201cBroken Irn Bru bottle strewn ash pitches in Eaterhouse in the mid 80s,\u201d says Colin Huxtable. \u201cFrost bite in the toes and dodging a Mitre 5 to the face like a ninja. It was character forming.\u201d I\u2019ll see your Mitre 5 and raise you the Mitre Mouldmaster. Now the referee is conducting another inspection. To be honest, conditions aren\u2019t bad now. There\u2019s a bit of surface water but the ball is rolling smoothly. Scott McTominay pointedly boots a couple of balls past the referee, into the net, to demonstrate the playability of the pitch. \u201cIan Gillan doesn\u2019t know he\u2019s born,\u201d says David Hopkins. \u201cIf he thinks Hampden Park is cold he should try the away end at Boundary Park. I hear scientists had to recalibrate their definition of absolute zero after attending a night game there.\u201d Imagine being a ball-playing defender in those conditions in the late 1980s, wearing short shorts, on a plastic pitch, with Ian Marshall galumping towards you. Oh this is hilarious, a distant relative of Tallinn 1996. Apparently the president of the Georgina FA is in the dressing-room with the players and is trying to negotiate with Fifa. There are rumours that the Georgia players are staging a sit-in. On one level, this is hilarious. Still no sign of the Georgia players. Anyone getting deja vu? It\u2019s on! Here come the players. Well, okay, here come the Scotland players. It looks like the match is going to take place after all. \u201cIan Gillan should go to Gayfield, home of Arbroath FC, in December,\u201d writes Simon McMahon. \u201cLiterally a stone\u2019s throw from the North Sea. Makes Hampden feel like Boxing Day in Melbourne.\u201d Apparently the match will resume at 9.15pm if \u2013 and it\u2019s a Brobdingnagian if - there\u2019s no more rain. Next up on the Hampden PA \u201cEnjoying your Ashes comparisons Rob,\u201d says Michael Keane, \u201cbut surely for a proper Bazball effect, Scotland should have declared after eight minutes?\u201d It\u2019s too soon. The players are leaving the field. I suspect you\u2019ve already discerned this, but I\u2019ve no idea what\u2019s going on. GOAL! Norway 2-0 Cyprus (Haaland 56 pen) Would you believe it. We\u2019re past the scheduled kick-off time. The groundstaff/stewards/anyone who fancies it are still sweeping water off the pitch, and the players are\u2026 I was going to say warming up, but many of the Georgina players are just loitering, wondering what kind of civilisation they have stumbled into. \u201cThanks for covering the water polo tonight,\u201d writes Ian Gillan. \u201cI was at Hampden in 2012 for one of the early World Cup women\u2019s football games, which featured North Korea. Someone accidentally displayed the South Korea flag on the big screen before the game and caused a major row among the North Korean squad, all of whom refused to come out for about an hour and a half. \u201cHampden is a notoriously cold place at the best of times, and the stands weren\u2019t exactly packed for that match. By the time the players were finally coaxed into putting in an appearance I was about the only person left in the stadium. I had to go home at half time because I\u2019ve never felt so cold in my life. \u201cThe fans seem in good spirits tonight, but I hope they\u2019ve packed a jumper for the second half.\u201d \u201cLoving the different approaches here,\u201d says James Humphries. \u201cGeorgia standing about collectively going \u2018are you kidding on, man\u2019 while Scotland warm up with a general air of \u2018it\u2019s Glasgow in June, you were expecting what, exactly?\u2019. Mind games!\u201d The tortoise and the hare: it\u2019s like watching the Ashes all over again. I hate to cast aspersions, but I\u2019m not sure some of the Georgian players are giving 110 per cent in their warm-up. The ball is actually rolling pretty well, a lot better than it did during the first six minutes of the game. It might actually be playable you know. \u201cI am sat in my flat one street over from Hampden and the minute that announcement came through for provisional restart the rainfall became heavier,\u201d says Zach Simm. \u201cMy money is still on abandonment.\u201d \u201cI remember that era,\u201d says James Humphries. \u201cI know fine well what I meant.\u201d You and Scott Murray would get on famously, at least until the fifth pint. \u2018There\u2019s good news and bad news\u2019 A) The players are out on the field warming up B) It\u2019s pouring down \u201cFor christ\u2019s sake,\u201d says James Humphries, \u201chow can it be this tense watching Scotland not play? (Yeah, yeah; Levein\u2019s 6-4-0 notwithstanding.) I thought it was 4-6-0? Give the man some credit. The players are going to warm up for 10 minutes at 8.45pm BST, which is in about five minutes. If everyone is happy with life, the match will resume at 8.55pm. \u201cI have to admit,\u201d says Peter Oh, \u201cthat I didn\u2019t expect Scotland to make such a huge splash in this group.\u201d This doesn\u2019t look good. The referee has just tried bouncing a ball, and it didn\u2019t even reach shin height. It\u2019s rolling perfectly well, mind you, so maybe that will satisfy the officials. The Hampden DJ is having some on-the-nose fun The officials are having another look at the pitch. Conditions have certainly improved, and it\u2019s no longer raining, but my hunch is it will be called off. \u201cGood news for the nation\u2019s pubs though\u2026\u201d says Tony Barr. \u201cIf the game restarts they\u2019ll have done even better on a wet Tuesday than expected. The one I\u2019m in is packed and there\u2019s no sign of drinking being suspended\u2026\u201d The referee isn\u2019t happy with the pitch. There will be a second inspection at 8.35pm. The umpires have come out to inspect the outfield. No news yet, but we\u2019ll keep you posted. Apparently if it is abandoned tonight, the match will take place tomorrow evening. Not sure what happens to Callum McGregor\u2019s goal though. \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll admit it,\u201d says James Humphries. \u201cI did not have \u2018act of a vengeful god\u2019 as the way by which the points would get away from us tonight. It\u2019s definitely not raining anymore, btw. Barely spitting; it\u2019s been far too hot anyway.\u201d You can probably guess what song is being played over the PA The other game in this group is 25 minutes old. Norway lead Cyprus 1-0 through a goal from \u2026 nope, not him. Taking the positives \u201cWell this is just typical, isn\u2019t it?\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cOne of those sporting sliding doors moments, like Henman v Ivanisevic at Wimbledon, or Rose v Mickelson at the Ryder Cup, or Stokes not spilling the catch with Australia eight down at Edgbaston. Match abandoned, Scotland lose the replay and collapse to fourth in the group without picking up another point. Well it was fun while it lasted I suppose.\u201d The stewards are brushing the water off the pitch. It\u2019s not the most sophisticated operation, I\u2019ll be honest, but I doubt this was in the job description. Apparently it is still raining, though not as heavily as before the game. I\u2019m not sure we\u2019re going to see any more football tonight. Presumably they could return tomorrow afternoon/evening at a push. 7.58 pm I won\u2019t lie, after that heart-stopping, brain-melting Ashes Test I was looking forward to a quiet, uneventful night. The match hasn\u2019t been abandoned, as far as I\u2019m aware. It looks like it has stopped raining, so they might just give the groundstaff half an hour to clear the surface water. 10 min Robertson points to his head and says \u201cthe ball\u2019s bouncing here\u201d. He wants to continue, and so would I if my team was 1-0 up. 9 min Now the referee is talking to the two captains, Andy Robertson and Guram Kashia. Robertson gently shoves another Georgian player away. The referee has run off the field. At first it seemed like there was a VAR check, but now I think he\u2019s talking to some suits about whether to abandon the game. Or perhaps the VAR technology is down because of all the rain. McGinn\u2019s corner from the right was headed away at the near post. McGregor charged onto the ball, 15 yards out, and lifted a right-foot shot that went through the hand of the diving Mamardashvili and into the net. Good luck calling it off now \u2013 Scotland have scored! 6 min Willy Sagnol, the Georgia manager, already seems to be asking for the game to be abandoned. He\u2019s got a point; this is just weird. 5 min What the hell happened there? Lobjanidze cuts inside from the right and hits a left-footed shot from the edge of the area. Gunn leaves it, safe in the knowledge that it\u2019s going wide of the far post \u2013 but then it changes direction after landing on the water. It goes wide anyway but for a split-second it looked like there might be a farcical goal. 4 min \u201cGenuine question as to whether the pitch is going to have a meaningful part in a major event,\u201d says Tony Barr. \u201cIt\u2019s a boon for anyone who routinely over hits their passes tbf\u2026\u201d My first touch would be immaculate on this. 3 min Kvaratskhelia tries to run with the ball, whiich is barely moving becaues of the water. This already has a whiff of farce. 1 min Peep peep! The match is under way. Jeez, this pitch is so wet, with a splash of water every time the ball bounces. There\u2019s a minute\u2019s applause for the mighty Gordon McQueen, who died last week aged 70. Summer in Glasgow Pitch inspection The referee is happy that the pitch is playable, so here come the players. The weather is almost beyond satire. \u201cScotland are operating with just the one Andrew today,\u201d writes Peter Oh, \u201cwhereas Georgia have got a Giorgi and a Georges in the starting XI and five Giorgis among their substitutes. Stacked!\u201d Topical pre-match music Steve Clarke speaks We need to be on the front foot tonight, we need to create chances, and putting Billy [Gilmour] in midfield should give us better control in that area. The lad from Napoli is a really good player, Kvaratskhelia. They\u2019re a good side \u2013 they\u2019ve got a number of other good players and their coach has got them very well organised. Sign up to Football Daily! It\u2019s dead free. The rain is so heavy that the players have aborted their warm-ups. In this weather it\u2019s more of a pneumonia-up. Tubthumping department \u201cNot that I\u2019m scarred or anything,\u201d begins James Humphries, \u201cbut I\u2019d just like to point out that after the Spain game, I confidently predicted nicking a result off Norway before somehow blowing it against Georgia (who have done us before, most notably with a 17-year-old debutant goalie). So I reckon 0-1 or 1-2 to Georgia, with one or both of the following: catastrophic defending leading to a Georgia goal out of nowhere, or Lyndon \u2018the man with no feet\u2019 Dykes* skying a gilt-edged chance thanks to the aforementioned pedi-impediment. \u201cBecause, c\u2019mon. It would be entirely nonsensical to blow it from here; and so, inevitably, that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do. \u201c* I have a lot of time for Dykes - he always gives maximum effort and makes himself a pain for defenders - and will concede that he appeared to have at least a foot against Norway; but I maintain that\u2019s only because not even he could manage to chest that ball in. The layup for McLean is harder to fit into this theory, I admit.\u201d The weekend\u2019s action in Group A The weather at Hampden: biblical \u201cUntil recently the BBC weather app was showing 0% chance of rain,\u201d writes Tony Barr. \u201cThis was at the same time it was literally chucking it down. I\u2019ve been to Tblisi a few times (food is amazing and it\u2019s very friendly) and it never rained. Not sure if this is a definitive call as a Scotland advantage however\u2026\u201d We\u2019ll also keep an eye on Norway v Cyprus, the other game in this group. Spain aren\u2019t playing in this round of fixtures as they\u2019ve been busy winning the Nations League. Steve Clarke makes one change from the side that started in Norway on Saturday. Billy Gilmour replaces Ryan Christie, which could mean a switch from 3-4-2-1 to 3-5-1-1. Georgia make four changes from their win over Cyprus. Solomon Kverkvelia, Luka Gagnidze, Lasha Dvali, Saba Lobjanidze replace Luka Lochoshvili, Giorgi Gocholeishvili, Giorgi Chakvetadze and Irakli Azarov. Scotland (possible 3-5-1-1) Gunn; Porteous, Hendry, Tierney; Hickey, McTominay, Gilmour, McGregor, Robertson; McGinn; Dykes. Substitutes: Kelly, Clark, Souttar, Shankland, Christie, Cooper, Armstrong, Ferguson, Nisbet, Jack, Taylor, McLean. Georgia (possible 3-5-2) Marardashvili; Kakabadze, Kashia, Kverkvelia; Gagnidze, Dvali, Kvekveskiri, Kiteishvili, Lobjanidze; Mikautadze, Kvaratskhelia. Substitutes: Loria, Gugeshashvili, Gvelesiani, Zivzivadze, Davitashvili, Kvilitaia, Gocholeishvili, Lochoshvili, Azarov, Shengelia, Chakvetadze, Altunashvili. Referee Istvan Vad (Hungary). Hello and welcome to live coverage of the European Championship qualifier between Scotland and Georgia at Hampden Park. They couldn\u2019t, could they? Well, yes, they could, we all know they could, but hopefully Scotland won\u2019t follow rousing wins over Spain and Norway with an anti-climax/shambles at home to Georgia. A win tonight would put Scotland \u2013 who are already five points clear in Group A \u2013 within touching distance of automatic qualification for Euro 2024. We shouldn\u2019t underestimate the challenge of Georgia, though. They are second in the group (mainly because of Scotland\u2019s win over Spain, it\u2019s true) and have had a really good run since the former Bayern Munich right-back Willy Sagnol took over as manager during Covid. Georgia\u2019s last defeat was in October 2021, since when their record is W10 D3 L0. Most of those games have been against third-tier opposition, but they are still a handy side. Like Scotland they were promoted in the Nations League, from League C to B in Georgia\u2019s case, and they have a genius in their team. Napoli\u2019s Khvicha Kvaratskhelia is one of the most exciting, original players in the world. Georgia aren\u2019t a one-man side \u2013 they also have players at Valencia, Bordeaux, Metz and Cremonese \u2013 but he is the main threat to Scotland\u2019s hopes. Okay, fair enough, some would say the main threat to Scotland\u2019s hopes is the last 50 years of Scottish football history, and the fatalism it has created. But apart from that it\u2019s Kvaratskhelia. Kick off 7.45pm BST."}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db580", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/20/scotland-georgia-euro-2024-qualifier-match-report", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Scotland overcome downpour and Georgia for fourth straight Euro win", "lead": "Scotland\u2019s Callum McGregor and Scott McTominay wrapped up a 2-0 win against Georgia in a game that was suspended and almost called off because of rain", "author": "Jamie Jackson at Hampden Park", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 22:31:13", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.991180", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/fff555771844bee05b22ca8dcffcc590325d0407/0_114_3444_2067/500.jpg", "body": "This was a Euro 2024 qualifier that fell 41 minutes short of requiring two days to complete after biblical rain caused a delay \u2013 six minutes into the game \u2013 of around an hour and a half, and a finishing time of 11.19pm. On the final whistle Steve Clarke\u2019s impressive Scotland had a fourth victory and 12 points and at the midpoint of Group C are already a near-shoo-in to reach next year\u2019s finals in Germany. What the manager is constructing is an expertly drilled unit burnished by the higher-end talents of Andy Robertson, Scott McTominay (who scored the second), and John McGinn, and which returned a far more complete triumph than the late-match mugging of Norway three days earlier. To see Lyndon Dykes sprint back to cover a rare Georgia foray as full time neared was instructive of the side\u2019s spirit, as he and his teammates closed proceedings out under the now cleared skies. The downpour caused Istvan Vad to inspect the pitch but the Hungarian referee was content to play, to the sell-out crowd\u2019s delight. They sang in the rain as Clarke\u2019s men bid to make it four wins in a row, having already beaten Cyprus, Spain and Norway. Georgia had arrived with four points. Vad may have been happy but the puddles being kicked up when the ball was addressed and a McTominay backheel sticking showed up the conditions and these were about to cause the game\u2019s prolonged pause. First, on six minutes, Scotland struck via a McGinn corner. The forward floated this over from the right, Dykes made a nuisance of himself, the ball went back and \u2013 after it slowed in the water \u2013 Callum McGregor smashed home. Cue Vad running to the touchline, conversing with a Uefa official, then Robertson and the Scotland captain\u2019s opposite number, Guram Kashia, and the game was suspended to allow ground staff to remove enough water to make the surface playable. When Vad came out for a first inspection 20 minutes later he judged it not to be. So, too, after a second look, at 8.45pm, as the players warmed up. But, finally, following a third assessment, the contest kicked off once more. This came with Georgia being reluctant to do so, for which they were booed, and Scotland dominated, Robertson and McTominay leading the charge. Otar Kiteishvili, though, was the Georgia No 10 who could see gaps for teammates who struck the ball confidently about between them when allowed. When Robertson swung in a cross, Dykes skidded across the slippy turf as a flying header looked on before the captain launched a buccaneering raid that took him clean through, but he ran out of space. McTominay, as half-time neared, forced Giorgi Mamardashvili to tip a low shot inches wide, then a McGinn effort was deflected to safety. Eighty seconds into the second half and the stadium erupted when McTominay steered a sweet left-foot home for his third of the group stage here, and fifth in all. As the jubilant crowd went \u201cnah, nah, nah, nah, nah\u201d to the Proclaimers\u2019 I\u2019m Gonna Be (500 miles), the song that accompanies Scotland goals at Hampden, their team had a definite stranglehold on the match. Georgia responded \u2013 Georges Mikautadze fed Kiteishvili in the Scotland area but they thwarted the threat and the hosts soon roved downfield where McGregor\u2019s radar, as he shot, was this time awry. McTominay, though, was unstoppable, akin to a battering ram who left those in white trailing, before an attempt, from distance, that was marginally wide. Billy Gilmour was Clarke\u2019s one change from Saturday\u2019s win against Norway and the midfielder impressed with his movement and continued bravery on the ball, Kiteishvili dumping him to the turf, although it had no effect. It was Gilmour\u2019s spiralling ball that gave Jack Hendry the chance, with his head, to add a third and though he missed this was immaterial \u2013 Khvicha Kvaratskhelia even missing a stoppage-time penalty. Clarke\u2019s side continue to march far ahead on the road to Germany and McTominay paid tribute to those who remained to see their latest triumph: \u201cAt the start we were all saying we couldn\u2019t play on the pitch. But we kept our heads and kept to the game plan and we did it really well. We came here to play, the crowd was amazingly patient. They kept us going. We thank them so much.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db581", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/20/international-roundup-germany-and-brazil-lose-as-ronaldo-sets-new-mark", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "International roundup: Germany and Brazil lose as Ronaldo sets new mark", "lead": "Euro 2024 hosts Germany lost 2-0 to Colombia while Senegal stunned Brazil 4-2 and Ronaldo played his 200th game for Portugal and scored in win", "author": "Guardian sport and agencies", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 22:05:15", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.991198", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/313ba69e9f23685d14617a29c5b2300a467cb7a1/0_90_3004_1803/500.jpg", "body": "Germany suffered a 2-0 home loss to Colombia in a friendly on Tuesday in their latest setback less than a year before they host Euro 2024, while Senegal thumped Brazil 4-2 in Lisbon with Sadio Man\u00e9 scoring twice. Luis D\u00edaz\u2019s 54th-minute header and Juan Cuadrado\u2019s penalty in the 82nd gave the visitors their first victory over the Germans, who were booed at the end. Germany, who have less than a year to build a battle-hardened team for the continental tournament, had needed two late goals to draw 3-3 with Ukraine last week before Friday\u2019s 1-0 loss to Poland. The four-time world champions have won just one of their last five matches since their shock World Cup group stage exit in December. They have also won only three of their last 11. \u201cObviously I am very disappointed that we could not apply what we had set out to do,\u201d said their coach Hansi Flick. \u201cThere are things that we wanted to try but they backfired.\u201d Flick, who took over in 2021 and is under mounting pressure since the early World Cup elimination, said after the game at Schalke\u2019s Veltins Arena his players were lacking in confidence. \u201cWhat can I say? The arguments are not on our side at the moment. We have to analyse it, draw our lessons,\u201d he said after three games without a win. \u201cThis is a cycle that we need to break through. In September we have to bring a different performance. We will see a different team and then the results will start coming,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are convinced we have a good team and good players.\u201d Former Liverpool forward Man\u00e9 made it a night to remember for Senegal after West Ham midfielder Lucas Paquet\u00e1 had put Brazil ahead in the 11th minute. Habib Diallo equalised for Senegal before an own goal from Marquinhos early in the second half gave Aliou Ciss\u00e9\u2019s side the advantage. Bayern Munich forward Man\u00e9 found the net twice in the second half including a late penalty as Marquinhos scored at the right end but Senegal become the first African team to score four goals against Brazil in amatch. Cristiano Ronaldo scored a stunning late goal as Portugal beat Iceland 1-0 on Tuesday to extend their perfect record in Euro 2024 qualifying Group J on an historic night for the forward who became the first player to make 200 international appearances. Ronaldo already held the record for most international appearances when he surpassed Kuwait\u2019s Bader al-Mutawa, who held the record of 196 matches, during Portugal\u2019s Euro 2024 qualifier against Liechtenstein in March. Ronaldo had to wait two minutes to celebrate the winner as the referee first ruled out his close-range strike in the 89th minute for offside, but the goal was given after the VAR replay showed he was fractionally onside. It was his 123rd goal for Portugal, extending his record as the all-time leading international goalscorer. Stand-in captain Romelu Lukaku scored twice in three minutes and Johan Bakayoko netted his first international goal as Belgium ended a tumultuous few days with a 3-0 victory over Estonia in their Euro 2024 Group F qualifier on Tuesday. The visitors had been rocked by a row between new coach Domenico Tedesco and veteran goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois in the build-up to the game, and made a slow start before Lukaku pounced with two close-range finishes towards the end of the first half. Norway\u2019s Erling Haaland scored twice in the second half as they cruised to a 3-1 win over Cyprus on Tuesday to get their Euro 2024 Group A campaign back on track after a shock 2-1 home defeat to Scotland in their previous game.

The research, which measured benzene levels in 87 homes in California and Colorado, found that gas and propane stoves frequently emitted benzene at rates well above healthy benchmarks set by the World Health Organization and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Leaving a single gas hob on for 45 minutes raised benzene levels to above that found in secondhand tobacco smoking, or at the boundary of oil and gas plants, with emissions 10 to 25 times higher than that from electric coil stoves. Even low-burning hobs, or gas oven use, emit significant levels of benzene. Induction stoves emit no benzene at all, the researchers found. The peer-reviewed study, led by scientists at Stanford University, is the first to use new monitors to effectively measure benzene indoors. Even low doses of airborne benzene raise the risk of a variety of cancers, including lymphomas and leukemia, by damaging people\u2019s bone marrow. Elevated levels of benzene can linger for six hours throughout a house or apartment after a gas stove is turned off. \u201cI\u2019m hard-pressed to think of a more powerful chemical cause of leukemia than benzene,\u201d said Jan Kirsch, a California-based oncologist who said that people had in their homes a \u201cvery potent\u201d cause of blood cell cancers. \u201cPeople have died, undoubtably, from exposure to benzene in their homes and unless this problem is ameliorated people will continue to do so,\u201d Kirsch said. \u201cThe idea is not to cause panic, but there are risks and we want to reduce them. It\u2019s important this message is carried to the public, so we can understand and act on it.\u201d More than a third of households in the US use gas stoves, although many lack adequate ventilation to help reduce dangerous levels of benzene, the researchers said. Range hoods, even when they are used, often just circulate air around a dwelling rather than expel the harmful chemicals. The result is indoor air hazards that often rival, or even exceed, the sort of outdoor air pollution that has been reduced through clean air regulations over the past 50 years. Gas stoves \u201care the only common fossil fuel appliance to vent pollution indoors\u201d, said Rob Jackson, a scientist at Stanford who helped lead the new research. \u201cWe would never willingly stand over the tailpipe of a car, breathing in its pollution, but we do willingly stand over our stoves, breathing in the pollution they emit,\u201d he added. Decades of previous research has highlighted the dangers posed by a stew of different emissions, including carbon monoxide and formaldehyde, that come from the burning of gas indoors. A study from earlier this year found that gas stoves are responsible for more than 12% of all childhood asthma cases in the US, with separate research discovering that a series of different pollutants are expelled from gas stoves, even after they are turned off. Joe Biden\u2019s administration has attempted to formulate efficiency standards for new stoves to lower such pollution, with around half of all stoves currently sold likely to fail the proposed safeguards. Several states, such as New York, have moved to phase out gas appliances in new buildings, too. This has provoked a furious political backlash, however, with Ron DeSantis, the Republican presidential hopeful, seeking to prevent any sort of gas stove ban in Florida, the state in which he is governor. Republicans in both the US House of Representatives and the Senate, meanwhile, have pushed forward legislation that would prohibit the banning of gas stoves. \u201cNothing is off limits to the radical left\u2019s Green New Deal agenda,\u201d said Markwayne Mullin, a Republican senator who signed onto the bill last week to \u201cget Washington out of our kitchens and our pocketbooks\u201d. Joe Manchin, the centrist Democrat from West Virginia, has joined with the Republicans, complaining last week that the \u201cfederal government has no business telling Americans how to cook their dinner\u201d. Stanford\u2019s Jackson pointed out that there is no proposal to remove people\u2019s existing gas stoves but that it made sense to encourage the adoption of cleaner-burning appliances when stove purchases are made in order to protect public health. \u201cWe should incentivize the use of induction stoves, particularly in lower-income communities,\u201d he said. \u201cWe stopped cooking over coal a century ago in the US because gas is cleaner and today I believe we should eventually stop cooking over gas because electricity is cleaner. We have a cleaner technology available today.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db583", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/20/jack-grealish-england-gareth-southgate", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018I\u2019m living my dream\u2019 \u2013 but did the full Grealish lead to England bit part? | David Hytner", "lead": "It was easy to feel that Gareth Southgate was miffed with the Manchester City midfielder who partied hard after the treble win", "author": "David Hytner", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 21:30:45", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.991232", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/bd54f6ba2d5bc45232bdd82991a5c5202fa61001/0_239_7175_4307/500.jpg", "body": "It used to be called going out, out. Now it is the full Grealish. And, for the man himself, it is easy to feel life will never be the same again. The first part of it is that Jack Peter Grealish from Solihull is a treble winner, a member of the Manchester City squad that has touched immortality. It was this that enabled the second bit \u2013 the one that has gilded the legend; some would say created it. Grealish was hardly alone on the three\u2011night bender in three countries that kicked off on the Saturday before last after City\u2019s Champions League victory against Internazionale in Istanbul. As the City midfielder Kalvin Phillips put it: \u201cEveryone was the same, everyone was enjoying it as much as Jack.\u201d Phillips would make another fair point. \u201cWhen Man United won the treble [in 1999], I dread to think what they were doing.\u201d No camera phones then. Or social media. Yet everybody knows which City player was the symbol of the celebrations, who was central to the most Instagram clips, who made the most headlines. \u201cHaving Treble, Jack?\u201d wrote the Sun on its front page last Tuesday, alongside a photograph of Grealish being helped by his teammate Kyle Walker into a people carrier for Ibiza airport the previous morning. Yes, Ibiza. Keep up. Most of the City players had headed there on the Sunday night for Part II of the Trilogy \u2013 dinner then party at Pacha until sunrise. Part I had been at the team hotel in Istanbul. The last leg was the open-top bus parade in Manchester on Monday evening, after a flight back from Ibiza, followed by another party at the Mayfield Depot in Piccadilly. \u201cFor the last 24 hours, I\u2019ve had the best day and night,\u201d Grealish said at the parade. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve had any sleep.\u201d He went on to say that he was a turkey and \u201cthe turkey needs feeding\u201d, before glugging down more booze, poured into his mouth by Phillips. Grealish is simply the largest-living and most quotable City player. One of the funniest, too. It is why he came to transcend the celebrations. The Sun had a point when it said Grealish\u2019s hangover must have been bad if Walker had to prop him up. They also reported that Ibiza airport staff had brought him a wheelchair because he was struggling to walk, which they offered as transportation to the plane. Grealish was able to make it up the steps himself. All of which, it is fair to say, was not the ideal preparation for Grealish\u2019s involvement with England in their atrociously timed Euro 2024 qualifiers away to Malta last Friday and at Old Trafford against North Macedonia on Monday. Grealish and City\u2019s other England players \u2013 Walker, John Stones, Phillips and Phil Foden \u2013 had to report to St George\u2019s Park last Tuesday night. \u201cI was a bit hungover but I weren\u2019t drunk or anything,\u201d Grealish says and if there is one line to capture the no-regrets outlook, the out\u2011there authenticity, it is this. There are others. \u201cI would never sit here and lie to you, and say: \u2018Yeah, I don\u2019t drink and I don\u2019t party\u2019 because I do,\u201d Grealish says. \u201cThere\u2019s so many people that will come here and say to you: \u2018I don\u2019t do this, I don\u2019t do that,\u2019 when they do. \u201cI\u2019m just truthful because [otherwise] when you see me doing anything, you\u2019d be like: \u2018Oh, hold on. He said a few weeks ago that he didn\u2019t do that.\u2019 I just enjoy myself. I\u2019m living my dream of playing for the best club in the world and we\u2019ve just won the treble. \u201cIt\u2019s something that will never happen again. So I went and enjoyed myself and I weren\u2019t the only one. A lot of the time you\u2019ll see everyone recording me. I could show you all this stuff of other people where they were the same. We all enjoyed ourselves. Other people enjoy themselves where the cameras weren\u2019t.\u201d It is rare to see a top footballer who does not hide his love of a drink and a party but it is all a part of Grealish\u2019s appeal. He is not only living his dream but that of many others and he is doing it as they would like to believe they would. When he came on as a substitute against North Macedonia, there were huge cheers and a chant that will surely be heard again. \u201cJack Grealish, he\u2019s still on the piss.\u201d Grealish\u2019s popularity knows no bounds but it is valid to ask whether Gareth Southgate has been as enamoured of him over the past week or so. Grealish says he knew he would not feature in the Malta tie but would he have started against North Macedonia if he had not reported for duty with a hangover? Southgate had him in the XI for the big game of the previous international window \u2013 the win over Italy in Naples. Against North Macedonia, he preferred Marcus Rashford, who was excellent. It was easy to feel that Southgate was miffed with Grealish, at the very least, when quizzed about him on the night before the Malta game. The England manager did not say whether he felt Grealish had crossed a line. Equally, he did not say that he was fine with his partying \u2013 and he had ample opportunity to do so. \u201cListen, I get on with him [Southgate] \u2026 I have a great relationship with him, honestly,\u201d Grealish says. \u201cI came into camp with the other [City] guys, we slept, then woke up and we trained Wednesday, Thursday. I trained well on Saturday and then on Sunday I thought it was going to be a toss-up with who plays \u2013 me, Phil [Foden] or Rashy. \u201cIt was Rashy and you can\u2019t complain. He\u2019s one of the most in-form players in the world. I came on and I\u2019m just happy. I\u2019ve had the most successful season of my life and there is a time now where I can just sit and relax.\u201d Which is certainly another way of putting it \u2026"}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db584", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/20/uk-parliament-calls-on-fifa-to-support-exiled-afghanistan-womens-team", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "UK parliament calls on Fifa to support exiled Afghanistan women\u2019s team", "lead": "Gianni Infantino has been urged to support Afghan women competing internationally with the parliamentarians letter backing a call made by Malala Yousafzai and Khalida Popal in January", "author": "Suzanne Wrack", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 21:30:45", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.991252", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/229fa8b320d4c19f813402ce2925395c5d5b2298/0_112_5472_3283/500.jpg", "body": "More than 100 parliamentarians have written to Gianni Infantino, urging the Fifa president to do more to support exiled Afghan female footballers and ensure Afghan women are able to compete on the international stage. The letter backs a call made by the Nobel prize winner Malala Yousafzai and Afghanistan women\u2019s national team founder Khalida Popal in the Guardian in January. Yousafzai and Popal have co-written the letter with Julie Elliott, the MP for Sunderland Central, and it has been signed by 76 members of the UK parliament and parliamentarians from Australia, Portugal and Italy. It calls on the governing body to do more to push back against restrictions placed on Afghan women\u2019s participation in sport. Elliott said: \u201cThe right to play football, and the right to compete, should be protected. Fifa should uphold their commitments to equality, and I believe that Fifa should be doing much more to support these women to regain their place on the world stage. \u201cThe support that this letter has got from colleagues across the house, and across the world, shows the widespread support for the women of Afghanistan, both those in exile, and those still living in the country, and their right to live how they choose.\u201d During the withdrawal of international forces from Afghanistan in 2021 the senior women\u2019s national team was evacuated to Australia, the country co-hosting the 2023 Women\u2019s World Cup with New Zealand. They continue to function as a team, supported by Melbourne Victory, and compete in the seventh tier as Melbourne Victory FC AWT. Several national youth-team players escaped to Portugal and Italy, and about 30 development-team players, including some with call-ups to the national youth teams and some from the league-winning Herat provincial team, reached the UK with the support of Leeds United. Since the Taliban took control of Afghanistan, women have been banned from playing sport and the national team have not been formally recognised and able to compete in international competition.

Last month, ministers announced they were dropping the kept animals bill, which was part of the Tories\u2019 2019 manifesto. The legislation was intended to ban live exports of farm animals as well as clamp down on puppy smuggling and dog theft. Now, Labour is bringing back the government\u2019s legislation unchanged in an opposition day motion on Wednesday to set aside parliamentary time on 12 July for the animal welfare (kept animals) bill to pass all stages and become law. Conservative sources said the bill was dropped over fears it would be used to crack down on the keeping of hunting dogs, which could have angered influential lobby groups and Tory donors. Members of the Conservative Animal Welfare Foundation, which counts MPs including the former environment secretary Theresa Villiers, Henry Smith and Sir Roger Gale among its members, are expected to vote in favour of the bill, which had widespread support in the Commons. MP Andrea Jenkyns spoke out last month when the government shelved the bill and has launched a parliamentary petition calling for it to be brought back. It is understood that a number of Conservative backbenchers are planning to speak in favour of the motion, in an attempt to force the government to put its own animal welfare legislation back on the table and avoid a Labour victory. The shadow environment secretary, Jim McMahon, has written to Conservative MPs asking for their support and stating: \u201cTo be absolutely clear, if the government and Tory MPs seek to kill the kept animals bill once again by either blocking the opposition day motion or the progress of the bill, you will be voting to continue puppy smuggling, puppy farming, pet theft and live animal exports.\u201d The Boris Johnson government had promised a revamp of animal welfare laws in the UK, using so-called \u201cBrexit freedoms\u201d to ban foie gras and fur imports, as well as passing the kept animals bill. However, successive governments have been less keen on these measures, with the environment secretary, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, having claimed there is not parliamentary time to ban fur and foie gras imports, and there has been a long delay in passing the kept animals bill, which was introduced into the Commons more than a year ago. McMahon said: \u201cThe kept animals bill is hugely important for animal welfare but it\u2019s also vital for delivering trust in politics. The Conservatives promised it in their 2019 manifesto and the prime minister personally committed to bringing it into law.\u201d The government is aiming to quash fears by bringing back some aspects of the bill as separate laws. On Tuesday, ministers announced they would be bringing in a law to ban primates as pets. A Defra spokesperson said: \u201cThe UK is a world leader on animal welfare and we are fully committed to maintaining and enhancing our strong track record to date. We are committed to delivering the kept animals bill measures individually during the remainder of this parliament and look forward to progressing these. We will be setting out next steps in due course.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db586", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/20/ukraine-lacks-capacity-to-process-huge-sums-in-aid-official-admits", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Ukraine lacks capacity to process huge sums in aid, official admits", "lead": "Largest amount of money Kyiv previously worked with was $6bn a year in 2014, Mustafa Nayyem says", "author": "Patrick Wintour Diplomatic Editor", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 21:30:44", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.991287", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/43cd51f40be4368ba5b1d7afcf4072f81eb54dad/0_150_3500_2101/500.jpg", "body": "Ukraine will struggle to absorb the expected billions of western private and public sector aid for its recovery not due to corruption, but a simple lack of capacity to process and invest such huge sums, a senior Ukraine official has said on the eve of the UK-sponsored Ukraine recovery conference in London. \u201cIt is about the capacity to work with this amount of money,\u201d said Mustafa Nayyem, the head of the Ukraine State Agency for Restoration and Infrastructure Development. During the two-day conference, the EU will make a pledge to spend \u20ac50bn (\u00a342.8bn) in grants and loans over the next four years largely to keep government services afloat. The UK will offer multibillion-pound export guarantees to the World Bank and pledge to use the sophisticated London insurance markets to develop a form of war insurance to protect western investments. The US is also to announce a significant economic aid package. The central aim of the conference, which will be attended by 1,000 delegates, is not pledge-making, but instead to stimulate private sector investment in Ukraine. The World Bank in March estimated that Ukraine faced a $430bn (\u00a3337bn) bill to replace its damaged buildings. Nayyem, who was appointed to run the Ukrainian reconstruction agency in January and was one of the first Facebook organisers of the Maidan revolution in 2014, said it would be a challenge for Ukraine to process such huge sums. \u201cIt is about the capacity to work with this amount of money. Historically the largest amount of money we have been capable of working with was $6bn a year in 2014. Now we are expecting much more, and it will be very difficult for the Ukrainian construction industry, government institutions and private institutions to deliver this result. It is not that the Ukrainians are bad, or corrupt. Show me the country that can do it.\u201d Nayyem also urged western donors not to be deterred by continuing corruption in the country nor to impose impossible conditions saying: \u201cWe cannot punish the whole country just because some people are corrupt. My generation did not start the Maidan in 2013-14 to be punished again because some oligarch was corrupt. Don\u2019t do that. It is not good to put some mark on a country and say it is corrupt.\u201d Speaking at Chatham House thinktank, he also made reference to London\u2019s reputation as a centre for Russian money laundering. \u201cAt one time I was sure it was only Ukraine. Now I am sure it is not only Ukraine. Look around you. We are in London.\u201d Nayyem said he already had 2,000 staff working in the regions, but admitted to a structural problem if reconstruction was exclusively directed locally. Less damaged and better-staffed cities had already submitted more claims to rebuild schools than more badly damaged eastern regions. After studying the regional distribution of initial bids for school reconstructions, he said: \u201cI thought the war was fought in the west and not the east.\u201d He said the infrastructure of Ukraine before the war was \u201coverloaded with so many facilities. We do not need so many schools, universities, hospitals that were built up during the Soviet Union but now that they are damaged and destroyed all communities want to rebuild everything, which is absurd.\u201d Nayyem admitted the case for rationalisation of public services was hard to sell to the Ukrainian public. A meeting of the G7 donors coordination committee on the sidelines of the conference is expected to discuss if there should be a single fund through which international financial institutions and governments funnel their aid, as well as whether war insurance will truly unlock private sector investment in a country that is at risk of further Russian violence. The UK will offer \u00a32.35bn in bank loan guarantees to the World Bank over the next three years to fund Ukraine\u2019s rebuild. Downing Street said the guarantees amount to the first bilateral package of multi-year fiscal assistance to be set out by a G7 country. In his address to the conference, the British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, will say : \u201cAs we\u2019ve seen in Bakhmut and Mariupol, what Russia cannot take, it will seek to destroy. They want to do the same to Ukraine\u2019s economy. The scale of the challenge is real. The war brought a 29% fall in Ukraine\u2019s GDP last year.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db587", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/20/rashford-kane-saka-potent-future-england-gareth-southgate", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Devastating debut of Rashford-Kane-Saka attack points way for England", "lead": "Gareth Southgate has options but rout of North Macedonia suggests Grealish, Foden and Sterling are playing catch-up", "author": "Jacob Steinberg", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 21:30:44", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.991307", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/597c8f8f6c28b533308752c695f7254ab5e30577/583_0_2429_1458/500.jpg", "body": "It is tempting to assume Gareth Southgate has found the way forward. England\u2019s manager picked a front three of Marcus Rashford, Harry Kane and Bukayo Saka for the first time on Monday and the results were devastating: a hat-trick for Saka, two more goals for Kane and, from Rashford, a performance that suggested a starting spot on the left is his to lose. North Macedonia had no way of handling the imagination, speed and trickery of England\u2019s attack. For a while the theory had been that Southgate\u2019s best attacking trio was Rashford-Kane-Saka, but it had never been put into practice. Rashford has been too susceptible to minor niggles and the suspicion is that Southgate\u2019s faith in him is not unflinching. Trust has to be built up. Rashford is in the middle of that process and despite his excellence for Manchester United last season it is worth remembering that he started only once at the World Cup. It did not quite happen for Rashford in Qatar. He scored three times during the group stage \u2013 once after coming off the bench against Iran, twice to kill off Wales \u2013 but was a reserve during the knockout stages. Saka and Phil Foden started on the flanks and Rashford stayed on the bench until the 85th minute when England lost to France in the quarter-finals. The sense was that England had wasted an opportunity to use their most effective forward line. The beauty for Southgate, though, is that he does not have to limit himself. Although Kane thrives when surrounded by pace, England can also turn to the subtler touches of Jack Grealish, Foden and James Maddison. \u201cThere will be games where different attributes are helpful,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cThat is the challenge for the squad. I\u2019d rather have that situation than say it\u2019s a headache. That\u2019s a brilliant position to be in.\u201d Although there is so much depth, the inclination is to favour Rashford and Saka. They are suited to playing with Kane, who just so happens to be England\u2019s record goalscorer and their best No 10. Rashford offers more directness than Grealish and Foden on the left and Saka is becoming undroppable on the right. The sense is that Rashford, Grealish, Foden and Maddison are fighting it out on the left. The shift in status is clear. Saka is the emerging star and if it continues to click with Rashford there is less need for Raheem Sterling, whose pace and finishing once made him a mandatory starter. Southgate is not ready to write Sterling off. But the winger sat out this camp to recover after a difficult first season at Chelsea and he could struggle to regain his place. \u201cHe\u2019s a fighter,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cIn the past he was the name on the teamsheet \u2013 we knew his goals were critical. There is now more competition there but I expect him to respond. The part he has to get right this summer is his physical fitness and I would expect him to be flying next year.\u201d Sterling was vital two years ago, driving England to the Euro 2020 final and setting the standard for other wingers to follow. Kane aside, nobody could match Sterling in the final third. He scored big goals and was crucial in a tactical sense, stretching teams by running beyond defenders, ensuring England did not get bogged down because of Kane\u2019s lack of explosive speed. His problem is that Saka and Rashford can do all that and more. Rashford has more layers to his game and Saka is special. The Arsenal winger can make those diagonal runs, as he did when he ran on to Kane\u2019s sweeping pass and completed his hat-trick against North Macedonia, and then there is relentlessness of his dribbling. The quality of his final ball. The conviction in his shooting. Southgate knows it, though he was wary of calling Saka an automatic starter. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to keep other people feeling important within the squad,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019d be foolish to give anybody that half a per cent that might cause them to take a step back.\u201d A year out from Euro 2024, Southgate was right not to go overboard. The mood can change. Mason Mount will have something to offer in midfield when back from injury. Grealish and Foden are too good not to play and this is a big summer for Maddison, who needs a move after Leicester\u2019s relegation. England have more than one way of playing. No doubt the starting point has to be the 4-3-3, which feels sturdier than 4-2-3-1. There is no need for a No 10 when England have Kane, especially as the thought of Jude Bellingham driving forward from midfield is a mouthwatering prospect. Yet new options keep emerging. This was the camp when Southgate saw Trent Alexander-Arnold flourish as a midfielder. Alexander-Arnold\u2019s passing gave England a new dimension and Southgate would not rule out using him against elite opposition after watching the Liverpool player excel against Malta and North Macedonia. The only problem, Southgate said, was that Jordan Henderson had just produced two more excellent performance alongside Declan Rice. It is about finding the right balance. The tantalising option is a midfield of Rice, Bellingham and Alexander-Arnold, but would Southgate sacrifice Henderson\u2019s pressing and energy against the very best? There are, as he said, different solutions for different games. At this juncture Rashford-Kane-Saka looks like the most potent front three. But there will be fluctuations in form and fitness during the next 12 months. Southgate will avoid favourites. He has to remain flexible."}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db588", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/20/honduras-prison-riot-women-killed", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018Monstrous murder\u2019: 46 women killed in Honduras prison riot", "lead": "Some women were burned to death in uprising blamed on crackdown on illicit activities inside of the country\u2019s prisons", "author": "Staff and agencies in Tegucigalpa", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 21:26:50", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.991326", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/2fb65cf9325b2ace6c393e00063ed95fd8eb573a/0_0_6048_3627/500.jpg", "body": "At least 46 women have been killed \u2013 some of them burned to death \u2013 after an outbreak of violence between gangs at a prison in Honduras. Authorities found dozens of bodies after the violence on Tuesday at the prison in Tamara, about 30 miles (50km) north-west of the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa, said Yuri Mora, spokesperson for the national police investigation agency. Some of the victims had been shot to death, and at least seven female inmates were being treated at a Tegucigalpa hospital for gunshot and knife wounds, employees there said. President Xiomara Castro said she was shocked by what she described as the \u201cmonstrous murder\u201d of the women, which she blamed on powerful street gangs. \u201cSolidarity with the families,\u201d she wrote in a tweet, adding that she would respond with \u201cdrastic measures\u201d. Delma Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, the president of an association for prisoners\u2019 families, told Reuters that a brawl had broken out at the prison between members of rival gangs Barrio 18 and the Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13). Relatives of the inmates gathered outside the prison, seeking to find out about their loved ones. \u201cI\u2019m looking for information about what happened to my daughter, but they still haven\u2019t informed us,\u201d a woman who identified herself as Ligia Rodr\u00edguez said in a television interview. Julissa Villanueva, the head of the country\u2019s prison system, suggested the riot started because of recent attempts by authorities to crack down on illicit activity inside prisons and called Tuesday\u2019s violence a result of \u201cthe actions we are taking against organized crime\u201d. \u201cWe will not back down,\u201d Villanueva said in a televised address after the riot. Gangs often wield broad control inside the country\u2019s prisons, where inmates often set their own rules and sell prohibited goods. The riot appears to be the worst tragedy at a female detention center in the region since 2017, when girls at a shelter for troubled youths in Guatemala set fire to mattresses to protest rapes and other mistreatment at the badly overcrowded institution. The ensuing smoke and fire killed 41 girls. The worst prison disaster in a century also occurred in Honduras, in 2012 at the Comayagua penitentiary, where 361 inmates died in a fire.

But if that\u2019s not attracting people to the game we love then I don\u2019t know what will. In terms of what we put into this week, taking the game on from ball one, it would have been easy to play it a bit safer but we didn\u2019t do that, not one individual. That\u2019s something I\u2019ve very proud of.\u201d Though England were within sight of victory before Pat Cummins, the Australia captain, and Nathan Lyon put together an unbeaten partnership of 55 to change the course of the game, Stokes insisted that defeat was \u201cnot a psychological blow at all\u201d. \u201cIf you look at the way we\u2019ve played over the last five days, compared with other recent Ashes series, it shows we\u2019re able to stand up to Australia in the way we want to play,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were so many questions coming into the series around whether we would be able to implement this style of play against that team, not just with the bat but with the ball against some unbelievable batsmen. I think we\u2019ve proved that we can. \u201cLosing sucks. Any game you play in sport, you always want to be the winner. But not putting the result at the top of everything that we think about actually really helps us play free-spirited cricket. When I think what it\u2019s done for the series and the game, it\u2019s hard to be too disappointed.\u201d Stokes described himself as \u201cflying on caffeine\u201d during a marathon final session to which he contributed seven overs and the wicket of Usman Khawaja, an apparently key moment which he barely celebrated. \u201cI had to keep myself pretty level,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the lads were saying: \u2018Are you all right?\u2019 I just found myself in a moment within the game where I knew it wasn\u2019t done.\u201d The England captain was involved in another potentially match-changing moment when he had a chance to dismiss Nathan Lyon with Australia still 36 runs from their target, but he dropped a difficult catch \u2013 a moment that reminded him of Lyon\u2019s fumbled run\u2011out chance when England won a thriller at Headingley four years ago. \u201cIf I\u2019d taken that catch we could have got Josh Hazlewood out first ball, or they could still have knocked the runs off, you never know,\u201d he said. \u201cYou think back to Headingley, with Gaz [Lyon] dropping the ball. I drop that catch and he\u2019s still out there at the end. It\u2019s mad how things go round.\u201d Cummins, echoing the words of Khawaja \u2013 who was named man of the match \u2013 at the end of the game, declared it \u201cthe No 1 Test I\u2019ve ever played in\u201d. It was also Australia\u2019s highest successful run chase in England since Don Bradman powered them to a then-record 404 at Headingley in 1948. \u201cI think it\u2019s huge in [giving us] that belief to be able to win from anywhere, having that belief that anyone\u2019s a match-winner,\u201d Cummins said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in the back yard playing as a kid, these are the moments you wish to be in \u2013 going out there and doing it in the middle of an Ashes series.\u201d Much has been made of the teams\u2019 contrasting approach to the game, but Cummins said the game was all the better for them. \u201cBoth teams spoke about playing their own styles before the game and it is just one of the beauties of this series, that we have contrasting styles. We both played to our strengths and you don\u2019t know what style is necessarily better \u2013 but it makes for good entertainment.\u201d The former Australia captain Ricky Ponting believes England will be left questioning their \u201cBazball\u201d approach after defeat. \u201cThe interesting thing coming out of it for me is going to be which team has got the most questions to answer, and I think England do. By no means am I saying England\u2019s methods are wrong. I have loved watching them play.

After being on the wrong end of several dramatic finishes in England in recent years, Australia won the first Test at Edgbaston by two wickets to slay the demons of 2005 and 2019. We\u2019ve got all the news and reaction to a match that will be talked about for years.

More on Donald Trump\u2019s classified document trial. Here\u2019s an explainer from the Guardian\u2019s Richard Luscombe on Aileen Cannon, the Florida judge who will oversee Donald Trump\u2019s federal classified documents case and set the 14 August trial date. Aileen Cannon, the Florida district judge assigned to oversee Donald Trump\u2019s classified documents case, initially at least, was appointed to the federal bench by the former president three years ago, and gave him a favorable ruling at an earlier hearing last year. But Cannon was later rebuked by an appeals court panel for granting Trump\u2019s request for an independent special master to review the documents. That action slowed the justice department\u2019s investigation and prompted questions over her impartiality. On Thursday, Cannon\u2019s name was listed on the summons sent to Trump\u2019s lawyers announcing his indictment, indicating she will be in charge of the timing and progression of hearings. There is no certainty she will remain on the case. And next Tuesday\u2019s first hearing in Miami is expected to be held in front of magistrate judge Bruce Reinhart, who signed the original warrant authorizing an FBI search of Mar-a-Lago, Trump\u2019s Florida home. But while she is the assigned jurist, Cannon, 42, will have broad authority to control almost every aspect, including which evidence is admissible, the ability to slow down or speed up proceedings, and even the legal viability of the justice department\u2019s case.

The White House has announced that Joe Biden, Jill Biden, Kamala Harris and Doug Emhoff will \u201cparticipate in a political event with reproductive rights groups\u201d this Friday, 23 June. Last year on Friday, 24 June, the US supreme court ruled in the case Dobbs v Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, a key case out of Mississippi that included the explicit urging for the court to overturn Roe v Wade, which it did. Roe was the historic ruling by that highest court in the US in 1973 that introduced the federal right to an abortion. So Potus, Flotus, Veep and Sgotus clearly plan to make a high-profile mark this Friday to register their support for a woman\u2019s right to choose her own reproductive health options in the US and whether to carry a baby or seek a termination. Pushing back against the rightwing drive to ban abortion and that pivotal decision by the conservative-dominated supreme court has been a vote winner for the Democrats ever since. Guardian US is engaged in bringing you original stories in our special series this week, A Year Without Roe. Check it out! Usually when the White House issues an ICYMI notice, most had not missed whatever it was. But given that yesterday was the Juneteenth holiday and there was/is a small kerfuffle about a missing submersible in the vicinity of the Titanic, folks may have missed the president\u2019s remarks yesterday about action to tackle the climate crisis. Joe Biden was in Palo Alto, California, yesterday. The White House reminds us that: During his visit, the President announced that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is launching a first-ever $575 million Climate Resilience Regional Challenge to help coastal and Great Lakes communities, including Tribal communities in those regions, become more resilient to extreme weather and other impacts of the climate crisis. The funding will support innovative coastal resilience and adaptation solutions, such as building natural infrastructure, planning and preparing for community-led relocation, and protecting public access to coastal natural resources, that protect communities and ecosystems from sea level rise, tidal flooding hurricanes, storm surge, among other severe climate impacts. In addition, the President highlighted a $2.3 billion investment in states, Territories, Tribes, and the District of Columbia over the next five years to bolster grid resilience across the country. The President also announced that later this year, he will convene local, state, Tribal, and territorial leaders for a White House climate resilience summit, where leaders will develop a roadmap for ensuring we build more climate-resilient communities all across America. The Guardian is huge on covering the climate crisis, you can dip into any of our stories on the relevant section of our site, here. Hello politics live blog readers, it\u2019s been a lively morning in US political news and there\u2019s a lot more to come, so please do stick with us as we bring you all the developments as they happen. Here\u2019s where things stand: House speaker Kevin McCarthy says DoJ should turn over the records from its investigation into Hunter Biden to the Republican-controlled House oversight committee, which has its own investigation going into the president\u2019s son. McCarthy has called Hunter Biden\u2019s plea agreement with DoJ a \u201csweetheart deal\u201d, adding that the latest filings should ramp up investigations into Joe Biden. Donald Trump responded via his social media platform to the news about Hunter Biden, with characteristically blunt populist-speak: \u201cWow!

We will have no further comment.\u201d Hunter Biden will plead guilty to federal crimes as part of a plea agreement with the Department of Justice (DoJ) to resolve tax and firearm crimes. Judge Aileen Cannon, presiding in Donald Trump\u2019s federal criminal case over his keeping classified documents at Mar-a-Lago after leaving office and allegedly refusing to return them and obstructing the related investigation, has set a trial date of August 14 this year. Trump was only arraigned on dozens of charges last week. Amid charges filed against Hunter Biden, Republicans are urging for a ramped up investigation into Biden. A May article from the Guardian\u2019s David Smith gives context on the lack of evidence from such an investigation. Comer has also said he obtained thousands of pages of financial records showing that at least nine members of the Biden family \u2013 including the president\u2019s son, Hunter, and brother, James \u2013 allegedly exploited the Biden name in their business dealings by accepting money from foreign nationals in China and Romania. The oversight committee chairman followed up with an eagerly hyped press conference this week, stating in an interim report that some Biden family members, associates and their companies received more than $10m from foreign entities between 2015 and 2017. Hunter, a lawyer, received more than $1m from a company controlled by Romanian businessman Gabriel Popoviciu, who was the subject of a criminal investigation and prosecution for corruption in Romania. But the financial records showed no evidence that Biden himself acted improperly or took any official action because of his family\u2019s business affairs. Nor, despite the claims of \u201cinfluence peddling\u201d, did they demonstrate actual wrongdoing by the Biden family. The press conference was widely ignored or panned. David Brock, president of Facts First USA, a non-profit watchdog, said afterwards: \u201cThe reality is we don\u2019t even have a scandal here, much less Watergate.\u201d Read the full article here. A new CNN poll found that support for Trump has fallen slightly after his arrest on federal charges, but that the former president still leads support ahead of the Republican primary. 47% of Republicans and Republican-leaning voters said that Trump was their top candidate for the 2024 Republican primary. The figure is down from 53%, from a May CNN poll. Trump\u2019s favorability among Republican voters also dipped following federal indictment charges, from 77% in May to 67% in the latest poll. The percentage of Republican voters who say they will not support Trump under any circumstances has increased, from 16% in May to 23%. Read the full CNN article here. Donald Trump has said that, if elected in 2024, his family would not serve in his administration. Trump confirmed that his family would not join his administration as it would be \u201ctoo painful\u201d for them, said the former president in a Fox interview on Monday night. \u201cMy family\u2019s been through hell. I mean, they have \u2014 Eric, my son, who\u2019s a fine boy. You know him very well. \u2026 We were doing beautifully. Then I decide to run for president. I don\u2019t think anybody in the world in history has ever had more subpoenas sent to him,\u201d said Trump said during the Fox interview, referring to criminal investigations looking into alleged the Trump Organization. Trump added: \u201cNobody has been through what my family has been through. Ivanka had a really successful line of clothing, I mean, making a fortune. When I did this, she closed it up. She sort of felt she had to, but she closed it up.\u201d Ivanka, Trump\u2019s daughter, and her husband Jared Kushner both served in advisory roles during Trump\u2019s tenure. Read the full article from the Hill here. McCarthy added that the Department of Justice should have to turn over records to the House Oversight committee for their ongoing investigation into Hunter Biden. \u201cThe DOJ should not be able to withhold any information now, saying that because a pending investigation, they should be able to provide Chairman Comer with any information that he requires,\u201d said McCarthy. From CNN\u2019s Manu Raju: More Republicans are condemning Hunter Biden\u2019s plea deal. New York representative Elise Stefanik released a statement on the plea deal, calling out \u201ca two-tiered system of justice\u201d that purportedly benefited Biden. \u201cThis is the epitome of the politicization and Weaponization of Joe Biden\u2019s Department of Justice as they give a slap on the wrist to President Biden\u2019s son - a tax fraud and corrupt pay-to-play criminal. It\u2019s never been more clear that we have a two-tiered system of justice when you have the son of the sitting President of the United States selling our country out to the highest bidder, laundering money, committing tax fraud, accepting bribes, illegally obtaining a firearm, and shamefully avoiding child support. House Republicans will not rest until the full illegal corruption of the Biden Crime Family is exposed. Joe Biden must and will be held accountable.\u201d Homeland Security deputy secretary John Tien is retiring, according to an internal announcement on Tuesday. First reported by ABC News, Tien shared that he will be leaving the department on 20 July. \u201cAfter 26 years of combined federal service including three combat tours in Iraq and living apart from my family for the last two years, I have decided to return to Atlanta to re-join them there,\u201d wrote Tien in an email. \u201cWhen I depart from DHS on July 20, 2023, I will most fondly remember what the Secretary and I tried to do for the workforce to vastly improve the lives of our fellow employees in terms of pay, training, facilities, and technology support, all essential to improving morale.\u201d Tien, a veteran who served in the military for over 24 years, was one of the highest ranking Asian-Americans in the Biden administration. House speaker Kevin McCarthy has called the Hunter Biden plea deal a \u201csweetheart deal\u201d, adding that the latest filings should ramp up investigations into Biden. McCarthy also suggested that Biden should face jail time over crimes he has committed. From CNN\u2019s Manu Raju: Here\u2019s more information on a court date on Donald Trump\u2019s federal charges for retaining classified documents and obstruction of justice, from Reuters. US district judge Aileen Cannon has set an initial trial date of 14 August in Florida on former US president Donald Trump\u2019s federal charges of willful retention of classified government records and obstruction of justice, according to a court order on Tuesday. The justice department\u2019s special counsel in the case, Jack Smith, promised a speedy trial after a 37-count indictment charging Trump with willfully retaining classified government records and obstructing justice. But the complexities of handling highly classified evidence, the degree to which Trump\u2019s legal team challenges the government\u2019s pre-trial motions, and the way the judge manages the schedule could all lead to a trial that is anything but swift, legal experts say, and a lengthy delay is widely expected. Trump\u2019s lawyers and a US justice department spokesperson did not immediately return requests for comment. The latest order came after a US judge on Monday ordered Trump\u2019s defense lawyers not to release evidence in the classified documents case to the media or the public, according to a court filing. Read the full story here. Donald Trump has commented on charges filed against Hunter Biden, comparing the plea deal struck to a traffic ticket. In a post made by Trump to social media platform Truth Social, Trump said: \u201cWow! The corrupt Biden DOJ just cleared up hundreds of years of criminal liability by giving Hunter Biden a mere \u2018traffic ticket.\u2019 Our system is BROKEN!\u201d Make America Great Again Inc, a super pac that supports Trump, also released a statement calling the agreement a \u201csweetheart deal\u201d to \u201cmake their bogus case to \u2018get Trump\u2019 appear fair.\u201d Republican lawmakers have publicly criticized a plea deal Hunter Biden will enter for tax and firearm charges, as investigations in Biden and his family are expected to ramp up. In a statement, House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer called Biden\u2019s charges a \u201cslap on the wrist when growing evidence uncovered by the House Oversight Committee reveals the Bidens engaged in a pattern of corruption, influence peddling, and possibly bribery\u201d. Illinois representative Mary Miller called Biden\u2019s expected plea a \u201csweetheart deal from the DOJ that shields \u201cTHE BIG GUY\u201d Joe Biden from the Biden foreign bribery operation\u201d. The White House issued a statement on Hunter Biden\u2019s charges, amid Justice Department filing confirming that Biden will enter a plea deal for tax crimes and a federal gun offense. A White House spokesperson said in a statement: \u201cThe President and First Lady love their son and support him as he continues to rebuild his life. We will have no further comment.\u201d Chris Clark, the lawyer representing Hunter Biden, has released a statement following charges filed against Biden. According to a statement shared with CNN, Clark acknowledged that Biden was charged with two misdemeanor tax crimes that were resolved in a plea agreement and one federal firearm charge, that was subject to a pre-trial diversion agreement. Calling the five-year investigation into Biden \u201cresolved\u201d, Clark added: \u201cI know Hunter believes it is important to take responsibility for these mistakes he made during a period of turmoil and addiction in his life. He looks forward to continuing his recovery and moving forward.\u201d From CNN\u2019s Manu Raju: Biden will plead guilty to federal crimes as part of a plea deal with the Justice Department to resolve tax and firearm crimes. Biden, 53, was charged with illegally owning a firearm in 2018 after lying about his drug use when he purchased a gun. Biden was also charged with failing to file and pay taxes in 2017 and 2018, which are misdemeanor offenses and fairly minor charges. Documents from the Justice Department confirm that Biden will enter a pre-trial diversion agreement for the firearm offense. But the White House has been preparing for any potential political fallout related to charges against Hunter Biden since early May, as lawyers representing Biden met with top federal prosecutors in Delaware in April. Hunter Biden, the son of Joe Biden, will plead guilty to three federal crimes on Tuesday, according to Justice Department. Biden is pleading guilty to two counts of wilful failure to pay income tax and a separate federal firearm offense, reports Reuters. This story is breaking. Follow the blog for more updates. It promises to be another very busy week in American political news and we\u2019ll bring you all the developments as they happen. Here\u2019s what\u2019s also happening: Judge Aileen Cannon, presiding in Donald Trump\u2019s federal criminal case over his keeping classified documents at Mar-a-Lago after leaving office and allegedly refusing to return them and obstructing the related investigation, has set a trial date of August 14 this year. Trump was only arraigned on dozens of charges last week. Joe Biden is very much out on the 2024 election campaign trail. He\u2019s in California, where yesterday he spoke about climate action and today he\u2019s speaking about seizing the opportunities of artificial intelligence (AI). Special counsel John Durham, who ran \u201can investigation into an investigation\u201d at the behest of the Trump administration, reviewing the Trump-Russia inquiry (and finding very little of substance) is due to testify at 3pm ET before the (Republican-controlled) House intelligence committee."}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db58c", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/jun/20/usman-khawaja-pat-cummins-ashes-australia-england-first-test-day-five-cricket", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Forget 2005 comparisons, this was as dramatic as decade-old Durham | Geoff Lemon", "lead": "First Test was reminiscent of 2013 as Warner gave Australia a flying start before Broad delivered one of his Ashes specials", "author": "Geoff Lemon at Edgbaston", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 20:03:28", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.991400", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/bc63ec66f2f67175538e420c53e3bf1366f27035/0_38_3500_2101/500.jpg", "body": "Smoking Jesus. Take a moment to collect yourself. If you were watching that final day at Edgbaston, you deserve to let your nerves unspool. They must be clenched to raging little clusters of data. Do some deep breathing. Take your shoes off and walk on the lawn. Fists with your toes. Even if you\u2019re not invested in either team, close Test cricket can make you sick, when awaiting each delivery feels like you\u2019ve just chugged a large chocolate milk before jumping on Magic Mountain. If you\u2019ve paid any attention to coverage over the past five days, you might have heard one or two comparisons to the Edgbaston Ashes Test of 2005. Run totals of 407 on the first day, fourth\u2011innings targets for Australia of 282 and 281 respectively, falling short both times under clouded skies, simmering in the fetid steambath of noise generated by the Hollies Stand. Until the dramatic work of Australia\u2019s lower order, though, this was more reminiscent of Durham in 2013. That time Australia were set a chase of 299. Both involved David Warner giving Australia a flying start in the company of a left\u2011handed opening partner enjoying a late-career revival at around the age of 36: Usman Khawaja now, Chris Rogers then. Khawaja was there in 2013, too, as was Steve Smith in the middle order and Nathan Lyon as the spinner. Both times Mitchell Starc was left out, and his pace was missed as England ran up a score in the third innings. Both involved a hulking blond all-rounder making useful runs at six, from Shane Watson to Cameron Green. And both involved a Stuart Broad spell, one of his Ashes specials. Durham was the more dramatic: a streak of six for 20 across 45 balls after the door had been prised open with the removal of the top three. Edgbaston had Broad apply the crowbar: removing Smith and Marnus Labuschagne in the space of 12 balls on the fourth evening. That spell more than anything was reminiscent of a decade earlier: the tall figure of Broad wading in on his heron legs, so elongated that his own shadow was jealous, his whites glowing a shade of gold in the late\u2011day sunshine. Cheered into his delivery stride each time by a liquored terrace of uncontained humanity, singing the same song about him being better than his dad. Chris Broad is a decent match referee but probably wouldn\u2019t give much argument. It was testament to Pat Cummins and Nathan Lyon, then, that Broad didn\u2019t have the decisive influence on the fifth day. For a time it was England\u2019s other talisman, Ben Stokes. As the captain leading their stated intention to set every game ablaze, he was set up opposite the approach of Khawaja. You could typify the contrast as fire and ice, but really it was fire and water. Whatever England tried to brandish, Khawaja doused. He faced 518 balls in the match, where the other five Australian specialists managed 393. England\u2019s entire team, both times, faced 866. There was something cussedly specific about the way Khawaja stretched forward to defend, time and again, occasionally diverting a single, even more rarely finding the boundary. So after a long wait, 70 overs into the innings, Stokes dragged his bad knee into action. In his second over, a cross-seamer took the inside edge on to the stumps. The immovable Khawaja was gone for 65. Stokes was away, with his incredible knack for shaping a game. Ignoring the new ball, keeping Joe Root on with spin that claimed Alex Carey\u2019s wicket the very next over. Then Stokes so nearly recreating his famous World Cup catch, running backwards after Lyon\u2019s hook. But that particular miracle couldn\u2019t repeat, and the extraordinary last stanza of this match took on an unexpected meter. In terms of playing style, the result owes its existence to England\u2019s. Had they batted conventionally in either innings, there would not have been enough time for Australia to have played their own way and won, given the sessions lost to rain. But there would also not have been time for England to come so close to a win themselves. One more nick, and Josh Hazlewood at No 11 was every chance of offering a second. And when the game came down to its last fateful overs, Australia\u2019s captain put an attacking philosophy just as firmly on display. Needing 72 when Khawaja was out, and 54 when Carey followed, Cummins hit twin sixes off Root, then charged Broad and hammered four through cover point. Australia could have looked to bunker down with 15 overs to go, but it turns out that they don\u2019t do draws either. Which, much as you might like to avoid cliche, does take you back to 2005. Specifically to Australia\u2019s lower order pulling a distant chase into the realms of possibility. Back then it was Brett Lee 43 not out, nearly getting home. This time it was Pat Cummins with one more run, with the opposite result, and with one of the best captain\u2019s innings in an Ashes match. One thing is certain: in a couple of decades from now, people will still be talking about this one too."}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db58d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/jun/20/fine-margins-dictate-outcome-of-ben-stokess-decisions-in-england-defeat", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Bold or brainless?

Just like the man on the radio phone-in said it would. Ben Stokes\u2019s bold/brainless decision (note to subeditors: I\u2019m on deadline, so please delete as appropriate) to call his batsmen in early in the first innings turned out to be a truly inspired/idiotic bit of captaincy. Joe Root was on 118 at the time, and Ollie Robinson had 17, the two of them were rattling along and common sense dictated they should be left to get on with it. But Stokes thought differently. Well, the handful of extra runs England would have made/the precious time Stokes saved really told late on the fifth day. So did the calls the selectors made before the game. Everyone knew how they were going to play out. The decision to bring in Jonny Bairstow as wicketkeeper paid off when he made that counterattacking 78 in the first innings/proved costly when he missed a stumping and three catches; and as for picking Moeen Ali, who hadn\u2019t played a first-class game in two years, that turned out to be such a discerning/desperate bit of thinking when Moeen took three crucial wickets/conceded almost 200 runs in his 47 overs. And the tactics in that last hour? The decision to wait to take the new ball, to set the field back, to keep Jimmy Anderson out of the attack. Well you just knew, didn\u2019t you? The truth is the rights and wrongs of every one of these decisions turned on the one thing Stokes insisted doesn\u2019t actually matter much at all: the result. And since Australia won by two wickets, you don\u2019t need me to tell you how they look now. There will be plenty of other people to do that for you, on radio, and TV, in the papers, on the comment sections, and down the pub. The margins are thin in Test cricket. If Stokes himself had only held a leaping one-handed catch off Nathan Lyon, Australia would have been down to their very last batters with 30 runs left to get. And he so very nearly did. But he spilled it as he came back down, and the ball tumbled out on to the ground. It\u2019s cruel that a game played over five days can be defined by what happened in that one split\u2011second of action, but that\u2019s the sport. Or at least, it\u2019s supposed to be. \u201cIf you fail, then you fail. So what?\u201d Stokes said before this match started. \u201cThe bottom line is, everybody fails at some point, so you might as well go out batting the way you want to. That won\u2019t change just because it\u2019s the Ashes. We\u2019ll move on, we\u2019ll go to sleep and we\u2019ll wake up the next day, hopefully with the sun shining, and we\u2019ll just go again.\u201d Stokes\u2019s approach is to ask his team to play the right way, enjoy themselves, entertain everybody else, and let the result look after itself. It is, you have to say, an unusual strategy for a professional sportsman, and meant, you guess, to take the pressure off his players by reminding them there\u2019s really nothing much to fear in losing. It\u2019s a lesson he\u2019s already taught them once before. Ten months ago, England lost against South Africa at Lord\u2019s. Maybe you remember it. They had won all four games they\u2019d played so far that summer, against India and New Zealand, but were routed by the South African attack, who bowled them out for 165 in the first innings and 149 in the second. There were an awful lot of people waiting to say \u201cI told you so\u201d after that happened. Because if 140-some years of Test cricket have taught us anything it\u2019s that of course you can\u2019t keep batting like that and expect to get away with it. We expected Stokes to recant everything he\u2019d said, or at the very least to express a little regret. He didn\u2019t. \u201cDid we commit to everything?\u201d he said instead. \u201cIf everyone can say yes, 100%, but we just didn\u2019t execute, then things are good.\u201d They won the next Test by an innings, the one after by nine wickets, and the series 2-1. The \u201ctold-you-sos\u201d will sound again now, louder than they did last summer. Stokes and his players will face a lot of hard questions about what England got right, and wrong, and what they\u2019ll change before the next game. And while they might well do a little tinkering, anyone expecting him to change direction now hasn\u2019t been paying attention. It was interesting to watch England in the moments after Pat Cummins hit the winning runs. They didn\u2019t look, or act, like a team who had just lost a game that they probably should have won. Stokes even seemed to be smiling. He slapped Cummins on the back, and wrapped a couple of his teammates up in a hug. England lost one of the most memorable, and entertaining, games of cricket played in this country in a long while, and are now 1-0 down in the series. But, hell, there are four more still to play and, Stokes will be pleased to know, the Met Office is indeed forecasting that the sun will be out tomorrow."}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db58e", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2023/jun/20/the-ashes-2023-england-vs-australia-live-updates-first-test-cricket-eng-v-aus-latest-score-day-five-egdbaston-weather", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "The Ashes: Australia beat England by two wickets in thrilling first Test \u2013 as it happened", "lead": "England were closing in with just two wickets required, but Pat Cummins led a rearguard action to get Australia over the line at Edgbaston", "author": "Daniel Gallan (earlier) and Taha Hashim (later)", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 19:42:00", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.991448", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/4257ae54bc4967b634b52196a60049dabceb604d/537_99_4029_2418/500.jpg", "body": "Right, I\u2019d say that\u2019s enough from me.

Can\u2019t wait for it. Just rewinding back a bit: it\u2019s worth remembering just how good Cummins was with the ball yesterday, taking 4-63 from his 18.2 overs. Gave it everything and produced one of the great deliveries, bowling Pope with a ridiculous inswinger. Well worth a rewatch. Still plenty to come from our writers on the ground, but just wanted to say a quick thanks to all the people who have messaged in today to talk about the game and everything surrounding it. It\u2019s been a privilege to be on board for it. And sorry to those whose messages I didn\u2019t get around to sharing. More words from Khawaja, who now averages 66.87 as a Test opener after 37 innings. \u201cFair play, right result,\u201d says Stephen Cottrell. \u201cI didn\u2019t agree with the declaration but it made the game on a road and gave England every chance of a win. Only gripe with stokes was keeping Root on after he\u2019d done the trick. From vaulting genius to self indulgence in the time it takes to say \u2018Be Here Now\u2019.\u201d Usman Khawaja is Player of the Match after a brilliant performance across both innings, showing everyone that he can do it in England, too. \u201cI\u2019m not going to lie, I was absolutely shitting myself for the last five minutes,\u201d he says at the post-match presentation. \u201cThis is probably my favourite Test match I\u2019ve played in so far.\u201d Oooph. Cummins, class: I get that people are going to take issue with the declaration. But, c\u2019mon, wasn\u2019t all of this just loads of fun? Isn\u2019t that all that really matters for Test cricket right now? Late on this, from an hour ago, but just want to share this from Adrian Paterson: \u201cAm following OBO from a lakeside Oslo train, while Dad has blood transfusion back in London. Both lasting 4 hours so far and due to finish in around 40 minutes. A tense simultaneity: Dad\u2019s not such a cricket fan but remembers wartime matches, so we are updating each other by text. I didn\u2019t much like the declaration (or the diagnosis) but if England pull this off (and Dad gets well) might have to tip what remains of my rational mind out of the window and agree that Stokes has power over all things.\u201d Hope all goes well with your dad, Adrian. Not the result you wanted, but what a game! \u201cWhat a game,\u201d writes Huw Swanborough. \u201cStriking to me though, and the joy of test cricket, that it feels like England had the better of the vast majority of the sessions, yet lost the game from pure doggedness from Australia.\u201d Right then, let me just catch my breath again. Australia were 227-8, 54 runs away and looking out of it. But Cummins, Australia\u2019s captain, thumped Joe Root\u2019s off spin and stayed resolute in the face of short-pitched bowling from the English. Nathan Lyon, a champion cricketer himself, held on from the other end and produced a couple of stunning shots down the ground. The Test champions of the world will go to Lord\u2019s 1-0 up. Just a stunning five days, and a staggering final hour, too. \u201cSole Aussie in a pub in London,\u201d writes Mark Doepel. \u201cFearing for my life. But loving it.\u201d Cummins\u2019 teammates are all over him. And Nathan Lyon is deservedly getting lots of love too. What a stand they put together, 55 off 12 overs. Pat Cummins is jubilant, a truly champion cricketer taking it all in. We have seen a stunning Test match here at Edgbaston. Short from Robinson to Cummins, and Pope dives brilliantly at short leg to his right to stop the Australians from stealing another run. But Cummins does the job, squirting a short ball down to third man for four! They\u2019ve done it! Incredible! \u201cWhat a time to answer the call of nature at 3:45am in Australia. Cricket eh? Flipping heck.. \" Rowan Sweeney with great timing. Cummins lets Broad hit him with the short ball. Twice. He won\u2019t budge. Cummins dabs the ball down straight and Broad gets low to halt the prospect of a single. Cummins then pushes to midwicket to steal a single. Australia need three to win. Lyon pats away a short ball from Broad, and it drops short of the man at short leg, Ollie Pope. Then Lyon pulls, and it goes past Pope. One more run. Australia need four to win. 91st over: Australia 276-8 (Lyon 15, Cummins 39) Robinson delivers a short ball to Cummins that flies down the leg side. Another short one sneaks past the bat and gloves, Cummins doing well to evade it. And then another bumper follows that Cummins gets under. And then a yorker! Cummins keeps it out, though, backing away as he tried to slap it through the off side. Robinson sends the next one down the leg side. And a dot seals it. The agony for all continues. Australia need 5 to win. Australia, I repeat, need five to win. England need two wickets. \u201cOn a plane from Heathrow to Helsinki, plane Wi-Fi patchy at best, and I\u2019m putting it under more stress than it\u2019s used to pulling down for page refreshes more frequently than overs being bowled! Keep the updates coming!\u201d I\u2019m here for you, Harry Sivarajah. 90th over: Australia 276-8 (Cummins 39, Lyon 15) A conversation ensues between Broad, Robinson and Stokes before the final ball of the 90th over. It\u2019s definitely not about tee times tomorrow. Broad runs in and Cummins clips away for one. Australia need five runs to win and go 1-0 up in the Ashes. Lyon then clips away for one more. Australia need six to win. Six. Broad runs in to Cummins and sneaks one past the outside edge! A gorgeous delivery that nibbled away off the scrambled seam \u2013 but no bat on it. Broad gets the crowd going, whipping them up, but Cummins clips away for one. Broad is still smiling, somehow, perhaps screaming internally. WHAT A SHOT FROM NATHAN LYON! He flicks Stuart Broad over mid-on for four and Australia need seven runs to win. 89th over: Australia 269-8 (Cummins 37, Lyon 10) Lyon pulls for a single. 13 required. Robinson thunders in and Cummins\u2019 forward defence is HUGE. Dot. Robinson slaps Cummins\u2019 pad but the appeal isn\u2019t convincing \u2013 that was going down the leg side. 12 required. Lyon clips to the leg side, but there\u2019s no run. A bumper follows, and nothing comes of it. Australia need 12 to win. Sums things up. 88th over: Australia 267-8 (Lyon 9, Cummins 37) Cummins pushes into the off side for one. Lyon resists, pokes at one he shouldn\u2019t but there\u2019s no edge. Broad wonders just what he must do to finish this. He\u2019s been immense all game. Edgbaston roars once more, but Lyon clips away for a single. He keeps the strike. \u201cAs a 60 year old this is the first test match I\u2019ve watched in its entirety,\u201d says Neil Clough. \u201cHave this awful feeling I\u2019ve really been missing out. Brilliant entertainment.\u201d Welcome to the party, Neil, it really is something. Australia need 14 to win. 87th over: Australia 265-8 (Cummins 36, Lyon 8) Robinson takes the new ball from the other end, not Anderson, and Cummins pushes into the off side for one. Does Robinson stick to the basics against Lyon or does he continue to go short? He strays onto the pads and Lyon clips nicely for a single. Cummins drives aerially through the covers and Crawley fumbles in trying to stop the boundary \u2013 IT\u2019S FOUR! Cummins gets one off the last ball of the over to keep the strike. Australia need 16 to win. Michael Fryer writes in: \u201cOver here in San Diego I\u2019m about to put my 2 year old down for a nap. In Lindfield, my friend Tony Cunningham is about to start the bedtime routine for his daughter. We\u2019re cursing the timing!!\u201d Let them watch! How are your nerves? 86th over: Australia 258-8 (Cummins 30, Lyon 7) Broad is the man to bowl, and Lyon hits an off-drive for four! A staggering stroke, pumped down the ground and a diving Broad couldn\u2019t save it. Paul Mincher is in trouble: \u201c8% left on my mobile from a campsite in the Dordogne. Go on, England!\u201d Australia need 23 to win. England take the second new ball. Finally. 85th over: Australia 254-8 (Lyon 3, Cummins 30) Still no new ball. But Ollie Robinson is into the attack, ready to bang them into Lyon. A bumper clips Lyon\u2019s helmet, beating Bairstow, but there\u2019s a man behind the keeper who picks up to clean the mess. Robinson drops to his haunches. The emotions are showing, even if Bazball is all about playing it kinda cool. Cummins is greeted with a yorker which he digs out, and then he dabs one into the off side for a couple. This is brilliant from the Australian captain. Australia need 27 to win. 84th over: Australia 251-8 (Cummins 28, Lyon 3) Broad has the ball, not a new one, though, and goes short to Lyon \u2013 and STOKES NEARLY PULLS OFF A STUNNER! The England captain leaps at square leg, going back with one hand, just like he did in 2019 against South Africa, but he can\u2019t hold on. What an effort. Broad thought he\u2019d pulled it off. This game, man. Then a leading edge from Cummins into the off side, and he picks up two. Cummins then swats to the boundary for four! Australia need 30 to win. Forget the draw, people, it ain\u2019t happening. 83rd over: Australia 244-8 (Lyon 2, Cummins 22) Stokes still saying no the second new nut. Root tosses it up and Cummins smashes a straight six! And then ANOTHER over mid-off! Erhmahgawd. Stokes surely has to go to Anderson and Broad now. Big over for Australia, huge over! Australia need 37 (!) to win, minimum 14 overs left. 82nd over: Australia 230-8 (Cummins 8, Lyon 2) Stokes continues, then, avoiding the second new ball. Lyon gets one away first up to bring Cummins on strike, and a quick single closes the over. Australia need 51 to win, minimum 15 overs left. 81st over: Australia 228-8 (Lyon 1, Cummins 7) What a shift this has been from Root, by the way, helping out with more than what was expected from him due to Moeen\u2019s finger problem. Australia need 53 to win, minimum 16 overs left. THIRD TIME LUCKY! England don\u2019t take the new ball, Root continues, and Carey thumps the ball straight back to the bowler who just about holds on. Edgbaston roars once again! 80th over: Australia 227-7 (Carey 20, Cummins 7) Stokes in for what could be his last over of the match, with the second new ball available after this. It\u2019s a maiden. Colum Fordham writes: \u201cWhat a fitting finale to a glorious test match, the tension palpable amongst the players, the crowd and those humble mortals following on the radio, TV and the wonderful OBO. \u201cThe captain makes the critical breakthrough of Khawaja, the former captain puts down an astonishingly difficult chance, and the prospect of Broad and Anderson with the new ball. Doesn\u2019t get much better!\u201d Australia need 54 to win, minimum 17 overs remaining. 79th over: Australia 227-7 (Cummins 7, Carey 20) Carey goes for the paddle and gets a boundary off Root. Cummins then drives the last ball of the over straight and Root drops one again! It was low, and a tough one, but we\u2019re at the finish now and every little thing matters. Australia need 54 to win, minimum 18 overs remaining. 78th over: Australia 219-7 (Carey 14, Cummins 5) Stokes, irrepressible, concedes a single off Carey and then roars in for five at Cummins. We move. Australia need 62 to win, minimum 19 overs remaining. \u201cI\u2019ve got 300 TV channels here in Kentucky and not one of them has the cricket,\u201d writes Andrew Clifton. \u201cI\u2019m following as I usually do on OBO. The grass needs cutting and I was pretending to do the ironing in the basement but I\u2019ve even given that up now. You have my undivided attention until the end.\u201d Here with you for the rest of the way, Andrew. 77th over: Australia 218-7 (Carey 13, Cummins 5) Cummins pumps Root down the ground for four \u2013 he smacked it in the first innings and he\u2019ll try do the same in the second. Australia need 63, minimum 20 overs remaining. 76th over: Australia 214-7 (Cummins 1, Carey 13) Stokes goes short to Cummins, who pulls but produces an edge\u2026 it goes high into the air but lands safely in the square-leg region. Carey, trying to up the ante, toes Stokes over mid-off for a couple. Australia trying to switch things up here. Australia need 67, minimum 21 overs remaining. 75th over: Australia 210-7 (Carey 11, Cummins 0) England go up for a leg-before review, with Bairstow adamant after Root fires one into Carey, who tries to cut from back in his crease. It does hit the pad first, but the ball is shown to be going on with the arm, missing leg stump. Carey then advances down the ground for a big shot but can\u2019t beat Stokes at mid-off. AND THEN A DROP! Carey smashes it back to Root who can\u2019t hold on \u2013 he absolutely smoked it, but still a chance. Australia need 71, minimum 22 overs remaining. 74th over: Australia 209-7 (Carey 10, Cummins 0) Stokes, clearly not at full fitness, rumbles in again, going up against his opposing number. Cummins plays out a maiden. \u201cHi Taha, Emiel here. From Holland, but residing in Doha. Big England cricket fan. Couple of nights before the start of this match, Cummins came to me in a dream. I imagined I was interviewing him for some big tv channel and asked him how he was going to deal with this Bazzball razzmatazz. \u201cYeah, we\u2019ll see, mate. We\u2019ll be playing some hard, old-fashioned test cricket, and then it\u2019s up to the Gods.\u201d Hope this was just a nightmare, but I\u2019m getting really quite anxious now!\u201d Emiel, presume you\u2019re a bit calmer now Khawaja\u2019s gone. Australia need 72, minimum 23 overs remaining. 73rd over: Australia 209-7 (Cummins 0, Carey 10) Root tosses one up, Carey throws out a drive, doesn\u2019t get a bat \u2013 then a reverse-sweep attempted, and no bat again. Suddenly, England have the control, the edge, the sense that they really are just a second away from closing this out. STOKES! He gets Khawaja, the big one. From around the wicket it\u2019s a leg-cutter, Khawaja pokes at it and drags onto his stumps. This might well be the game (famous last words). A colossal effort from Khawaja, but it\u2019ll have to be someone else who finishes the job for Australia. 72nd over: Australia 209-7 (Cummins 0, Carey 10) Australia need 72 to win. A minimum of 25 overs to go. 71st over: Australia 207-6 (Carey 8, Khawaja 65) Khawaja bunts away Root for a single, and that\u2019s the only damage from the over. \u201cLoving this!\u201d says Stephen Brown. \u201cI assume they are saving Broad for the new ball. If he and Anderson don\u2019t bowl in the next 10 overs and Aus need less than 50 at that point, the game should be England\u2019s.\u201d Australia need 74. A minimum of 26 overs to go. 70th over: Australia 206-6 (Khawaja 64, Carey 8) Right then, who\u2019s here? Benjamin Stokes is here. The England captain will bowl, he was always going to bowl, he has to bowl. The crowd love him for it, of course they do. He thunders in, smacks Carey\u2019s pads and they steal another run. Khawaja clips away and they take three off it. Australia need 75. A minimum of 27 overs to go. 69th over: Australia 203-6 (Khawaja 62, Carey 8) Root continues, having looked somewhat threatening so far. Khawaja picks up one. Australia need 78 runs to win. A minimum of 28 overs to go. 68th over: Australia 202-6 (Khawaja 61, Carey 8) Moeen returns, defying that cut-up finger. He drops short with his third ball and Carey smacks away for four. Australia have brought up 200. \u201cWeird that Broad hasn\u2019t come back?\u201d asks Finley Wilks. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be on soon. Australia need 79 runs to win. A minimum of 29 overs to go. 67th over: Australia 195-6 (Khawaja 60, Carey 2) Carey swats away Root for a couple, and then watches on as the offie gets some big turn away from the bat. Australia need 86 to win. A minimum of 30 overs to go. 66th over: Australia 193-6 (Carey 0, Khawaja 60) The Robinson v Khawaja duel continues. The quick thunders in, the left-hander resists. A maiden. Australia need 88 runs to win. A minimum of 31 overs to go. 65th over: Australia 193-6 (Khawaja 60, Carey 0) Root keeps on twirling, conceding one. Meanwhile Jordan White has just written in, beautifully: \u201cAs an Aussie reading the emails the British OBO fans are sending in, I am absolutely laughing at how pessimistic they all seem to be, when Broad is obviously about to blast through the Aussie batting line-up...this level of pessimism seems to be seen as something quintessentially British, although I learned it from my Australian grandfather, who passed away today. His love for watching his team get beaten, or watching his team winning but all the while assuming that they\u2019d lose, was a defining feature of his, somehow, and it\u2019s poetic for me that this absolute nail-biter of a Test is coming to an end today. \u201cNot sure if this is interesting for anyone else! But reading Jonathan Liew\u2019s beautiful piece on Sunday reminded me of the value in the personal.... \u201cCheers! PS: Robinson got Green the second I finished writing this!\u201d Thoughts are with you, Jordan. Hope you get to enjoy a great finish, regardless of the result. 64th over: Australia 192-6 (Khawaja 59, Carey 0) Robinson, with his tail up, finishes his over with a fine yorker that Carey digs out. Game on. GOT HIM! Robinson nips the ball in and Green drags onto his stumps. This magnificent Test match takes another turn. 63rd over: Australia 192-5 (Green 28, Khawaja 59) Root delivers an absolute beaut, ripping one past Khawaja\u2019s outside edge into the hands of Bairstow. The crowd is getting going against after a period of uneasy silence. Green, who really does give the ball a serious whack, gives it everything with a drive through the off side for one. Australia need 89 to win. 62nd over: Australia 189-5 (Green 26, Khawaja 58) Bouncer from Robinson to Khawaja, followed by a full delivery that goes down the leg side. A maiden. \u201cHi Taha,\u201d writes David J. Govantes-Edwards, \u201cthank you for keeping me informed as I attend my son\u2019s end of year school play (here in Spain they finish school so much earlier than in the UK). \u201cMy question is, as I begin to proper panic now ... Thinking about those dropped catches behind the wicket, what is the point of leaving out a world-class keeper for JB\u2019s runs if we\u2019re going to declare when there are still (presumably) plenty of runs in the bag?\u201d You\u2019re panicking too early, David. Just sit back and enjoy for now \u2013 we\u2019ll get into the nitty-gritty later. But, also, Australia need 92 to win. 61st over: Australia 189-5 (Green 26, Khawaja 58) Joe Root picks things up from the other end, and Green punches off the back foot for a couple. Khawaja hangs back to Root to dig the ball into the leg side for a single. Australia need 92 to win. 60th over: Australia 185-5 (Green 23, Khawaja 57) Robinson to Khawaja, who shows off his excellent pull shot to pick up one. Green edges, with a degree of control, to third man for another single. Australia need 96. Last session, Australia need 98, England need five wickets, I need to type even quicker. Let\u2019s. Go. Oooooh yeah, it\u2019s getting tasty: This game, man: Right, lots of people getting back to me regarding Philip Gillibrand\u2019s query (46th over). Here\u2019s a good one, pointed out by Geoff Wignall: opener Desmond Haynes was the last man out in both West Indies innings against New Zealand at Dunedin in February 1980. Ended up a one-wicket win for the Black Caps after Haynes made 55 and 105 in a low-scorer. One game finishes, another begins. The women\u2019s Ashes gets underway on Thursday with a five-day Test at Trent Bridge. Buzzing for it. Here\u2019s Megan Maurice on Australia, who will be without the great Meg Lanning. 59th over: Australia 183-5 (Khawaja 56, Green 22) Tidy from Root, who usually likes bowling from around the wicket but is going from over, trying to spin one through Green\u2019s gate. A maiden, and that\u2019s tea. England won the first half of the session, Australia claimed the second. Australia need 98 to win. 58th over: Australia 183-5 (Green 22, Khawaja 56) Robinson, wide of the crease, angles the ball in, scream scrambled, and beats the forward prod of Green. A beauty, but no joy. An attempted yorker from Robinson turns into a low full toss, but Green can only steal one off it. Fran Collins has seen enough: \u201cCan only envisage one result now, sadly. Australian victory. England need a couple of wickets quickly.\u201d It\u2019s into double-figures. Australia need 98 to win. 57th over: Australia 181-5 (Khawaja 55, Green 21) Joe Root\u2019s in and gets some pretty sharp turn into Green. Just one off it. Good point from Leandro: \u201cThe question is, when do we start panicking that Australia may win it? Is 210-5 too late to start? Should I begin straightaway?\u201d It\u2019s been a good 20 minutes or so for Australia so, yeah, I reckon you can go ahead and start sweating. Australia need 100 runs to win. 56th over: Australia 180-5 (Khawaja 54, Green 21) Anderson flies in and delivers a back-of-the-hand slower ball that Khawaja helps on its way for a single. Green then finishes the over with a thumping drive to the long-off boundary for four. Will Dean sounds a bit worried: \u201cOne can\u2019t help but wonder if Uzzy will manage a very similar feat to that of Ben Stokes at Headingly 2019\u2026. Perish the thought!\u201d Right then, I\u2019m going to start the countdown. Australia need 101 runs to win. 55th over: Australia 173-5 (Khawaja 52, Green 17) Moeen floats one up to Green who drives hard and picks up three after Anderson fails to stop the ball at cover. Khawaja receives a long-hop but can only sweep it to the man in the deep for one. 54th over: Australia 167-5 (Green 13, Khawaja 50) Green, starting to look a little more comfortable, punches Anderson nicely off the back-foot to pick up two. He grabs a single off the last ball of the over, too. 53rd over: Australia 164-5 (Green 10, Khawaja 50) Moeen is being allowed here to do what he said he couldn\u2019t: hold up an end. Just one run off it. 52nd over: Australia 163-5 (Green 9, Khawaja 50) Khawaja picks up a couple to bring up a half-century, following up on his first-innings ton. What a Test match he\u2019s had after two difficult tours of England in 2013 and 2019. Here\u2019s a suggestion from Robin Hazlehurst: \u201cSo if Uzzy Khawaja is playing the diametric opposite of Bazball with his defensive slow scoring, shouldn\u2019t it also have a fun name? How about Uzball?\u201d I think he\u2019s just playing, like, normal Test cricket, right? 51st over: Australia 161-5 (Khawaja 48, Green 9) Two off Moeen\u2019s over. Stat bomb: My OBO colleague Tim de Lisle points out that Stuart Broad has the best strike rate in the match, beating Nathan Lyon. It\u2019s been a terrific effort from the quick who I, prior to the game, didn\u2019t have in my England XI (I went for Wood). He\u2019s still proving people wrong. 50th over: Australia 159-5 (Green 7, Khawaja 48) Green drives well through the covers to pick up two from Anderson. Brendon McCullum has his feet up by the dressing room and, as ever, looks very relaxed. 49th over: Australia 156-5 (Green 4, Khawaja 48) Full toss from Moeen and Khawaja can breathe easy \u2013 he sweeps away for four. The left-hander picks up two more off the next ball. Nearly a howler from the batter, trying to flick Moeen away only to pop up a leading edge \u2013 but the ball doesn\u2019t carry to mid-on. Then he tries to rock back and cut but misses completely. 48th over: Australia 150-5 (Khawaja 42, Green 4) Khawaja clips Anderson away for one after seeing off two dots. Green continues to resist. 47th over: Australia 149-5 (Khawaja 41, Green 4) Moeen continues, and Green shows off his forward defence. You still feel that Australia still need to go after Moeen despite that wicket \u2013 they haven\u2019t had any success against the quicks today, and they really need a bit of a push now, just a few boundaries to get this chase properly going. Just one off the over. \u201cTaha it\u2019s pretty obvious what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d says Kim Thonger. \u201cAustralia collapse to 199 for 9 after tea, and then Lyon and Hazlewood successfully block everything for two hours until the close. Result, a draw. I\u2019ll stake your reputation on it.\u201d 46th over: Australia 144-5 (Khawaja 40, Green 4) The lean, mean (he actually seems to be a lovely young man) Cameron Green is out there with Khawaja now. Anderson returns to test out the big all-rounder\u2019s defence, and gets a couple to sneak past the bat. And then an outside-edge! But it stays low and runs away for four. Philip Gillibrand asks: \u201cThe tweet from Alison Mitchell [see below] about how long Khawaja has been out on the field begs the question whether any cricketer has been out on the field for the whole of a test match i.e. has any opening batsman ever carried his bat in both innings and fielded for two complete opposition innings?\u201d \u201cIf so, he would have earned his match fee!\u201d Anyone got an answer? I\u2019m rather occupied. 45th over: Australia 143-5 (Khawaja 39, Green 0) Moeen Ali is just a box-office cricketer, isn\u2019t he? Those first three balls were no good, really, and then he just gets it right outta nowhere. Right then, this is very interesting. Moeen has the ball, and he\u2019s going to test out that finger. A poor first ball from the offie, short and smacked away by Head for four. Head then cuts away for a couple. The batter then gets a thickish edge that runs away for another four, despite Broad\u2019s best efforts to stop it at third man. Moeen finally gets one right, tossed up outside off that Head edges away. AND THEN THE WICKET! Moeen tosses it up, gets sharp turn and Head hangs back, and gets an edge that goes to Root at slip. Oh Moeen, that is magical, that\u2019s why you\u2019re here \u2013 what a story! 44th over: Australia 133-4 (Head 6, Khawaja 39) Broad continues after the break and goes short (shock) to Head, who swings hard and gets something on it to pick up four. Another bumper follows and Head ducks. The batter then cuts hard, but straight to Robinson at cover. A yorker follows \u2013 Broad showing off all the tricks, trying everything, and Head is still struggling to find the meat of the bat. A pull shot then goes straight to the fielder, but he does clip one off the hips for one to finish the over. \u201cWelcome to the fun Taha,\u201d writes John Sims. \u201cI\u2019ve been following England tests this way since before my twins (now 19) were born here in New Jersey, and their early nurdling sounds were reminiscent of the great I Ron Bell\u2019s batting. England\u2019s approach has been a revelation - my first test was at Edgbaston in the early 70\u2019s when I walked there with my father and great uncle. The early declaration makes it great entertainment and a real thinker\u2019s conundrum: would I do that? So much better than the terror of failing we\u2019ve had for decades. \u201cBen - I have a meeting with the COO in 45 minutes. Please whittle them out by then.\u201d Might have to keep the notifications on. 43rd over: Australia 128-4 (Head 1, Khawaja 39) Robinson isn\u2019t giving anything away. Maiden. Drinks, and England will be pleased with what they\u2019ve pulled off so far. A wicket and no real aggression from Australia. Or is that more frustrating? Surely they want them to play a few shots to invite something silly. Maybe that\u2019ll come soon. Surely we\u2019re not on for a draw, right? Ah man, my mind\u2019s scrambled. 42nd over: Australia 128-4 (Khawaja 39, Head 1) Head finally gets off strike, pulling away to fine leg for one. Khawaja drives nicely but hits it straight to one of the fielders at cover. Broad oversteps, but Australia don\u2019t seem to be going anywhere at the moment. The bowler, 163 Tests in, remains relentless \u2013 heart to go with skill \u2013 and he finishes with a yorker that Khawaja toe-edges for one. Oooph, he\u2019s got away with that one. This is thrilling. 41st over: Australia 125-4 (Head 0, Khawaja 38) Khawaja is playing a game of patience, waiting on the bad balls. Unfortunately for him, the bad balls don\u2019t seem to be coming. He\u2019s added four so far to his overnight total. Afternoon to Simon McMahon: \u201cI think the only thing worse than following the nail biting climax of an Ashes Test at work is not following the nail biting climax of an Ashes Test at work. Been torture waiting on play to start. Now that it has, let\u2019s hope we get a result. Though who will be celebrating is anybody\u2019s guess I reckon. A tied Test, maybe..?\u201d Interested to know how many people have opted to WFH today\u2026 40th over: Australia 123-4 (Khawaja 38, Head 0) Broad is bowling a lovely spell, pushing the ball away from Khawaja from over the wicket. The left-hander isn\u2019t falling for it, refusing to poke and prod for the outside edge. A leg-bye for one gets Khawaja off strike, and Broad thunders in a short ball to Head. He\u2019s still on 0 after 11 balls. 39th over: Australia 122-4 (Khawaja 38, Head 0) Robinson is in for his first bowl of the day, and Khawaja clips him away for one. The right-armer gets a bit of shape away from Head, who is still searching for one off the middle of the bat. 38th over: Australia 121-4 (Khawaja 37, Head 0) Travis Head, the aggressor, is in. He will surely play his shots and with the nightwatcher gone, we\u2019re into a proper battle now. Edgbaston is beginning to roar a bit louder, and Broad has the momentum. Back of a length first up, and Head gets behind it. Broad continues to bang \u2018em in, and the left-hander resists until he tries to pull the last ball of the over. Nothing comes of it. \u201cTo satisfy narrative tension, England should wait until the new ball is due to wipe off the final three wickets,\u201d says John Starbuck. How\u2019s your ticker? Broad into Boland, and that means more bumper action. Boland gets out of the way of the first one pretty easily. But then the fuller one and HE\u2019S GONE! Swings in, full, and Boland nicks off to give Bairstow the catch. Six more to go for England. 37th over: Australia 121-3 (Boland 20, Khawaja 37) More runs for Australia as Boland picks up four leg-byes off Anderson. A shout for catch as Bairstow holds on down the leg side, but the ball came off Boland\u2019s pad, not bat. Wide from Anderson and Boland cuts hard for one. Also, this is magnificent: 36th over: Australia 116-3 (Boland 19, Khawaja 37) Sharp bumper from Broad to Boland, who does well to duck out of the way. Another short ball follows \u2013 but Boland does well to ride and guide it behind square on the leg side for one. Khawaja\u2019s on strike but Broad sticks to the same plan \u2013 he sends another bouncer in, whistling past the opener\u2019s helmet. A clip to fine leg for one follows. Fuller from Broad to Boland, who has a little poke outside off, but gets nothing on it. The right-hander is resolute, though, and picks a ball off his pads for one. 35th over: Australia 113-3 (Boland 17, Khawaja 36) Anderson to Khawaja again, and it\u2019s quiet. Six dots, and that makes it just one run from the last three overs. Pressure building. 34th over: Australia 113-3 (Khawaja 36, Boland 17) One keeping a bit low from Broad, but Boland gets behind it. One then tails back into the right-hander, who brings out a leave (remember those?). Boland then cuts hard, but Ollie Pope stops it at gully. 33rd over: Australia 113-3 (Boland 17, Khawaja 36) Oops. Misfield from Ollie Robinson at midwicket helps Boland get off strike. Anderson gets some pretty-lookin\u2019 outswing going against Khawaja. And then a play and miss outside off from the batter, which fires up Edgbaston. \u201cG\u2019day Taha.\u201d G\u2019day Jack Faine. \u201cThis test and its fifth day provides such fertile terrain for the unfolding of so many different narratives - it\u2019s hard to know where to look! For me, I\u2019ll be looking to Usman Khawaja and Moeen Ali, both with such great stories of careers resurrected, who both hold an opportunity today to win the match for their respective countries. Here\u2019s hoping for an even contest to keep us all entranced to the end.\u201d Beautifully put. I\u2019ve absolutely loved the Khawaja story over the last 18 months and, well, Mo, how can you not love Mo. Hope that finger\u2019s OK. 32nd over: Australia 112-3 (Boland 16, Khawaja 36) Broad to the nightwatcher Boland, who manages to pick up three with an edge down to third man. Bit of swing away from Khawaja for the quick. The opener \u2013 whose bat looks well massive at the moment \u2013 sees off the rest. 31st over: Australia 109-3 (Boland 13, Khawaja 36) Anderson v Khawaja to kick things off. The left-hander blocks one, leaves another, blocks again and then inside-edges for a couple. Two more dots to finish. It\u2019s already very tense. Australia need 174 more runs. England need seven wickets. Let\u2019s gooooooooo Chris Drew writes in: \u201cBefore we get too far into \u2018drop Brook/bring in Foakes/YJB to open\u2019, there is another aspect that has to be considered And it has a direct implication. Bowling. \u201cWe don\u2019t know fully yet how Ben\u2019s knee holds up. How much will he be able to bowl? That impacts on who you bring in as a bowler (Mark Wood?). Do we need another bowler, and Stokes only plays as a batter? \u201cThese Ashes are as much about \u2018the Battle of Ben\u2019s Knee\u2019 as anything, as it affects the whole balance of the team.\u201d Dropping Brook? Who suggested that \u2013 what is happening to the discourse?!?! Anyway, let\u2019s not get too far ahead \u2013 as Bazball tells us, just look at what\u2019s in front of you. And we\u2019ve got a thriller on here \u2013 let\u2019s get going! Kim Thonger is looking on the bright side: \u201cThis seems an opportune moment to point out that I don\u2019t think anyone has thrown into the OBE this test, the Boycottian clich\u00e9, \u2018add two wickets to the score\u2019 to get a truer understanding of the direction the game might take. \u201cI\u2019m therefore throwing it in now.\u201d Jimmy A has his say: Thanks Dan! Oh boy, this is exciting/nervy/joyous/brilliant/very exciting/too exciting/ermahgawd. How do we see this going? You can\u2019t help but think about Edgbaston \u201905. That was the thing that got me into this silly sport, and I really hope today does the same for some other eight-year-old watching. I\u2019ll be here all the way till the close - keep me company and let me know how you\u2019re watching/listening/reading/feeling. Alrighty folks. Not long to go but my day is done. Sincerely, that was one of my best shifts at the OBO wheel. You\u2019ve all been brilliant! Loved the chat about mental health and how Bazball has served as a balm. The Foakes/Bairstow debate will continue to twist and turn and of course the nickname banter had me giggling. I hope you enjoy the cricket and keep the chat alive as the excellent Taha takes over. You\u2019re in safe hands. Til next time\u2026 InzaDan-ul-Haq. You know, this is a really good idea\u2026 \u201cHi Dan, Thanks for the fantastic coverage. It\u2019s been a wonderful Test and what odds on an England victory by two runs?\u201d It\u2019s been fun, Tom Keil. Hope you enjoy the actual cricket in a bit. \u201cIt\u2019s also been a Test that\u2019s largely proved Bazball will hold up against the Aussies. The one area of the team that needs to be scrutinised, is Bairstow keeping wicket. Bazball is fundamentally about creating heavy momentum from the outset. The batsman all bat like they are on 150, but from ball one. And England set fields like they are 500 ahead, regardless of the actual score. It\u2019s partly worked so well because it rips up the traditional cricket notion that pressure has to be built over long periods of time. Bazball yanks the momentum to England from the opening ball of each day, and it\u2019s hard for opposition teams to cope with it. \u201cBut nothing kills momentum faster than dropped catches and missed stumpings. Foakes barely ever makes a mistake and so the pressure is never released by him. Bairstow has missed too many opportunities in this Test, and every time he does the Aussies grow a little bit taller. For me, if Bairstow plays it has to be as a pure batsman, and the choice is between him and Brook at 5.\u201d England favourites? Wet outfield. This is a good spot from one of the keener observers in the game. How will a wet outfield impact the bowlers? Will it make batting easier? I guess the scorecard will tell us all. They\u2019ll try to get 67 overs in \u2013 52 plus the last hour to squeeze in 15 if needed. Tea is now at 4:30pm BST/ 1:30am AEST and they can go until 7pm BST/4am AEST. \u201cGreat point on how the dressing room reacts to the first person getting dropped,\u201d says Philip Ward. \u201cFeels a bit like that movie The Beach. Right now, we\u2019re in the bit before Leo gets kicked out. Sounds like utopia until it isn\u2019t. Derek Sutherland writes in from a gorgeous part of the world: \u201cHi Dan, loving the OBO (as ever), and enjoying tracking the test match vicariously. Really frustrating to see you\u2019ve lost a session today (it\u2019s sweltering here in the Peloponnese, you could have had some of our sunshine if you had asked nicely). \u201cMy question - it\u2019s a beautifully balanced test (or at least it was with a full day\u2019s play available), but any guess how this might have played out if the Aussies had won the coin toss? \u201cWinning the toss can be close to decisive at times in England - would Australia have batted for two full days and racked up 600 before declaring at tea on day 2?\u201d Cummins said he would have batted first and we know that they wouldn\u2019t have been as aggressive, nor would they have declared with a set batter not-out overnight and on a ton. Peter Hicks calls me out! \u201cHi Daniel. With great respect this is a stupid thing to say: We\u2019re getting some cricket! Plenty of time to get a result. Go make yourself some food. Get comfy. Tell your family to leave you alone. Not long now. Instead, tell your family to gather round the tellybox and watch something that could very well be spectacular and memorable. Involve them, encourage them to enjoy cricket. Welcome new members to the cricketing family.\u201d Right you are Peter! Let me unequivocally retract my previous comment (will even amend as it\u2019s a key event). Thanks for keeping me honest. Every now and then I get a letter that needs no editing and should be posted in full. First it was Simon in Cornwall who opened up about his own struggles with mental health and how Bazball has helped him through a tough time. Now it\u2019s Barry Eyre who has sent in this lovely ode to the game, to fathers and to rain: \u201cAs I sit in our holiday cottage in Northumberland with my six month old rwin grandkids, waiting for the rain to subside and surreptitiously checking news from Edgbaston, I read Jonny Liews piece as recommended by your good self. I must admit to quickly wiping away a tear, thinking of my own dad and my introduction to the beautiful game. (Or both beautiful games). They say it takes a village, and for me it was a village cricket team. In the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s my dad and his friends were the heart and soul of our village cricket team. Saturdays and Sundays, from the age of I cant remember when, me, and a bunch of other offspring, would go with our dads to cricket played in glamorous arenas like Sileby, Mountsorrel, Heather, Ibstock, Cropston. We learnt by watching. Wandering around the boundary. Picking up an old ball and having a knockabout on the outfield. Looking for the match ball in the hedge when someone despatched the opponents fast bowler to cow corner. Did the sun always shine? My memory tells me it did\u2026 School holidays were spent glued to the BBC and Jim Laker\u2019s sparse commentary , or the lyrical John Arlott on Test Match Special. Or better still, TV pictures with radio commentary. In the red hot summer of 76 I spent most days watering the square to my dads instructions as he worked in one of the local factories. So Jonny is right; it\u2019s not just about Bazball. It\u2019s about all those subtleties, those shared experiences, those little moments from my past that keep me checking the score when no-one else is looking. Cricketing dads. About 10 years before he died, I took my dad to an Ashes test at Trent Bridge. We watched David Gower complete an elegant century and, in an unspoken way, I felt I\u2019d payed back all that cricket education and special moments we shared on the cricket fields of North Leicestershire. Althougjh I don\u2019t know what he would have made of Bazball,.. And it\u2019s still raining here.\u201d Hat tip to you Baz. To Starc or not to Starc? \u201cHi Daniel \u201cEight-Pints-to-the\u201d Gallan (sic),\u201d \u201cAny thoughts on the Aussie\u2019s decision to leave out Starc for this one? None of the Aussie seamers have bowled badly. Yet, Starc is a particularly good white ball bowler - so may be well positioned to deal with the whole Bazball approach. He also, unequivocally, shortens the tail.\u201d Hindsight is a wonderful thing, Gavin Byrne, and yes, it seems like the Aussies could have used a bowler like Starc. Someone who doesn\u2019t rely on the pitch as much and can bowl at pace. However, I initially thought that they\u2019d made the right call. I thought that Starc\u2019s natural length would be more hittable than Boland\u2019s. I didn\u2019t factor in the reverse scoop from Root though. We\u2019re getting some cricket! Plenty of time to get a result. Go make yourself some food. Get comfy. Gather your loves ones. Not long now. \u201cHi Fourth Dan,\u201d Ah yes, I forgot about this one, Kevin Foster. \u201cI see the current Cricinfo headline for their commentary is \u201cLive - Rain de-instensifies but no play before lunch\u201d. Is \u201cde-intensify\u201d a specific cricketing term? I\u2019m new to the game.\u201d No, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a cricket term. Then again Bazball wasn\u2019t a thing not long ago. I\u2019ve got over 100 emails to get through. You\u2019ve all been brilliant. Thank you for making this a lot easier. I obviously can\u2019t get to them all but will reply individually if they\u2019re not posted here. Here\u2019s a Dan Gallan XI by Mac Millings: Danil Gallanskar Ranjan Madangallan Gallan Border Jason \u201cDan\u201d Gallian MS Dhani Chris Jor-dan Gallan Javagallan Srinath Gubby Gallen Jimmy Danderson Curtly Danbrose Muttiah Muralithagallan Head Coach: Brendon McGallan \u201cHi DannyGally, Many thanks for keeping us entertained on OBO!\u201d It\u2019s been a pleasure, Mike Friend. Just hoping I get to see some actual cricket before my shift ends at 2. \u201cQuick question regarding start time. We have light meters to determine quality of light. But is anything other than the palm of a hand used to determine the wetness / dryness of the outfield? I ask because if it\u2019s too damp in even one small area of the playing surface, the risk to England is that the ball will soak up the damp and stop swinging. On the other hand, the longer the start time is pushed back, the advantage swings to Australia since a dry pitch and overhead conditions will lessen how much the ball swings.\u201d What a great question. I honestly don\u2019t know. Maybe the umpires have a sponge they use? Massive first hour after the restart once we do get going. Inspection in 15 minutes. Lunch is officially over in less than that. Going to grab a bite now (trying the intermittent fasting thing so, as you can imagine, I\u2019m pretty hungry!) Alex Greggery in Melbourne has a very challenging question that speaks to Simon\u2019s earlier entry on mental health. What do you all reckon? \u201cDear Daniel Anvil-Smiting Gallan [nice], At the risk of injuring my brain, I have a few thoughts... \u201cI love Recent English Test Cricket, for reasons beautifully articulated earlier by Simon in Cornwall. I\u2019m most curious about what happens when an underperforming player has to be dropped. Can the long-leash, results-don\u2019t-matter attitude be maintained in the dressing room? \u201cI wonder how Foakes feels about his situation - can he buy into Bazball at this stage? I\u2019ve been fascinated by the injustice of his England career for years now. The discussion feels a bit moot though, as there\u2019s no way Bairstow will lose the gloves so quickly.\u201d Yes. Eventually a player will need to be dropped. I suppose Foakes already has been dropped. Not exactly \u201cvibes and man-feelings\u201d, as Barney would say. Really intersting point on how this chimes with the new energy. Easier to promote solid mental health in sport when you\u2019re winning I suppose. Thank you also to Mesnil Man, Robin Armstrong and Kit Lewis who also shared the TMS link. You OBOers are just the best :) Thank you, Shreedutta Chidananda. Here\u2019s the TMS link for those in need: Mark Gillespie makes a couple of really solid points, presented here in full: \u201cTo question the level of the opposition in those games kind of misses the main benefit, I think. While there are tactical innovations that have directly helped win some games, especially in Pakistan, the main benefit seems to be that England now have a clear purpose and a lack of fear that allows them to play at or near their full potential far more of the time. What mustn\u2019t be lost is that at the point McCullum and Stokes took over, England had 1 win in 17 tests. So it\u2019s not that another team playing conventional cricket wouldn\u2019t have won some/most of those subsequent tests, it\u2019s that this England team wouldn\u2019t.\u201d \u201cOn the keeper situation, to me Foakes was the man in possession and had done well, and the facts that his keeping is better than Bairstow\u2019s, plus Bairstow\u2019s batting goes down a level, means that dropping him for Bairstow was never the right choice. The options were to drop Pope, who has been OK without being amazing under Stokes, or Crawley if they felt Pope was capable of opening.\u201d On your second point, I think Pope being vice-captain plays a role. And they don\u2019t want him opening. No. 3 was a difficult position for a long time and Root doesn\u2019t want to bat there. As one reader said earlier, it perhaps should have been Bairstow or Brook if Foakes is to play. Or they stick with this team and hope YJB can come good with the gloves. So a slightly longer wait than was first hoped. Help OBOers! Does anyone have a link to the overseas TMS link? You\u2019d be doing me (and many others) a solid. Don\u2019t go away folks. We\u2019re almost there: \u201cDear Daniel, Loving the OBO - as always. Can I use this rain delay to ask for OBO insights on another matter. We\u2019ve had the all-rounder and the wicketkeeper in todays thread, so let\u2019s focus on bowler(s).\u201d Sure thing, Jaap van Netten, let\u2019s stir another pot while we\u2019re at it. \u201cStuart Broad was widely hailed yesterday as THE Ashes bowler. But - me being relatively new to cricket and not scarred by past Ashes - I checked his numbers yesterday. His bowling in Australia is uninfluential, and probably best labeled as average. \u201cWhy does an Aussie batsmen who only performs down under gets to deal with all the criticism, while an English bowler who only performs in England is the best Ashes bowler ever? \u201cThere must be bowlers who\u2019ve performed in both countries. Are there? So I suggest that any notion of \u201cthe great Broad\u201d is always followed by \u201cOBO\u201d: On British soil Only.\u201d Ah, now Broad and his old mate, Jimmy Anderson, are regularly criticised for their (apparent) lack of bite overseas. It\u2019s definitely not an Aussie only issue. \u201cHi Dan, This could be a nail biting last day.\u201d I\u2019m buzzing, Joe Varley. \u201dIn three weeks, 22 non-cricketers will be participating in a 20-20 match at the famous Ilkley CC ground in Yorkshire. 2pm start. What\u2019s the best time to start drinking? Noon too early? Just prior to the umpires taking the field? Advice, please?\u201d Now we\u2019re venturing into my area of expertise. It sounds counter productive but I find an early pint helps in the long run. As long as you maintain discipline and drink a lot of water before your second. Is that a bunch of nonsense I\u2019ve told myself so I can drink beer at 11am? Possibly. But I\u2019ve always kept my stamina over a full day\u2019s cricket. Good luck out there! Get well soon Ed King! \u201cHi Daniel! hope you\u2019re enjoying rain-o-vision. Thanks for keeping OBO engaging enough to ruin my productivity for the day. Wondered if I could request a shout out to teammate Ed King of the Brixton Barbarians, who like Edgbaston yesterday is spending a fair amount of time worrying about ball condition - after a saturday fielding mishap which has unfortunately left him needing surgery (not sure if lefty or righty, but middle stump also suffering from what I\u2019ve heard). Sure a mention from the esteemed Graun will do wonders for his spirits.\u201d I\u2019ve been there. Drifted too close standing at short extra cover a few years back and broke the ring finger on my right hand. Dropped the catch as well and missed seven weeks. Grim. Because I\u2019m self indulgent, and because you\u2019ve all sent so many, here are a few nicknames that have tickled me: Sarah O\u2019Regan \u2013 Dazzlebazzle John Starbuck \u2013 Dannikins Colum Fordham \u2013 Dan de Lyon Sandy Radford \u2013 Danchester United/City (delete as appropriate) Ed Smyth \u2013 Hold Me Closer Tiny Danzo Tom Morgan \u2013 OBO Dan Kenobi John McCaughey \u2013 Dannington Damian Johnson \u2013 Danislav You\u2019re an odd bunch. Let\u2019s not get too excited just yet. Still a way to go but some positive signs. Reminder that play won\u2019t start any earlier than 1.10pm BST / 10.10pm AEST. Phil Crockford has called me out: \u201cHang on, This idea that \u2018bazball\u2019 hasn\u2019t been tested yet is a little bit revisionist. \u201cNew Zealand were the defending World Test Champions. India were the beaten finalists. I think that South Africa started that series as the number 1 ranked team in the world. How many England teams have won a test series 3-0 in Pakistan? \u201cI really don\u2019t think anyone was expecting before the start of the McCullum/Stokes revolution that England would win 11 tests out of the next 13 tests. Especially considering their previous form - 2 test wins out of 14, or something like that, and coming from a series which they lost in the West Indies. \u201cEngland may win or lose this game - and win or lose the series. But they have played outstanding cricket against some very good teams for over a year now.\u201d The Pakistan series was as good as anything I\u2019ve seen and cemented the ideology. South Africa were terrible with the bat (not one batter came into the series with an average in the 40s) and the Kiwis were a shadow of the side that won the Mace. Taking nothing away from Baz and Ben but this is the real test of their new approach. So far, it\u2019s working. I have them winning this Test on points. \u201cHi Dan, Loving the OBO as usual\u201d Cheers, David Nicholls, it\u2019s been an intersting day despite the lack of cricket. \u201cOn the subject of nicknames, I\u2019ve recently joined the village cricket team. My third appearance, about to start a spell of filthy off breaks, the call all village cricketers will know came from the sideline: \u201cbowlers name..?\u201d \u201cNichols\u201d reply my team \u201cKnickers???\u201d replies the scorer. Me, turning to the umpire, resigned to my fate: \u201cthat\u2019s going to bleeping stick...\u201d Separately, do you have any indication that the Bairstow/Foukes keeper/Stokes/Root opening debate is happening within the actual team? I get the feeling it\u2019s a bit like when commentators start debating when a declaration will come, about 3 sessions before a team has even considered the possibility (BazBall notwithstanding)? Are we confecting it or is it an actual possibility? It\u2019s a great question Knickers. I think this team is settled internally. If Bairstow drops a couple of clangers today and England lose then perhaps we might see a shift next game. But barring that I can see Bairstow keeping the gloves until it really costs his team a win. Root won\u2019t open. He\u2019s the world\u2019s best batter and settled at four. And I also can\u2019t see Stokes opening. But hey, who knows? Whisper it quietly\u2026 Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s Test? Just don\u2019t look inside the box, Kelvin MacDonald Fraser. \u201cHi Dan, The Family Solicitor here. I\u2019m lucky enough to work from home, but I\u2019m having severe trouble concentrating on my briefs today, as the anticipation continues to build through this morning\u2019s rain delay. It\u2019s just so difficult to decide who\u2019s in the driving seat \u2013 and, in fact, I\u2019ve now come to the rather baffling conclusion that both sides are slight favourites, and marginal underdogs, at the same time! \u201cIt\u2019s as if the combination of convention busting Bazball, top class opposition and the glorious collective consciousness of The Ashes, has produced the ultimate cricketing paradox \u2013 a match so finely poised that it currently exists in a \u2018superposition\u2019 of all possible states. This, my friend, is \u2018Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s Test\u2019!\u201d Bazball continues to convert: \u201cHi Dod, despite being Kieran I was \u2018christened\u2019 Trev sometime ago. Watching my first long-form cricket this Ashes and have been gripped, it may take a ridiculous amount of time but it\u2019s hardly the slow sport I thought I knew it to be. I\u2019ll be following the whole test series.\u201d Love this, thank you Kieran \u2018Trev\u2019 Robinson. Like Andy Bull said at the start of the series, this Ashes could save the format: Cricket versus logic? Only one winner. I\u2019d love to say that they\u2019d play on but knowing the laws of cricket (and I don\u2019t) my guess is that once the final cut-off point is reached it\u2019s game over. No more timeless Tests. Anyone with a better understanding care to help? \u201cAfternoon sir,\u201d Now that is an odd nickname, Nat Guillou. \u201cI suspect the attached link of Lord Botham\u2019s deranged cbbc appearance from 1986 may well be familiar to the obo fraternity, but I saw it for the first time yesterday and thought it worth a share as we await the rain\u2019s passing. A truly, er, remarkable performance. The past is another country...\u201d More than happy to share this remarkable clip. For those who haven\u2019t already seen it (of for those who have): Did you all catch Jonny Liew\u2019s moving piece about rain and cricket and dads? No? Please stop scrolling through the blog and read this. It\u2019s incredible, as you\u2019d expect. I wonder how many sons and fathers are now huddled at Edgbaston wondering what to say to each other. \u201cHi Danosauresrex - greetings from an Aussie in Nairobi.\u201d G\u2019day to you, the aptly named Andy Raine. \u201cIn Kenya, Kilumi dance rituals are used to \u201cpray for rain\u201d. The sacred dance can mean life or death, depending on the outcome of the performance. I think I saw some British expats doing it this morning in the forest. It looked weird and inappropriate.\u201d Quite. As I said before, it\u2019s a very silly game. Family feud on the OBO? \u201cDear Dan The Lion\u201d Not the best, Stephen Lock, but I\u2019ll take it. \u201cMy little brother Andrew got a mention in OBO in around 2005. It\u2019s one of the proudest moments of his life. And he\u2019s got four kids. We remark on it from time to time and I think that he thinks that makes him a better person than me. Does it?\u201d It certainly does, Steve, but no longer! Now you too can have bragging rights. Be sure to bring this up at the next family event. Speaking of, well, piss. I once interviewed the South African fast bowler Makhaya Ntini about his superstitions. He\u2019s from the rural Eastern Cape and grew up as a barefooted cattle herder. He\u2019d keep dried cow dung in his kit bag throughout his professional career. He\u2019d even kiss it for luck! But the kicker was this: \u201cNot many people know this, but if I struggled during a session, I would sometimes go and pee on my hands and splash it on my face. It would revitalise me and get me going for the next spell\u201d Rowan Sweeney from Australia is wondering if Bazball has truly been tested yet? \u201cI\u2019m wanting to pick up the thread about Bazball, specifically something I feel the media hasn\u2019t really prosecuted too vigorously. Bazball is exciting, yes, and England are winning tests and series, but the strength of opposition in the last 12 months hasn\u2019t been amazing. I guess I\u2019m asking, inspiring method aside, have they beaten anyone with Bazball they\u2019d realistically not have been able to beat playing conventional cricket? Let\u2019s go Australia!\u201d Let\u2019s unpack them in reverse order: Ireland were poor so that doesn\u2019t count. So too a New Zealand side though they did draw their series away. The 3-0 win in Pakistan was perhaps the most impressive and wouldn\u2019t have happened without the uber aggressive batting on dead tracks. South Africa couldn\u2019t bat to save themselves but England still lost one match by an innings. If the Proteas bowlers had Smith or Khawaja or Head or Marnus I think they would have won (but perhaps I\u2019m biased.) The one-off Indian Test win to square the covid-delayed series doesn\u2019t count as an example of Bazball coming good. New Zealand in England at the start of Bazball were like deers in the headlights. It was as if they couldn\u2019t believe their old skipper was leading a revolution somewhere else. So, yes? Bazball hasn\u2019t quite been tested? But look, their batting in this game has been extraordinary and Stokes deserves immense praise for the way he\u2019s captained. Root\u2019s scoops or Cummins\u2019 corker? Why not both, says Lee Henderson from a chilly NSO in NSW Far North Coast, who\u2019s also leaning into the nickname debate. \u201cIf you were on a building site, the likes of which I work on daily I reckon you\u2019d end up being called Dangle; Oi Dangle more mud(brickies mortar) you(English person or words to that effect...). Dangle! Hurry it up. Hey Dangle get us a pie coke willya.\u201d But enough about me. What\u2019s the weirdest nickname you\u2019ve got? Bonus points if it\u2019s cricket related. Ashes newbie Alexander Radford writes in: \u201cWotcher Dandemonium, thanks for your sterling work\u201d Now that is a nickname! \u201cThis is my first time engaging with The Ashes (and cricket in any form to be honest), following a spur of the moment decision to listen on my drive home on Friday, and it turns out I\u2019m really enjoying it. I am consistently baffled by\u2026 well, everything, but have some patient and knowledgeable friends who like explaining things to set me right. They inform me that it\u2019s not usually this exciting! Should I quit while I\u2019m ahead, or is it still worth watching the next Test?\u201d No, definitely don\u2019t quit. I genuinely believe that this series will be as good as any we\u2019ve had. And if the doomsayers are true, we might never get an epic contest like this again (don\u2019t worry, we will, but some jeopardy helps with the narrative). Welcome to this strange game, Alex. You don\u2019t have to be nuts to enjoy it, but it helps. More than just an urn at stake? That\u2019s what Jonny Liew reckons. And, as always, he\u2019s spot on. 2005 anyone? As Dan Green points out, things are getting a little eerie: \u201cAs a fellow Dan G I quite like Dang! as an American exclamatory nickname. Other than that, noting the Edgbaston 2005 fall of wickets vs today\u2019s nail biter: 2005: 47, 48, 82, 107, 134, 136, 137, 175, 220, 279 2023: 61, 78, 89 Here\u2019s the scorecard from that epic. Stop the count. We have a nickname winner: \u201cHello Danza-da-manza, Riley here in British Columbia, Canada. I work as a bartender so I usually finish work late enough to justify staying up until 3am so I can watch the first hour or so of the test before going to sleep. Then I tend to wake up around noon and watch an extended highlights video before heading off to work. But tonight my late night (early morning?) plans have been rained out so to speak. I can\u2019t imagine I\u2019ll be up for first ball. But I wanted to offer you the nifty nickname of Danza-da-manza in honour of the glorious Bazball.\u201d Love that. Thanks Riley. Hope you manage to catch some of the action live. On the count of three\u2026 What happened to all the yorkers? \u201cFor me, the ball of the match so far was the absolute jaffa sent down by Pat Cummins to dismiss Ollie Pope yesterday and it got me thinking.\u201d It was a cracker, that\u2019s for sure Benjamin Hendy. What\u2019s on your mind\u2026 \u201cClearly pulling off a ball like that is a bloody difficult thing to do, but the yorker seems to be attempted much more rarely than it used to be. Obviously it was never happening every other ball or anything, and also I should acknowledge that I rarely get to watch teams outside of England and their opponents (world cups and some domestic cricket aside), but that ball from Cummins was unplayable and it seems like they\u2019re almost never attempted anymore. Is there anything to this? Or am I just not paying enough attention?\u201d It\u2019s such a difficult ball to bowl as the margin for error is so small. Too full and it\u2019s a full-toss. Too short and it\u2019s a half volley. That\u2019s OK in white ball cricket as you\u2019ve got boundary riders but with traditional Test fields you\u2019re going to go for some tap. However, with the way the English are batting don\u2019t be surprised if we see more yorkers, knuckle balls and slower ball bouncers tossed down by the Aussies as the series goes on. In case you missed this peach from Pat, here it is: Are tickets to the cricket too expensive? It\u2019s a question worth asking, especially as the sport is so often accused of being elitist. The excellent Phil Walker dives into this important debate: Don\u2019t worry mate. I think both teams will want to win this when they get out there \u2018Bazball\u2019? Shazbat! \u201cGood evening Daniel.\u201d Hi Neil Cowan from Down Under. All good your side I hope. \u201cMr Grumpy from Wallan (that\u2019s in Victoria, don\u2019t yer know) would like to advise that if he never ever encounters the term \u2018Bazball\u2019 again, it will be much, much too soon. Do we really need to dumb this game down to that level? He asks.\u201d Think of it as marketing guff. As Matthew McConaughey\u2019s character in Wolf of Wall Street said, \u201cIt\u2019s Fugayzi, fugazi. It\u2019s a whazy. It\u2019s a woozie. It\u2019s fairy dust. It doesn\u2019t exist. It\u2019s never landed. It is no matter. It\u2019s not on the elemental chart. It\u2019s not f****** real.\u201d What\u2019s in a name, really? \u201cMy Dad was wont to call me \u201cDan Dan the lavatory man.\u201d I don\u2019t know why. My name is Andy.\u201d My uni mates still call me \u2018Stan\u2019. So there\u2019s that, Andy Brittain. I\u2019ve done the maths and, at four an over, Australia will need 43.5 overs to reach their target. One or two more wickets in hand and they\u2019d be in pole position. Still in the balance I reckon. Here\u2019s Josh Robinson with some perspective: \u201cMorning Dan, morning everybody. In a situation such as this I\u2019d generally say that down to a certain point, the more overs are taken out of the game, the more the scales are tipped towards the chasing side. Were the full quota of 98 overs to be bowled, it\u2019s a straight shoot-out between 174 runs and 7 wickets. As the time decreases down to somewhere around 25 overs (perhaps even a little lower than that), the batting side can afford to take more risks in the knowledge that there\u2019s just not that much time for the bowlers to take the wickets. Much less than 20 and it\u2019s a question of how seriously the batting side will have a go (and how hard, and for how long, if wickets start to fall). I\u2019d say the state of the match doesn\u2019t meaningfully change until 30 overs have been lost, at which point each over taken out of the game gives a slight advantage to the batting side.\u201d Is Bazball better than Glastonbury? Here\u2019s the excellent Archie Rhind-Tutt \u2013 a name familiar to all Football Weekly fans: \u201cOver with a friend, German Tom, for Glastonbury from Cologne. We were due to stay in London today, make final preparations BUT THEN\u2026 Took him to the pub last night to watch the final session / make a stab at explaining cricket to him. Sufficient attention was obtained. Broad\u2019s late spell had me checking Day 5 tickets and here we are, sat on a National Express coach just outside Birmingham, hoping the rain shifts shortly after the traffic does. German Tom could be about to experience one of the best days of sport he\u2019ll ever see (he supports Hamburg)\u2026or I\u2019ve lugged him up here for a day of rain in Birmingham. Either way, an unforgettable experience.\u201d And there, folks, is why Bazball works. Sure it\u2019s a silly marketing term that is merely a shorthand for a slightly more aggressive brand of cricket. But it\u2019s a hook. And it forces other teams to respond and talk about it and do something different (or stick to what they believe in and defend their position). It\u2019s why this team, love them or hate them, is so good for the game. I hope you have a brilliant day Archie and German Tom. Australia still in with a shout? \u201cCameron Green seems to have a cushy little number as an ,almost , non bowling all rounder. Can\u2019t understand the hype around him. Mitchell Marsh looks a better option to me but what do I know?\u201d Don\u2019t talk yourself down, John Jones. I\u2019ve seen so-called experts make ridiculous calls in this game. Your view is as valid as anyone else\u2019s. I like Green. His height is a factor. Glib, perhaps, but his ability to hit an awkward length hard is what makes him a slippery customer. And I back his batting. I know a few in my local cricket club (hi Millsy, if you\u2019re reading this) don\u2019t rate him, but I\u2019d have him in my team. = Root the spinner? \u201cHi Dan-the-dude\u201d excellent, btw, Robin Hazlehurst. \u201cNot enough thinking outside the box in the YJB/Foakes debate, not enough true bazballing. If Moeen and Leach are knacked and England don\u2019t have any other spinners, then the issue is resolved - play both Bairstow and Foakes and let Root be the spinner. He\u2019s done ok at it recently, hasn\u2019t he? Or if that might overload him, then maybe Brooke can share the load. He looked pretty spicy when he bowled in the first innings. Or if Bairstow goes into a steaming funk when he has the gloves removed, then toss him the ball and ask him to charge in and vent his rage that way. Would certainly not be what the oppo expect and would probably be entertaining one way or another.\u201d I\u2019m not sure Root would fancy that. And I also don\u2019t think he\u2019s good enough to be a frontline spinner. And I also don\u2019t think you\u2019d want to burden him with that extra job. But it\u2019s funky and I like where your head is at. Even the Aussie are on board with Baz: \u201cOh how we pine for the days when Australia batted first, crawled to 450 or so by after lunch on day two \u2026 Not. It\u2019s been a few years since I\u2019ve sat up late (ish) in Perth watching cricket. Last night was captivating. A contest between batsmen who wouldn\u2019t allow bowlers to just bowl line and length and bowlers who were nearly up to task. Long may it last\u201d Thanks Ross McGillivray. I lived in Perth for a couple of years when I was younger. Would love to go back. Jonathan May is asking some difficult questions: \u201cMay I ask how many overs are left when they get back on the pitch? I\u2019m reading that they will try and get the full quota (98 overs) in from the moment play commences. Are overs not deducted on a proportionate basis (as I believe has always been the case?) Some people were saying England upped the tempo yesterday to put overs back into the game, but if no overs are lost, that would render the tactic unnecessary.\u201d The good thing about playing cricket in England is that the sun sets late. So I see no reason why we won\u2019t get a decent amount. Now how many exactly remains a mystery. I\u2019d be astounded if we get 98 in. And yes, I think England\u2019s breezy batting (and even their first innings declaration) had something to do with the weather. Unless I\u2019m mistaken this rain is a little late. Thanks everyone for the messages. If you\u2019re bored of my natter can I recommend this outstanding piece from my mate, James Wallace: Cricket balls and Holocaust survivors. I promise you\u2019ve never read anything like it before: \u201cDaz, Dazza, Dazzy McDazface\u201d Those are more appropriate for a Darren, than a Daniel, but I\u2019m loving your energy Hugh Maguire. \u201cI\u2019m not going to offer anything other than frothing excitement for todays play. There\u2019s going to be plenty more whatiffery as the day pans out for both sides whatever the outcome. I\u2019m back with the OBO mistress Hope. Though I\u2019ve swiped right on Expectation. I think Hope knows and today may end up with both or neither.\u201d Little expectation here. Let me ask the group a question\u2026 How many overs do Australia need to knock these runs off? Good to get some Aussie correspondence. Here\u2019s Gervase Greene from Sydney\u2019s eastern \u2018burbs: \u201cAs to the \u2018whole Bazball thing\u2019, sorry to be so prosaic: surely they are playing that way because the previous approach didn\u2019t work? Which is why it\u2019s a brilliantly sensible strategy. Please leave out all the blather evoking slow-motion running across a windswept beach to a Vangelis soundtrack (anyone for unbranded merch?). England are all about winning, and this is a way of - just maybe - of getting close to that again. Which is fair enough.\u201d Right you are Gervase. They hit rock bottom playing a placid brand of cricket and they reverted to what served them so well in the white ball game. What\u2019s more, they have the batters to score at 4.5 an over. It\u2019s exciting and bold, but it also makes cricket sense. Should Australia be chasing a smaller target? If they do fall short (either with a loss or a draw) will they rue the firm wagging of England\u2019s tail? Geoff Lemon says so which means it must be true: I\u2019ve just been alphad by Ronald Glover: \u201cHi Dan, how about \u201cFourth Dan\u201d for you? After (Google tells me) the other Dans who write for the Guardian (Sabbagh, Boffey, and Harris). Powerful but sadly also unintentionally dismissive.\u201d \u201cHi Daniel. Really looking forward to this afternoon - surely no chance of an Aussie win now given the time and conditions?\u201d It\u2019s looking that way, Andrew Bennett. \u201cWatching the highlights of the back end of yesterday\u2019s action led to a very important question re the travelling Australian fans and their colour coordinated outfits. \u201c(a) There appears to be both a yellow and dark green option - what does each mean? Are they different fan clubs or supporter organisations? And (b) how do they organise themselves into very neat blocks of each colour in the stands? Doesn\u2019t seem to be any mixing of greens and yellows, but with random amounts of English/neutral/other fans in between each row?\u201d \u201cAll very important stuff, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll agree.\u201d Absolutely! These are deeply important questions and I have no answers. Chalk them down to life\u2019s mysteries. No play before 1.10pm BST / 10.10pm AEST. Sad news folks but we\u2019re going to have to keep the chat going for some time. Lunch will be taken at 12.30pm BST with no play til then. Forecast is better this afternoon but a draw now looming large. What does Nathan Lyon do in his hotel room? I\u2019m going to regret typing these next words, but now I really wish I knew. Always good to get a line from inside the room. Here\u2019s my colleague, Luke McLaughlin: \u201cI\u2019ve heard more than one pundit opine that if England win, all of Stokes\u2019s decisions during the match will be vindicated, and if Australia win, then the same becomes true of Cummings. Surely this is a vast oversimplification? \u201cAnyway, England\u2019s main lessons from this remarkable Test match must be: 1) Bazball shouldn\u2019t mean it\u2019s OK to toss wickets away cheaply. 2) Foakes must play, Bairstow stays as a batsman. I do worry that the fact Bairstow is a lovely lad, and very popular within the team, means he gets too much leeway with his keeping.\u201d That\u2019s the nature of elite sport, innit? Pep Guardiola pointed out that he won the treble because a striker missed a header from three yards out. If that went in, would Pep be a fraud? No. But we deal in binary results. Makes for good chat though, doesn\u2019t it? I agree with your second point. If England lose I bet they\u2019ll be kicking themselves for a few soft dismissals. \u2018Dan-ster\u2019. I like it. Loads of chat about YJB and Foakes: Timothy Sanders from Leeds: \u201cI think Barney is right, that \u2018it would be progressive, not regressive, to bring Foakes into this team\u2019, in line with England\u2019s philosophy of how to play Test cricket. If it\u2019s about having fun, taking twenty wickets, and showing the paying public your very best skills, then surely the practical application of Bazball means picking your very best wicketkeeper? I say go with Foakes as the way for this team to live its values. Then they just have to decide on the best 5 from the 6 batters!\u201d Stephen Brown who has offered \u2018Big Dan\u2019 as a nickname: \u201cFor me, Foakes should be in the team. Having a very good wicket keeper vs a good wicket keeper can be worth having another batter who averages 40-50 in the team. And who wouldn\u2019t want to add that? So the question becomes, who do you leave out? Weirdly, I\u2019d say the person underperforming their playing role in the team the most over the last year might actually be Stokes. But we can\u2019t exactly drop him and let him captain from the touchlines. Which means the solution is probably to let Bairstow open. Ducket has more runs as an opener under Stokes than Crawly despite playing half the games, so he should probably be given the first shot of opening alongside Bairstow.\u201d Joe Roberts: \u201cIf it is true that Bairstow must be in the side due to last year\u2019s heroics, it is also true that Crawley has done very little to justify his place in this side, having contributed very little to the success over the last 12 months. Not to mention that Foakes has been a vital part of that success, not just with the gloves, but with the bat as well, and surely warrants the same treatment as Bairstow.\u201d Tom Nolan: \u201cCrawley out for Foakes with YJB opening? Won\u2018t happen after Crawley\u2018s first innings knock here but seems a logical way to get Foakes and Bairstow into the same side.\u201d Geoff Wignall with a another whacky idea: \u201cMy new solution would be someone with sound defensive technique yet capable of serious aggression who isn\u2019t scoring many in his current slot: one Ben Stokes.\u201d Foakes for Brook? To be honest, I hadn\u2019t considered that. But Richard O\u2019Hagan makes an intersting point that has got me thinking: \u201cI know that this will be controversial, but I think you have to choose between Bairstow and Brook. Brook came into the side as the replacement for the injured Bairstow and from a batting perspective they are probably on a par with one another, save that YJB is vastly more experienced. But at the same time the runs that England have conceded as a result of Bairstow\u2019s rustiness with the gloves could well be the difference between winning and losing this Test, as they pretty much negate his contribution with the bat. For my money Foakes has to play and one of those two has to stand down if England are to have any chance of winning this series.\u201d Let\u2019s not forget that Foakes is still a brilliant batter. Sure he doesn\u2019t have the firepower of Brook or Bairstow, but it\u2019s not like he\u2019s a mug with the willow. And if Ali plays (finger blister permitting) they still have the punch in the lower order. Email gremlins fixed: I wasn\u2019t aware that the link to my email was broken. Should be sorted now. If you\u2019ve been trying to get in touch but haven\u2019t done so, please try again. This is a really, really long email from Simon in Cornwall. But with nothing going on, I\u2019ll share it in it\u2019s entirety with my two cents between each paragraph (yes, paragraph, strap in): \u201cI have a question about the reverse ramp. How does the batter decide that that is the shot they are going to play? It seems that they get into position for the shot so early that it can\u2019t be based on the trajectory of the ball - does the batter decide before the ball is bowled that they are going to play that shot, and just commit? I get that you wouldn\u2019t play it against an unpredictable spinner, and that you need some kind of predictability in the bowlers style - is there maybe some subtle thing in finger position or wrist action that makes the batter know it is a good shot selection? Or is it just hit and hope?\u201d It has to be premeditated. Bowlers like Boland who put it on the same spot over and over again are particularly susceptible to being ramped. A lot of hit and hope for sure. \u201cI\u2019d also like to say something about Bazball. I think something that hasn\u2019t been mentioned much is Ben Stokes\u2019 struggles with mental health, and the fact that it seems to me that Bazball is an attempt by Stokes to take the parts of the game that may cause a player to struggle, and just\u2026..remove them. Many elite sportspeople have suffered badly in this arena, and not just cricketers - see \u2018The Edge\u2019, about the 09-13 England team, but also Nick Kyrgios, Mark Selby, Naomi Osaka, Simone Biles, Michael Phelps, and god knows how many others from years gone by.\u201d Oh, Bazball is therapy. Or so said Barney Ronay in this wonderful piece. \u201cThe reason I have so much respect for this style of play is that it seems to me that after taking brave decisions to protect his own wellbeing over the years, Stokes has developed a style that extends this protection to his whole team. Stokes has a greater understanding of his teammates, and of the nature of leadership and sporting ambition than any leader I can think of, and this goes far beyond \u2018finding a way to win\u2019. Stokes has taken bold, innovative steps to protect, nurture and develop the whole person, not just their skills and sporting qualities, knowing full well that, coincidentally, this is how you get the best out of them.\u201d Bold, innovative, daring, carefree. That\u2019s why it' has captured so many people, win or lose. \u201cIts interesting that the list of athletes I mention who have publicly struggled with their mental health are all proponents of individual sports (tennis, snooker, gymnastics, swimming), and this is the first example I know of where the thinking has been extended to a team sport. I see Gareth Southgate doing something similar, but in a gentler and less bold way, and the results there are fairly clear too. As someone who has had some pretty loopy mental health over the years, I can not tell you how much I respect what Stokes (and BmcC) is doing.\u201d Mate, thank you for opening up. I reckon a lot of people reading this right now will relate. \u201cThe way England are playing will ripple outwards and change the way test cricket is played, and more importantly how it is perceived that it SHOULD be played, maybe even save the format from a spiral of stagnation and diminishing gate receipts as everyone rushes to whizzier formats, leaving a trail of broken and forgotten players who gave their all but failed in some way that comes to define them forever. I adore the man, and in true Bazball style, wish with all my heart that he stays true to his new methods through the whole series, even if it means we lose every test. It feels more important than that, to me.\u201d Even football is hooked! \u201cI understand that this isn\u2019t how a lot of fans feel - the \u2018win at all costs\u2019 mentality is irresistible to a sports fan, even if that cost is the health and wellbeing of the very players they revere. Bazball reminds us all that athletes are people, and that people do their best work when they love what they are doing, are given freedom to express themselves and are respected for doing so. Bazball, to me, isn\u2019t just a cricketing ideology, it\u2019s not a cricketing tactic, and its certainly not the new-age, man-feeling, bro-vibes rubbish it can so easily be dismissed as. Its an affirmation of the humanity at the heart of cricket, of sport, and of competition, and I hope it lasts forever. Or at least til the end of the fifth test.\u201d And let\u2019s not forget that England were rubbish before Bazball. This is not simply the unshackling of players but also a cohesive strategy to get the best out of a talented group. It\u2019s daring and brave, but also calculated (even if it doesn\u2019t always seem that way). Thank you for a brilliant mail. I really enjoyed that. \u201cHi Dan. Looking forward to a cracking day\u2019s play!\u201d Me too, Damian Johnson, let\u2019s hope we get enough of it. \u201cRegards Bairstow/Foakes, YJB is allowed one bad game I would say, and horses for courses, Foakes stays in contention for tours in Asia or the driest of dry wickets. \u201cIf he were to come in, any of the top 3 should be under pressure and this includes Pope who never seems to be mentioned despite a highly mediocre record, especially against the big boys. Don\u2019t get me wrong, cracking looking batter but he never seems to be under any pressure - is this a Surrey thing!?\u201d Hmmm. I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s a Surrey thing. If that was the case then Foakes would be playing. Pope is class. No doubt about that. I saw him score a coming of age ton against South Africa in Gqeberha. He\u2019ll be alright in the long run. But you\u2019re right. A few more failures and some serious questions will need to be asked. YummyBear has become our official weather correspondent. And yup, all fingers, toes and limbs crossed. Oh man. I\u2019m watching the Sky feed and it looks really grim. I take back what I said earlier and I\u2019m now with Will Southworth. Will be incredible if they get out there in time to finish the game. How frustrating! But, if they do, one team in particular will fancy it. Oh dear\u2026 So advantage England. Especially as Warner is in the shed. But hey, Head can give it a whack too. How many overs do you reckon Australia will need to fancy having a go? I loved this piece by Barney from last night. And would love to know what you think about the Bairstow-Foakes debate. For my money, Young JB has to play. He\u2019s just so destructive with the bat. But there\u2019s no question Foakes is the outstanding keeper in the country. Does that mean Duckett drops out? But then who opens? Should Pope make way? Ludicrous! There are no easy answers in the epoch of Baz. Granted this was 20 minutes ago, but it\u2019s not looking great. Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll get plenty of cricket. We just won\u2019t start at 11. Has it only been four days? At the risk of heaping more hyperbole on top of a narrative oozing with the stuff, this has already been an almighty contest that has packed more action than most series. It began on a road and saw Joe Root unfurl a sumptuous century before the bucket-hatted Ben Stokes declared on the first day. Then Usman Khawaja batted and batted and batted until he was given a sweary send-off by Ollie Robinson. Did it cross the line? Have these lines ever existed? Are the Aussies now the meek ones in this ancient relationship? Root attempted a reverse scoop from the first ball of day three. Pat Cummins was outstanding. Nathan Lyon picked up a four-for. Moeen Ali\u2019s finger fell apart. Stuart Broad did Stuart Broad things and now, as we begin this final day of an epic battle, Australia need 174 runs and England need seven wickets. There are echoes of 2005 and the narrow two run win for England that helped ignite the greatest Ashes in living memory. If the past four days are anything to go by, we might have a contender to that particular title. My name is Daniel, but in this Bazball age you can call me Dan, Danny Boy or frankly any other whacky nickname you like (please don\u2019t make me regret that). There\u2019s rain about in Birmingham but all the journos on the ground reckon we\u2019ll have play after a slight delay. Don\u2019t worry. We\u2019re getting a result. Of that I\u2019m certain. If you fancy dropping a line please do. Email or Twitter. You know the drill. Strap in folks. This is going to be a good \u2019un."}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db58f", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/20/california-affordable-housing-crisis-homelessness-study-myths-older-black-residents", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Who\u2019s unhoused in California?

University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) research released on Tuesday also revealed that 90% of the population lost their housing in California, with 75% of them now living in the same county where they were last housed. The study further found that nearly nine out of 10 people reported that the cost of housing was the main barrier to leaving homelessness. The research from UCSF\u2019s Benioff Homelessness and Housing Initiative, based on a representative survey of nearly 3,200 unhoused people, contradicts several persistent myths about the population, including that most unhoused people come from out of state to take advantage of services, as well as stereotypes that homeless people are mostly young adults who prefer to live outside and don\u2019t want help. \u201cPeople are homeless because their rent is too high. And their options are too few. And they have no cushion,\u201d Dr Margot Kushel, initiative director and lead investigator, told the Associated Press. \u201cAnd it really makes you wonder how different things would look if we could solve that underlying problem.\u201d California is home to more than 171,000 people experiencing homelessness, comprising 30% of the homeless population in the US and half of all Americans who are unsheltered and living outside. The crisis has become a public health catastrophe in recent years as an ageing population is forced to live in tents, cars and other makeshift shelters, with thousands dying on the streets each year. California is considered the most unaffordable state for housing, where minimum-wage earners would have to work nearly 90 hours a week to afford a one-bedroom apartment. The study further found that among the older population, 41% said they experienced their first episode of homelessness after age 50. Most participants in the research reported that the cost of living had become unsustainable before they lost housing, reporting a monthly median household income of $960 in the six months before homelessness. Nearly half of adults surveyed were not living on a lease in the six months before facing homelessness, meaning they were couch-surfing or had moved in with family and friends in precarious situations. Renters with leases reported a median of only 10 days\u2019 notice that they were going to lose their housing, while people without leases reported a median of only one day of warning. Researchers reported that participants had endured significant trauma, with two-thirds reporting mental health symptoms, more than a third experiencing physical or sexual violence during homelessness, and more than a third visiting an emergency department in the past six months. Access to care and treatment was also a major challenge cited, with one in five who use substances reporting that they wanted treatment but could not obtain it. The study found that while Black residents make up 6% of California\u2019s general population, they account for 26% of the unhoused population. Native American and Indigenous people were also overrepresented, accounting for 12% of the unhoused population. Latinos made up 35% of the unhoused population, fairly comparable to their proportion of the general population. The study was done at the request of Governor Gavin Newsom\u2019s administration, but was not funded by the state. The researchers recommended that the state increase access to housing that is affordable to extremely low-income people, including by expanding rental subsidies; expand homelessness prevention through financial support and legal assistance, including for people leaving jails, prisons and drug treatment; expand eviction protections; increase access to treatment; and increase outreach and services for people living on the streets. Claudine Sipili, a member of the research project\u2019s lived expertise board, said in a statement that she hopes the research will help the state develop effective strategies that allow people to transition out of homelessness and into stable housing circumstances: \u201cHaving experienced homelessness first-hand, I vividly recall the relentless fight for survival, the pervasive shame that haunted me, and my unsuccessful endeavors to overcome homelessness on my own.\u201d The Associated Press contributed reporting"}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db590", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/20/andy-murray-bows-out-of-queens-and-left-to-wait-for-wimbledon-seeding", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Andy Murray focused on \u2018positive signs\u2019 after crashing out of Queen\u2019s Club", "lead": "Andy Murray lost 6-3, 6-1 against Australia\u2019s Alex de Minaur and admitted he didn\u2019t play very well, while Carlos Alcaraz reached the second round", "author": "Tumaini Carayol at Queen's Club", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 19:28:11", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.991482", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/9804470307bc28f639274bd7477e2896af103118/0_146_4107_2464/500.jpg", "body": "Andy Murray\u2019s hopes of being seeded at Wimbledon came to a bitter, abrupt end in his opening match at Queen\u2019s Club as the five-time champion was soundly defeated 6-3, 6-1 by Alex de Minaur in the first round. Murray arrived in west London with high expectations having established some positive form on grass. After skipping the French Open, he opted to drop down to ATP Challenger level and competed at events in Surbiton and Nottingham, comfortably winning both tournaments and compiling a 10-match winning run. However, he looked laboured from the beginning against the Australian seventh seed, spraying unforced errors and moving timidly as De Minaur smothered him with consistent aggression. Murray refused to blame his defeat on his intense schedule as he competed for a third successive week. \u201cI felt OK going into the match. Just didn\u2019t play very well,\u201d he said. Now ranked 38th, Murray needed a quarter-final at Queen\u2019s Club to give himself a solid chance of being a top\u201132 seed at Wimbledon and ensure he could avoid a high seed in the first two rounds. He will instead have to wait to see what the draw produces for him next Friday. \u201cObviously after today, you know, it\u2019s easy to overreact,\u201d Murray said. \u201cWell, no, I lost to a good player and it was obviously very comfortable but at the same time, over the last couple of weeks, yes, it\u2019s obviously not the same level of opponents, but I won the tournament last week without dropping a set. I only lost one set in Surbiton. Was holding serve very comfortably, was moving well, hitting the ball good. There is a lot of positive signs there.\u201d Eleven days since his tense, anticlimactic semi-final defeat against Novak Djokovic in the French Open, Carlos Alcaraz looked forward to new objectives as he continued to learn how to perform at a high level. On his Queen\u2019s Club debut, the Spaniard recovered from a set deficit as he defeated Arthur Rinderknech 4-6, 7-5, 7-6 (3) to reach the second round. In his short time as a professional, Alcaraz has performed at the highest level on clay and hard courts, but Queen\u2019s is only the third senior grass court tournament of his career. Like many young players, he is still learning the nuances of grass court tennis. Before the tournament, he made it clear that his movement is still a work in progress on the surface. At times, he remained slow out of the corners when changing directions. But the 20-year-old slowly buckled down, producing some special shotmaking in the decisive moments. After the Spaniard recovered from a 2-0 deficit in the third set, the pair held serve until they reached the tiebreak and Alcaraz took his first win at Queen\u2019s. \u201cDuring the match I was thinking that I need hours on court. I need to play as much as I can,\u201d Alcaraz said, smiling. \u201cSo for me, it was great to have this tough match. I\u2019m saying that after winning. If I had lost, it was totally different. But it was really good for me, coming in.\u201d Meanwhile, Frances Tiafoe celebrated his first week as a top\u201110 player with another victory. The new No 10, who won the Stuttgart Open last week, is the third African-American man to reach the top 10 of the ATP rankings and the first since the former No 4 James Blake. With Taylor Fritz ranked No 8, this week marks the first time since 2012 that two American players have been inside the top 10. \u201cI always believed in it before anybody else did,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I\u2019m here and I\u2019m super excited. Can\u2019t really write it any other way. Got in top 10. It was Juneteenth yesterday. It\u2019s just all around a great day. Yeah, I mean, again, I hope, I think just keep going. I texted and called James. He didn\u2019t answer. He big-timed me. He Hollywooded me.\u201d In Birmingham, Katie Boulter\u2019s winning run was ended with defeat by China\u2019s Zhu Lin in the first round of the Rothesay Classic. Boulter had celebrated the best achievement of her career in Nottingham on Sunday when she won her first WTA Tour title to reach a highest ranking of 77 but was unable to back it up at Edgbaston Priory against Zhu, the world No 39, in a 7-5, 7-5 defeat. The second seed Jelena Ostapenko battled to a three-set win against the Czech teenager Linda Noskova in the opening match, winning 6-2, 5-7, 6-1 to set up a second-round meeting with Venus Williams."}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db591", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/jun/20/england-vibes-sprites-cummins-bazball-ashes-cricket-australia", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "England relied on vibes and sprites when Cummins went a little Bazball | Jonathan Liew", "lead": "Five tempestuous, hysterical days ended with Australia playing the old-fashioned way until desperation won the day", "author": "Jonathan Liew at Edgbaston", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 19:17:00", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.991500", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/93cd90ab0775fe452d15f7bc2f8291c6190e9745/0_71_4000_2400/500.jpg", "body": "Everyone talks about big first hours. That\u2019s because first hours need all the hype they can get. Nobody needs to sell the last hour of a Test match. And particularly not a Test on this epic, colossal, orchestral scale, a Test that shook you from its very first ball and never stopped shaking. Take the devastating tension of a tight Twenty20, the ebb and grapple of a really good one-day international, and then make it big. Stretch it out over almost a week. Throw in some random weather phenomena, enough booze to fill the Caspian, batters forced to bowl and bowlers forced to bat. Cricket: good. Worth your time. Might just catch on. That was the only firm conclusion we could draw from these five tempestuous, hysterical days in Birmingham. For the victorious, exhausted Australia there will be a temptation to see this as vindication: almost a moral as well as a sporting triumph, proof of the time-honoured virtues of ticker, patience, trust in the process. But that would be to ignore the fact they only turned this game round when Pat Cummins threw caution to the wind and hurled the bat at everything that moved. When they went \u2013 to coin a phrase \u2013 a little bit Bazball. As for the demoralised, exhausted England: well, whatever you think about them is by definition wrong. Remember, Bazball is largely indifferent to your staid, hidebound trivialities like victory and defeat. It is no more possible to defeat Bazball than it is to defeat carbon, or the notion of love, or the number five. So what if they looked bereft of ideas in the field and kept throwing their wickets away when well set? Something something pitch. Something something the little kid within. Something something Test cricket is the winner here. The bitter irony here was that England were defeated largely on their own terms. Whatever nebulous cricketing principles their new style of play embodies, it probably doesn\u2019t incorporate trying to win a nail-biting Test with seven fielders on the boundary. England batted with brio and panache, but Usman Khawaja still scored more runs than any of them. With the game within their grasp, the kings of the fourth\u2011innings surge succumbed to the sort of blistering counterattack that might have been transcribed from the pages of Brendon McCullum\u2019s copybook, were he to possess a copybook, which we can be fairly certain he does not. England lost the battle of ideas, but they also lost the battle of the breaks. The rain on the third afternoon came and went at the worst possible time for them, a key period during which Australia claimed both their openers. The fast, flat pitch Ben Stokes ordered was, quite frankly, a mess. The only way of prising out wickets on it was through big turn, big pace or a litany of batting errors. As the margins tightened in the final session, with Moeen Ali failing to appear after the tea break, it became clear they had none of them. So what do you do? You have to reach for the bag of mystery intangibles. Ollie Robinson\u2019s glare. Stuart Broad pumping up the crowd. Field settings that look more like interview panels. Funky choices, such as Joe Root bowling 13 overs in a row or deciding not to take the new ball until it is too late. Often Australia would succumb to the showmanship: Cameron Green and Alex Carey played silly shots to get out. Stokes, trudging in with the old ball to bowl his little 81mph lozenges, cleaned up Khawaja with a brilliantly disguised leg-cutter. But over a long enough x-axis, the arc of Ashes cricket bends towards logic. England had precious little of it when it mattered most. Bazball \u2013 if it is founded on anything \u2013 is founded on the idea that cricket is an energy as well as a mass, a game of magic as well as materials, a game of visions and hallucinations. When you can will yourself to chase down 378, perhaps you also start to believe that you can will the skin on Moeen\u2019s spinning finger to heal, that you can will your battery of 82mph fast bowlers to bowl out the best team in the world, that the magic moment will simply drop in your lap when you need it. Meanwhile, let\u2019s just remind ourselves of McCullum\u2019s playing record against Australia: one win, 13 defeats, and a trouncing in a World Cup final. Perhaps it is too much of a simplification to say England play cricket as they would like it to be, while Australia play the game that actually exists. But it was certainly true here. England played the game of sprites and vibes; Australia played the surface and the ball that was bowled and however you want to spin it a defeat on your own terms is still a defeat. Now comes the real test. Do England want to wake up? Or do they want to keep dreaming?"}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db592", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/20/hunter-biden-guilty-case-plea-charges-explained", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "What to know about the Hunter Biden investigation and what it means", "lead": "The case has already resulted in a political uproar as Republicans express outrage over plea deal", "author": "Nick Robins-Early", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 19:10:04", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.991517", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/72c94fb6306526c6c4b62b3adea5b63ea26f8932/0_160_2406_1444/500.jpg", "body": "Hunter Biden, the son of Joe Biden, will plead guilty to two counts of misdemeanor tax crimes and accept a deal with prosecutors related to a separate illegal firearm possession charge. The charges and plea deal, which authorities announced in a court filing on Tuesday, will end a five-year criminal investigation into Biden. The case has already resulted in a political uproar as Republicans, fresh off Donald Trump\u2019s second criminal indictment, express outrage over the plea deal and appear eager to redirect public attention to Hunter Biden. The agreement between 53-year-old Biden and authorities will likely mean he avoids any jail time, as well as set up a frequent talking point for the 2024 presidential election. Here is a breakdown of the charges against Hunter Biden: What is the Hunter Biden investigation? The justice department has been looking into Hunter Biden\u2019s personal and business dealings for years, launching an investigation into him as far back as 2018. Hunter Biden issued a statement in 2020 acknowledging that the US attorney\u2019s office in Delaware informed his legal counsel that investigators were looking into his tax affairs, while stating he was confident he handled his affairs \u201clegally and appropriately\u201d. The investigation, which was led by Trump-appointed US attorney for Delaware David Weiss, looked into a range of Biden\u2019s activities that included his role in foreign businesses \u2013 such as his seat on the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma, a frequent source of rightwing criticism. Investigators interviewed witnesses and looked through financial documents, with the probe looming in the background for years. Ultimately the investigation narrowed down to two main issues: Biden\u2019s failure to pay income taxes on time and a charge related to lying on a firearm application form. Prosecutors charged Biden on 20 June, while simultaneously announcing that he would enter a plea deal that will likely not result in jail time. What are the tax charges against Hunter Biden? Biden pleaded guilty to two counts of wilful failure to pay federal income tax. The two misdemeanor charges relate to Biden failing to pay taxes for the years 2017 and 2018, according to a statement from Weiss\u2019s office, despite owing more than $100,000 each year. (He paid these back taxes in 2021, following the opening of the investigation.) What is the gun charge against Hunter Biden? Investigators also charged Biden with one count of illegally possessing a firearm, stating that he violated a law that prohibits people who use or are addicted to controlled substances from owning a gun. Biden has publicly detailed his struggles with substance abuse, including alcohol and crack cocaine, while explicit photos of him on drugs have circulated for years. He stated on a handgun application in 2018 that he was not using drugs, according to the New York Times, which prosecutors allege was a lie. Biden will not plead guilty to the firearm charge, but instead will enter into a Pretrial Diversion Agreement that typically means an individual avoids prosecution if they meet certain conditions. What are the political implications of the Hunter Biden charges? The charges against Hunter Biden, and the plea deal will mean he likely avoids any jail time, have immediately riled up Republicans who have long made unsubstantiated accusations that the president\u2019s son is part of an international criminal conspiracy. Almost immediately after the charges were announced, numerous Republican lawmakers and rightwing commentators criticized the justice department for not seeking harsher punishment for Biden. Former president Donald Trump posted on his Truth Social network that the plea deal was the work of the \u201ccorrupt Biden DOJ\u201d and was a \u201ctraffic ticket\u201d. The House Oversight Committee chairman, James Comer, who is leading Republican lawmakers\u2019 separate inquiry into Hunter Biden, alleged: \u201cBiden is getting away with a slap on the wrist\u201d and vowed to continue his committee\u2019s investigation. Ohio Republican congressman Jim Jordan simply tweeted: \u201cDOUBLE STANDARD OF JUSTICE.\u201d Republicans have long attempted to use Hunter Biden as a counterpoint to the various criminal investigations facing Trump, claiming that the Biden administration is somehow covering up the president\u2019s son\u2019s crimes or engaging in corruption. The charges against Hunter Biden also notably come one week after Trump was arraigned in a Florida courthouse after facing a 37-count indictment related to his handling of classified documents. Unlike Biden, who has never held public office and faced misdemeanor charges, the more serious felony counts against Trump could carry significant jail time and complicate his 2024 presidential election campaign. How has the president responded to his son\u2019s plea deal? Meanwhile, the White House on Tuesday issued a brief statement through a spokesperson on the charges against Biden. \u201cThe President and First Lady love their son and support him as he continues to rebuild his life. We will have no further comment,\u201d the statement said. The Biden administration has been preparing for possible charges against the president\u2019s son for months, as Republicans appear intent to once again make Hunter Biden a focal point during the election."}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db593", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/20/king-charles-royal-ascot-frankie-dettori-horse-racing", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": " Dawn of Royal Ascot\u2019s new era ends in defeat for King Charles and Dettori | Sean Ingle", "lead": "The monarch\u2019s lukewarm interest in racing will not have been helped by veteran jockey\u2019s ban for careless riding on Saga", "author": "Sean Ingle at Ascot", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 19:09:18", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.991534", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/39e87343f9e67b7e9f7e873e534fe6154a25ec76/0_234_6944_4167/500.jpg", "body": "Even on a day when Royal Ascot felt even more awash with bunting than ever, and the top hats and collars were suitably starched and stiff, there was a hint of change in the air. A gentle sense of tradition encountering transition after the death of the sport\u2019s greatest patron, Queen Elizabeth II, last year. It was evident as the royal procession bumpily made its way down the straight before the first race, and the regal waves of King Charles III were met with gentle \u2013 rather than rousing applause \u2013 although plenty did tip their hats. The racecards also carried a new royal cypher, bearing the double C for Charles and Camilla. It was evident too as the crowds cheered the sport\u2019s most famous jockey, Frankie Dettori, at what will be his final Royal Ascot before he rides off into the sunset. The headline in Tuesday\u2019s Racing Post had proclaimed it the Land of Hope and Dettori. But this was one of those afternoons when the magician waves his wand but the rabbit refuses to leave the hat. Mostly, though, Royal Ascot\u2019s unique ecosystem remains as familiar and unaltered as it ever was. A few months ago the Jockey Club announced a relaxation of its dress code to get more people to go racing. But for a place that is a stickler for rules, this was one Ascot was happy to swerve. In the Royal Enclosure, in particular, the clothing restrictions would make a sergeant major wince. Women are told that dresses and skirts should fall just above the knee or longer \u2013 while men are reminded of the need for a waistcoat and necktie, with patterns of a patriotic nature deemed acceptable. Those unsure of where the line is can visit a room by the entrance which is labelled \u201cdress code enquiries.\u201d Some will roll their eyes at this, as well as Ascot\u2019s proud boast that it remains the centrepiece of the British sporting social season. But it is certainly up there. And it would be churlish to deny that it offers a palate that a large-cross section of the British public rather enjoys: dressing up, drinking, royalty and a speculative punt. Taking it all in was Dave Harries, an 80-year-old recording engineer, who said he had been coming to Royal Ascot since the 1960s. \u201cIt\u2019s still the place to be,\u201d he insisted, as he showed off his new Panama hat. \u201cIt\u2019s about the tradition, the racing, and the fact you can talk to everyone.\u201d As Harries also noted, Charles is rumoured to be no turfite at heart. However for now, at least, he is making the effort. He has promised to be here all week. And before the penultimate race on the first day, he was down in the paddock to run his eye over his horse, Saga, and talk to his jockey, Dettori. He even looked to be giving a passable impression of enjoying himself. But there was to be no winning headline as Saga trudged home in fifth. Afterwards Dettori\u2019s face was etched in frustration, the bookies in delight. For decades, they have been wary of the \u201cFrankie factor\u201d, with multiple wins on the same card turning small stakes into damaging payouts. But there was no chance of that happening on the first day, despite the 52-year-old\u2019s best efforts. In the opening race the crowd got ever louder as Dettori\u2019s mount Inspiral appeared poised to strike but he could find no way past the eventual 33-1 winner, Triple Time. Then, in the fourth, Dettori coaxed his mount Givemethebeatboys to the front only for River Tiber to pound past him in the final furlong. Again anticipation turned to deflation. To make matters worse for Dettori, he was then handed a nine-day ban for careless riding following his ride on Saga, which will start in early July. Meanwhile, it wasn\u2019t only the bookies breathing a sigh of relief. Ascot had spent a six-figure sum on extra security and enhanced CCTV in the build up to this meeting, but the protest group Animal Rising proved as good as their word in promising not to disrupt the event. Not that organisers were taking any chances: there was a vigorous police presence every 20 metres of so on the rails. On the course and the rails battle will be renewed again over the next four days, with a world record prize money of \u00a39.52m on offer too. Dettori will surely have plenty more chances to succeed. The punters too."}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db594", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/20/glastonbury-2023-sunshine-open-gates-elton-john-arctic-monkeys", "primaryCategory": "music", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Sunshine, secret sets and Elton\u2019s sendoff: Glastonbury 2023 prepares to open gates", "lead": "Crowds head to what could be a relatively low-key edition of the UK\u2019s biggest festival following its long-awaited return and 50th anniversary last year", "author": "Laura Snapes", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 19:00:41", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.991553", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/3cfcdfa3e937462f458d5273732c457d66514976/127_0_4728_2840/500.jpg", "body": "As Glastonbury-goers flock toward Worthy Farm, the UK\u2019s biggest festival is yet to give up a number of secrets about the weekend \u2013 from surprise performers to the outcome of the mercurial south-western weather. Most pressing is the question of whether Friday night headliners Arctic Monkeys will be able to fulfil their booking. On Monday (19 June) the group cancelled a performance in Dublin on 20 June owing to singer Alex Turner\u2019s \u201cacute laryngitis\u201d. The 37-year-old had received medical advice to rest \u2013 presumably to ensure their planned third Glastonbury headlining set is able to go ahead. If the Sheffield band is forced to cancel, then they could be replaced by the mysterious band the Churnups, a surprise act currently billed for 6.15pm on the Pyramid stage and widely believed to be the Foo Fighters. Fans think the US group has been sowing hints that they will grace the farm this year. Frontman Dave Grohl recently posted his thanks to fans for their show of support at their recent live shows \u2013 their first tour following the death of drummer Taylor Hawkins last year \u2013 in which he described them as \u201cchurning up these emotions together\u201d. The band is currently touring a new album, But Here We Are, which addresses the fallout from Hawkins\u2019 death. Eagle-eyed observers also noticed the appearance of a hawk-shaped bird on this year\u2019s Glastonbury artwork \u2013 a possible reference to Hawkins, who had a hawk tattoo on his arm relating to his surname. His surviving bandmates have been using the symbol as a tribute to Hawkins. However, rumours persist that the Churnups could be Blur or Pulp \u2013 or that one of the two Britpop bands might appear in one of several other as-yet-unannounced slots across the weekend. On Tuesday, the Pretenders announced that they are the secret act performing on the Park stage on Saturday night. \u201cThere has never been a festival like it anywhere else,\u201d said frontwoman Chrissie Hynde. Elton John has also confirmed that he is set to bring on several guest stars during his Sunday headline set \u2013 billed as his last ever UK performance. John told BBC Radio 1 that rather than repeat his ongoing Farewell Yellow Brick Road tour, which concludes in Sweden in July, he has planned an entirely new show for the occasion, including rarely played songs. \u201cIt\u2019s a different show to what people have been seeing,\u201d he said. \u201cOn Farewell Yellow Brick Road, there\u2019s quite a lot of deep cuts, it\u2019s not all hits, and you\u2019ve got to keep people interested. When you put a setlist together, I always say it\u2019s a bit like having sex. You start off really well, then you chill out a little bit, then towards the end of the show all hell breaks loose.\u201d It will be John\u2019s first ever appearance at the festival, whether as performer or punter. Further down the bill, the famed new music fan tipped UK rock duo Nova Twins, Scottish pop songwriter Joesef and Nigerian pop star Obongjayar as performances to check out. The current Met Office forecast suggests that the famous first-time festivalgoer will be spared the worst of Glastonbury\u2019s infamous weather. There is a chance of residual showers throughout Thursday that are set to settle down for the weekend. Friday is due to be dry and sunny, with temperatures peaking around 25\u00b0C. Saturday could see one isolated short shower, but the forecast should be warm and dry, with temperatures remaining high overnight. Sunday so far looks to be the same. Glastonbury 2023 looks to be a relatively low-key festival compared with more momentous editions in recent years: last year was the delayed 50th anniversary celebration after the 2020 and 2021 events were postponed by the Covid-19 pandemic. The weekend also coincided with the overturning of Roe v Wade, a move protested by many of the weekend\u2019s performers, including the US stars Phoebe Bridgers and Olivia Rodrigo, and saw a surprise appearance from the Swedish climate protester Greta Thunberg. In 2019, David Attenborough made an unbilled appearance on the Pyramid stage and Extinction Rebellion led a procession through the festival, while 2017 will be remembered as the year that Corbyn-mania swept Worthy Farm. Glastonbury organisers have this year pulled the screening of a documentary about Corbyn following a complaint by a leading Jewish group that the film was antisemitic. \u201cIt\u2019s become clear that it is not appropriate for us to screen it at the festival,\u201d they said in a statement. \u201cGlastonbury is about unity and not division, and we stand against all forms of discrimination.\u201d In 2016, the UK voted to leave the European Union in the wee hours of Friday morning. This year, the festival has expressed its solidarity with the NHS, painting a large display on the field in front of the Pyramid stage. The organisers have also announced that Glastonbury 2023 will be the first entirely run by renewable energy and fuels. Sustainable, renewable, palm oil-free HVO fuel made from waste cooking oil will power all generators across the site. The famous giant fire-belching spider in Arcadia will also run entirely off recycled biofuels. It is the festival\u2019s latest environmental initiative: it banned single-use plastic bottles in 2019. This year, organisers have told festivalgoers not to bring disposable vapes on site, saying \u201cthey pollute the environment and can be hazardous at waste centres\u201d."}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db595", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/20/ashes-2023-first-test-england-and-australia-player-ratings-at-edgbaston", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Ashes 2023 first Test: England and Australia player ratings at Edgbaston | Simon Burnton", "lead": "Joe Root may have excelled for England but Australia\u2019s Usman Khawaja and captain Pat Cummins led the way to victory", "author": "Simon Burnton at Edgbaston", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 18:59:00", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.991571", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/b49208be6d9148d72840e682fecb0bf1c6db7543/0_162_4928_2955/500.jpg", "body": "England Zak Crawley The shot with which he started the match was hardly bettered all game, and was the start of a fine innings. Unlucky to then be batting in those few wild second-innings minutes. 7 Ben Duckett Nicked off twice, to a notably poor shot in the first innings. Never leaving the ball is a jolly jape, but there\u2019s a time and a place ... 5 Ollie Pope Fell to one good delivery and one superb one: a batter can\u2019t really be blamed sometimes. Hours of selfless service at short leg. 6 Joe Root Stumped for the first time in his Test career, but 164 runs for once out, those awe-inspiring reverse scoops and an excellent effort with the ball on the final day made for an outstanding performance. 9 Harry Brook Batted well in both innings, was extraordinarily unlucky with his freak dismissal in the first and fell to an outstanding catch in the second. Moderate numbers, but very promising signs for the series ahead. 8 Ben Stokes The vibes. The declaration. The umbrella fields. Bowling when knackered and still dismissing Khawaja. Take the result out of it, he made this game great. His team did lose, mind. 8 Jonny Bairstow Batted well, in the first innings particularly, but made crucial errors behind the stumps to keep the wicketkeeping debate rumbling. 5 Moeen Ali Ended the match with 37 runs, three wickets and a hole in his finger. His return was not as painful to watch as it was to play but it wasn\u2019t an overwhelming success either. 5 Stuart Broad Has a supernatural ability to manufacture drama, and but for the excess of no-balls both bowling and crowd-rousing have been on point. 8 Ollie Robinson Took key wickets at crucial moments, bowled with great discipline and batted with impressive control (until he biffed one to long-on). 8 Jimmy Anderson The least impressive of England\u2019s three seamers, at times he looked like he was not having much fun. Strangely subdued on Monday evening, but Anderson bowled well on the final day. 6 Australia Usman Khawaja The opener didn\u2019t necessarily get the pulse \u2013 or the scoreboard \u2013 racing but he was almost impeccable with the bat in both innings. 9 David Warner Not a great start to the series for Warner, who was dismissed by Broad for the 15th time in his career in the first innings, but his partnership with Khawaja was the largest in either side\u2019s second knock. 6 Marnus Labuschagne An excellent catch to dismiss Brook in the second innings, but the world\u2019s best Test batter barely contributed with the bat for Australia. 5 Steve Smith Of the matches in which Smith has been dismissed twice, this was his ninth worst in terms of total run contribution (five of the bottom eight were also in England). 5 Travis Head Several fielding errors on the first day made him the target of the Hollies Stand, which he dealt with with humour. Half-century in the first innings. 6 Cameron Green Produced another miracle catch for the highlights reel, but bowled only eight overs and with the bat got two starts without going big. 6 Alex Carey Kept wicket superbly, sometimes standing up to the seamers, and continued his recent good form with the bat. Looks a huge asset to his side. 7 Pat Cummins Some very conservative fields, but bowled superbly in England\u2019s second innings \u2013 that ball to Pope is almost worth a 10 on its own \u2013 and led the way in an incredible run chase. 9 Nathan Lyon A craftsman, Lyon bowled beautifully and handled that late\u2011overs pressure as coolly as he had five days of Edgbaston banter. \u201cTo be honest I absolutely love the crowd,\u201d he said. 8 Scott Boland With just two wickets, Boland did not have the impact anticipated when he was chosen ahead of Mitchell Starc, though he was a fine nightwatchman in the second innings. 5 Josh Hazlewood A low\u2011key performance on his return to the Australia side, taking three wickets and batting only once in the match. 6 \u2022 This article was amended on 21 June 2023.

Capt Jamie Frederick also told reporters at a media briefing that a massive sea and air search that began on Sunday night for the vessel and five men aboard, and which has so far covered 7,600 sq miles of a remote area of the ocean, had \u201cnot yielded any results\u201d. Rescue teams were racing against time to locate the 22ft-long (6.7-metre-long) vessel, which had a 96-hour supply of oxygen when contact was lost on Sunday at one hour and 45 minutes into its descent to the wreck site 12,500ft (3,800 metres) beneath the ocean\u2019s surface, about 370 miles (600km) from the coast of Newfoundland. \u201cWe know from the data that we were using as a starting point, [their available air] was 96 hours. We know at this point we\u2019re approximately about 40, 41 hours,\u201d Frederick said. Aircraft from the US Coast Guard, US navy and Canadian military were scouring the surface by sight and radar, he added, and were able to drop sonar buoys to monitor under water earlier today. \u201cSearch efforts have continued through last night and today. Those search efforts have not yielded any results,\u201d Frederick said, announcing that a \u201cunified command\u201d had been set up between the agencies to coordinate the effort. Private companies have offered vessels with deep ocean capabilities, he said: \u201cThis is a complex search effort, which requires multiple agencies with subject matter expertise and specialized equipment.\u201d On Tuesday morning, military authorities said the search was expanding to under the water, using sonar and other hi-tech equipment, enhancing surface operations that had continued through the night. US Coast Guard C-130 rescue planes joined the air force national guard, Canadian aircraft and vessels, and a research ship belonging to OceanGate Expeditions, the organizers of the dive mission, on Monday in the search for the five crew members aboard the carbon fiber and titanium submersible Titan. They include Hamish Harding, 58, a British explorer and pilot who has previously taken a suborbital spaceflight; British Pakistani businessman Shahzada Dawood, 48; and Dawood\u2019s son Suleman, 19. Also aboard are Paul Henri Nargeolet, a former French navy commander, deep diver and submersible pilot widely considered the leading authority on the Titanic wreck site, and Stockton Rush, the founder of OceanGate, the company confirmed on Tuesday afternoon. On Tuesday morning, Rear Adm John Mauger, commander of the US Coast Guard\u2019s first district, said search crews had flown over an area \u201cabout the size of Connecticut\u201d trying to establish if Titan had surfaced anywhere. \u201cWe have a commercial vessel that\u2019s on scene now, that has remote operated vehicles, that will give us the ability to search under the water as well,\u201d he told ABC News. He said a Canadian aircraft had dropped sonar buoys to listen for the submersible while surface crews were expanding the search area. Also on Tuesday, the New Republic published a report claiming that a former OceanGate employee was fired after raising safety concerns about the submersible, including that it was \u201cnot capable\u201d of descending to the depth of the Titanic wreck. The ex-employee, former marine operations director David Lochridge, was countersued by the company for leaking proprietary information, according to documents seen by the outlet. The case was eventually settled out of court. A veteran Titanic expert who was a member of the 1985 expedition that located the wreck told the Guardian that the deep sea exploration community was \u201cshattered\u201d by the episode. \u201cThis is the day that we have been fearing for a long, long time \u2013 when you lose a sub in really deep water,\u201d said Joe MacInnis, a Canadian adventurer who has made several dives to the wreck. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look good.\u201d A statement sent to the Guardian on OceanGate\u2019s behalf by a crisis communications company on Tuesday said it was \u201cpraying\u201d for the safe return of Titan\u2019s crew and passengers. \u201cOur entire focus is on the wellbeing of the crew and every step possible is being taken to bring the five crew members back safely,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe are deeply grateful for the urgent and extensive assistance we are receiving from multiple government agencies and deep-sea companies as we seek to reestablish contact with the submersible.\u201d Mark Butler, managing director of Harding\u2019s company Action Aviation, told the Associated Press that he remained hopeful. \u201cThere is still plenty of time to facilitate a rescue mission \u2013 there is equipment on board for survival in this event,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re all hoping and praying he comes back safe and sound.\u201d Others were less confident. \u201cI\u2019m not optimistic just because I know the logistics of it. And I know how vast the ocean is, and how very tiny the craft is,\u201d American television writer Mike Reiss, who dived to the Titanic last year, told BBC Breakfast. \u201cIf it\u2019s down at the bottom, I don\u2019t know how anyone\u2019s going to be able to access it, much less bring it back up. There is a hope that it\u2019s at, or near, the surface.\u201d Relatives of Dawood \u2013 a billionaire entrepreneur with a home in Surrey, UK, who is a director for the Prince\u2019s Trust and the Seti Institute, which explores the possibility of extraterrestrial life \u2013 released a statement thanking well-wishers. \u201cWe are very grateful for the concern being shown by our colleagues and friends and would like to request everyone to pray for their safety while granting the family privacy at this time,\u201d it said. \u201cThe family is well looked after and are praying to Allah for the safe return of their family members.\u201d The Dawoods are believed to have paid OceanGate up to $250,000 (\u00a3196,500) each for their places as \u201ccitizen scientists\u201d aboard the submersible. Their dive was scheduled to begin at about 4am local time on Sunday as the first crewed exploration of the company\u2019s two-month expedition to the wreck of the famous ocean liner that sank in 1912 with the loss of more than 1,500 passengers and crew. Harding, who holds a Guinness world record for the longest duration dive at full ocean depth by a crewed vessel \u2013 because of his 2021 dive to the lowest depth of the Mariana Trench with explorer Victor Vescovo \u2013 posted on Instagram at the weekend he was \u201cproud\u201d to join the expedition as a mission specialist. \u201cDue to the worst winter in Newfoundland in 40 years, this mission is likely to be the first and only manned mission to the Titanic in 2023,\u201d he wrote. Action Aviation\u2019s Instagram account posted on Sunday that the submersible\u2019s launch was \u201csuccessful\u201d and that Harding was \u201ccurrently diving\u201d. In a further statement posted on Tuesday morning requesting privacy for his family, the company described Harding as \u201ca living legend\u201d of aviation. \u201c[We] are extremely proud of Hamish and look forward to welcoming him home,\u201d it said. Experts say that even if the vessel is found, retrieving it could prove almost impossible, especially if it has become entangled in the Titanic\u2019s wreckage. Alistair Greig, a professor of marine engineering at University College London, said: \u201cIf it has gone down to the seabed and can\u2019t get back up under its own power, options are very limited. \u201cWhile the submersible might still be intact, if it is beyond the continental shelf [more than 200m] there are very few vessels that can get that deep, and certainly not divers.\u201d Edward Helmore contributed reporting.

The panel found Nicolson had not bullied Dorries, the former culture secretary, when he liked or retweeted dozens of disparaging messages about her after the two clashed during a hearing in front of the culture, media and sport select committee. The independent experts said they had come to their decision in part because Dorries herself has been such a \u201cfrequent and aggressive tweeter\u201d. In a report released on Tuesday, the panel said: \u201cIf the approach of the [standards] commissioner were accepted, then effective opposition would be seriously impeded. Proper vigorous opposition through social media would be swamped by spurious complaints, taking advantage of far too low a bar for bullying and harassment.\u201d The complaint referred to a series of tweets Nicolson sent in the aftermath of her appearance as culture secretary before the select committee in November 2021. In a 24-hour period, Nicolson tweeted, liked and retweeted disparaging material about Dorries, including liking tweets that described her as \u201cgrotesque\u201d, a \u201cvacuous goon\u201d, and as having been \u201cragdolled\u201d by him during the hearing. Dorries did not contact the parliamentary standards commissioner until nearly a year later, when she reported the tweets as harassment and bullying. The panel took note of the fact that Dorries reported the tweets amid a separate row with the committee over whether she made had made false claims about a Channel 4 documentary. The panel\u2019s report reveals that the commissioner, Daniel Greenberg, upheld Dorries\u2019 complaint, before submitting it to the panel to decide Nicolson\u2019s punishment. After the SNP MP appealed, the panel decided to overturn the original ruling. The independent experts said Greenberg had failed to take into account the highly charged nature of the political dispute between the two and Dorries\u2019 own history of aggressive tweeting. It gave one example where Dorries tweeted she would \u201cnail [a journalist\u2019s] balls to the floor using [their] own front teeth\u201d and another where she retweeted someone calling a journalist \u201can apologist for Islamic atrocities\u201d. The report said: \u201cPolitical discourse, and in particular political opposition, can involve behaviour which, in a different context, would be regarded (at least) as offensive or insulting, and sometimes intimidating, without constituting an abuse or misuse of power. Opposition attacks and government counterattacks are commonly of that nature, in the chamber of the House of Commons and beyond.\u201d Dorries has said she will stand down as an MP after she was not included on a list of people to be given peerages as part of Boris Johnson\u2019s resignation honours list. She has blamed Downing Street for not making clear to her that she would have to stand down before being nominated. The former culture secretary responded to the report on Tuesday afternoon via Twitter, saying: \u201cIn any workplace other than parliament where the rule of law, not privilege applies, Nicholson [sic] would have been instantly dismissed.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db598", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/20/china-nationals-expatriate-illegal-stalking-trial", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Three men including ex-NYPD officer convicted of harassing Chinese exile", "lead": "Prosecutors say \u2018Operation Fox Hunt\u2019 is a Beijing effort to pressure Chinese nationals in the US to return home to face charges", "author": "Staff and agencies in New York", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 18:35:23", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.991622", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/8be2bc7d374047bdea827aefc5ec5e6c07cad881/0_145_5351_3213/500.jpg", "body": "A former New York City police sergeant and two Chinese citizens living in the US have been convicted of various charges in a trial showcasing Chinese efforts to pressure expatriates into returning home, part of a program called \u201cOperation Fox Hunt\u201d. Michael McMahon, who now works as a private investigator, Zheng Congying and Zhu Yong were accused of taking part in scare tactics aimed at a former Chinese official. Zhu was convicted of acting as an illegal foreign agent, stalking, interstate stalking conspiracy and conspiring to act as an illegal foreign agent. Zheng was convicted of stalking and stalking conspiracy but acquitted of the other charges. McMahon was convicted of all except conspiracy to act as a foreign agent. The Brooklyn federal court trial which concluded on Tuesday was the first to emerge from a spate of US prosecutions scrutinizing Operation Fox Hunt, a nearly decade-old initiative that Beijing characterizes as a pursuit of fugitives from justice. US authorities view it, at least sometimes, as an exercise in \u201ctransnational repression\u201d, or deploying government operatives to harass, threaten and silence critics living abroad. China has denied trying to force repatriations through intimidation and says the US is maligning an effort to fight crime. Prosecutors say pressure from Beijing was brought to bear in suburban New Jersey, where former Wuhan city official Xu Jin and his family moved in 2010. China has accused him and wife, Liu Fang, of taking bribes; they deny it and say they were targeted because he got crosswise with China\u2019s communist power structure. According to prosecutors, Zhu, Zheng and McMahon took part in a years-long effort to goad Xu into going back to China. The defense acknowledged that Zhu, Zheng and McMahon took various actions but said the three had no idea that Beijing was allegedly behind it all. McMahon said he was \u201cdevastated by the verdict\u201d, insisting that all he had done was his job as a private investigator. \u201cIf I had known for one second that they were a foreign country, a foreign government, hiring me, I would never have worked the case. I would have notified the FBI,\u201d McMahon said. His lawyer, Lawrence Lustberg, said he would challenge the conviction and was confident that \u201cthis injustice will not survive the scrutiny that the legal system will give it\u201d. Zheng and Zhu left court without speaking to reporters. Messages seeking comment were sent to their attorneys. McMahon conducted surveillance and data searches to smoke out Xu\u2019s carefully guarded address and information about his loved ones. Zhu, a retiree who also goes by Jason Zhu and Yong Zhu, helped hire McMahon and equip him with details to get started. Zheng later went to Xu\u2019s home and left an ominous note: \u201cIf you are willing to go back to the mainland and spend 10 years in prison, your wife and children will be all right. That\u2019s the end of this matter!\u201d \u201cBefore I saw this, I felt that the threats from the Chinese Communist party was only a mental threat to me. However, when I saw that note, I realized that it had become a physical threat,\u201d Xu testified, through a court interpreter. The defense said McMahon, Zheng and Zhu were told they were helping to collect a debt or achieve some other end for a company or individuals \u2013 not for China. \u201cThey were used, cheated, misguided by a foreign government to work for them,\u201d Zhu\u2019s attorney, Kevin Tung, said in a closing argument. But assistant US attorney Craig Heeren said the three \u201cagreed to participate in something that went way, way over the line \u2026 a line that all three defendants knew they were crossing\u201d."}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db599", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/20/england-australia-ashes-first-test-day-five-match-report-cricket", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Australia hold off late England charge to win first Ashes Test in thrilling finale", "lead": "Pat Cummins and Nathan Lyon dug in at the last to secure a two-wicket victory for Australia in a thriller at Edgbaston", "author": "Ali Martin at Edgbaston", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 18:23:39", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.991639", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/19aad83d6d05bd141846064e8811da6957a56e89/0_168_4000_2400/500.jpg", "body": "At the end of a final day packed with pressure and palpitations it was Australia who emerged victorious. The old fable of the tortoise and the hare just about held firm as they chased down 281 to beat England by two wickets and secure a 1-0 lead in this red-hot Ashes series. Those numbers tell little of the drama. This was a famous victory for Pat Cummins and his world champions, the captain the hero when at 7.21pm and with four overs left \u2013 ice in his veins and a gutsy sidekick in Nathan Lyon \u2013 a guide to third man off Ollie Robinson was fumbled over the rope by Harry Brook. Reaching 282 for eight from 92.3 overs, it completed an epic chase that left nerves utterly shredded. Cummins and Lyon had come together an hour earlier with England in the ascendancy and Ben Stokes, a constant source of energy for his side, eyeing up his 12th win as captain. Joe Root had somehow clung on to a bullet return catch off Alex Carey\u2019s bat that left Australia 227 for eight, 54 runs short of their goal. Edgbaston was in full voice at this stage, the Hollies Stand goading the tourists and their pockets of supporters with the kind of triumphalism that was positively ripe to turn red-faced. Not that the conclusion was sour. Far from it. This fifth sellout crowd left with memories galore and a final twist to digest as over the course of 11 gripping overs under lights Cummins and Lyon repelled the second new ball and worked the gaps like a couple of pros. They sealed their country\u2019s highest successful run chase since Cummins struck the winning blow of 310-run target in Johannesburg on his debut 12 years ago. Fifty caps later, the blue-eyed Blue Mountains boy has done it again. The coup de grace this time was unreflective of a fielding display from England that was tigerish throughout; a contributing factor to the pressure cooker the ground had become. Once the valve was released with Brook\u2019s fumble, Cummins enveloped Lyon in an almighty bear hug, the pair 44 and 16 not out respectively and the toast of an away dressing room that was bouncing. The two teams soon shared smiles and handshakes, all combatants seeing the bigger picture of this classic Test finish. Among them was Usman Khawaja, no doubt keen to raise a glass of ice-cold diet Coke to his lips once more. The opener was named player of the match, having followed his first innings 141 with a similarly adhesive 65 that kept Australia in the hunt. The 36-year-old, riding what has become a remarkable late crest in his career, batted on all five days, faced 518 balls and spent 796 minutes out in the middle. All in a thick cable-knit tank top. On another day Khawaja\u2019s demise might have been the moment that commanded the headlines. At 5.29pm, short of options before the second new ball\u2019s arrival, Stokes brought himself on to bowl for the first time in the innings. Charging to the crease in defiance of that left knee injury, he sent down a smart slower ball that cannoned into the stumps off the inside edge. With Australia 209 for seven it appeared another case of Stokes bending the script to his will. But that wickets column was deceptive all day, Australia\u2019s deployment of a nightwatchman the previous evening \u2013 Scott Boland \u2013 creating the illusion. At 2.15pm, after morning rain, Boland had walked out alongside Khawaja, with the score 107 for three and needing 174 runs in 67 overs. It soon became clear Australia would be putting their supporters back home into a state of sleep-deprived delirium. In the first hour 21 runs were chiselled off the target \u2013 a mere 13 from the bat \u2013 and Stuart Broad removing Boland for his third wicket of the innings. When Moeen Ali was thrown the ball in the 15th over of this opening session, removing the typically aggressive Travis Head for 16 with a ball that gripped and found the left-hander\u2019s edge, Australia\u2019s 143 for five did not quite reflect the depth to come. It was a fine delivery in an otherwise forlorn showing from Moeen, that burst blister on his spinning finger leaving him a passenger in the main. Had the skin on that digit been hard and durable from regular first\u2011class cricket, not red and raw after a 33-over first innings straight out of Test retirement, Stokes would have been able to turn to a spinner with the best fourth\u2011innings strike-rate of any to claim more than 50 wickets. This England team do not appear to do regrets, so to claim they will rue the SOS to Moeen would be false. Similarly, come the second Test at Lord\u2019s next Wednesday they will not be turning back on the decision to restore Jonny Bairstow behind the stumps, even if three missed chances in Australia\u2019s first innings \u2013 and an edge off Khawaja that flew between keeper and first slip late on day four \u2013 proved costly. That day one declaration? All part of the entertainment, said an unrepentant Stokes. This final day certainly had it in spades, be it Robinson\u2019s dramatic removal of Cameron Green for 28, bowled off the inside edge, the tension that built as Australia declined to take on Root\u2019s bowling or the spectacular one\u2011handed effort from Stokes in the deep off Lyon that popped out of his grasp. With 36 runs to get at that stage, and Josh Hazlewood next man in at No 11, it would have been telling. As it was, England met an Australian team prepared to meet fire with ice and a captain embodying this in Cummins. The tourists scored at 3.2 runs per over to the home side\u2019s 4.61 and you have to go back to 1904, when England (2.30) beat Australia (3.81) at Melbourne, for the only time the difference was greater. The tortoises lead 1-0 and this culture clash Ashes series is off to an incredible start."}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db59a", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/20/new-zealand-fa-fifa-walk-off-alleged-racism-qatar", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "New Zealand FA urges Fifa to do more after walk-off against Qatar over alleged racism", "lead": "New Zealand Football has said it will contact Fifa after the men\u2019s national team abandoned a friendly against Qatar in protest at an alleged racist slur", "author": "Michael Butler", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 18:18:56", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.991656", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/f8dbfce289d62407ef6c22160b72517703b38b68/789_161_1565_939/500.jpg", "body": "New Zealand Football have challenged Fifa to do more to tackle racism after the men\u2019s national team abandoned Monday\u2019s friendly with Qatar in protest at \u201csignificant racist abuse\u201d directed at one of their players going unpunished by the officials. The alleged incident comes after comments last week from Gianni Infantino that there should be \u201czero tolerance\u201d for racism, with the Fifa president insisting that Fifa matches should be halted by referees if there is any discrimination. Yusuf Abdurisag Yusuf, the Qatari player accused of making the alleged racial slur towards New Zealand\u2019s Michael Boxall, has denied using any racial or discriminatory language and claimed that he himself was racially abused. Yusuf clashed with Boxall, who is of Samoan heritage, just before half-time and despite an allegation of racism against the Qatari player being reported to Austrian referee Manuel Sch\u00fcttengruber at the break, no action was taken, prompting the New Zealand squad to make the collective decision to not retake the field for the second half, a decision supported by New Zealand Football (NZF). \u201cWe never want to see a match abandoned but some issues are bigger than football and it is important to make a stand,\u201d NZF\u2019s chief executive Andrew Pragnell said in a statement. \u201cI think when someone receives significant racial abuse, multiple people hear it, there\u2019s multiple witnesses to something like that and nothing can be done then we\u2019ve got a bigger problem and maybe it\u2019s time we look at the rules,\u201d he said.

In the contrary, Yusuf stressed that, in fact, he himself was racially abused during the match.\u201d Qatari FA\u2019s president, Jassim bin Rashid Al Buenain, also released a statement of support, \u201cstrongly condemning\u201d the \u201cunwarranted attention [Yusuf] has received\u201d.

The match was also abandoned before full-time. Kuwait\u2019s FA disputed the FAI\u2019s description of events and said the referee stopped the match because of \u201croughness and tension\u201d between the players. \u201cKuwait Football Association ... categorically rejects such accusations,\u201d it said on social media. \u201cThe match was stopped by the referee in the 70th minute to protect the players from potential injuries.\u201d Speaking at an event last week with Real Madrid\u2019s Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior \u2013 who received racial abuse in a La Liga match at Valencia last month \u2013 Infantino insisted that Fifa matches should be halted if there is any discrimination. \u201cThere is no football if there is racism! So let\u2019s stop the games,\u201d Infantino said. \u201cThe referees have this opportunity in Fifa competitions as we have this process for stopping the game, and actions have to be taken at every level, at national level as well.\u201d Last week it was also announced that Fifa would set up a task force to tackle racism, with Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior taking a prominent role.

The price point is now frequently the joint second-most popular price tag for a grocery item, alongside \u00a32 and behind \u00a31, according to the data firm Kantar. Supermarkets typically use \u201cround-pound\u201d deals to sell budget items, but have been forced to raise prices. Grocery inflation has eased to its lowest level this year but remains high, Kantar said on Tuesday. Annual grocery inflation in the UK declined to 16.5% in the four weeks to 11 June, down from 17.2% last month and a record 17.5% in March. It remains at its sixth-highest level since the financial crisis in 2008. The biggest price rises were for eggs, cooking sauces and frozen potato products. Fraser McKevitt, the head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, said: \u201cTraditionally, \u2018round-pound\u2019 prices have been attractive to shoppers, who find them easier to relate to and practical as well with no leftover change. \u201cBut, with retailers eager to offer value and cash buying less popular, \u00a31.25 has emerged as an increasingly important price point.\u201d The Kantar figures were released a day before the official UK data on inflation, which is expected to ease to 8.4% in May from 8.7% in April, when food and drink prices rose at an annual rate of 19.1%. Rishi Sunak\u2019s pledge to halve inflation this year is at risk from stubbornly high food inflation, which has kept the headline rate at a higher than expected level. McKevitt said: \u201cThis is the lowest rate of grocery price inflation we\u2019ve seen in 2023, which will be a relief to shoppers and retailers. \u201cBut prices rising at 16.5% isn\u2019t something to celebrate\u2026 Price rises are now being compared to the increasing rate of grocery inflation seen last summer, which means that it should continue to fall in the coming months, a welcome result for everyone.\u201d A survey for Kantar found that of consumers\u2019 top five financial worries, rising grocery prices is the only one that they are more concerned about now than at the start of the year. Almost 70% of households are either \u201cextremely\u201d or \u201cvery worried\u201d about food and drink inflation, compared with just over two-thirds in January. It remains the second-biggest concern behind rising energy bills. Consumers have been switching to supermarkets\u2019 cheaper own-label lines to save money, where sales are up 41% compared with last year, and changing how they eat and cook, Kantar said. McKevitt added: \u201cPeople are thinking more and more about what they eat and how they cook as the cost of living crisis takes its toll on traditional behaviours. \u201cThe most prominent change we\u2019ve seen is that people are preparing simpler dishes with fewer ingredients.\u201d There were 4% fewer meals made using an oven in the last 12 weeks compared with the same period last year, while microwaved meals rose by 8%, and there was a rise in food prepared with toasters and grills. Sue Davies, the head of food policy at the consumer group Which?, said high prices have been \u201chammering the household budgets of millions, including desperate families and people on low incomes who have been skipping meals for many months to make ends meet\u201d. She called on the government to get urgent commitments from supermarkets on stocking essential budget ranges in all their stores, particularly in areas where people are most in need, as well as make pricing much clearer so shoppers can compare prices and find the best value products. As costs for producers and retailers have risen, the proportion of products sold for \u00a31 has almost halved in a year, from 9% to 5%, according to Kantar. With the advent of warm weather, consumers have been buying more ice-cream and mineral water, with sales up by 25% and 8% respectively last month, despite price increases of 20% and 17%. Barbecue food has also gone up in price, with fresh sausage prices up 16% and fresh burgers 13% more expensive. Aldi was the fastest-growing retailer in the past four months as people turned to the discount supermarkets in an attempt to conserve cash.

The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has unveiled an aid package for Ukraine worth \u20ac50bn (\u00a343bn), Reuters reports. The sum comes after a review of the EU\u2019s 2021-27 budget and before an international conference in London this week aimed at raising more funds to rebuild Ukraine from its war with Russia. Ukraine claims to have shot down 32 of 35 \u201cShahad\u201d drones launched in an overnight attack mostly directed at Kyiv. Suspilne reports that in Kyiv, non-residential structures and several private houses were damaged by debris, and agricultural property and equipment were damaged in Zaporizhzhia after Russia launched seven S-300 missiles at the Ukraine-controlled portion of the region. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy\u2019s office said drones attacked the Kyiv region in several waves, with the air alert lasting for more than four hours. Several commercial and administrative buildings and some private houses were damaged, it said. The energy ministry said debris from falling drones damaged electricity lines in the Kyiv region and also in the Mykolaiv region in the south, cutting off electricity for hundreds of residents. Kyiv has repatriated three Ukrainian prisoners of war from Hungary after a group of PoWs was transferred there from Russia without coordination with Kyiv, the foreign ministry said on Tuesday according to Reuters. Hungary, which under its prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n has forged strong political and economic ties with Moscow, said on 9 June that Budapest had received a group of 11 Ukrainian prisoners of war from Russia. \u201cThe embassy of Ukraine in Budapest managed to bring back three Ukrainian prisoners of war from Hungary,\u201d Ukraine\u2019s foreign ministry spokesperson Oleg Nikolenko wrote on his Facebook page. Nikolenko said they were already back on Ukrainian soil and were receiving the support they needed. He said Ukrainian diplomats and other relevant Ukrainian authorities were working to try to bring back the remaining prisoners of war. Prosecutors served a notice of suspicion to the head of Kyiv\u2019s municipal department for security on Tuesday after three people died in a Russian air attack when they were unable to get into a bomb shelter, the prosecutor\u2019s office said according to Reuters. The deaths of the people on 1 June after they rushed to an air raid shelter that failed to open caused a public outrage and prompted the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to vow a harsh response. The prosecutor\u2019s office said the suspect was accused of improperly performing their official duties and that a lack of control over the maintenance and readiness of city bomb shelters led to the deaths and injuries of people. Kyiv\u2019s prosecutor\u2019s office did not name the suspect, but the capital\u2019s city council identified him as Roman Tkachuk and said the municipal security department was cooperating and providing access to available documentation. The destruction of the vast Kakhovka hydroelectric dam has caused \u20ac1.2bn (\u00a31.02bn) of damage, Ukraine\u2019s environment minister said on Tuesday according to Reuters, warning that mines unearthed by flooding could wash onto other European countries\u2019 shores. The collapse of the Russian-held dam on 6 June unleashed flood waters across southern Ukraine and Russian-occupied areas of the Kherson region, killing more than 50 people and destroying homes and farmland. Speaking by video link to a meeting of European Union countries\u2019 environment ministers, the Ukrainian environment minister Ruslan Strilets said assessments of the damage was ongoing but the dam collapse was already the largest environmental disaster since Russia\u2019s February 2022 invasion. \u201cThere are things that we can never restore. These are the ecosystems that were washed away into the Black Sea. This includes 20,000 animals that probably died, including endemic species that were only found in southern Ukraine,\u201d he said. The World Bank is looking to enhance aid to Ukraine for urgent repair projects in the transport, energy and housing sectors, the bank\u2019s director for operations, Anna Bjerde, said on Tuesday ahead of the Ukraine Recovery conference in London. The Washington-based lender has disbursed more than $21bn (\u00a318.5bn) to Ukraine, mainly via grants, since the war started in February 2022, focused on government expenditure. \u201cThe budget support will continue, but now there is a comprehensive pivot to the country\u2019s recovery,\u201d Bjerde said. The Ukraine Recovery conference on 21-22 June will focus on building international support for Ukraine\u2019s recovery from war, and how the private sector can help with the reconstruction. One person has been killed and seven injured while they were clearing mud in the flooded area of Kherson, Ukrainian officials have reported. The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has unveiled an aid package for Ukraine worth \u20ac50bn (\u00a343bn), Reuters reports. The sum comes after a review of the EU\u2019s 2021-27 budget and before an international conference in London this week aimed at raising more funds to rebuild Ukraine from its war with Russia. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said he had called on China to use its influence over Russia more in regards to the war in Ukraine, Reuters reports. Speaking alongside China\u2019s premier, Li Qiang, after bilateral talks in the German capital, Scholz also said China should not supply weapons to Russia and that the war in Ukraine should not become a frozen conflict. The Ukrainian kickboxing champion Maksym Bordus has been killed fighting Russian forces, a website that lists athletes killed in the war said on Tuesday. Bordus was killed on 11 June in \u201cfierce fighting against Russian invaders\u201d, according to Sport Angels, a Ukrainian website set up with the assistance of the sports committee that brings together NGOs and federations from non-Olympic sports, Reuters reports. The companies behind the Telegram and Viber messaging apps were fined by a Moscow court on Tuesday for failing to delete what Russia deems illegal content, Interfax news agency said, including about the war in Ukraine, Reuters reports. The Ukrainian kickboxing champion Maksym Bordus has been killed fighting Russian forces, a website that lists athletes killed in the war said on Tuesday. Bordus was killed on 11 June in \u201cfierce fighting against Russian invaders\u201d, according to Sport Angels, a Ukrainian website set up with the assistance of the sports committee that brings together NGOs and federations from non-Olympic sports, Reuters reports. \u201cEvery day he brought Ukraine\u2019s victory closer with a weapon in his hands, but he himself will not see it,\u201d it wrote under a photograph of Bordus posing with several medals. A petition was posted on President Volodymyr Zelenskiy\u2019s website calling for Bordus to be posthumously awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine. Sport Angels said he had won dozens of tournaments and was the World Association of Kickboxing (Wako) champion of Ukraine. European Union member states plan to train as many as 30,000 members of Ukraine\u2019s armed forces this year, including from territorial defence units, Kyiv said on Tuesday, according to AFP. \u201cIn 2023, the EU Military Assistance Mission for Ukraine plans to train 30,000 Ukrainian armed forces personnel, including soldiers of the territorial defence forces,\u201d the defence ministry in Kyiv said. The statement follows a pledge from EU officials in February this year that it would train 30,000 Ukrainian troops, building on an initial target of 15,000 personnel. The announcement came as Brussels asked EU member states to back a \u20ac50bn (\u00a343bn) package to support Ukraine over the next four years. Our Brussels correspondent, Lisa O\u2019Carroll, reports on the latest financial developments at the EU regarding Ukraine: The European Union is proposing to create a \u20ac50bn (\u00a342bn/$54.5bn) financial reserve for the next four years. It took the unusual step of ringfencing potential funds after a review of the bloc\u2019s 2021-27 budget. Since the outbreak of war it has diverted \u20ac30bn cash from other funding streams to respond to the crisis. The European Commission chief, Ursula von der Leyen, said it would be made up of loans and grants and would give Ukraine \u201cpredictability\u201d and \u201cincentivise other donors to step up too\u201d. The announcement was made on the eve of a major conference in London on the reconstruction of Ukraine. World leaders, banks and private interests will attend with a view to forging an early framework for the construction, restoration of community infrastructures and to put in place mental health programmes for generations to come. At a conference in Brussels, Peter Klanso, a director Danish Red Cross, said an estimated 9 million people were already impacted by the war, both civilians and soldiers. The Ukrainian ambassador to the EU, Vsevolod Chentsov, said it was vital that Ukraine and Ukrainian people remained in control of the conversations about the future of the country. The World Bank has estimated it will cost at least \u20ac411bn (\u00a3352bn/$448bn) to rebuild the country devastated by war. Here are some of the latest images sent to us over the news wires from Ukraine and around the world. The United States is not promoting a particular candidate to lead Nato, the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said on Tuesday when asked about the leadership of the transatlantic military alliance. \u201cWe\u2019re not pushing, promoting any particular candidate. We\u2019re in very close consultation with our allies and partners to determine where we want to go with Nato and its leadership,\u201d Blinken told reporters in a press conference alongside the British foreign secretary, James Cleverly, in London. The British defence minister, Ben Wallace, has said he would like to be Nato\u2019s next secretary general, however behind the scenes it is believed that France\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron, thinks the head of Nato must be from an EU member state. One person has been killed and seven injured while they were clearing mud in the flooded area of Kherson, Ukrainian officials have reported. Andriy Yermak, the head of the office of the Ukrainian presidency, posted to Telegram to say: The Russian army fired at rescue workers in Kherson who were clearing mud. As a result of the shelling, one employee of the state emergency service was killed, and seven more employees were injured. Six are in serious condition. The claims have not been independently verified. Ukraine\u2019s intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, has reportedly been seen for the first time since numerous Russian theories emerged about his death or injury. In what appeared to be recent pictures, Budanov was seen with Japan\u2019s ambassador to Ukraine, Matsuda Kuninori. Budanov and Ukraine\u2019s top commander, Valery Zaluzhny, had been the subject of rumours by Russian figures, after having not been seen for some time. Zaluzhny was seen in a video, released by the General Staff late on Monday, which showed the commander-in-chief sporting a badge of Grogu, the pale green, pointy-eared hero best known as \u201cBaby Yoda\u201d from the hit Disney Star Wars TV show The Mandalorian. A Russian soldier who destroyed a German Leopard tank in a battle in Ukraine has been given a 1m rouble (\u00a39,282) reward by a private foundation, Russia\u2019s defence ministry said on Tuesday, according to Reuters. On Friday it was reported that the defence ministry had said Russian troops who had destroyed German-made Leopard tanks and US-supplied armoured vehicles being used by Ukraine would receive bonus payments. The ministry said this was part of a wider reward scheme under which more than 10,000 Russian servicemen had received individual bonuses since the start of the war, nearly 16 months ago. On the basis of reports from Russian field commanders, \u201cpayments are currently being made to servicemen of the Russian Federation armed forces who in the course of military operations destroyed Leopard tanks, as well as armoured fighting vehicles made in the USA and other Nato countries\u201d, the ministry said. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said he had called on China to use its influence over Russia more in regards to the war in Ukraine, Reuters reports. Speaking alongside China\u2019s premier, Li Qiang, after bilateral talks in the German capital, Scholz also said China should not supply weapons to Russia and that the war in Ukraine should not become a frozen conflict. Scholz also said he told Li in talks in Berlin that Germany did not want to decouple from China but to diversify trade in a bid for more balanced relationships all round. Speaking at a joint news conference, Scholz said he had told Li that German companies still faced challenges in accessing the Chinese market and unfair business conditions. The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has unveiled an aid package for Ukraine worth \u20ac50bn (\u00a343bn), Reuters reports. The sum comes after a review of the EU\u2019s 2021-27 budget and before an international conference in London this week aimed at raising more funds to rebuild Ukraine from its war with Russia. The \u20ac50bn budget reserve would provide perspective and reliability to the bloc\u2019s Ukrainian partners, Von der Leyen said in remarks to journalists after an EU commission meeting in Brussels. \u201cThis financial reserve will allow us really to calibrate our financial support according to the evolution of the situation on the ground,\u201d Von der Leyen said according to Agence France-Presse news agency. Trade, climate change and the war in Ukraine are on the agenda Tuesday as the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, meets the Chinese premier, Li Qiang, who is on his first foreign trip since taking office. The Associated Press news agency reports Germany is keen to maintain good ties with China, its biggest trading partner, despite wariness over Beijing\u2019s growing assertiveness and refusal to criticise the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Germany\u2019s recently published national security strategy describes China as \u201ca partner, competitor and systemic rival\u201d. The meeting in Berlin is the seventh time Germany and China have held high-level government consultations. It comes a day after the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, met the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, indicating an effort by Beijing to reach out to the west and improve frosty relations. Li, a former Communist party secretary for Shanghai who took office in March as China\u2019s No 2 official, met the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, on Monday and had dinner with Scholz at the Chancellery before the start of formal talks. Russia sees scant chance of peace talks with Ukraine due to Kyiv\u2019s stance on the issue despite constructive efforts by an African peace mission, the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said on Tuesday, according to Reuters. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, had held \u201cvery productive\u201d talks with African leaders on Saturday and remained open to dialogue and contacts on Ukraine, said Peskov. But he told reporters that what he called the history of Kyiv\u2019s position meant \u201cone can hardly talk about stable grounds\u201d for peace negotiations. The companies behind the Telegram and Viber messaging apps were fined by a Moscow court on Tuesday for failing to delete what Russia deems illegal content, Interfax news agency said, including about the war in Ukraine, Reuters reports. Dubai-based Telegram was ordered to pay 4 million roubles ($47,525), Interfax said, and the Japanese company behind Viber was fined 1 million roubles. Telegram, founded by Russian-born brothers Pavel and Nikolai Durov in 2013, is hugely popular in Russia where it is used on a daily basis by the Kremlin and defence ministry as well as by journalists, opposition figures, rights groups and millions of ordinary people. TASS news agency said the fine against Telegram was for refusing to remove 32 channels publishing false information about what Russia calls its \u201cspecial military operation\u201d in Ukraine. Russia has tightened controls over the coverage of the conflict by media and bloggers, introducing tougher punishments after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year for \u201cdiscrediting\u201d the actions of its armed forces or publishing false information about them. Ukraine claims to have shot down 32 of 35 \u201cShahad\u201d drones launched in an overnight attack mostly directed at Kyiv. Suspilne reports that in Kyiv non-residential structures and several private houses were damaged by debris, and agricultural property and equipment were damaged in Zaporizhzhia after Russia launched seven S-300 missiles at the Ukraine-controlled portion of the region. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy\u2019s office said drones attacked the Kyiv region in several waves, with the air alert lasting for over four hours. Several commercial and administrative buildings and some private houses were damaged, it said. The energy ministry said debris from falling drones damaged electricity lines in the Kyiv region and also in the Mykolaiv region in the south, cutting off electricity for hundreds of residents. Air force spokesperson Yuriy Ihnat said in a radio interview that it was simply not possible for air defence systems to cover all of a country as large as Ukraine. An unspecified critical infrastructure facility was hit in Lviv, which is about 70 km (43 miles) from the border with Nato member Poland. As a consequence some tram routes were altered during the morning rush hour, officials said. \u201cThey hit a critically important facility. There were three hits,\u201d said regional governor Maksym Kozytskiy. Russia\u2019s defence minister has threatened \u201cimmediate strikes on decision-making centres\u201d in Ukraine if western-supplied long-range weapons are used to strike at Crimea. The ministry of defence statement from Sergei Shoigu said an attack on Crimea with Himars and Storm Shadow missiles would constitute an attack \u201coutside the zone of the special military operation\u201d and would mean \u201cthe full involvement of the United States and Great Britain in the conflict\u201d. Russia illegally seized the peninsula from Ukraine in 2014. Ukraine is in negotiations with western arms manufacturers to boost production of weapons, including drones, and could sign contracts in coming months, a Ukrainian minister told Reuters. Sergiy Boyev, the deputy minister for Strategic Industries in Ukraine, said Kyiv was in talks with manufacturers from Germany, Italy, France and eastern Europe about them producing weapons in Ukraine. Ukraine\u2019s ministry of the interior has stated that four settlements and 818 houses remain flooded on the right bank of the Dnipro in Kherson. Authorities in Mykolaiv reported some flooding remains in their region too. One person has been killed in Kherson this morning as a result of Russian attacks. Russia has issued an appeal for staff at Ukrainian embassies around the world to defect to Moscow. In a statement, Russia\u2019s Foreign Intelligence Service said \u201cWe appeal to the employees of Ukrainian diplomatic missions and representative offices of state bodies abroad. If you feel responsible for the fate of your Motherland, ensuring peace and stability in Europe and are under pressure from the criminal Kyiv regime leading Ukraine to a national catastrophe, come to Moscow, where you and your loved ones will be guaranteed safety.\u201d Russian state-owned media reports that Ukraine struck the occupied settlement of Nova Kakhovka with \u201ckamikaze\u201d drones, injuring three people. Russia\u2019s security forces, the FSB, have claimed to have detained a Ukrainian national in the Kabardino-Balkaria region on suspicion of espionage. Heavy casualties are being endured by both Ukrainian and Russian forces, British military intelligence has said, two weeks into the Ukrainian counteroffensive. The level of losses among Russian troops was said by British officials to be at its highest level since the peak of March\u2019s battle for Bakhmut in the Donetsk region, with Ukraine claiming to have killed or injured 4,600 soldiers. Ukrainian deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said Monday Ukraine must prepare itself for a \u201ctough duel\u201d but that \u201cthe biggest blow is yet to come\u201d. Separately she said that Russia had concentrated a significant number of units in the east, including air assault troops, but that Ukrainian forces were preventing their advance. She described the situation in the east of the country as \u201cdifficult\u201d. Russia\u2019s defence minister has threatened \u201cimmediate strikes on decision-making centres\u201d in Ukraine if western-supplied long-range weapons are used to strike at Crimea. Russia illegally seized the peninsula from Ukraine in 2014. The ministry of defence statement from Sergei Shoigu says an attack on Crimea with Himars and Storm Shadow missiles would constitute an attack \u201coutside the zone of the special military operation\u201d and would mean \u201cthe full involvement of the United States and Great Britain in the conflict\u201d. In the statement, Shoigu said: According to our information, the leadership of the armed forces of Ukraine plans to strike at the territory of the Russian Federation, including Crimea, with Himars and Storm Shadow missiles. The use of these missiles outside the zone of the special military operation will mean the full involvement of the United States and Great Britain in the conflict and will entail immediate strikes on decision-making centres on the territory of Ukraine. Shoigu also claimed that Russia has repulsed over 200 attacks from Ukraine in recent weeks. He said: Since 4 June, the armed forces of Ukraine have launched 263 attacks on the positions of Russian troops. Thanks to the competent and selfless actions of our units, all of them were repulsed, the enemy did not achieve his goals. Ukraine claims to have retaken at least eight settlements during that period of time, and advanced the front in Zaporizhzhia region by several kilometres. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, is reporting that one person has been killed in Kherson this morning as a result of Russian attacks. It cited the head of the regional authority, Oleksandr Prokudin. It posted to its Telegram news channel for the region: Russian troops attacked Kherson in the morning. A 27-year-old man died. Houses, a kindergarten, a school and a service station were hit by Russian shells, as was a team of doctors who went to help the Kherson people. The doctors were not injured. The claims have not been independently verified. Reuters is carrying some more comment from Ukrainian sources about the overnight Russian drone attacks on the country. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy\u2019s office said drones attacked the Kyiv region in several waves, with the air alert lasting for over four hours. Several commercial and administrative buildings and some private houses were damaged, it said. The energy ministry said debris from falling drones damaged electricity lines in the Kyiv region and also in the Mykolaiv region in the south, cutting off electricity for hundreds of residents. Air force spokesperson Yuriy Ihnat said in a radio interview that it was simply not possible for air defence systems to cover all of a country as large as Ukraine. Ukraine is in negotiations with western arms manufacturers to boost production of weapons, including drones, and could sign contracts in coming months, a Ukrainian minister told Reuters. Sergiy Boyev, the deputy minister for Strategic Industries in Ukraine, said Kyiv was in talks with manufacturers from Germany, Italy, France and eastern Europe about them producing weapons in Ukraine. \u201cWe are in very detailed discussions with them. And we are certain that we will have the contracts agreements signed within the next few months,\u201d Boyev told Reuters on the sidelines of the Paris airshow. Russia has issued an appeal for staff at Ukrainian embassies around the world to defect to Moscow. In a statement, Russia\u2019s Foreign Intelligence Service said: We appeal to the employees of Ukrainian diplomatic missions and representative offices of state bodies abroad. If you feel responsible for the fate of your Motherland, ensuring peace and stability in Europe and are under pressure from the criminal Kyiv regime leading Ukraine to a national catastrophe, come to Moscow, where you and your loved ones will be guaranteed safety. State-owned news agency Tass quotes director of the service, Sergey Naryshkin, saying \u201cthe consequences of the steady degradation of the internal political and socio-economic situation in Ukraine, as well as the repressive methods of managing the state apparatus implemented by the Kyiv regime, are increasingly affecting the personnel of Ukrainian missions abroad.\u201d The service claims that \u201cLarge-scale purges are being carried out in the foreign establishments of Ukraine, aimed at identifying employees disloyal to Kyiv and ensuring their early return to their homeland.\u201d Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February last year. Finland\u2019s newly elected parliament on Tuesday voted in favour of National Coalition Party leader Petteri Orpo to become prime minister, as widely expected, ushering in a right-wing government and ending Social Democrat Sanna Marin\u2019s rule, Reuters reports. Finland formally joined Nato in April, having applied to become a member of the alliance after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Finland shares as 1,340km (832 mile) border with Russia, the longest of any EU member. This image sent to us over the news wires shows smoke rising over the western Ukrainian city of Lviv. An unspecified critical infrastructure facility was hit in the city, which is about 70 km (43 miles) from the border with Nato member Poland. As a consequence some tram routes were altered during the morning rush hour, officials said. \u201cThey hit a critically important facility. There were three hits,\u201d Reuters reports regional governor Maksym Kozytskiy said. There has been some comment on social media, including from Ukrainian MP Inna Sovsun, about the appearance of Ukrainian commander-in-chief Valerii Zaluzhnyi wearing a baby Yoda insignia from the Star Wars series The Mandalorian. Ukrainian forces on Tuesday struck the Russian-occupied town of Nova Kakhovka in the southern Kherson region with drones and three civilians were wounded, the Tass news agency reported, citing the local Russian-imposed authorities. Reuters reports that the authorities claim \u201ckamikaze\u201d drones were used. Ukraine\u2019s ministry of the interior has stated that four settlements and 818 houses remain flooded on the right bank of the Dnipro in Kherson. Russia\u2019s state-owned news agency Tass reports that security forces have detained a Ukrainian national in the Kabardino-Balkaria region on suspicion of espionage. It quotes the FSB saying: In the city of Nalchik, Kabardino-Balkar Republic, [the FSB] stopped the illegal activities of a 44-year-old citizen of Ukraine suspected of espionage. It was established that the detainee, acting on the instructions of the security service of Ukraine, collected and handed over military information to a foreign intelligence officer. The investigation continues. If found guilty, espionage charges carry a term of between ten and 20 years in jail in Russia. Here is an overnight summary of developments in Ukraine as reported by Suspilne on its official Telegram channel: At night, the Russian Federation released 35 \u201cShahed\u201d attack drones over Ukraine \u2013 32 of them were shot down. Anti-aircraft defence operated in most regions, but the main direction of the attack was Kyiv region. In the Kyiv region non-residential structures and several private houses were damaged by debris. There were no casualties or injuries. In Lviv, there were three hits on a critically important object. There was a fire. People were not injured. Due to shelling, the routes of three trams in the city were changed. Zaporizhzhia and its suburbs were fired at with seven S-300 missiles at night: they damaged agricultural property and equipment and one of the recreation areas. There were no injuries or damage to residential buildings. The claims have not been independently verified. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, reports that yesterday Russia shelled 19 settlements in the Zaporizhzhia region, and that one person was injured in Orikhiv as a result. It cited the local authority. Zaporizhzhia is one of four Ukrainian regions that the Russian Federation claimed to annex late last year. This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog in London.

Western powers will only protect Ukraine\u2019s multibillion-dollar postwar recovery if they agree a unified strategy to make aid conditional on clear progress on combating judicial corruption, reinstating the obligation on Ukrainian public officials to declare assets and ensuring all recovery finds can be digitally traced, according to an authoritative report from the German Marshall Fund. The US thinktank\u2019s proposals, matching calls from Ukrainian civil society and G7 ambassadors in Ukraine, reflect a concern that donors have not yet assembled a strategy to ensure how recovery funds can be monitored in a country that has made progress in tackling capture by oligarchs since 2014 but still has many unreformed institutions. The report, published before the UK government-led Ukraine recovery conference takes place in London, argues that Ukraine is fighting a two-front war to defeat Russia and to permanently embed the rule of law. Members of Ukrainian civil society feel they have been sidelined at the conference, which will be dominated by the private sector and international politicians. The leader of Russian mercenary group Wagner, Yevgeny Prigozhin, is involved in yet \u201canother deliberate effort to undermine the authority of the official military authorities,\u201d in Russia, the UK\u2019s Ministry of Defence writes in its latest intelligence update. On Monday, \u201cPrigozhin said that he was expecting a reply from the Russian MoD regarding a \u2018contract\u2019 of his own drafting which he had delivered to the ministry three days before,\u201d the MoD said. \u201cThis follows the MoD\u2019s own ultimatum to Wagner and other \u2018volunteer formations\u2019 to sign contracts with the MoD by 01 July 2023. \u201cAlthough the content of Prigozhin\u2019s document has not been made public, the act of him delivering it raises the stakes, and is highly likely another deliberate effort to undermine the authority of the official military authorities. \u201cPrigozhin\u2019s tone towards the MoD has become unambiguously confrontational. The MoD almost certainly sees this as deeply unfortunate at a time when it is grappling with Ukraine\u2019s counter-offensive.\u201d Prigozhin has been feuding with the Russian military for months, accusing it among other things of failing to provide enough ammunition to his forces. The dispute reached new heights this month when a Russian commander accused Wagner of kidnapping and torturing his soldiers. More from the most recent ISW analysis, which writes that Russian sources have claimed that a car carrying a Zaporizhia Oblast occupation official exploded in Simferopol, occupied Crimea on Sunday. It reports: Zaporizhia Oblast occupation official Vladimir Rogov claimed that the gas tank of the assistant to the Zaporizhia Oblast occupation deputy prime minister, Vladimir Epifanov, exploded, injuring Epifanov and two other passengers. Rogov claimed that the cause of the explosion is unknown but that unspecified actors inspected the gas tank on June 17, implying possible sabotage. Interestingly, the ISW appears to contradict Biden\u2019s assessment of the risks posed by Russia\u2019s deployment of tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus. In its latest analysis, the US think tank writes: ISW has long assessed that Russia will likely keep tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus in order to consolidate de facto control of Belarus but maintains that this deployment is extraordinarily unlikely to have battlefield impacts in Ukraine. A European Union report will this week say that Ukraine has met two out of seven conditions to start membership negotiations, two EU sources have said according to Reuters, with the bloc\u2019s executive set to highlight progress made despite the war triggered by Russia\u2019s invasion. The news agency reports: In a highly symbolic move, the EU granted Ukraine formal membership candidate status a year ago \u2013 four months after Russia, Kyiv\u2019s Soviet-era overlord, attacked the country amid its efforts to pursue integration with the West. But the EU set seven conditions \u2013 including on judicial reform and curbing endemic corruption \u2013 to launch accession negotiations. Ukraine has called for talks to start this year. The executive European Commission\u2019s report is a milestone in that process, which supporters of Ukraine\u2019s quest for swift EU accession hope will culminate in a decision by the bloc\u2019s 27 member countries in December to start the talks with Kyiv. Two senior EU officials who were briefed on the report, which has not been made public, said Ukraine has met two of the criteria by now. One of the officials said these related to judicial reform and media law, and added that the focus in the report was on the positives. \u201cThere is progress. The report will be moderately positive,\u201d said the person, who spoke under condition of anonymity. \u201cIt\u2019s not about embellishing reality but recognising progress, there have been prominent anti-corruption cases to name, for example.\u201d Ukraine has in recent months gone after several cases of high-profile corruption, including detaining the head of its Supreme Court over a suspected $2.7 million bribe. Beyond stronger anti-graft efforts, other criteria include reforms to Ukraine\u2019s Constitutional Court and law enforcement, anti-money laundering measures as well as laws to rein in oligarchs and safeguard rights of national minorities. Russia\u2019s mercenary Wagner group is calling for people aged 21 to 35 with a \u201cgaming background\u201d to join it as drone specialists as it seeks to expand its recruitment pool following heavy losses, the Institute for the Study of War notes in its latest update on the conflict. The group\u2019s recruiters are posting messages on social media platforms, the thinktank said citing Russian opposition outlet Verstka, which reported that recruits needed no previous experience. The ISW also pointed to an audio intercept posted by Ukraine\u2019s Main Intelligence Directorate (GUR), in which a Russian soldier discusses a new Wagner recruitment campaign launched due to heavy battlefield losses. \u201cThe new Wagner recruitment campaign reportedly advertises training with well-prepared instructors, health and life insurance, modern equipment, and guarantees that all recruits will receive all promised payments,\u201d the ISW wrote. US president Joe Biden says the threat of Russian president Vladimir Putin using tactical nuclear weapons is \u201creal\u201d, days after denouncing Russia\u2019s deployment of such weapons in Belarus. Reuters reports: On Saturday, Biden called Putin\u2019s announcement that Russia had deployed its first tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus \u201cabsolutely irresponsible\u201d. \u201cWhen I was out here about two years ago saying I worried about the Colorado river drying up, everybody looked at me like I was crazy,\u201d Biden told a group of donors in California on Monday. \u201cThey looked at me like when I said I worry about Putin using tactical nuclear weapons. It\u2019s real,\u201d Biden said. Last week, Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko said his country had started taking delivery of Russian tactical nuclear weapons, some of which he said were three times more powerful than the atomic bombs the US dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. The deployment is Russia\u2019s first move of such warheads \u2013 shorter-range, less powerful nuclear weapons that could be used on the battlefield \u2013 outside Russia since the fall of the Soviet Union. Russia launched attacks across Ukraine overnight, including on the capital Kyiv and the western city of Lviv, close to the border with Poland. Kyiv\u2019s military administration said Moscow had launched a drone attack in the early hours of Tuesday, warning residents to find shelter, in a post on the Telegram messaging app. There were no immediate reports of casualties. The administration later said the city\u2019s air defences had detected and destroyed about two-dozen Iranian-made Shahed drones in the \u201cmassive air attack\u201d. It was the second drone attack on the city since the beginning of the month, it said. In Lviv, a piece of \u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d was hit and set on fire, the city\u2019s military administration said, but there were no injuries. Earlier, the city\u2019s mayor, Andriy Sadovy reported explosions in Lviv and the surrounding area. It was not clear if the explosions came from air defences or from missile strikes. Air raid alerts also sounded in Zaporizhzhia, the Kyiv Independent reported, noting that the southern city has been heavily targeted by Russian artillery over the past few days. The situation in the city was \u201cstable\u201d despite a \u201ca restless and noisy night\u201d the head of the city council, Anatoly Kurtev, later said on Telegram. No injuries were reported and there was no damage to residential buildings while all utility systems were working as normal, he said. Hello and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the war in Ukraine with me, Helen Livingstone. Moscow launched raids across Ukraine overnight, with Kyiv reporting drone attacks while explosions were also reported in the western city of Lviv and in the southern city of Zaporizhzhia. There were no immediate reports of casualties but authorities in Lviv said a piece of critical infrastructure was set on fire. US president Joe Biden meanwhile warned that the possibility that Russia could use tactical nuclear weapons was \u201creal\u201d. \u201cWhen I was out here about two years ago saying I worried about the Colorado river drying up, everybody looked at me like I was crazy,\u201d Biden told a group of donors in California. \u201cThey looked at me like when I said I worry about Putin using tactical nuclear weapons. It\u2019s real,\u201d Biden said. Other key developments: Heavy casualties are being endured by both Ukrainian and Russian forces, British military intelligence has said, two weeks into the Ukrainian counteroffensive. The level of losses among Russian troops was said by British officials to be at its highest level since the peak of March\u2019s battle for Bakhmut in the Donetsk region, with Ukraine claiming to have killed or injured 4,600 soldiers. Ukrainian deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said Ukraine must prepare itself for a \u201ctough duel\u201d but that \u201cthe biggest blow is yet to come\u201d. Separately she said that Russia had concentrated a significant number of units in the east, including air assault troops, but that Ukrainian forces were preventing their advance. She described the situation in the east of the country as \u201cdifficult\u201d. Ukraine has recaptured the village of Piatykhatky, a settlement on a heavily fortified part of the frontline near the most direct route to the country\u2019s Azov Sea coast, Maliar confirmed. It brings the tally of settlements liberated in the past two weeks up to eight, with 113 sq km of territory said to have been seized from the occupying forces. Imprisoned Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny urged his supporters to begin a broad campaign against Moscow\u2019s actions in Ukraine as he went on trial on new charges of extremism that could keep him behind bars for decades. In a statement posted on social media by his allies, Navalny declared that the decision to close his trial was a sign of fear on the part of Vladimir Putin, the Russian president. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said he had asked China\u2019s government to be vigilant about private companies that may be providing Russia with technology that could be used against Ukraine, although he said he had seen no evidence Beijing was providing lethal assistance to Moscow. \u201cWith regard to lethal aid to Russia for use in Ukraine, we and other countries have received assurances from China that it is not and will not provide lethal assistance to Russia for use in Ukraine,\u201d Blinken said in Beijing. The British government announced plans to tighten its sanctions policy against Russia, including introducing legislation to keep assets frozen until Moscow has agreed to pay compensation to Ukraine. The new measures will require any individual who has been designated under the sanctions to disclose assets held in Britain. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, discussed his country\u2019s need for long-range weapons and pushed for tougher sanctions on Russia in a phone call with Rishi Sunak. The British prime minister said the UK was firmly behind Ukraine and that \u201csmall steps forward will bring success\u201d. A photograph of a car apparently laden with explosives parked at the top of Ukraine\u2019s Kakhovka dam shortly before it gave way has been said to offer further evidence Russia was behind the bombing. A Ukrainian special forces communications official told the Associated Press he believed the car was there to stop any Ukrainian advance on the dam and to amplify a planned explosion originating in the machine room. Kyiv has accused Hungary of barring access to 11 Ukrainian prisoners of war whom Russia handed over to the EU country, which has maintained ties with the Kremlin during the invasion of Ukraine. \u201cAll attempts by Ukrainian diplomats over the past few days to establish direct contact with Ukrainian citizens have not been successful,\u201d foreign ministry spokesperson Oleg Nikolenko said in a statement on Facebook. \u201cEssentially they are being kept in isolation.\u201d Nato leaders will not issue a formal invitation for Ukraine to join the alliance at a summit in Vilnius in mid-July, Jens Stoltenberg, Nato\u2019s secretary general, said although he added leaders would discuss how to move Ukraine closer to Nato. He also warned against accepting a frozen conflict in Ukraine in return for an end to the war and \u201caccepting a deal dictated by Russia\u201d. The Kremlin said Russia\u2019s decision to decline UN help in areas of Russian-held Ukraine flooded by the Kakhovka dam breach was motivated by security concerns and \u201cother nuances\u201d. Ukraine deputy minister for strategic industries Sergiy Boyev told Reuters at the Paris airshow that Ukraine was in talks with arms manufacturers in Germany, Italy, France and eastern Europe to boost output of weapons, including drones, and possibly manufacture them in Ukraine. \u201cWe are in very detailed discussions with them. And we are certain that we will have the contracts agreements signed within the next few months,\u201d Boyev said. A military attack against Sweden cannot be ruled out following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, a report by the Swedish military has said, stressing the importance of its swift entry into Nato. The report entitled Serious Times did not single out Moscow for instigating a potential attack but rather said Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and China\u2019s mounting influence in Asia and the world were responsible for rising insecurity."}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db59d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/20/true-crime-survivor-podcast", "primaryCategory": "tv-and-radio", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018I\u2019m still ostracized\u2019: what happens to true crime survivors?", "lead": "Two survivors of horrifying, well-publicized crime stories have banded together to create a podcast tackling difficult tales of survival against the odds", "author": "Andrew Gumbel", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 18:10:40", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.991710", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/050b5864c3b1a62fbf4136a752002b54ddb924cc/0_178_1588_953/500.jpg", "body": "When Collier Landry was 12 years old, he became a media sensation as the star witness in a small-town murder trial like no other. With uncommon poise and precision for someone so young, he told a jury in Ohio how, months earlier, he\u2019d woken up in the middle of the night and overheard his father killing his mother in the next room. The town of Mansfield \u2013 and much of the rest of the country \u2013 was riveted as Collier\u2019s father, Jack Boyle, a charming, highly intelligent osteopath with a thriving local medical practice, was convicted of premeditated murder and sentenced to 20 years to life. Much of that was Collier\u2019s doing, not just because of his testimony but also because he had alerted the police and fed them enough information to warrant a murder investigation in the first place. Despite Boyle\u2019s initial insistence that his wife, Noreen, had left on an impromptu trip, the evidence showed that he had smashed her skull with a blunt instrument and suffocated her with a plastic bag about 15 feet from where Collier was lying. Later, Boyle took a jackhammer to the basement of a newly purchased house across the Pennsylvania state line, where he was planning to move with his pregnant mistress, and buried Noreen\u2019s corpse under a layer of fresh concrete. That much of the story was widely reported at the time. Much less well known, though, is what happened next. Collier lost almost everything he had ever known \u2013 not just his parents but also his house, his dog, the three-year-old sister his parents had adopted a few months before the murder, and the entirety of his extended family. His father\u2019s relatives could not forgive him for testifying for the prosecution, while his mother\u2019s relatives did not want to take him in for fear that he might have inherited his father\u2019s worst traits. The one person who seemed to believe in Collier was the lead detective on the case, Dave Messmore, but a family court judge rejected an application by Messmore and his wife to adopt him, saying it would constitute a conflict of interest. Instead, Collier was placed in foster care, then with a different adoptive family, and had to deal with the aftermath of an unspeakable tragedy largely on his own. He was haunted by the idea that his father could easily have murdered him, too. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have been difficult for him to make the hole in the concrete a little bit bigger,\u201d he now says. He was haunted, too, by the questions he still had about what motivated the crime and why his father, even after his conviction, kept insisting he had done nothing wrong. \u201cAlready as a teenager, I started to think about the ramifications and consequences of violence,\u201d a 45-year-old Landry said in a recent interview. \u201cHow society is concerned only with the bad guy going to jail. The state gets its restitution, the gavel comes down, the judge calls \u2018next!\u2019, and people have no idea how events have affected the families and the ancillary victims.\u201d A year or two after the murder, Collier wrote to his father and told him, with the same poise and maturity he\u2019d shown on the stand, that he loved him and forgave him. And he added: \u201cI really hope you face up to what you\u2019ve done and realize that it was wrong.\u201d In a furious response, Jack Boyle called the letter \u201cthe product of some nearby cesspool\u201d and said Collier was an \u201cunctuous brat\u201d and \u201cimbued with hate\u201d. \u201cYou shameful coward!\u201d he wrote. \u201cYou are truly evil!\u201d That, too, he had to absorb largely on his own. One important insight Landry has acquired is that within every high-profile story of violence and survival there is a second, less visible, less well understood story \u2013 the one that follows on, the one that forces survivors to ask: \u201cHow am I going to deal with this for the rest of my life?\u201d The timeline may be less compressed but, as he sees it, the stakes are just as high. \u201cIf you don\u2019t get a handle on these events,\u201d he said, \u201cthey will destroy you.\u201d After years of continuing to investigate his mother\u2019s murder and telling the story in a variety of formats, Landry now has a new project, a podcast designed to throw a spotlight on the question of long-term survival and profile people who, like him, have been through the wringer and struggled to put their lives back together afterward. The project is called The Survivor Squad, which he is co-hosting with another figure familiar to fans of the true crime genre, Terra Newell, who came close to being murdered by her mother\u2019s abusive husband but managed to kill him instead in a gruesome knife fight in a residential parking lot in Orange county, south of Los Angeles. (The story was told in a popular podcast, Dirty John, and later turned into a television drama series.) Newell was not a child when she was attacked \u2013 she was 25, and a fan of the zombie-horror TV show The Walking Dead, which inspired her to save herself by prying the knife out of her attacker\u2019s hands and plunging the blade into his eye. Many aspects of her survival story are similar to Landry\u2019s, though, starting with the agony they both experienced watching their mothers suffer at the hands of an abusive partner and, after that abuse turned violent, their struggle to find the support they needed. After her fatal encounter with \u201cDirty John\u201d Meehan in August 2016, Newell found that some of her oldest friends wouldn\u2019t believe that the reason she was rushed to the hospital was that the same man had jabbed at her repeatedly with a knife, leaving gashes in her left arm and chest, before she was able to overpower and kill him. One of the underlying problems, Newell now says, was that she\u2019d experienced way too many toxic relationships in and around her family. The mindset in the suburban communities where she grew up was too often to excuse or apologize for abuse and to pressure victims to stay silent. Having once been susceptible to the same sort of abuse \u2013 she described a man she dated on and off for years as a narcissist who cheated on her without remorse and once sideswiped her with a car \u2013 Newell now describes herself as a \u201cwhistleblower on narcissists\u201d and refuses to stay silent, whatever the price of that silence. \u201cI\u2019m trying to break a generational pattern of trauma in my family, to tell people to stop putting themselves in the jaws of the shark,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m still ostracized in certain circles. I don\u2019t get invited to events. Where I\u2019m from, in Orange county, wealth is very prevalent and narcissism is very prevalent. With a lot of money comes a lot of control.\u201d Landry and Newell have also learned to expect unexpected, sometimes unwelcome reactions from people because of what they have gone through. Landry said he made a point of not talking much about his childhood trauma when he first moved to Los Angeles in the early 2000s, because he worried about who might be drawn to him. \u201cI wanted people to like me because of who I am, not where I came from,\u201d he said. Some people would be scared of getting too close to him once they learned the details. One girlfriend grew so alarmed when he started to work on a documentary about his story in 2016 that she broke up with him. Another girlfriend proved toxic in ways that reminded him of his father and he quickly broke up with her. Newell, for her part, said she spent years being so unnerved by certain men who approached her \u2013 \u201cwhite men who remind me of John\u201d \u2013 that she would often run away from them, hyperventilating. More recently, a man came up to her and said: \u201cMy wife is like that. My wife is like Dirty John.\u201d She had to fight an old instinct to feel sorry for him before recognizing that this was someone she wanted nothing to do with. What has empowered both of them, over the years, has been to tell their story and to share it with others who have been through similarly traumatic events and are likely to listen to their accounts constructively and without judgment. One of the things that powered Landry through the hardest parts of his life was the conviction that his story could serve as an inspiration to others. He\u2019d been aware, when he took the witness stand, that he was testifying for his life because anything short of a conviction would put him back in his father\u2019s custody and at risk of suffering the same fate as his mother. But he also felt he had no choice. \u201cI knew that if I didn\u2019t do it, I wouldn\u2019t be able to live with myself,\u201d he said. \u201cI have friends and acquaintances who hesitated to speak up and to do what\u2019s right, and it haunts them.\u201d Landry saw, even as a youth leader in high school, how younger kids looked up to him because of what he\u2019d done, and that gave him an unwavering sense of purpose that he retains to this day. \u201cI want to speak to that one kid in foster care who is facing a monster with no support,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to say, brother, you\u2019ll make it. I did, and you will too.\u201d Newell has a similar sense of higher purpose and has banded together with other survivor-advocates, many of whom are now guests on the podcast. They include Lenora Claire, a Hollywood casting professional who has spent years fending off a stalker and works with entertainment productions to ensure they are sensitive to issues of abuse and abuse survival; Jimanekia Eborn, whose mother was murdered when she was very young and works as a therapist to other survivors of trauma; and Amanda Knox, who spent four years in an Italian prison for a murder she did not commit and now speaks and writes about miscarriages of justice around the world. When Newell started telling her story, she saw that it did more than turn off some of her old friends. It also inspired other women to leave abusive relationships and to band together and support each other. \u201cIt turned into something beautiful,\u201d she said. She and Landry both know many people who have been unable to overcome past trauma and have succumbed to alcohol, drugs, depression or other illnesses. \u201cIf we don\u2019t talk, it lives in our bodies,\u201d Newell said. Recognizing that others have been through similar experiences can often be a first step toward a more productive path forward. \u201cThe fact is, we\u2019re not alone with our stories,\u201d she added. \u201cThey\u2019re all unique and they are not as shameful as we sometimes think they are. There is a power in our vulnerability.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db59e", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/20/missing-titanic-submarine-best-and-worst-case-scenarios", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Best and worst case scenarios to explain Titan\u2019s loss of contact with surface", "lead": "The missing submarine had enough oxygen to sustain those onboard for four days, but limited air is far from the only hazard", "author": "Ian Sample Science editor", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 18:07:37", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.991727", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/ae56c204e01a57345c199d662c89b10e2a17be54/0_50_1500_900/500.jpg", "body": "For an expedition as hazardous as the Titan\u2019s descent to the Titanic, there is a long list of onboard systems that need to be checked and a host of environmental hazards that must be identified and assessed before the voyage begins. \u201cWhen you are putting people in a potentially dangerous position like this you want to be absolutely sure everything\u2019s checked through before getting under way,\u201d said Stefan Williams, a professor of marine robotics at the University of Sydney. \u201cWe have an extensive checklist before we put anything in the water.\u201d What checks were performed before the submersible and its five occupants slipped beneath the waves are unclear, but standard checks and procedures were followed, the Guardian understands. These would have been absolutely crucial given the crushing pressure generated at 3,800 metres below sea level \u2013 the depth of water the Titanic came to rest in \u2013 and the real potential of getting lost: the site is nearly 400 miles off the coast of Newfoundland. Industry insiders said pre-dive preparations would, or should, have included checks on the submersible\u2019s structure and all of the vessel\u2019s mechanical and electrical systems. These aim to ensure all is fine before the descent begins: that the hull is sound, the batteries are charged, there are no short circuits or electrical faults, that the thrusters work, that radio and acoustic communications are functioning, and that the submersible can drop the weights it carries when the time comes to resurface. Further checks are needed to reduce risks at the dive site. The Titanic itself is a hazardous structure that a submersible could become caught in, but lost trawler fishing nets and other drifting materials either at or near the site can also present a danger of entanglement. An expedition would typically plan to keep a safe distance from the wreckage, though strong undersea currents can make this a challenge. The problem with getting entangled is there is often little that can be done from inside a submersible to work the vessel free. The Titan was expected to spend two hours descending to the Titanic, a few hours exploring the site, and two more resurfacing. As the vessel plunged deeper, a real-time hull health monitoring system would have reported the strain on the hull, a carbon fibre structure that connects two titanium composite domes. Contact was lost with the Titan one hour and 45 minutes into the expedition. By that time, experts believe it reached a depth of about 3,500 metres, where each square inch of the structure would have been subjected to a force equivalent to more than two tonnes. While the vessel was designed to operate down to 4,000 metres, and would have had a safety margin to go deeper, industry experts said other deep-sea vessels used steel or titanium alone to ensure their hulls could take the pressure. Carbon fibre is widely regarded as an untested material: when it fails, it can fail catastrophically. When the Titan is submerged, communications with the support ship on the surface are conducted over an acoustic link. Crewed submersibles sometimes have two separate systems with independent power supplies: one an acoustic beacon that regularly pings the ship to reveal its location, and another that can carry short text-like messages. This ensures that if the main power supply fails, the beacon keeps working, allowing the surface ship to track the vessel. According to some reports, the Titan did not have an acoustic beacon and had become lost before. In the event of a major power failure, the Titan should have dropped its weights, resurfaced, and made immediate radio contact with the support vessel \u2013 provided the radio communications had a separate power supply. If an incident onboard the vessel knocked out all the electrics, the submersible could be adrift on the surface and awaiting rescue. US and Canadian ships and aircraft have been scrambled, but the bus-sized Titan will be hard to spot in such a vast area of ocean. If the Titan has surfaced, the danger for the crew is not over: the hatch appears to be bolted from the outside, meaning those inside will still need to rely on emergency oxygen to breathe. One grim possibility is a fire in the cabin. The air in a submersible tends to be enriched with oxygen, making fires more risky. For this reason, petroleum-based skin creams and makeup are typically banned in deep dives, but fires can still take hold and swiftly produce smoke that intoxicates those on board. An emergency ascent should still be possible, however. If the vessel has become stricken on the seafloor, only specialised deep-sea submersibles and sonar equipment have a good chance of finding it. The Titan embarked with enough oxygen to sustain the pilot and crew for four days, but limited air is not the only issue. If the vessel had lost power, temperatures inside the cabin would have quickly fallen to a frigid 4C, Williams said. The scenario most feared is that the vessel suffered a catastrophic failure. At such depth, a hull breach would be devastating. \u201cIf something\u2019s gone wrong, there\u2019s a good chance it\u2019s gone very wrong,\u201d said Williams. \u201cIf the pressure vessel has failed catastrophically, it\u2019s like a small bomb going off. The potential is that all the safety devices might be destroyed in the process.\u201d Such a fate would probably trigger signals in military hydrophones that are deployed throughout the world\u2019s oceans. When an Argentine submarine was lost in 2017, hydrophones off Ascension Island and the Crozet Islands detected an acoustic signal consistent with a catastrophic failure of the submarine. \u201cJust knowing where the vessel is is a big consideration,\u201d said Williams. \u201cThe best case scenario is that the vessel has popped up and can be found visually or with radar.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db59f", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/20/tory-mps-split-on-whether-to-intervene-to-help-mortgage-holders", "primaryCategory": "business", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Tory MPs split on whether to intervene to help mortgage holders", "lead": "Figures released on Wednesday expected to confirm UK stuck with highest inflation rate in G7", "author": "Richard Partington Economics correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 18:07:28", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.991745", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/ab5b3cc95553880f9bded2b8d3770b3431359799/0_251_5568_3340/500.jpg", "body": "Conservative MPs are increasingly split over whether ministers should intervene to defuse Britain\u2019s mortgage timebomb, as the Bank of England prepares to raise interest rates for a 13th consecutive time.

Exposing a fresh schism in the party over its economic management, Jake Berry, the influential chair of the the Northern Research Group of Tory MPs, said ministers were at risk of frittering away progress made thanks to support for families with energy costs during the winter. \u201cPeople are very concerned about what is being described as the mortgage bomb about to go off,\u201d he told the chancellor from the backbenches in the Commons. \u201cIf we don\u2019t help families now, all the other money that we have spent to help them will have been wasted if they lose their home.\u201d Convulsions in financial markets in the past week have driven up the average cost of a two-year fixed rate mortgage above 6% for the first time since the ill-fated Liz Truss premiership, as Britain\u2019s biggest lenders \u2013 including Nationwide, NatWest and HSBC \u2013 scramble to pull hundreds of cheaper deals. Should borrowing costs be sustained at that level for several years, house prices across the UK could collapse by a quarter, with no recovery until 2025, economists at the consultancy Capital Economics have warned. Borrowers are experiencing the sharpest increase in interest payments since the late 1980s, with the Bank of England imposing 12 consecutive increases in its key base rate dating back to December 2021. Financial markets widely expect Threadneedle Street will be forced to hike it again on Thursday to tackle stubbornly high inflation. City traders are betting on an increase of at least a quarter-point from the current level of 4.5%, with the possibility of further increases taking the rate close to 6% by Christmas. Hunt has summoned banking chiefs for a meeting at the Treasury on Friday to discuss options for responding to the mortgage crisis. Divisions on the Conservative benches emerged during a debate in the House of Commons on Tuesday. Fuelling political unrest at the prospect of millions of households facing a sharp increase in borrowing costs, Berry urged ministers to reinstate a \u201cbold Conservative idea\u201d of offering tax relief on mortgage interest. Known as mortgage relief at source, or Miras, the tax break was first launched in the 1980s under Margaret Thatcher to encourage home ownership, but was scrapped by Gordon Brown in 2000 amid criticism it had become a giveaway for the rich. Berry\u2019s call to revive the tax break was echoed by Jonathan Gullis, the outspoken Tory MP for Stoke-on-Trent North. But the Treasury minister, Andrew Griffith, suggested such a tax break could be \u201cdisastrous\u201d for the government finances. \u201cThis government wouldn\u2019t come forward with the sort of unfunded spending commitments that we see on the benches opposite,\u201d he said. \u201cThat would be disastrous \u2026 because it would see inflation higher for longer.\u201d The chancellor has so far ruled out mortgage support, and did so again during Tuesday\u2019s debate. He argued it would undermine the Bank of England\u2019s efforts to curb inflation, and insisted the government had already provided substantial sums to help families with rising living costs. \u201cThose kind of schemes, which involve injecting large amounts of cash into the economy right now, would be inflationary,\u201d he added. Figures on Sunak\u2019s right flank appear increasingly ready to criticise the prime minister\u2019s managerialist approach to economic policy, demanding he instead offer voters tax cuts, deregulation and a warmer embrace of Brexit. Labour on Wednesday sought to capitalise on public anger over soaring mortgage costs by labelling them a \u201cTory mortgage penalty\u201d, while highlighting sharp increases facing voters in byelections triggered after Boris Johnson\u2019s resignation. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, told the Commons that more than 10,000 households in Johnson\u2019s former seat of Uxbridge and South Ruislip would need to pay an extra \u00a35,200 a year on average on their mortgages. In Selby and Ainsty, vacated amid increasingly open Tory infighting by Nigel Adams, an ally of the former prime minister, Labour said more than 12,000 households would face an extra \u00a32,700 on average for their home loans. \u201cWhile the Tories squabble over peerages and parties, mortgage products are being withdrawn by lenders and replaced by mortgages with much higher rates,\u201d Reeves said. \u201cThis is the consequence of the Conservative government\u2019s mini-budget and 13 years of economic failure, with inflation higher here than in similar countries.\u201d More than a quarter of UK homeowners on a fixed-rate mortgage are expected to reach the end of cheaper deals before the next general election, which must be held by 28 January 2025, with the Resolution Foundation thinktank estimating a \u00a32,900 increase in annual repayments for the average household."}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db5a0", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/20/johnson-inquiry-report-on-attack-by-mps-could-prompt-fresh-tory-infighting", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Johnson inquiry report on attack by MPs could prompt fresh Tory infighting", "lead": "Findings on \u2018sustained attempt\u2019 to undermine privileges committee expected as early as next week", "author": "Peter Walker", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 18:02:48", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.991764", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/f96ad6f1de0547a6c56e9f3c5b54872c32b6f2b4/0_136_3602_2161/500.jpg", "body": "A privileges committee report that could criticise Conservative MPs who attacked an inquiry into Boris Johnson may be released as early as next week, potentially plunging Rishi Sunak into renewed party infighting. While Johnson allies say the former prime minister is keen to assist in a period of \u201cpeace and quiet\u201d after Monday\u2019s Commons vote, which endorsed the privileges committee\u2019s findings that he had lied repeatedly to parliament, the additional report could jeopardise that. In the 106-page investigation that found Johnson misled MPs in repeatedly assuring the Commons he was unaware of lockdown-breaching parties, the Conservative-majority committee condemned what it called \u201ca sustained attempt, seemingly coordinated\u201d to undermine its members and the inquiry process. It said it would produce a supplementary \u201cspecial report\u201d into this, which could be published next week. While it is not known what the extra report will say, even if it does not name MPs it could anger Johnson\u2019s supporters, jeopardising Sunak\u2019s attempts to placate them. Some of Johnson\u2019s Tory allies have argued that whether or not they agree with the decision about misleading parliament, the committee\u2019s decision to suspend him for 90 days \u2013 not enforceable as he has stepped down \u2013 and the special report show overreach. Downing Street has steadfastly refused to give Sunak\u2019s opinion on Monday\u2019s vote, or even whether he believed Johnson did mislead MPs, after the prime minister was absent from the entire debate. While the deliberate ambiguity avoids the risk of further upsetting Johnson-loyal Conservative MPs, it prompted Labour and the Liberal Democrats to label Sunak as terrified of his own party and is likely to be exploited by Keir Starmer at Wednesday\u2019s prime minister\u2019s questions. A series of ministers were among the 354 MPs who approved the report on Monday, 118 of them Conservatives. Seven MPs voted against. Asked whether Sunak had a view on the decision, his spokesperson said: \u201cThe prime minister thanks the committee for their thorough work, and he fully respects the decision of the house on this matter. He\u2019s made clear it was rightly a matter for parliament and not the government.\u201d Questioned repeatedly, the spokesperson declined to say if Sunak agreed with the committee\u2019s conclusion that Johnson had misled MPs. \u201cHe respects the decision the house has come to,\u201d he said. \u201cThis follows extensive work by the committee, but beyond that, I don\u2019t have any more to add.\u201d He also declined to comment on how Sunak may have voted had he attended, saying: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t get into how he may have voted if he was there. Obviously, that is the definition of a hypothetical.\u201d Asked if Sunak\u2019s stance showed a lack of backbone, the spokesperson replied: \u201cIt was right to enable a free vote to ensure the house could come to a collective view, and he respects that view.\u201d No 10 also refused to endorse comments by Penny Mordaunt, the Commons leader, who opened Monday\u2019s debate by saying Johnson had presided over a \u201cdebasement of the honours system\u201d with his resignation honours list. Asked if Mordaunt was speaking for the government, Sunak\u2019s spokesperson said: \u201cYou\u2019ve got our position on the former prime ministers\u2019 honours system. I\u2019m not aware of when the leader of the house made those comments, but I\u2019m not aware of any plans to change our approach.\u201d Mordaunt voted to endorse the report, as did ministers including Gillian Keegan, the education secretary, and Alex Chalk, the justice secretary. Angela Rayner, Labour\u2019s deputy leader, said: \u201cIt\u2019s astonishing that a prime minister who promised integrity, professionalism and accountability still doesn\u2019t have an opinion about his disgraced predecessor being found guilty of repeatedly lying to parliament. Instead of turning the page on Boris Johnson, Rishi Sunak is showing just how weak and indecisive he is.\u201d Christine Jardine, the Liberal Democrats\u2019 Cabinet Office spokesperson, said: \u201cRishi Sunak is in complete denial over the Boris Johnson saga. The British public will rightly judge him for skipping the vote and not even offering an opinion.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db5a1", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/20/the-guardian-view-on-danger-at-sea-looking-out-for-all-those-in-peril", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "subCategories": "test", "title": "The Guardian view on danger at sea: looking out for all those in peril | Editorial", "lead": "<strong>Editorial:</strong> The contrast between the frantic hunt for a missing submersible and the failure to save migrants drowning in the Mediterranean is illuminating", "author": "Editorial", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 17:52:57", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.991782", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/36aeb659df73052b418b84bc51e49665f8713068/0_513_8640_5184/500.jpg", "body": "A massive operation is under way to find and save a stricken vessel and its passengers. As time passes, anxious families and friends wait with growing fear. The US coastguard, Canadian armed forces and commercial vessels are all hunting for the Titan submersible, which has gone missing with five aboard on a dive to the wreck of the Titanic in the north Atlantic. The UK\u2019s Ministry of Defence is also monitoring the situation. It is hard to think of a starker contrast with the response to a fishing boat which sank in the Mediterranean last week with an estimated 750 people, including children, packed onboard. Only about 100 survived, making this one of the deadliest disasters in the Mediterranean. Greece and the EU blame people smugglers, who overcrowd boats and abuse those aboard them. But both have profound questions to answer about their own role in such disasters. Activists say authorities were repeatedly warned of the danger this boat faced, hours before it went down, but failed to act. Greece has said that the vessel was moving steadily, was not at risk, and that passengers refused help; survivors and tracking data paint a very different picture. The Greek coastguard\u2019s record includes forcible and dangerous pushbacks of asylum seekers, with a recent video showing a family including small children being set adrift on a raft. Frontex, the EU\u2019s border and coast guard, is also \u2013 rightly \u2013 under growing scrutiny. Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, has praised Greece as the bloc\u2019s \u201cshield\u201d against migration \u2013 not only applauding its role, but using the language of combat and self-defence. Josep Borrell, the EU\u2019s foreign policy chief, last year described Europe as a \u201cgarden\u201d and most of the world as a \u201cjungle\u201d which \u201ccould invade\u201d it unless there was greater engagement. Following the backlash, he said he was sorry \u201cif some were offended\u201d and insisted he was referring to the rule of law in contrast with lawlessness. On the most generous interpretation, he showed a startling ignorance of the implications of such language. On a more cynical one, he pandered to it. The rhetoric of a hostile world\u2019s encroachment upon Europe is used in part to try to stem the advance of the far right, showing that mainstream politicians and officials are not ignoring the issues it exploits to win support. But this contributes to an environment in which there is a growing sense of an \u201cus\u201d, living in safety and relative comfort, menaced by a \u201cthem\u201d seeking the same things. Most of those on board the boat last week are believed to have been Pakistani nationals, who had grown desperate as the country\u2019s economic situation deteriorated. \u201cMigrant\u201d has become a word that disguises rather than illuminates the individuals behind the label \u2013 humans with the usual struggles, hopes and fears for themselves and their families, loved as dearly as any others, and as deserving of dignity, safety and concern. That mass drownings have become so common \u2013 more than 25,000 people have died or gone missing in the Mediterranean since 2014 \u2013 is shameful in itself. What is worse is that these disasters have come to be seen as almost normal. Planes and boats are scrambled to save a handful of people who took a risk for an adventure, while children and adults in imminent danger wait until catastrophe strikes.

They might argue that it sustained their political rise. Like doctors who say that bleeding the patient will help them recover, the pair claimed that cutting back government spending would produce economic growth. What Britain suffered was more food banks, more rough sleeping, fewer police, stagnant wages and longer NHS waiting lists. How could any of this have helped prepare Britain for when the pandemic struck? Such details weren\u2019t going to shift Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne, who from the witness stand of the Covid-19 public inquiry remain unmoved by reality. For Mr Cameron, the former prime minister, it was 2008 all over again. Britain had not wanted to end up like Greece, he warned, which had had to cut health budgets after losing control of its national debt and its budget deficit. This is an invidious comparison. Britain, unlike Greece, controls its own currency and can always afford to pay creditors. Greece also had a much lower per capita death rate than the UK during the pandemic. That might have been because, as experts suggested, of the widening health inequalities under Mr Cameron\u2019s watch. These scientists, he averred, had got this wrong. Misjudging the mood, Mr Cameron treated the public inquiry like a rerun of prime minister\u2019s question time. When Kate Blackwell KC for the inquiry asked Mr Cameron a straightforward question about the effect of cuts to public health budgets being the largest in the most deprived areas, he suggested that she use a different measure of council spending power that his government preferred, which showed this not to be the case. Self-awareness is plainly not Mr Cameron\u2019s strong point \u2013 and it was no surprise to see him heckled as he left the inquiry. The former chancellor Mr Osborne was equally deluded. He went as far as saying that austerity had a positive effect because it meant that public finances recovered. \u201cReducing the deficit and placing debt as a percentage of GDP on a downward path was \u2026 essential to rebuild fiscal space to provide scope to respond to future economic shocks,\u201d Mr Osborne told the inquiry. But Britain\u2019s national debt and deficit are determined by the choices that businesses and households make. The UK\u2019s national debt was actually higher in 2016-17 when Mr Osborne left office than when he arrived. Once Covid-19 hit, the neoliberal temple emptied, leaving only the high priests alone at their altar. It turned out that governments can run large fiscal deficits. Central banks can make these fundable at close to zero rates. But almost everywhere, within months of its return, Keynesianism had been ejected again from the economic pantheon. High inflation, sparked by war in Ukraine, set the stage for today\u2019s counter-reformation, permitting Mr Osborne and Mr Cameron \u2013 and their ideological soulmate Rishi Sunak \u2013 a space to peddle fallacies. Both Tory grandees have a limited, detached view of the real economy. For a time they could sell this view through the media. That world \u2013 and their careers \u2013 were blown away in 2016 by the vote to leave the EU. Their arrogance did not let them see that their economic policies were building their political pyres. The irony is that the EU referendum could have resulted in a remain victory had it not been for austerity. Britain will pay long and dearly for the conceit of Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne."}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db5a3", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2023/jun/20/royal-ascot-2023-day-one-st-jamess-palace-stakes-and-more-live", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Royal Ascot day one: Paddington flies to win St James\u2019s Palace Stakes \u2013 as it happened", "lead": "Race-by-race coverage, tips and reaction on the Royal Meeting.

Neither has quite as obvious a chance as Chris Waller\u2019s gelding did last year, though Coolangatta is second-top on Timeform ratings \u2013 behind the favourite, Highfield Princess \u2013 and was strong at the finish when successful in the Group One Lightning Stakes at Flemington in February. Dramatised, successful over course and distance in the Queen Mary Stakes for two-year-olds at last year\u2019s meeting, is also in the reckoning, and arrives with a little more scope for progress than her older opponents, but they all have something to find with Highfield Princess if John Quinn\u2019s admirable mare is close to her best form. She was giving weight to the winner when going down to a narrow defeat on her return to action at York last month and a remarkable performer who started out in handicap company could well be about to get another Group One on the board.

ITV Racing pundit Kevin Blake was adamant that Dettori\u2019s mount, Inspiral, was the best horse in the first race and that \u201cnine times out of ten\u201d she would have won instead of coming second. The slow start and the modest pace would not have helped but the feeling is that perhaps Dettori should have made ground sooner and was not in the best of positions when making his move. The bookies will be pleased but the Italian won\u2019t and last year\u2019s debacle of a meeting will be in the back of his mind.

That said, fancied horses have a pretty decent record in this contest overall, with four winning favourites in the last nine years, and this year\u2019s race has two colts \u2013 River Tiber and Asadna \u2013 a fair way clear at the top of the betting. The market suggests that it is around an 8-15 chance that one or other will win, and punters who place their faith in time analysis in particular have been counting down the days to this race ever since Asadna posted one of the fastest debut times by a two-year-old for many a year at Ripon last month. The only horse from that race to run subsequently was the runner-up and he did little to frank the form - while River Tiber has also won in a decent time on both of his starts to date \u2013 but Asadna is clearly a potent talent and if he can improve only a little for his first experience of racing he is likely to take all the beating.

The favourite has come in! Before King Charles turns up in a couple of minutes in the royal procession, his former butler Grant Harrold has told Boylesports he\u2019s only going to be there \u201cout of duty.\u201d \u201cThe King will go this year because it\u2019s a thing that royals go to Ascot and it is a royal event. But I can make a bet that you won\u2019t see the King running out of the box with excitement over the possibility of winning a race. He rides and he\u2019s got a love for the animals as well, but the racing part was much his mother\u2019s passion. I\u2019m not saying he doesn\u2019t have a flutter, but it\u2019s not something you would go to. \u201cHowever, his wife, the new Queen, loves horse racing. In fact, we often see her at Cheltenham. Anne has always been a lover along with her daughter Zara. I think the new Queen will be the one maybe stepping forward in that role and presenting the prizes. I think the King will present the prize, but who knows? Maybe the new Queen will be given that honour as she is more of a lover of racing. \u201cWe see him at it, so it\u2019s not as if he doesn\u2019t go to them. I think it\u2019s more something that he\u2019ll probably go because it\u2019s his duty to go, it\u2019s something it\u2019s expected the royal family to do. I think it\u2019s fair to say that it was very much his mother\u2019s sport.\u201d Another non-runner in the King\u2019s Stand Stakes this afternoon \u2026 The debate over Ascot\u2019s insistence on running three Group Ones on day one in front of the second-smallest crowd of the week is apparently closed from the track\u2019s point of view, so a race that could be a very worthy highlight in front of a packed house of 70,000 on Friday or Saturday will be seen instead by roughly half that number as Modern Games, Inspiral and Native Trail, who have won eight Group One or Grade One races between them already, duke it out down the straight mile. Modern Games, who took the Lockinge Stakes at Newbury last time, a race that is also run on a straight track, has edged in front of Inspiral in the betting this morning, with the pair currently trading at 9-4 and 5-2 respectively, but the memory of Inspiral\u2019s devastating success on the round course here in last season\u2019s Coronation Stakes, which was also her first race of the season, remains strong and she is possibly the one to be on. Don\u2019t rule out Native Mission, though, as last year\u2019s Irish 2,000 Guineas winner should definitely come on significantly for his seasonal debut behind Mutasaabeq, who is also in today\u2019s field, while lightly-raced Cash is another to bear in mind for each-way purposes. He has just one win to his name but was just a short-head behind Westover, the subsequent Irish Derby winner, in last year\u2019s Sandown Classic Trial. SELECTION: INSPIRAL Don\u2019t put East Asia (5pm) on your betting slips. He has an abscess and won\u2019t be turning up. Una Healy of the Saturdays is at Ascot and that\u2019s a nice tribute to Frankie Dettori right there \u2026 Chris Stickels also told us that the far side (ie those nearest the rail and so those drawn in the low-numbered stalls) on the straight course is the quickest ground. Marginally anyway. Some important jockey news \u2026 and the Puerto Rican jockey Irad Ortiz has clearly eaten something that has disagreed with him. Nice touch from Frankie Dettori on Twitter where he\u2019s just posted this \u2026 film of his first ever winner at Royal Ascot (Markofdistiniction way back in 1990) The going change is here, it\u2019s now official and it\u2019s not insignificant (certainly so on the round course where the going is now on the soft side). Frankie Dettori will be the name on everyone\u2019s lips this week given it\u2019s his final Royal Ascot but he\u2019s had a setback already with the news that one of his best-backed mounts, Manaccan, will not be lining up in the King\u2019s Stand Stakes at 3.40pm today. 1st Carriage The King The Queen The Duke of Wellington The Duchess of Wellington 2nd Carriage The Princess Royal Mrs. Simon Elliot Sir Ben Elliot Lady Elliot 3rd Carriage The Duke of Gloucester The Duchess of Gloucester The Lord Bamford The Lady Bamford 4th Carriage Mr. Willie Mullins Mrs. Willie Mullins Mr. Ralph Beckett Mrs. Ralph Beckett Full race schedule for Tuesday Queen Anne Stakes - 2:30pm (Guardian tip: Inspiral) Coventry Stakes - 3:05pm (Guardian tip: Asadana) King\u2019s Stand Stakes - 3:40pm (Guardian tip: Highfield Princess) St James\u2019s Palace Stakes - 4:20pm (Guardian tip: Isaac Shelby \u2013 nb) Ascot Stakes - 5pm (Guardian: Calling The Wind- nap) Wolferton Stakes - 5:35pm (Guardian tip: Cadillac) Copper Horse Stakes - 6:10pm (Guardian tip: Ruling Dynasty) If you want a betting tip today it\u2019s to have a good look at the Tote odds at the meeting. Royal Ascot became the first British meeting to be part of the World Pool initiative back in 2019. The World Pool is a collaboration between several countries around the globe which allows punters to bet into the same pool as those from eight countries on specific racedays , including every day of the royal meeting. The World Pool generates greater liquidity while also being able to go against fellow bettors from across the globe. This means that punters can place larger, more significant bets without having an impact on a horse\u2019s price. For example, if you\u2019d placed a \u00a31 bet on each winner across 2022\u2019s 17 World Pool days in Britain and Ireland, you\u2019d have a 16% higher return compared to the usual, standard SP. Punters can do so via the Tote website and mobile app, bookmakers that offer Tote betting and on the racecourses themselves. Michael Fitzsimons, Executive Director, Wagering Products, at the Hong Kong Jockey Club, told me: \u201cWorld Pool was born at Royal Ascot four years ago and it\u2019s been hugely satisfying to see how much progress we\u2019ve made. In 2019, there were a total of 30 World Pool races and we\u2019re going to be closing in on 200 races in 2023. The value on offer for racing fans globally is truly exceptional.\u201d It\u2019s almost that time again ... the announcement of who will be in the royal procession down the track at about 2pm. We can expect the details of who will be in the procession at around midday. This, of course, is also the time when I traditionally mention the Serpentine gallery exhibition by artist Mark Wallinger I saw back in 1994 when one of his installations, called \u2018Royal Ascot\u2019, consisted of a series of video monitors on top of wheeled flight cases, each isolating the royal carriage\u2019s leisurely progress down the track on the Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday (respectively, as it was then) of the meeting with the added TV commentary. The British Council described the work thus: \u201cSimultaneous footage exposes precise choreography: the Queen\u2019s frozen smile and rigid curls, the tilt of her head, her gloved wave, the Duke of Edinburgh raising his top hat, the national anthem striking up. Appropriately for an event whose media coverage focuses on the parade of hats and dresses rather than the sport, here we have a close-up on clothes, on the Queen\u2019s dolly mixture of pinks, tangerines, limes; the difference from day to day is barely discernible, just as the four BBC commentaries merge in a confused blather.\u201d As the critic Martin Herbert observed: \u201cWhat Wallinger\u2019s synchronised footage reveals is the rigidity of the class system in tangible form: the event is surreally identical every day.\u201d The point Wallinger was making is that the overall difference from day to day was barely discernible but what will be different this week is that King Charles III will be in the first carriage and that he will reportedly be there every day (something he won\u2019t enjoy as he regularly used to scuttle off after the Tuesday). 3/1 Cream/White 4/1 Blue/Navy 5/1 Pink/Peach 6/1 Yellow 8/1 Purple 8/1 Red 10/1 Green 10/1 Orange Boylesports betting Our regular reader knows that we always start with the traditional opening betting heat of the day, the Queen\u2019s Hat Stakes. The late Queen Elizabeth was a regular presence at the track during her long reign until failing health prevented her attending. Odds on the colour of her titfer were regularly offered by bookmakers and with reportedly the new King and Queen set to attend every day then the tradition is back. A spokesperson for BestofBets.com tells me: \u201cEarlier this week, BoyleSports confirmed that they are in fact continuing this long-standing tradition with the torch being passed to Queen Camilla with odds on what colour she wears on all five days.\u201d I also got a form preview as I was told: \u201cBookies have agreed that Queen Camilla\u2019s likely to go for a more muted approach with cream/white shades being the current favourite.\u201d Chris Stickels has been on Sky Sports Racing just now and told reporter Zoe Bird: \u201cI can see a slight ease in the description but I don\u2019t think it will be drastic.\u201d With that he was off to walk around the track \u2026 Good morning and welcome to the royal meeting day one. Ascot, unlike Cheltenham, pushed their royal meeting into the weekend with its first Royal Ascot Saturday in 2002 and that was an immediate success. But five days of high-class racing make this a marathon (a Queen Alexandra Stakes if you like) not a sprint (a King\u2019s Stand) and it\u2019s key to pace yourself. The first thing we need to know is what effect the 10mm of rain overnight and this morning has had on the ground. But we won\u2019t know the details of the going until near to midday apparently which is, er, frustrating. \u201cWe anticipate an ease in the going but it is too early to say what it will be before the rain we\u2019ve had has properly soaked in,\u201d reported clerk of the course Chris Stickels. \u201cWe had 10mm, or just under, and most of that came in the heavy shower this morning, which came just after we originally walked the track. We\u2019ll let that rain settle in and the ground will be reassessed by midday at the latest.\u201d We\u2019ll get you the details as soon as we get them. Good morning and welcome to Ascot racecourse, where the weather forecast is a little iffy and the track has already soaked up around 10mm of rain since midnight, but around 40,000 racegoers in their finest gladrags are due to arrive imminently for day one of Royal Ascot 2023. The track\u2019s official weather and going webpage will be generating plenty of traffic this morning, while Chris Stickels, the clerk of the course, has recently issued an update on the ground via Twitter. \u201cThe going will be reassessed at midday after 10mm of rain has just fallen,\u201d Stickels said. \u201cThe current going description is good-to-firm in the straight and good, good-to-firm in places on the round course, but this will be updated once that rain has soaked through and we\u2019ve have a chance to reassess the track.\u201d Despite the softening conditions underfoot, the first-day racegoers could be said to be smart in more ways than one. This is the only day of the five-day meeting which stages three Group One events \u2013 the Queen Anne Stakes, the King\u2019s Stand Stakes and the St James\u2019s Palace Stakes \u2013 and yet, year after year, it is fourth out of five in terms of attendance. Only tomorrow\u2019s card \u2013 which features the Prince of Wales\u2019s Stakes, often the highest-quality race of the entire meeting \u2013 pulls in fewer racegoers. Baaeed and Coroebus were both odds-on for the Queen Anne and St James\u2019s Palace respectively 12 months ago, but the shortest-priced favourite on the first day this year is Vauban, in the Copper Horse Handicap at the end of the card, at around 13-8. On the Flat, it does not get much better than this. One rider, inevitably, will be the centre of attention as the meeting gets underway. Frankie Dettori is Mr Ascot, and a double on Inspiral and Chaldean would get his final royal meeting off to an explosive start. His first-day book of rides, in fact, may well turn out to be the best of his week, and now also includes a \u00a31.1m juvenile after vGivemethebeatboys, a big fancy for the Coventry Stakes, was knocked down for a seven-figure sum at the Goffs London Sale on Monday evening. Bookies will be braced for a Frankie charge on the first afternoon, although Ryan Moore, who is just four winners behind Dettori in third place on the all-time list at the meeting, is a very warm favourite to end the week as the top jockey. William Buick, champion on the Flat for the first time last year, is also very much in the conversation, as is Oisin Murphy, whose suspension in 2022 meant that he did not get a chance to defend the title that he won for the first time in 2021. Picks for the first seven races at this year\u2019s royal meeting are here, and you can, as ever, follow all the news, views, gambles and results here on the blog, all the way until the Copper Horse Stakes at what is now the meeting\u2019s traditional last-race time of 6.10pm."}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db5a4", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/20/privacy-trial-judge-asks-why-piers-morgan-has-not-given-evidence", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Privacy trial judge asks why Piers Morgan has not given evidence", "lead": "Judge in case brought by Prince Harry notes that some journalists happy to comment on sidelines", "author": "Kevin Rawlinson and agency", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 17:27:21", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.991835", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/3b025561a135ce00a9024c7fabdb60de595cba59/0_50_2952_1772/500.jpg", "body": "The judge presiding over the privacy case brought by Prince Harry and others has questioned why journalists including Piers Morgan have not appeared to give evidence, noting that some have been happy to commentate on the case from the sidelines in recent weeks.

Referring to that pair in particular, he said they \u201crelatively recently had a lot to say about this matter outside of court\u201d.

Morgan has denied involvement in phone hacking \u2013 one of the issues at hand in the case being heard in the high court. After a three-week trial in 2015, Wallis was found not guilty of phone-hacking charges relating to his time at the News of the World, which was not published by the respondent in the present case. Also on Tuesday, the court heard that the Coronation Street actor Michael Le Vell \u201cburned quite a few bridges\u201d and has been in some \u201creally dark places\u201d over some of the press coverage of his personal life. The actor, who plays Kevin Webster in the long-running soap, is suing MGN for damages over alleged unlawful information gathering between 1991 and 2011. He has claimed journalists at the publisher\u2019s titles were linked to phone hacking, so-called \u201cblagging\u201d or gaining information by deception and the use of private investigators for unlawful activities. Tuesday was the final day of evidence in the case as Le Vell, who is bringing the legal action under his real name, Michael Turner, finished his time in the witness box. In written evidence placed before the court, Le Vell said he became \u201cextremely paranoid\u201d about stories about him, and that he blamed people around him. \u201cI feel like I wasted quite a lot of years alienating quite a lot of decent people in my life.

In a letter to Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, the 81-year-old US senator from Vermont and chair of the influential Senate committee on health, education, labor and pension (Help) demanded information about \u201csystematically underreported\u201d injury rates, turnover, productivity targets, and adherence to federal and state safety guidelines at the e-commerce giant. Sanders\u2019s letter, which was obtained by the Washington Post, described conditions at Amazon\u2019s warehouses as \u201cuniquely dangerous\u201d and pointed to a report that found the company\u2019s serious injury rate in 2021 was double the warehouse industry average in 2021. \u201cAmazon is one of the most valuable companies in the world, worth $1.3tn and its founder, Jeff Bezos, is one of the richest men in the world worth nearly $150bn,\u201d Sanders wrote in the letter. \u201cAmazon should be one of the safest places in America to work, not one of the most dangerous.\u201d Amazon spokesperson Steve Kelly acknowledged that the company had \u201creceived chairman Sanders\u2019s letter this evening and are in the early stages of reviewing it\u201d, adding that the senator had an open invitation to tour one of the company\u2019s warehouses. Sanders has previously hit out at working conditions and pay at Amazon. In 2018, the company said it would raise its base hourly pay rate to $15, or roughly double the national minimum wage. Then CEO Jeff Bezos said the company had \u201clistened to our critics\u201d. The initiation of an investigation into workplace health and safety practices at Amazon comes amid a vigorous opposition against unionization efforts by company employees and data from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration that Amazon warehouse jobs can be more dangerous than at comparable companies. Over the past year, Amazon has opposed union organizing campaigns, resisted charges of unfair labor practices filed by workers and spent over $14.2m on anti-union consultants in 2022. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the companies that really talks about a big game about how good they treat their workers, and yet, when you actually talk to workers, it\u2019s the total opposite,\u201d Aliss Lugo, an organizer in Georgia with United for Respect at Amazon, told the Guardian in April. Sanders has previously written a letter to Starbucks founder and former CEO Howard Schultz in which he accused the coffee company of refusing to bargain a contract with workers who voted to unionize. \u201cOver the past 18 months, Starbucks has waged the most aggressive and illegal union-busting campaign in the modern history of our country,\u201d Sanders stormed at a Help committee hearing in March. In an interview with the Post, Sanders said it was \u201can absolute possibility\u201d that Jassy or founder Jeff Bezos could be called to testify at a similar hearing, as Schultz had done. \u201cAmazon sets an example for the rest of the country,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWhat Amazon does, their attitude, their lack of respect for workers permeates the American corporate world.\u201d Sanders told the Post he was \u201cappreciative\u201d of Amazon\u2019s decision to raise its starting wage but maintained he was \u201cextremely upset by their vehement anti-union behavior\u201d and workplace safety record. Steve Kelly, the Amazon spokesperson, said the company has recorded a 23% reduction in injuries since 2019 and had invested more than $1bn into safety initiatives, projects and programs in the last four years. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue investing and inventing in this area because nothing is more important than our employees\u2019 safety,\u201d Kelly added, and he said that critics of the company had spliced the data \u201cto suit their narrative\u201d."}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db5a6", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jun/20/exclusive-joe-lycett-backs-out-award-ceremony-over-fossil-fuel-links", "primaryCategory": "culture", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Joe Lycett backs out of award ceremony over fossil fuel links", "lead": "Comedian among stars who publicly withdrew from British LGBT Awards after climate campaigners warned of sponsorship deals with oil giants", "author": "Damien Gayle", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 17:14:02", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.991873", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/057b52e584e1321a82ee2ee93ec874a3f92f2bc7/211_0_1709_1026/500.jpg", "body": "Joe Lycett has pulled out of the British LGBT Awards after climate campaigners said they would protest outside over its sponsorship deals with Shell and BP.

Gorgeous, who found fame after appearances on RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race, said it was \u201cwith sadness but necessary resolve\u201d that they were rejecting a nomination for \u201cTV moment of the year\u201d. Writing on Instagram, they said: \u201cThe event unfortunately has a number of sponsors with questionable track records on climate change, racism and inequality, including BP and Shell. These two in particular have consistently failed to back up rhetoric of low carbon transition with actions to that effect. \u201cGiven the nomination was offered for an act of creative advocacy, it wouldn\u2019t feel right to be part of the event knowing the damage these companies are still doing to the environment and communities most affected by climate change.\u201d Faye also announced her withdrawal on Instagram, writing: \u201cI don\u2019t accept my nomination nor would I want anyone to vote for me as long the awards are sponsored by BP and Shell. \u201cOne of the greatest political anxieties I have is that I have spent a lot of my working life trying to fight for future generations of queer and trans people to see liberation. That\u2019s all undermined and threatened by the extreme and imminent threat of climate change and the social impact of climate injustice.\u201d Turning down her nomination, Dhaliwal said: \u201cI can\u2019t be part of this, so will not be attending the event. I won\u2019t win \u2013 I\u2019m up against very big names, so I don\u2019t imagine it will make a difference for them, but as an activist, who fights for the rights of queer people of colour, the last thing I want to do is align myself to this.\u201d Nominees began pulling out of the awards ceremony after they were contacted by activists from climate justice group Tipping Point UK and from Fossil Free Pride, which campaigns for Pride events across the UK to drop their fossil fuel sponsors. On Monday night the LGBT community platform Queer House Party joined calls on stars to pull out, saying in an open letter: \u201cFor these kinds of companies to be advertised at the British LGBT Awards represents a defeat for the LGBTQ community and an insult to everyone that we stand in solidarity with internationally. \u201cAs the LGBT Awards are ignoring our calls to end their partnerships with these corporations \u2013 we are now instead calling upon the nominees of the awards to take a stand and reject their nominations in support of our community and the people who are disproportionately affected by the climate crisis being drastically worsened by these corporations.\u201d On Tuesday, Just Stop Oil issued a statement, in the name of its LGBTQ+ supporters, saying: \u201cWe in the LGBTQ+ community will not allow the deadliest and most dangerous companies to use our existence to greenwash and rainbow wash their brands. This is a line in the sand for us.\u201d The awards ceremony takes place in central London on Friday. Climate campaigners have vowed to hold \u201ca big camp protest\u201d outside, including a counter-ceremony with drag performances, speakers from communities affected by climate breakdown and satirical awards for sponsors in categories such as \u201cbiggest destroyer of habitats in the North Sea\u201d and \u201cbiggest destroyer of indigenous lands in Colombia\u201d. Jessie Dolliver, a spokesperson for Fossil Free Pride, said: \u201cThis awards is a really blatant, textbook example of what pinkwashing is \u2026 Not only are [sponsors] awarding prizes to prominent members of the LGBT+ community, but they are also awarding prizes to themselves, and then they will use those as credentials going forward to make themselves look impressive.\u201d Shell said the extent of its sponsorship ran as far as its LGBT+ employee group \u2013known internally as the Proud@ShellUK Network \u2013 buying a premium table at the awards event and taking out an advert in the awards brochure. A spokesperson for Proud@Shell, said: \u201cShell puts diversity, equity and inclusion at the heart of its employee culture and believes that a fully inclusive workplace allows our business to flourish. \u201cIt\u2019s important to highlight this through our presence at events like this one, and it\u2019s regrettable that a few people have reacted so negatively, especially as we\u2019re committed to becoming a net zero emissions energy business by 2050.\u201d A BP spokesperson said: \u201cAt BP, we promote an environment where everyone can be their best and true selves and feel like they belong, with no exceptions. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re proud to sponsor the British LGBT Awards to celebrate other individuals and organisations that share our beliefs and recognise diversity, equity and inclusion.\u201d The Guardian has contacted the British LGBT Awards for comment."}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db5a7", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/20/george-osborne-sings-praises-of-true-pandemic-hero-himself", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "George Osborne sings praises of true pandemic hero \u2013 himself", "lead": "Yes, it was unfortunate the former chancellor had let social care collapse, but no one lives for ever", "author": "John Crace", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 17:12:32", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.991890", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/8ce73fcd1f7818b198b077d4317ad0424f26cf99/159_55_2264_1359/500.jpg", "body": "There were many unsung heroes during the Covid pandemic. The doctors, nurses and paramedics who went that extra mile to treat and comfort the sick and the dying. The care home staff who put themselves in harm\u2019s way knowing they were admitting patients who hadn\u2019t been tested for the coronavirus. The ordinary members of the public who went out of their way to follow the rules even though they knew they might never see relatives or loved ones again. But during his evidence to the Covid inquiry on Tuesday morning, George Osborne went out of his way to praise the efforts of one man without whom the country might never have survived the pandemic. Someone whose name had mysteriously slipped under the public\u2019s radar and yet was worthy of a nation\u2019s gratitude. The former chancellor was here to right that wrong. To allow that someone to be a hero. If only just for one day. And that someone was a certain George Osborne. Few people do conceit and self-regard quite as well as the former chancellor. So he was understandably rather hurt when Kate Blackwell KC, the counsel for the inquiry, dared to quote reports that had found the austerity economics of the coalition government contributed to the impact of the pandemic. Underinvestment in public services \u2013 and especially the NHS and social care \u2013 had led to a higher rate of mortality. \u201cI absolutely refute that,\u201d said a brittle Osborne. How dare anyone suggest that he might have blood on his hands. George doesn\u2019t do guilt. Or self-doubt. He\u2019s never lost a moment\u2019s sleep over the effect of his policies on the country. The only fault to which he will admit is excessive modesty. People should be thanking, not condemning him. Put it this way, he snapped. The reality was that the country would have been far worse off during the pandemic were it not for austerity. OK, so a whole load of people might have died unnecessarily but that was just unfortunate. The poor always croak first in a pandemic and it was a coincidence that his economics had increased health inequality. But look on the bright side. It was totally down to him that Rishi Sunak had been able to fund the furlough and bailout schemes. Thanks to Him, the country could afford a contingency plan. Weirdly, it didn\u2019t seem to have occurred to Osborne that other countries that hadn\u2019t made their people poorer or cut public services had also been able to afford bailouts. That rather got overlooked. A short-circuit of denial in George\u2019s psyche. But hey! He had given everything a lot of thought and had come to the conclusion there wasn\u2019t a single thing he could have done better. We had all been so, so lucky to have him. Blackwell didn\u2019t sound wholly convinced. Nor did the committee chair, Heather Hallett, who made a couple of well-timed interventions. After all, it couldn\u2019t be just a coincidence that the Institute for Government, the Office for Budget Responsibility and just about everyone else contradicted Osborne\u2019s version of events. But George was in a world of his own. Not prepared to accept even the slightest criticism. Or the slightest responsibility, for that matter. When things go wrong, it\u2019s always someone else\u2019s fault. Osborne hastily went on to list more of his magnificent achievements. OK, so many hospitals had fallen down around him on his watch but he had definitely ringfenced the NHS budget. And his sugar tax and smoking strategies had worked a treat on the nation\u2019s health. So he was basically a saint. Yes, it was unfortunate that he\u2019d let social care collapse, but people had to die of something. No one lives for ever, so they might as well die of neglect. After all, it wasn\u2019t his fault if people weren\u2019t prepared to pay more in tax to live longer. Nor was George willing to concede that he could have made better contingency plans for the pandemic. It was what it was. Even if he had given it a moment\u2019s thought, no one would have taken seriously the idea of locking down a country for months on end. So even if he had thought of it, nobody would have believed him. Besides, it all worked out quite well. Even down to Tory donors making loads of dosh on PPE. Osborne smiled. He had done enough. He could look himself in the eye and exonerate himself of all blame. That was all from Planet George. A place where everything is for the best in the best of all possible worlds. It had all been very different when Oliver Letwin, the Cabinet Office minister, had been cross-examined earlier in the morning. Then, Letwin is at heart a very decent bloke. Someone prone to self-criticism who could talk himself out of almost anything. A man for whom doubt is an article of faith. A man driven by the things he should have done. Who places demands on himself that he doesn\u2019t expect of others. Osborne and David Cameron would call him wet and indecisive. The rest of us would like to see more people like him in public life. Letwin couldn\u2019t think of anything he didn\u2019t wish he had done differently. He shouldn\u2019t have just accepted the advice he was given that all the contingency plans for pandemic flu were in place. Because if he hadn\u2019t, he might have given more thought to the possibility of other respiratory viruses. He should have asked better questions of the scientists. He should have given more thought to the implementation of contingency plans. He had lasting regrets about his time in office. He felt every death keenly. As if the victims had died at his hands. Contrast this approach with Osborne and Cameron. Tells you all you need to know about the three men really."}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db5a8", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jun/20/translator-alleges-work-on-chinese-radical-plagiarised-in-british-museum-show", "primaryCategory": "culture", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Translator alleges work on Chinese radical \u2018plagiarised\u2019 in British Museum show", "lead": "Exclusive: Yilin Wang claims she did not receive any credit for translations of Qiu Jin\u2019s work in the China\u2019s Hidden Century exhibition", "author": "Nadia Khomami and Amy Hawkins", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 16:53:50", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.991908", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/8865d26163bc3706373d9285211a0661c095d122/0_116_3500_2101/500.jpg", "body": "The British Museum is removing a segment of its landmark exhibition on China after a writer alleged that her translations of a Chinese revolutionary\u2019s poetry had been \u201cplagiarised\u201d. Yilin Wang, an award-winning translator, poet and editor who lives in Vancouver, said she did not receive any credit or reimbursement for translations of Qiu Jin\u2019s work that she claims are hers. They appeared in the exhibition and catalogue of the museum\u2019s China\u2019s Hidden Century exhibition. \u201cHey [British Museum], it\u2019s come to my attention that your exhibit \u2018China\u2019s hidden century\u2019 uses my translations of Qiu Jin\u2019s poetry, but you never contacted me for permission,\u201d Wang wrote on Twitter. \u201cPlease note this is a copyright infringement! How are you going to fix this?\u201d In a lengthy thread, the writer then linked to articles which include translations she alleges to be her own. Wang emphasised the amount of effort she put into them, including reading more than 200 of Qiu Jin\u2019s poems \u201cabout five times\u201d, and taking \u201ca week to several months, perhaps at an average of 20-50hrs\u201d to research and translate each poem. She added: \u201cI am demanding all my translations to be removed from the China\u2019s Hidden Century exhibit and all materials pertaining to the exhibit (including the exhibition books, all video/photo/display materials, all signage, all digital or print materials such as brochures, and anywhere else where translations have appeared), unless the museum makes a proper offer to compensate me and the compensation is immediately given.\u201d The British Museum has said it makes every effort to contact copyright owners of images, print and digital media it uses, and has removed the assets in question as an act of good faith until the matter is resolved. In a statement, the museum said: \u201cThe British Museum takes copyright permissions seriously. We have been in touch with Yilin Wang directly to discuss this matter.\u201d It is understood that the first time the museum was made aware of the matter was via Wang\u2019s Twitter thread. The China\u2019s Hidden Century exhibition is the result of a four-year research project supported by the Arts and Humanities Research Council, led by the British Museum and London University, and was made in collaboration with more than 100 scholars from 14 countries. The show consists of 300 objects, half from the British Museum and half borrowed from 30 different British and international lenders \u2013 with most being publicly displayed for the first time. Many items have been refurbished by conservators over the course of several years. Celebrated in the exhibition is the life and legacy of Qiu Jin (1875 \u2013 1907), a revolutionary, feminist and poet who was executed by beheading at the age of 31. The exhibition ends with a wall devoted to a rotating sequence of photos of Qiu alongside English translations of her poetry and a recording of one of her songs performed by the London Chinese Philharmonic Choir. Some of the English translations of Qiu\u2019s work, which Wang claims were done by her, include: \u201cAs my heart shatters with rage over my homeland\u2019s troubles, how can I linger, a guest abroad, savouring spring winds?\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t speak of how women can\u2019t become heroes\u201d.

Les Soul\u00e8vements de la Terre (Earth Uprising) is an umbrella group of several different environmental activist associations across France. It is seen as leading a new form of more radical climate action in Europe with high-profile direct action often aimed at big business interests, state projects and large-scale farming. The group was part of a demonstration over a controversial irrigation project in Sainte-Soline, western France, in March that led to fierce clashes with police. Around 5,000 protesters battled with more than 3,000 police officers. Two protesters were left in a coma afterwards, while around 30 officers were injured. The demonstrators were protesting against a giant reservoir for storing water pumped up from the underground water table, saying it would hurt smaller farmers and the ecosystem, while benefiting mainly industrial agriculture groups. France\u2019s Human Rights League said after the protests that \u201cas soon as the demonstrators arrived at the reservoir site, police fired at them with weapons of war: teargas grenades, stun grenades, explosive sting-ball grenades and rubber bullets \u2026 the deployment put everyone present at risk of serious harm\u201d. Earlier this month, UN experts urged France to review its policing practices, expressing concern at the \u201creported excessive use of force\u201d against protesters, in particular at Sainte-Soline. This month Les Soul\u00e8vements de la Terre led protests against a sand quarry in western France where protesters tore up fields and equipment at a farm. The group was also one of several organisers of a banned demonstration at the weekend against a new rail link between the eastern city of Lyon and Turin in Italy. On Tuesday, prosecutors said they detained 14 people for questioning over vandalism at an earlier protest supported by Les Soul\u00e8vements de la Terre, against a Lafarge cement plant near the southern city of Marseille. The interior minister, G\u00e9rald Darmanin, confirmed in parliament on Tuesday that the group would be shut down, saying \u201cno cause justifies the injuring of police officers and gendarmes\u201d. The government spokesman, Olivier V\u00e9ran, accused the coalition of encouraging violence at the Sainte-Soline irrigation protest in March. \u201cYou don\u2019t dissolve an association because of its ideas,\u201d V\u00e9ran told CNews television. \u201cYou dissolve it because there is violence or a risk for public safety.\u201d V\u00e9ran said the group \u201cwhipped up violence at Sainte-Soline by inviting rioters, who came from across Europe with metal bars and p\u00e9tanque balls to try to kill police officers\u201d. He said: \u201cThe climate question does not justify throwing rocks at police in a field.\u201d The dissolution of Les Soul\u00e8vements de la Terre was officially launched by the interior ministry just after the Sainte-Soline clashes in March, using powers that have been previously used to outlaw far-right and Islamist groups. The group said in a statement on Tuesday that the agricultural and food industry as well as the farmers\u2019 union had leant directly on the government to issue a ban. In a statement, the group said: \u201cTrying to silence the Soul\u00e8vements de la Terre is a vain attempt to break the thermometer instead of worrying about the temperature.\u201d The decree to ban the group will be presented at the government\u2019s weekly cabinet meeting on Wednesday.

Britain\u2019s whole system of critical national infrastructure remains \u201cwildly under-resilient\u201d, the Covid-19 inquiry has been told by Oliver Letwin, who was responsible for emergency planning in the coalition government. George Osborne, the former chancellor, has said he completely rejects claims that austerity weakened the UK\u2019s health and social care capacity before Covid. (See 2.47pm.) David Lammy, the shadow foreign secretary, has said that Labour will not try to rejoin the single market or the customs union because it needs to be \u201cpragmatic\u201d. In a speech at Best for Britain\u2019s Trade Unlocked conference, he said: The next Labour government will not rejoin the EU, the single market or customs union. I know that disappoints some people here today. But I\u2019ve spent the last 18 months travelling around Europe, meeting counterparts, building relationships, talking to our sister parties. It\u2019s mistaken to think that after such a messy divorce it is possible to propose marriage again even before two ex-partners have gone on a date. The next Labour government will be focused on what is pragmatic, turning the page on the era of acrimony that this government has overseen, which has seen trust undermined, cooperation stall and our economy damaged. But Lammy also said that it was a \u201cfantasy\u201d to think the relationship with the EU was not important. He explained: Last week the Conservative party press office attacked me for saying that improving our relationship with the EU will be a priority of the next Labour government. I have no qualms about repeating this. Reconnecting Britain must start by reconnecting with our European neighbours. Because the EU are our biggest trading partners. And our allies as we face war on our continent. If you do not think Britain\u2019s relationship with Europe is of fundamental importance to our future, you are living in a fantasy. Pressure is growing on the former Tory London mayoral candidate Shaun Bailey not to accept the peerage offered to him by Boris Johnson, as a senior Conservative MP said he should \u201cconsider his position\u201d. Nadine Dorries, the Boris Johnson cheerleader and former culture secretary, has suggested that Harriet Harman\u2019s revelation last night that No 10 wanted her to carry on as chair of the privileges committee, despite people claiming that she had posted tweets implying she was biased against Johnson, showed that Downing Street was engaged in some sort of anti-Johnson conspiracy. She posted this on Twitter. But Dorries seems to have forgotten when she posted her tweet that it was not Rishi Sunak who was in No 10 when it approved the Harman appointment, but Johnson himself. Dame Sally Davies, who was chief medical officer for England between 2010 and 2019, told the Covid inquiry this afternoon that a generation of children had been damaged by Covid, and the experience of lockdown. Davies, who is now master of a Cambridge college, said that, in planning for a possible pandemic, no thought had been given to the prospect of lockdown, said: It\u2019s clear that no one thought about lockdown. I still think we should have locked down, although a week earlier. But during that we should have thought do we need to further. The damage I now see to children and students from Covid and the educational impact tells me that education has a terrific amount of work to do. We have damaged a generation and it is awful as head of a college in Cambridge watching these young people struggle. I know in preschools they haven\u2019t learned how to socialise and play properly, they haven\u2019t learned how to read at school. We must have plans for them. In the House of Lords peers have just inflicted two further defeats on the government over the retained EU law (revocation and reform) bill. It is the third time the bill has been sent from the House of Commons to the Lords, and by this stage of \u201cping pong\u201d peers are often minded to back down and let the elected house have its way. But at the moment they are digging in. The government lost on two amendments where peers are insisting on safeguards to the bill, which was originally intended to ensure that all remaining EU regulations would lapse by the end of the year, unless ministers chose to keep or reform then, until Kemi Badenoch, the business secretary, significantly watered down what was planned. One amendment would ensure that any new regulations replacing EU environmental regulations must not \u201creduce the level of environmental protection arising from the EU retained law to which the provision relates\u201d. It would also ensure that ministers have to take expert advice when drafting replacement regulations. Lord Krebs, the crossbencher, academic and former president of the British Science Association who proposed the amendment, said he had tried \u201cvery hard\u201d to make his amendment acceptable to the government. He said he was \u201csimply trying to ensure that our environmental protections are not weakened\u201d. His amendment was passed by 232 votes to 187 \u2013 a majority of 45. The second amendment would ensure that, if ministers wanted to use secondary legislation under the powers in the bill to change EU law, they would have to consult a joint committee of MPs and peers, and that if that committee ruled the changes were \u201csubstantial\u201d, the Commons and the Lords would get to vote on them. This was passed by 241 votes to 181 \u2013 a majority of 60. The Green party peer Jenny Jones posted this on Twitter after the votes. Nicola Sturgeon has implied that she will not resign from the Scottish National party following her arrest by police because doing might suggest she was guilty. The former first minister hosted a short press conference with reporters at Holyrood this afternoon to again insist she was wholly innocent of any wrongdoing, nine days after being arrested as a suspect by Police Scotland detectives. Pressed on why she had not resigned the SNP whip at Holyrood or voluntarily suspended her party membership, Sturgeon said she understood that argument \u2013 one forcibly put by Michelle Thomson, who was forced to resign the SNP whip in 2015 after being implicated in a mortgage misselling investigation. But Sturgeon has rejected it. She said: What that would do, I think, would be to compromise my ability and my right to assert the position that I hold absolutely, which is that I have done nothing wrong. Thomson and other Sturgeon critics believe the former SNP leader is guilty of hypocrisy: two ministers lost the whip after being accused of personal misconduct; several MPs have lost the whip pending investigations into financial or personal misconduct. By being arrested as a suspect as part of Police Scotland\u2019s investigation into the SNP\u2019s handling of over \u00a3600,000 in donations, she too has been implicated, her critics argue. Sturgeon said she always put the party\u2019s interests first. I will always consider, and I consider on an ongoing basis at all times, what\u2019s in the best interest of the SNP \u2013 a party I have given my all too, almost my entire life; an organisation that for me is not abstract. It\u2019s made up of my friends, my family, my colleagues. During a 10-minute question and answer session, Sturgeon also deflected questions on whether her husband, Peter Murrell, the SNP\u2019s former chief executive who was the first to be arrested by police, was innocent of wrongdoing. Sturgeon said: In a situation like this, I can only speak for myself and I am speaking for myself. There is also a difference between me and my husband. I\u2019m an elected politician. I\u2019m a public servant, and therefore there is an expectation, I think a legitimate expectation on your part, that I make statements and to the best of my ability answer questions; obviously Peter is not in that position. Here are the main points from George Osborne\u2019s evidence to the Covid inquiry this morning. Osborne said austerity, and getting the public finances under control, made the UK better placed to respond to Covid. (See 10.22am.) He said: The one thing I\u2019m sure of is there\u2019s no point having a contingency plan you can\u2019t pay for. And absolutely central to all of this is the ability of your economy and your public finances to flex in a crisis. He said he completely rejected claims that austerity had weakened the UK\u2019s health and social care capacity before Covid. (See 12.40pm.) And he rejected claims that austerity meant the poor were affected more by Covid. Asked if he was saying there was no link between austerity and Covid disproportionately affecting the most disadvantaged people, he said: That\u2019s absolutely my contention. It is true that pandemics will affect poorer people more severely and that is one of the great tragedies, which is why we tried to alleviate poverty and direct services towards them. I think everything we did to try and ringfence the NHS budget, to provide stable finances so that they were not further affected by a fiscal crisis, things like universal credit which were introduced, all of these things were done to try and protect the poorest part of the population. He rejected claims that he did not fund the NHS properly. Asked if funding for health was insufficient when he was chancellor, he replied: No, I don\u2019t accept that. I mean, what I accept is you could spend more money on the NHS, just like you could spend more money on the court system, more money on the school system, more money on the army. But you have to make a calculation of balancing the resources each of those services get, and the central calculation, which every household has to make, is what can we actually afford, because what\u2019s the revenue that\u2019s coming in? He said the Treasury had not planned for an emergency that might require a long lockdown \u2013 but he said that, even if it had, he was not sure policies like furlough would have been any better. He said: You\u2019re absolutely right that there was no planning done by the UK Treasury, or indeed as far as I\u2019m aware, any western treasury for asking the entire population to stay at home for months and months on end, essentially depriving large sectors of the economy like hospitality of all their customers for months and months to come \u2026 So yes, planning could have been done for a furlough scheme in advance. I\u2019m not clear, observing it at that point as just a citizen, I\u2019m not clear that would have made a better furlough scheme than the one we actually as a country saw. He said other countries had also not planned for lockdown. He said: You\u2019re right that there was no planning in Britain \u2013 or indeed as far as I\u2019m aware in France, Germany, the United States, or anywhere like that. It wasn\u2019t a groupthink unique to this country. There was no assumption that you would mandate that the population to stay at home for months and months on end so there was no planning for a lockdown. He said that there were \u201cdefinitely things that we could have done if this threat of a coronavirus pandemic had been identified in advance\u201d, including stockpiling PPE and respirators in hospitals. In the Times today Steven Swinford quotes a source close to Boris Johnson saying the former PM wants a truce with Rishi Sunak. Swinford says: A source close to Johnson said that he wanted to improve his relationship with Sunak and had all but given up on making a political comeback before the next election. \u201cHe\u2019s moving into a different phase,\u201d the source said. \u201cHe wants to de-escalate tensions with the government. He believes that his long-term interests are best served by refraining from agitating. He\u2019s in watching and waiting mode. But all of this is conditional on the Sunak government leaving him alone.\u201d Iain Martin, the Times columnist and publisher of the Reaction website, says there are claims that the Johnson ceasefire is linked to Sunak not voting for the privileges committee\u2019s report. Some 97,000 households across much of the UK that had their benefits capped included children, PA Media reports. PA says: The total number of capped households has increased by 3% in the latest quarter, according to the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) statistics. This means there were 2,900 more households subject to the benefit cap across England, Scotland and Wales as of February 2023 compared with November 2022 last year. Around 114,000 households had their benefits capped as of February 2023 and 86% of these included children. Some 70% of households that had their benefits capped are single-parent families, the DWP said. Action for Children said the cap \u2013 which was introduced in April 2013 and means the amount of benefit a household receives is reduced to ensure claimants do not receive more than the cap limit \u2013 \u201ccauses immense harm by unjustifiably pushing struggling families deeper into poverty\u201d. Benefit cap levels have recently gone up, but during the period covered by these figures the cap was \u00a320,000 a year (or \u00a313,400 for single adults with no children) nationally, and \u00a323,000 a year (or \u00a315,410 for single adults with no children) in London. At Treasury questions today Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, ruled out providing large-scale assistance to mortgage payers, through tax relief on their mortgage payments. Graeme Wearden has more on this story on his business live blog. Nadine Dorries, the former culture secretary, has said she is \u201cdisappointed\u201d by the report from the independent expert panel rejecting her complaint that she was bullied on Twitter by the SNP MP John Nicolson. (See 1.10pm.) At the Covid inquiry George Osborne was also asked about an Institute for Government report saying austerity had left the public services in a poor state to respond to the pandemic. As my colleague Ben Quinn reports, he did not accept that. Osborne has finished giving evidence now. I will post a summary of what he said soon. Here is John Crace\u2019s take. The SNP MP John Nicolson has been cleared of bullying and harassing Nadine Dorries, the former culture secretary, on Twitter. The parliamentary commissioner for standards, Daniel Greenberg, originally considered Dorries\u2019 complaint about Nicolson, and he concluded that the SNP MP had bullied Dorries when she was culture secretary. Dorries submitted her complaint in October 2022, and it related to tweets sent by Nicolson in November 2021, after Dorries gave evidence to the Commons culture committee, on which Nicolson sits. In a summary of the key complaints, today\u2019s independent expert panel report says: They were that over a 24-hour period in November 2021, Mr Nicolson had tweeted, liked or retweeted disparaging material about Nadine Dorries 168 times and that in the course of that time, he had \u201cliked\u201d tweets which described Ms Dorries as \u201cgrotesque\u201d, a \u201cvacuous goon\u201d, and as having been \u201cragdolled\u201d by him during parliamentary exchanges. The complaint was originally investigated by an investigator appointed under parliament\u2019s independent complaints and grievance scheme. The investigator said Nicolson had not broken bullying rules, but Greenberg disagreed and said Nicolson\u2019s conduct amounted to bullying and harassment. Greenberg said Nicolson\u2019s tweets amounted to \u201coffensive, intimidating, malicious or insulting behaviour\u201d and that as a result Dorries was \u201cleft feeling vulnerable, upset, undermined, humiliated, denigrated or threatened\u201d. But Nicolson appealed to the independent expert panel, and in its report today the IEP says what the MP did should not count as bullying and harassment. The IEP said there were three reasons why it thought Greenberg\u2019s ruling was flawed. 1) Greenberg did not enough account of the importance of MPs being able to engage in \u201clegitimate political activity\u201d. 2) Greenberg did not make enough allowance for Dorries\u2019 own record of aggressive tweeting. 3) Greenberg did not take into account when Dorries submitted her complaint. The IEP pointed out that Dorries only submitted her complaint in 2022, almost a year after Nicolson posted his messages on Twitter, but shortly after the Commons culture committee criticised her for making false claims about Channel 4 faking a reality TV documentary. And the IEP also said that Dorries\u2019 own Twitter use suggested that she was not quite as shocked by Nicolson\u2019s tweets as she suggested. The IEP said: The question whether she was genuinely shocked or disturbed is obviously capable of being affected by her own behaviour. If her own use of Twitter might at times be thought aggressive, or even threatening, it would suggest it was less likely that she was affected as she claimed \u2026 Some of the evidence provided to us demonstrates that the complainant herself has used strong language in tweeting, and that she has lodged complaints about others in the past. On one occasion she referred in a tweet to a journalist with whom she has had a sustained difficult relationship as \u201can apologist for Islamic atrocities\u201d. She then complained about the journalist to his employers. The complaint was dismissed. On another occasion a tabloid journalist was investigating the funding of the complainant\u2019s office and payments to one of her daughters. A press photographer took photographs of the complainant\u2019s (adult) daughter in the street near her home. Subsequently the complainant tweeted that she would \u201cnail [the journalist\u2019s] balls to the floor using [the journalist\u2019s] own front teeth\u201d. She explained this to the investigator by saying the photographer had taken photographs of her \u201cteenage\u201d daughter \u201cinside her house\u201d. The complainant lodged a complaint with the Independent Press Standards Organisation, which was rejected. On the Today programme this morning Mel Stride, the work and pensions secretary, said that Rishi Sunak would answer questions about the privileges committee report into Boris Johnson in due course. (See 9.22am.) As if, as the young people might say. At the Downing Street lobby briefing the PM\u2019s spokesperson was asked if he would finally say whether or not Sunak agreed with the committee\u2019s report. The spokesperson implied that Sunak is still in Trappist monk mode on this issue. He told reporters: The prime minister thanks the committee for their thorough work and fully respects the decision of the house on this matter. He has made clear it was rightly a matter for parliament and not for government. The spokesperson would not say how Sunak would have voted if he had been in the Commons for last night\u2019s vote. Asked if Sunak thought Boris Johnson did mislead MPs about Partygate, the spokesperson replied: He respects the decision the house has come to, this follows extensive work by the committee, but beyond that I don\u2019t have anything more to add. Asked if Sunak thought the matter was now closed, the spokesperson replied: \u201cYes.\u201d At the Covid inquiry, Kate Blackwell KC asked George Osborne if he agreed that his austerity policies had left the UK with \u201ca depleted health and social care capacity, and rising inequality\u201d. Osborne replied: Most certainly not. I completely reject that. I would make two points. The first of all, it is not surprising that the biggest economic crash that Britain experienced since the 1930s has an impact on Britain and on poverty and on unemployment, and on people\u2019s life chances. That\u2019s unfortunately what happens when your country experiences such a massive economic shock as we experienced in 2008-9. What flows from that is a whole set of things. And one of them is seriously impaired public finances which you then have to repair and that is what we set about doing. I would say if we had not done that, Britain would have been more exposed, not just to future things like the coronavirus pandemic, but indeed to the fiscal crisis which very rapidly followed in countries across Europe, such as Spain, Italy, Greece, Ireland, Slovenia, all across the continent \u2026 If we had not had a clear plan to put the public finances on a sustainable path, then Britain might have experienced a fiscal crisis, we would not have had the fiscal space to deal with the coronavirus pandemic when it hit seven years later. And indeed, as Mr Cameron pointed out yesterday, the example in many of those countries that did have those crises was there were real cuts in health services and other public services that went far beyond what the UK experienced. In the case of the NHS, actually budgets went up in real terms. The committee has just displayed this extract from the witness statement from Richard Hughes, head of the Office for Budget Responsibility. In it, Hughes says economists paid \u201cfar too little\u201d attention to the risk of a global pandemic in the decade before Covid. (I\u2019m sorry I do not have a clearer version. The inquiry has not published this yet.) Osborne quotes from a witness statement given to the Covid inquiry by Richard Hughes, head of the Office for Budget Responsibility. Hughes\u2019s statement has not been published, but Osborne quotes him as saying: In the absence of perfect foresight, fiscal space may be the most valuable risk tool above all. Osborne says this backs up his argument (see 10.22am) about how improving the state of the public finances put the country in a better position to deal with the pandemic. Osborne says other countries could not afford a lockdown because they were not as economically strong as the UK. George Osborne says it is hard to imagine a crisis like Covid not also turning into a financial or fiscal crisis. Q: Do you agree that the Treasury had not been planning for external shocks that could affect the economy? Osborne says the UK had an influenza plan. The Treasury had looked at the impact of that \u2013 the hit to GDP, and the impact of people being off work for a week or two. The Treasury had the capacity to deal with that, he says. For example, he says it had considered supply chain issues. But Osborne says no planning had been done for the impact of the entire population being asked to stay at home for months. He says no other country had planned for that either. If the Treasury had been asked to prepare for a lockdown lasting months, it would have prepared policies like furlough, he says. In the event, he says it turned out to be relatively easy to put schemes like furlough in place. Planning could have been done in advance, he says. But he goes on: I\u2019m not clear that would have made for a better furlough scheme than the one we actually saw. Kate Blackwell KC is questioning George Osborne on behalf of the inquiry. She starts by saying this hearing is not about the merits of Osborne\u2019s economic policy. It will only cover austerity in so far as it is relevant to the pandemic, she says. George Osborne, chancellor from 2010 until 2016, is giving evidence to the Covid inquiry now. He starts by saying he wants to express his heartfelt sympathy to all those who lost loved ones during the pandemic. He says he hopes the inquiry gets to the heart of what happened. Oliver Letwin, the Cabinet Office minister, told the Covid inquiry that it was a matter of \u201clasting regret\u201d to him that he had not focused on the threat from a flu pandemic when he was in charge of resilience. Yesterday David Cameron told the inquiry that his government has spent too much time preparing for a flu pandemic, and that as a result it had not prepared enough for another type of pandemic, like a coronavirus one. Letwin said that he was told he did not need to focus personally on flu pandemic planning because officials had already done a lot of work on this. But if he had devoted attention to this, he might have better realised the threat posed by a non-flu pandemic, he said. My great regret about not having focused on pandemic flu, because I was told it was being well looked after, is not actually about pandemic flu. But that it might have occurred to me if I had focused on that, that despite all the scientists had concluded, and no doubt they were right, that there was a very tiny probability by comparison with the probability of pandemic flu, of some other catastrophic pathogen \u2026 It might have occurred to me to say \u2018well, OK there\u2019s a tiny probability but can we for a tiny amount of money prepare properly to deal with it in advance? Letwin also said he was not blaming officials for giving him poor advice in this respect. Actually it is absolutely not an excuse for a minister, alas, because you can always ask the following question, you don\u2019t have to accept the advice. That is actually what I should\u2019ve done and it\u2019s a matter of lasting regret that I didn\u2019t. Here are some of the main points from Oliver Letwin\u2019s evidence to the Covid inquiry so far. Letwin, the former Cabinet Office minister, said there should be a senior minister in government with sole responsibility for resilience, including preparing for pandemics. Letwin was responsible for resilience, but he had many other responsibilities too. He told the inquiry: Actually there really ought to be a minister solely devoted to resilience at a senior level. Asked if anyone had ever had this role, he replied: There hasn\u2019t, as far as I\u2019m aware and I think that is an error. I came to that view very gradually but by the end of my time I was pretty convinced that we ought to have, and had I remained in situ I would\u2019ve tried therefore to move to a model, where somebody took that position. Letwin also said that having a junior minister doing this job would \u201cachieve nothing\u201d because the resilience minister should be senior and close to the prime minister. Letwin said the high turnover of ministers and civil servants responsible for resilience was a \u201cdisaster for the country\u201d. He said the ministers and officials should receive training for dealing with civil emergencies, and he said there was a need for \u201ca system that keeps both ministers and officials in post long enough so they can use the training\u201d. He said: I\u2019m pretty certain that the entire structure of the civil service means that you can\u2019t really make progress in a career without going through endless different jobs one after another, which I regard as a disaster for the country, particularly disastrous in the case of things that have very long lead times and where learning from experience is critical. Oliver Letwin, who as Cabinet Office minister was responsible for resilience in David Cameron\u2019s government, has been giving evidence to the Covid inquiry. George Osborne is on later. ITV\u2019s Anushka Asthana has been tweeting on Letwin\u2019s evidence. George Osborne, the former chancellor, will be giving evidence to the Covid inquiry later this morning. The inquiry is focusing at this stage on how prepared the UK was to deal with a pandemic, and Osborne will be questioned about the impact of austerity. He has submitted a 38-page witness statement to the inquiry. It has not been published in full yet, but the committee has released one page from it, because it was cited during the hearing yesterday, and in it Osborne claims that that his austerity measures, which he describes as \u201ccutting the deficit\u201d, had a \u201cpositive\u201d effect on the country\u2019s ability to withstand Covid. He says: Reducing the deficit and placing debt as a percentage of GDP on a downward path was also essential to rebuild fiscal space to provide scope to respond to future economic shocks. A responsible approach to repairing the UK\u2019s public finances following the financial crisis was essential. I have no doubt that taking those steps to repair the UK\u2019s public finances in the years following the financial crisis of 2008/09 had a material and positive effect on the UK\u2019s ability to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic. Scotland\u2019s first-ever recall petition for a sitting MP opened this morning following the suspension of Margaret Ferrier from the House of Commons, PA Media reports. PA says: From 9am, voters in Rutherglen and Hamilton West will have the chance to sign a petition to recall their MP from Westminster. If 10% of the electorate choose to do so \u2013 some 8,113 people out of 81,124 \u2013 then a by-election will be triggered. Despite pressure to resign from her seat since breaching coronavirus rules, Ferrier remains the MP, now sitting as an independent. She urged voters not to sign the petition, saying her constituents are her \u201ctop priority\u201d. Tobias Ellwood, the Conservative MP who chairs the Commons defence committee, has said that Shaun Bailey should consider turning down the peerage he was given in Boris Johnson\u2019s resignation honours list because of his attendance at a Partygate event. Ben Quinn has the story here. Good morning. MPs voted last night, by 354 votes to 7, to accept the privileges committee report saying that Boris Johnson deliberately misled them about Partygate, but even though he is now out of parliament, and condemned as a liar in a report actively endorsed by more than half of the Commons, he is still having a corrosive impact on Tory politics. That was illustrated this morning when Mel Stride, the work and pensions secretary, gave an interview to the Today programme. Stride said that he accepted the conclusions of the privileges committee report, but that he had doubts about the severity of the notional penalty applied (a 90-day suspension, if Johnson had still been an MP \u2013 Stride thought this was too harsh), and so that is why he was one of the 225 Conservatives who did not vote. But it was after that, when the Johnson questions kept coming, that Stride started to struggle. Stride admitted that he did not know what Rishi Sunak thought about the report. Sunak did not vote yesterday, and Stride defended this, saying the PM was busy. He said: What I do know is I know that he had some long standing engagements yesterday, including with the Swedish prime minister and the Jewish Care event in the evening. Stride said Sunak did not express a view before the vote, because he did not want to influence MPs on something that was not a goverment matter, and Stride defended this. Stride said he did not know if Sunak thought, as he did, that the proposed punishment was too harsh. But he said he had \u201cno doubt\u201d that Sunak would answers questions on this in due course. Stride refused to say that he thought it would be unacceptable to return as a Conservative MP. He said he wanted the party to move on: I think really the caravan has got to move on from Boris Johnson, with respect. But, when asked if he thought it would be acceptable for Johnson to return, he said: I can\u2019t read the future. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right for me to come on your programme and start speculating on the future. Asked again if he would find Johnson acceptable as a Tory colleague in the future, he replied: I\u2019m not going to be drawn in speculating on the future of Boris Johnson. Stride failed to defend Johnson\u2019s resignation honours list in its entirety, suggesting that it might be right for Shaun Bailey, the former Tory mayoral candidate, to refuse his peerage. Bailey\u2019s peerage is in jeopardy because, just a week after it announced, the Mirror released a video of a Tory \u201cjingle and mingle\u201d party he attended that is being investigated by the police as a potential breach of lockdown rules. It was organised by Bailey\u2019s campaign team. Asked if he agreed that Bailey\u2019s peerage was in question, Stride said he did not want to prejudge the investigation. Asked if Bailey definitely would become a peer, Stride declined to say. Asked if he accepted that the Johnson honours list had not been good for the party, Stride said: I think its down to Boris Johnson who he put forward. Alastair Campbell, the former Labour spin doctor who hates Johnson, and most of the Conservative party too, is about the last person you would consult for an objective view. But this tweet does give a sense of quite how much difficulty Stride was in dealing with these questions. In the debate yesterday Penny Mordaunt, leader of the Commons, suggested Johnson was responsible for the \u201cdebasement of our honours system\u201d. Eventually we will get on to some political news that isn\u2019t about Johnson. Here is the agenda for the day. Morning; Rishi Sunak chairs cabinet. 10am: Oliver Letwin, the former Cabinet Office minister, gives evidence to the Covid inquiry. Later in the morning George Osborne, the former chancellor, will give evidence. 11.30am: Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, takes questions in the Commons. 11.30m: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing. After 3pm: Peers vote on Commons amendments to the retained EU law (revocation and reform) bill. 4pm: David Lammy, the shadow foreign secretary, speaks at Best for Britain\u2019s Trade Unlocked conference.

Prof Dame Sally Davies, who described her role as CMO from 2010 to 2019 as \u201cthe nation\u2019s doctor\u201d, was being cross-examined at the UK Covid-19 public inquiry about shortcomings in the nation\u2019s preparedness when she said \u201cmaybe this is the moment to say how sorry I am to the relatives who lost their families\u201d. Close to tears, Davies said: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just the deaths, it was the way they died. It was horrible. And I heard a lot about it from my daughter on the frontline, as a young doctor in Scotland. It was harrowing and it remains horrible.\u201d She also said sorry for the failure of the government to plan for lockdowns, and said of the effects on children: \u201cWe have damaged a generation and it is awful.\u201d Davies said there had been too much \u201cgroupthink\u201d and there should have been more external challenge to the UK\u2019s approach of planning mainly for a flu pandemic. \u201cI tried,\u201d she said. \u201cFollowing a visit to Hong Kong where I learned a lot about Sars, I did ask unofficially \u2018what about doing a Sars review\u2019 and was told \u2018oh no it won\u2019t come here\u2019.\u201d The Department of Health and Social Care has already told the inquiry it would have benefited from a fuller understanding of the response by Asian countries to previous coronavirus outbreaks, including Sars and Mers, said Hugo Keith KC, counsel to the inquiry. Death tolls in several Asian countries from Covid-19 were far lower than the UK. The UK had an influenza pandemic strategy document, which said the plan could be adapted for a Sars outbreak. Asked why a strategy for a non-flu pandemic was not produced, Davies said she preferred to run exercises gauging preparedness, such as those that were run for E coli and Mers \u2013 the latter in 2016 and known as exercise Alice. \u201cThere was more we should have done,\u201d she said. Davies was speaking after the former chancellor George Osborne denied austerity had left Britain vulnerable, as the public inquiry continued its six-week investigation into UK preparedness. She attacked disinvestment in public health in the years before the pandemic, saying: \u201cYou can\u2019t get a good outcome if you don\u2019t have resilience in the public\u2019s health, resilience in the public health system \u2013 it has been disinvested in. \u201cAnd on comparator data \u2026 we were at the bottom of the table on number of doctors, number of beds, number of ITUs [intensive therapy units], number of ventilators. We needed resilience in social care. That was clearly missing.\u201d After David Cameron gave evidence on Monday, Osborne defended spending cuts in the 2010s. \u201cIf we had not had a clear plan to put the public finances on a sustainable path then Britain might have experienced a fiscal crisis, we would not have had the fiscal space to deal with the coronavirus pandemic when it hit,\u201d said Osborne. Asked whether he saw no connection between austerity and Covid disproportionately affecting the most disadvantaged people, Osborne said: \u201cThat\u2019s absolutely my contention.\u201d The Trades Union Congress, a core participant in the inquiry, said Osborne was \u201ctrying to rewrite history and gaslight the British public\u201d. Also on Tuesday, the former Cabinet Office minister Oliver Letwin, responsible for emergency planning in the coalition government, said Britain\u2019s whole system of critical national infrastructure remained\u201cwildly under-resilient\u201d. He said it was an \u201cerror\u201d that no government had appointed a senior minister with sole responsibility over planning for pandemics and other areas of resilience. He described the churn of ministers and officials tasked with preparing for emergencies as a \u201cdisaster for the country\u201d. The inquiry continues on Wednesday with the cross-examination of the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, who was previously the health secretary."}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db5ac", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/20/roy-hodgson-expected-to-extend-record-as-leagues-oldest-manager-with-crystal-palace", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Crystal Palace keen for Hodgson to stay and extend oldest manager record", "lead": "The 75-year-old has been in talks over a one-year contract extension despite the club having considered other candidates including Graham Potter", "author": "Ed Aarons", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 16:38:09", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.991979", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/6f961fca84937c660942ef83fd28c1e10b36b235/1_265_3370_2022/500.jpg", "body": "Crystal Palace have considered candidates including Graham Potter for their manager\u2019s job but are still expected to persuade Roy Hodgson to stay on despite the 75-year-old\u2019s reservations about continuing for another season. Hodgson steered Palace to safety by earning five victories from eight games after replacing Patrick Vieira in March and has held talks with the chairman, Steve Parish, over a one-year contract that would extend the former England coach\u2019s record as the league\u2019s oldest manager. Parish is also believed to have discussed several other contenders for the post including Potter, who was sacked by Chelsea at the start of April, Nottingham Forest\u2019s Steve Cooper and Brendan Rodgers, who has since rejoined Celtic. Hodgson, who turns 76 three days before Palace travel to Sheffield United for their opening fixture, remains the frontrunner. Any deal would include retaining Ray Lewington, his long-term ally, as first-team coach and his assistant Paddy McCarthy, the former Palace captain who took charge of the loss to Arsenal in March after Vieira was sacked as a result of a winless start to 2023. McCarthy is highly rated by the Palace hierarchy and seen as a potential future manager having begun his coaching career with the club\u2019s under-18s after retiring from playing in 2016. Last week Eberechi Eze paid tribute to Hodgson\u2019s \u201cinsane wisdom\u201d and credited him for his England call-up, which brought the 25-year-old a first cap as a substitute in Malta.

Sergei Shoigu, the Russian defence minister, said on Tuesday that the potential use of US-supplied Himars and UK-supplied Storm Shadow missiles against targets in Crimea would mark the west\u2019s \u201cfull involvement in the conflict and would entail immediate strikes upon decision-making centres in Ukrainian territory\u201d. Those are seen to include the Ukrainian presidential administration and intelligence headquarters. Russia has issued similar threats before, but the latest comments come as Kyiv is launching a counteroffensive into south and eastern Ukraine to retake land occupied by Russia since the early days of the war. Shoigu claimed without providing evidence that Ukraine was preparing a strike against Crimea using the missiles. The Russian ultimatum comes one day after Joe Biden said that the threat of Vladimir Putin authorising a tactical nuclear strike was \u201creal\u201d, shortly after the Kremlin leader announced the first deployment of those weapons to neighbouring Belarus since the fall of the Soviet Union. Ukraine has denounced Russian blackmail tactics, saying it intends to return control over all its lands occupied by Russia, including Crimea. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the Ukrainian presidential administration, said: \u201cIt is important to understand that the presence or absence of nuclear weapons in Russia is not a variable that affects the overall equation of this war, and nuclear threats should not in any way influence the decision of Ukrainians to defend themselves or the decision of our allies to support us.\u201d The Swedish Defence Research Agency released a report on Tuesday saying that Russia was planning for a prolonged confrontation with the west and was neither planning to end the war nor seek detente. The risk of an escalation was also growing, the report said. \u201cAs Russia\u2019s ground forces are severely battered, the importance of nuclear weapons increases,\u201d said Maria Engqvist, an analyst for the organisation. Dmitri Trenin, a prominent Russian foreign policy thinker who has grown more aggressive since the invasion, wrote on Tuesday that Russia should modernise its nuclear doctrine in order to show that the use of nuclear weapons is a \u201creal, and not just theoretical possibility\u201d. He wrote: \u201cThe possibility of using nuclear weapons during the current conflict should not be hidden.\u201d At the weekend, Putin swiftly rejected a peace plan proposed by African leaders from seven countries that called for de-escalation and security guarantees. Volodymyr Zelenskiy had also rejected the plan, calling it unworkable. The Ukrainian president had earlier said that negotiations with the Kremlin were impossible. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said that the military alliance would not strong-arm Ukraine into suing for a peace that was not \u201cjust and enduring\u201d. The Russian foreign minister on Tuesday responded by saying the Kremlin was ready to continue its war in Ukraine. \u201cIt means that they want to fight,\u201d he said of Stoltenberg\u2019s remarks. \u201cWell, let them fight. We are ready for that.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db5ae", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/20/royal-ascot-day-two-luxembourg-in-good-form-for-prince-of-waless-stakes", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Royal Ascot day two: Luxembourg in good form for Prince of Wales\u2019s Stakes", "lead": "Adayar and My Prospero also run in the strongest contest of the week while Crimson Advocate looks a contender at 2.30", "author": "Greg Wood", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 16:24:38", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.992015", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/a9b1c75a34630f538e401d30d235480514289a2c/30_0_2786_1671/500.jpg", "body": "The second-day crowd at Royal Ascot was denied a rare meeting of two Derby winners when Desert Crown was ruled out of the Prince of Wales\u2019s Stakes this month, but it is a sign of the depth in the six-runner field that the feature event on Wednesday may well still prove to be the strongest contest of the week. Adayar, the Derby winner in 2021, is joined by Bay Bridge and My Prospero, completing the 1-2-3 from last season\u2019s Champion Stakes over course and distance, while Luxembourg, who was denied a run in Desert Crown\u2019s Derby by injury, went on to land the Irish Champion Stakes last season. Any one of the four would be a worthy winner but Luxembourg (4.20) arrives in the best form of all, having beaten Bay Bridge by half a length at the Curragh last month. That run was up to the level of his Champion Stakes success and with only nine starts in the form book so far, there is also a chance of further improvement as the season unfolds. Ascot 2.30 A daunting field of 28 juvenile fillies to open the second afternoon but this is a race that has been won from stall 13 or below once in the past decade, which helps to narrow things down a little. There is still no end of possibilities, but the US-trained Crimson Advocate has an excellent draw near the rail, showed excellent gate speed at Gulfstream Park last month, stayed on well to go further clear in the closing stages and has John Velazquez booked to ride. Ascot 3.05 Adelaise is in the early stages of her career with Joseph O\u2019Brien, with only two starts for the yard and was an eye-catcher on her seasonal debut at the Curragh last month, finishing within a length of the winner despite being switched a furlong out. That was her first start for 244 days and she is off just a 1lb higher mark here. Ascot 3.40 Unraced at two, Grande Dame progressed steadily last season and rounded off the campaign with a two-and-a-half length third in the Group One Sun Chariot Stakes. This could be the ideal starting-out point for a successful four-year-old career. Ascot 5.00 Dunum has a remarkable record since joining Natalia Lupini\u2019s Irish stable at the start of last season, racking up five wins and two close second-place finishes. He was touched off in a big field at the Curragh last time after travelling well throughout and must be worth an each-way interest at around 16-1. Ascot 5.35 The step up to 14 furlongs looks sure to suit Circle Of Fire, who did well in the circumstances to finish third in the Lingfield Derby Trial last time. Ascot 6.10 Maximum Impact has been flawless in his two starts to date, winning both in a useful time, and can extend his streak to three."}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db5af", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/20/id-like-to-see-more-black-surfers-the-student-turning-the-tide-on-diversity-in-surfing", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018I\u2019d like to see more black surfers\u2019: the UK student turning the tide on diversity in surfing", "lead": "While studying for his GCSEs, Siyanda Hewitt, 16, has become the first UK-based black professional junior surfer", "author": "Steven Morris", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 16:15:22", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.992041", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/84a894e047cbaaf7f50e0801ee136831ade34122/158_96_4610_2765/500.jpg", "body": "When he first joined the Croyde \u201cgrom pack\u201d \u2013 the gang of young surfers whose passion is catching waves off the seaside village on the north Devon coast \u2013 Siyanda Hewitt was taken aback that he was the only black person out there. \u201cIt was a bit of a shock, to be honest,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was weird not to see any black surfers.\u201d Five years on Siyanda, 16, has become the first UK-based black professional junior surfer. On Wednesday, two days after finishing his GCSEs, he is flying out of Heathrow at the start of a world tour during which he will train in South Africa, the Maldives and California, in preparation for next year\u2019s contest circuit. He hopes eventually to compete on the adult circuit, perhaps even make it to the Olympics \u2013 and inspire others to give surfing a go. \u201cI\u2019d like to see more, a lot more black surfers try surfing,\u201d he said. \u201cAccess can be a problem. It can be expensive to buy a board or get surf lessons. It\u2019s a shame.\u201d Siyanda grew up in South Africa, where his father, activist and surfer Tom Hewitt was the founder of Surfers Not Street Children, which worked with homeless street children and introduced them to the sport. \u201cI was five or six when I started,\u201d said Siyanda. \u201cAll the kids who were surfing were black. I got hooked on it.\u201d When Tom Hewitt and Siyanda\u2019s mum, Bulelwa, re-located to the UK, they set up in north Devon because of its world-class breaks. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t quite the same here,\u201d said Siyanda. \u201cIn Durban I was mostly surfing with black surfers. Here there were hardly any. A few in the summer, none in the winter, none in competitions.\u201d While Siyanda\u2019s surfing improved dramatically, combining school work at Braunton Academy with his passion for the sport was a challenge. \u201cIt could be difficult to juggle surfing and school, especially in the winter. I\u2019d be doing my studies and see great waves but have only 30 minutes of light left. That was annoying. In summer it was fine. You can study, surf and still have time to study afterwards.\u201d Now standing at 6ft 2ins he has become known as a fine \u201cpower surfer\u201d able to put in dramatic carving turns, throwing off huge spray and, unusually for a surfer with a larger frame, has a great \u201cair game\u201d \u2013 his ability to get skip clear of the waves. Siyanda\u2019s skill, and story, made him a name in British \u201cfree surfing\u201d (non-competition surfing), but he is keen to become a contest surfer. He has now been sponsored by a range of surf and beach clothing brands \u2013 plus a Devon wellbeing centre \u2013 to train overseas for a year. Asked why he wanted to compete when good money was to be made out of free surfing by producing content for online channels, Siyanda said: \u201cIt\u2019s wanting to win, being hungry to win. When you win it feels good and that\u2019s pretty addictive.\u201d Tom Hewitt said since the Black Lives Matter movement, surfing across the world had been thinking hard about its image. \u201cThe sport has had to look at itself and its lack of diversity. The blond, blue-eyed male surfer image sold T-shirts over the years but there has been a lot of introspection.\u201d As well as looking forward to training on some of the world\u2019s great beaches, Siyanda is keen to return to a contest first staged last year called A Great Day In The Stoke at Huntington Beach in California, billed as the \u201cthe largest gathering of black surfers in history\u201d. Siyanda said: \u201cMost contests are dominated by white surfers. That one gives black surfers a chance.\u201d When he\u2019s not training, Siyanda will have to find time to study as he taking two A-levels \u2013 geography and sociology. He will also be acting as an ambassador for Surfers Not Street Children and The Wave, the inland surfing centre near Bristol. Despite it all, he says he does not feel under pressure to be a spokesperson for black surfers. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s pressure but if other black people see me and think, oh, there are black surfers and are encouraged, that would be good.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db5b0", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/20/taylor-swift-eras-tour-to-reach-the-uk-and-europe-in-summer-2024", "primaryCategory": "music", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Taylor Swift\u2019s Eras tour to reach the UK and Europe in summer 2024", "lead": "The pop star will play twenty-six stadium dates, including four nights at Wembley, following huge success in the US leg of the career-spanning tour", "author": "Ben Beaumont-Thomas", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 16:14:24", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.992059", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/29f1a1efe1fa5c97e87f5dffb7bc5c14c4b14349/390_444_2211_1326/500.jpg", "body": "Taylor Swift\u2019s Eras tour, whose three-hour, career-spanning shows have made it a huge critical and commercial success in the US, is to arrive in the UK and Europe. The tour encompasses 26 stadium dates, beginning 9 May 2024 in Paris, followed by gigs in Stockholm, Madrid, Lisbon and Lyon. The UK leg then begins on 7 June with two dates in Edinburgh, followed by two in Liverpool, one in Cardiff, and two in London\u2019s Wembley Stadium. Dublin, Amsterdam, Zurich, Milan, Gelsenkirchen, Hamburg, Munich, Warsaw and Vienna follow, with two further Wembley Stadium dates closing the tour on 16 and 17 August. Registration for tickets is now open. Eras is Swift\u2019s first world tour since 2018, since when she has released four new studio albums. After 2019\u2019s lovestruck pop album Lover, she spent the years when touring plans were disrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic writing and recording a pair of more intimate, folksy records: Folklore and Evermore, both released in 2020. Midnights followed in 2022 and turned back towards pop, with songs rendered in pulsating synth-focused productions. The tour has been acclaimed for its use of three stages made of digital display units, allowing Swift to execute eye-catching tricks such as appearing to dive into a swimming pool and emerge in an entirely new outfit. Billboard has estimated gross ticket revenue from the US tour to be $591m, though that figure is based on average ticket prices \u2013 in an era of \u201cdynamic pricing\u201d by ticket companies, where what fans pay can change depending on demand, such estimates could easily fluctuate. Ticketmaster saw enormous demand for the US tour, with 2.4m tickets sold in a single day: a new record. But the company was unprepared for the number of fans for the pre-sale period, and had to cancel a public sale of tickets, leading to a fan group suing the company. Swift said she was \u201cpissed off\u201d with Ticketmaster and the company apologised. But the fiasco led to debates in the US Congress over whether Ticketmaster and its parent company Live Nation hold too great a share of the live music marketplace. A message regarding the UK and Europe tour warns hopeful fans: \u201cRegistration does not guarantee access to the sale or to tickets.\u201d Some who do definitely qualify are those who were incentivised to buy Midnights from Swift\u2019s own store, which ensured they had future access to the tour pre-sale \u2013 the tactic helped Midnights become the fastest-selling album of 2022, beating Arctic Monkeys to No 1 in a fierce chart battle. In a five-star review of the tour\u2019s opening night in Glendale, Arizona, on 17 March, the Guardian\u2019s Adrian Horton described it as \u201cindisputably epic ... in sheer scope of songs and devotion to lyrics, no artist can match her\u201d. Regarding Swift\u2019s notoriously intense fans, she wrote: \u201csuch intensity, courted by Swift with notorious Easter egging and rewarding, can be eyeroll-inducing. But when viewed from inside the Swiftieverse, in a deafening stadium she comfortably commanded for over three hours, it is rapturous.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db5b1", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/20/rachel-daly-says-england-will-step-up-for-womens-world-cup-as-buildup-has-been-perfect", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Rachel Daly defends England\u2019s World Cup preparations after early arrivals", "lead": "Rachel Daly denied players were bullied by the FA into an early meet-up and said the squad has great depth despite injuries and retirements", "author": "Sachin Nakrani", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 16:10:07", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.992076", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/39f5ece500f3e3898b3c06f79af5a96231cc49a7/0_128_5406_3244/500.jpg", "body": "Rachel Daly has defended England\u2019s long and controversial buildup to the Women\u2019s World Cup, describing the squad coming together more than a month before their opening match as \u201cperfect\u201d. The Lionesses arrived at their St George\u2019s Park base on Monday and had their first training session on Tuesday in preparation for a warm-up game against Portugal in Milton Keynes on 1 July. Players and staff fly to a training camp on Queensland\u2019s Sunshine Coast on 5 July in advance of facing Haiti in Brisbane on 22 July. That means they will have been together for a somewhat remarkable 33 days before kicking their first competitive ball in anger in Australia \u2013 something that has caused outrage among Women\u2019s Super League clubs, who feel their England players were bullied into accepting the 19 June meet-up date by the Football Association. Daly has insisted that was not the case, stating that every member of the squad was more than happy to join up when requested to do so by the FA, having had more than three weeks off after the WSL season. \u201cFor me it\u2019s perfect, and the girls agreed on that,\u201d the 31-year-old said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had enough time to have a rest and have a holiday, completely switch off mentally and physically. \u201cIt\u2019s scientifically proven; it\u2019s not just picking a date and all of us joining up. This date has been planned since the Euros, I\u2019m sure, by the backroom staff in regards to the physical side of things. I feel like we\u2019re in a great spot.\u201d All 23 members of Sarina Wiegman\u2019s squad, and the three reserves, are at St George\u2019s Park, with only the stand-in captain Millie Bright and Jordan Nobbs missing training. Both underwent individual programmes as they continue their recovery from knee surgery and a minor injury respectively. The session, which was open to the media on a grey and wet morning, was sharp and competitive, something Daly believes reflects the healthy state England find themselves in as they seek to add a world title to the European one secured on home soil 11 months ago. At the very least they want to reach the final, which takes place in Sydney on 20 August, having reached the semi-finals at the World Cup in France four years ago. \u201cThis squad is completely different [to 2019],\u201d Daly said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got injuries, we\u2019ve had players retiring and now we\u2019ve got young faces and new people, and with that we\u2019ve got great depth. Sarina\u2019s picked a fantastic squad and the really good thing about this squad is that everyone\u2019s able to step up.\u201d No one looks more ready to step up at the World Cup than Daly. She was named WSL player of the season after a sensational debut campaign for Aston Villa during which she scored 22 goals and provided six assists for Carla Ward\u2019s side, becoming the first English winner of the golden boot since Ellen White in 2018. \u201cI\u2019ve had a pretty good year,\u201d the left-back-come-striker said. \u201cI can put it down to happiness; the way Carla\u2019s given me freedom at the club to play my own game. The team around me has also been brilliant.

I cannot give it 12 months and say: \u2018I am not playing so I am going to leave.\u2019 As you have seen with many players at City, it can take quite a while to cement yourself into the team.\u201d The 27-year-old, unable thus far to dislodge Rodri, has discussed with teammates the difficult transition sometimes experienced when joining the club. \u201cI spoke to quite a few of the players about it,\u201d he said. \u201cNathan Ak\u00e9 being one; Jack [Grealish]. They all said the same: the first 12 months were the hardest of their City careers but after that it \u2026 it doesn\u2019t become easy, but easier. I\u2019m just going to go away for the off-season and enjoy myself with my family and girlfriend and friends and then come back fighting.\u201d Phillips believes he is close to mastering what his manager wants. He referred to \u201chow difficult it is to understand the way Pep wants to play and how quickly you need to adapt\u201d and said: \u201cI am on the brink of almost getting it. Obviously there is a little bit of work in pre-season and hopefully [it will] be all right.\u201d He intends to have a discussion with Guardiola. \u201cI will definitely speak to Pep. I don\u2019t know whether it will be in the summer because everyone enjoys their downtime and everyone wants their space away from football, so I\u2019ll probably leave it until I go back.\u201d An early assignment for City will be the Community Shield against Arsenal on Sunday 6 August. The Football Association has changed the kick-off from 5.30pm to 4pm after complaints from City fans, some of whom said they would boycott, and contact from the club. A City spokesperson said: \u201cWhilst we understand that this will not fully alleviate travel issues for our fans and our preference would have been for an earlier kick-off time still, we hope that the new kick-off time of 4pm will make a difference.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db5b3", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/20/lusty-singalongs-and-brexit-portents-the-eternal-flame-of-the-wicker-man-soundtrack", "primaryCategory": "music", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Lusty singalongs and Brexit portents: the eternal flame of The Wicker Man soundtrack", "lead": "With British folk songs done by a New Yorker, the soundtrack disappeared for decades \u2013 but has now become a touchstone for artists journeying to a nation\u2019s dark heart", "author": "Fergal Kinney", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 16:00:37", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.992126", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/228be8ee6289e2df761f9d489e96ae806a7d086b/0_162_3316_1989/500.jpg", "body": "It\u2019s one of the most disturbing juxtapositions in British cinema: a gigantic wicker figure blazes in a moment of shocking violence as a semicircle of people smilingly incant a traditional English folk song. The 1973 British film The Wicker Man drew its horror from Britain\u2019s pagan past, and indeed its music \u2013 the soundtrack, fusing traditionals with new compositions and bawdy pub singalongs, is now widely recognised as a classic. But the film\u2019s initial failure and the long disappearance of the recordings meant that when the little-known US theatre director and musician Paul Giovanni died in 1990, he likely believed his soundtrack had been entirely forgotten. Instead, its importance is being minted this month by a concert at London\u2019s high-cultural Barbican centre. The Wicker Man, created by screenwriter Anthony Shaffer and director Robin Hardy, concerns a devout Christian police officer who investigates an alleged disappearance in the fictional rural community of Summerisle, shot on location in Dumfries and Galloway in southern Scotland. It was soundtracked, though, by a jobbing New Yorker. Born in New Jersey in 1933, Giovanni had fronted psych-pop band Side Show before scoring an experimental folk-rock production of Twelfth Night, which Shaffer had caught by chance on a visit to the US. The steady masculine baritone heard on Wicker Man tracks such as Corn Rigs and Gently Johnny is Giovanni\u2019s \u2013 he briefly appears in the film singing the latter track. \u201cPaul wanted to work with students because he thought they would be cheaper,\u201d says Gary Carpenter, who had just graduated from the Royal College of Music when he was hired for the film\u2019s session band Magnet. \u201cHe would sing the songs and I\u2019d write them down and flesh them out.\u201d The soundtrack became a grab-bag of assorted music including the Middle English song Sumer Is Icumen In, a new arrangement of the Robert Burns ballad Rigs O\u2019Barley and children\u2019s nursery rhymes. Original Giovanni compositions such as the sensual Willow\u2019s Song and incidental psychedelic guitar music owed much to the contemporaneous UK folk rock boom of Pentangle and Fairport Convention. Lesley Mackie was cast as schoolgirl Daisy then invited to the soundtrack\u2019s London recording sessions to sing The Highland Widow\u2019s Lament. \u201cI remember being handed \u00a320 as I left the session,\u201d says Mackie. \u201cIt was that casual, but I just loved being there. Paul was a lovely human being.\u201d Infamously, the film tanked, seen as the B-movie flipside to Don\u2019t Look Now\u2019s high-class horror. \u201cIf I mentioned on my CV that I was involved in The Wicker Man, for at least 10 years afterwards it was tumbleweed,\u201d says Carpenter. No soundtrack recording was released, and the film\u2019s fall into obscurity echoed a wider decline in the UK folk scene in the late 1970s as an unusually high number of key performers either died or left the industry. Much later, in 1988, BBC Two commissioned the late night series Moviedrome, whose remit was to show cult films with recorded introductions by cinema scholar Alex Cox. Its first film was the UK TV premiere of The Wicker Man, and this was the starting gun for an underground revival of the film. Jonny Trunk, part of a new wave of crate-digging film music collectors, could barely come back from the pub in the early 1990s without a friend putting on a VHS rip of the film. \u201cThere\u2019s a graveyard scene with some flute music and I thought it was one of the most beautiful pieces of music I\u2019d ever heard,\u201d says Trunk, \u201cI thought, I need to get that on a piece of vinyl.\u201d It took him three years of letter writing and unanswered phone calls as the film rights leapfrogged between companies. Trunk eventually cut a deal with distributor Canal+ who would authorise the soundtrack if he could find it. \u201cI went into the vaults of Pinewood Studios,\u201d Trunk says. \u201cWe located 13 enormous musical effects tapes which they set up on these flat reel-to-reel players.\u201d The first sound Trunk heard was the chopping of aeroplane propellers against a low harmonium drone: the opening sounds of the film. \u201cIt was one of the most exciting moments of my entire life.\u201d The 1998 release sold quicker than Trunk could press them up. \u201cChristopher Lee went bonkers,\u201d remembers Trunk of the veteran actor who had long called The Wicker Man his finest work. \u201cHe asked me to research Tinkers of Rye. The English Folk Song and Dance Society came back and said it was just made up. He was devastated.\u201d An official release based on tapes owned by Carpenter would be released by Silva Screen in 2002. \u201cI think Jonny Trunk releasing The Wicker Man soundtrack kind of rewrote history,\u201d says comedian Stewart Lee approvingly, who first owned a bootleg of the soundtrack ripped from the Moviedrome broadcast. \u201cIt made younger musicians think that acid folk\u201d \u2013 a genre name applied in the 00s to the psychedelic folk of the 60s and 70s \u2013 \u201cwas a bigger thing than it was. The genre was almost retroactively created by The Wicker Man.\u201d Suddenly in the 00s, UK folk acts were forming in the image and likeness of the soundtrack \u2013 Trembling Bells, United Bible Studies, the Owl Service \u2013 while acid folk became a prized tag among collectors, compilers and DJs. Another genre, hauntology (most associated with Ghost Box Records), became an artistic movement which used the forgotten cultures of the 1970s such as The Wicker Man to comment on lost futures in our capitalist present. David Bramwell, with singer Eliza Skelton, began hosting Sing-Along-a-Wicker Man events in Brighton in 2009. \u201cIt started out as a 25-capacity thing but the buzz got around,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was more inspired by Vic and Bob than the polished singalongs you get at some cinemas.\u201d By 2023, there have been more than 100 events across the UK. \u201cThe Landlord\u2019s Daughter is sung the most lustily,\u201d says Bramwell, \u201cit\u2019s a good knees-up and you can slap your thighs to it. Festival audiences are the rowdiest and we like that; people just lean into it.\u201d British festival culture would more broadly be shaped by the film\u2019s revival. Scotland\u2019s Wickerman alternative festival ran from 2001 to 2015 while Wales\u2019 Green Man festival culminates with a similar ritual burning each year. Where in the early 1990s, new age travellers burned DIY wicker men at Glastonbury, in 2023 the film will be screened as part of the festival\u2019s official programme. The soundtrack would find a new resonance during the political shocks of the last decade. \u201cBrexit had just happened,\u201d says electronic producer Gazelle Twin of her decision to record a hypnotic and sinister reimagining of the soundtrack\u2019s Fire Leap with the NYX drone choir, \u201cand I wanted to explore what being English meant to me. I wanted to shine a light on some of these falsehoods that Christianity might present.\u201d The piece is being performed at the forthcoming Barbican concert. \u201cPerforming it as a group of women,\u201d says the producer, \u201c[we\u2019re] very aware of violence against women and every time we perform it we feel like there\u2019s this energy.\u201d Now, the film\u2019s golden jubilee is arriving at a moment of booming interest in Britain\u2019s folk heritage, from neolithic walking group Stone Club to Wiltshire publication Weird Walk, even Stroud morris dancing collective Boss Morris\u2019s appearance alongside Wet Leg at the 2023 Brit awards. \u201cYou can tell so much about where a society is at by what they\u2019re listening to,\u201d says writer Melanie Xulu who edits Cornish acid folk zine Moof. \u201cThe fact that folk music is having a revival says a lot about where we are now. People are a bit lost and are looking to reconnect with our past, as we\u2019re becoming ever more city-based and global.\u201d Broadcaster Zakia Sewell, who adores the soundtrack\u2019s \u201cheady mix of high eroticism and haunting darkness,\u201d regularly plays traditional English folk to a young and diverse skewing audience on her popular NTS breakfast show. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people now looking for alternative visions of Britain, whether real or imagined,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat that\u2019s connected to is this general interest in the occult, the magical, and a rejection of the rational or objective conservative, capitalist and consumerist way that\u2019s been the way for the past 50 years.\u201d Fifty years on, The Wicker Man\u2019s imagined folk culture has shaped England\u2019s actual folk culture. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a confection isn\u2019t it?\u201d says Lee. \u201cBut folk music, as we understand it, is too.\u201d He cites Cecil Sharp, who collected British folk in the Edwardian era and curated the definitive folk canon. \u201cHe picked and chose what he wanted to include and tried to create English folk song and dance based on what his vision was. It\u2019s always been manipulated. A folk culture as we would like it or hope it to be \u2013 and then of course that becomes a real thing.\u201d We may not like or hope for it, but on an island engaged in sacrifice and discord post-Brexit, and in violent ceremonial rejections of outsiders by its leadership, it should be no surprise that The Wicker Man still burns bright. \u2022 The Wicker Man \u201cFinal Cut\u201d 4K restoration is released in cinemas on 21 June. Musics from Summerisle is at the Barbican, London on 24 June. The Wicker Man 50th anniversary collector\u2019s edition is released on Blu-ray on 4 September."}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db5b4", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/20/frome-unenthusiastic-about-byelection-nobody-wants", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Frome unenthusiastic about \u2018byelection nobody wants\u2019", "lead": "All parties could face a tough test in disillusioned Somerton and Frome, the seat vacated by the disgraced MP David Warburton", "author": "Steven Morris", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 15:59:18", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.992143", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/fb6afffa1f5bade48fa587b02fbd062742d478dc/0_275_8256_4954/500.jpg", "body": "The reaction of Charlie Murray, who manages a coffee shop in the Somerset town of Frome, to an imminent byelection will not encourage the teams of activists about to descend on the area. \u201cOh pants!\u201d she said when the Guardian broke the news. \u201cI\u2019m fed up with all these byelections. They\u2019re a waste of time. Politicians need to get on and run the country, not keep banging on our doors bothering us.\u201d \u201cNobody wants a byelection,\u201d said Ian Jonathan Berkeley-Hurst, a lawyer, who was having his hair cut in a barber shop. \u201cIt all feels irrelevant given that there is going to be a general election next year anyway. I think most people are bored with listening to the Tories and Labour squabbling, especially when so many are struggling and businesses are going bust all over the place.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the byelection nobody really wants,\u201d said Nick White, a retired sales agent who usually votes Conservative but has not made his mind up this time. \u201cThe Lib Dems will fancy their chances and I think a lot of Tory voters will stay at home.\u201d Whether the largely rural Somerton and Frome constituency likes it or not, a byelection will take place after the resignation of David Warburton, who won a hefty 19,000 majority in 2019 but was suspended from the Conservative party in April 2022 after accusations of harassment and drugs use. This week, he finally stepped down after a long investigation. The byelection, to be held on 20 July, will be another stern test for the Tories in the English West Country, who were stung exactly a year ago by the historic loss of nearby Tiverton and Honiton, where the Lib Dems overturned a 24,000 majority. It will give Labour and the Green party a chance to make gains and refine battle plans as they prepare for the general election \u2013 by which time this sprawling constituency will almost certainly be split into two \u2013 and may also provide an opportunity for residents to think about tactical voting. Mike Grenville, a Frome funeral and wedding celebrant and poet, said he would much prefer to vote for the Greens. \u201cBut Somerton and Frome used to be a Lib Dem seat [David Heath was the MP from 1997 to 2015] and they are best placed to retake the seat to replace the disgraced Tory. For now, the imperative is to vote in almost anything but Tory.\u201d Angie Salfield, an artist, agreed: \u201cI\u2019ll vote for whoever can beat the Tories.\u201d Before Warburton officially announced his resignation, the Tories had been campaigning with Greg Hands, the party chair, canvassing at the weekend. An increase in the number of police officers in Avon and Somerset was the message they tried to hammer home. The Lib Dems, who took Somerset council at last year\u2019s local elections, have also been working the doors hard. \u201cI\u2019ve been knocking on doors since I was selected last year \u2013 thousands of doors,\u201d said their candidate, Sarah Dyke, a county councillor. \u201cThere is toxicity around the outgoing MP and the Conservative party. People want change.\u201d Martin Dimery, the Green candidate, said he hoped tactical voting would not wreck his chances. \u201cIf you can\u2019t vote for the party you really want in a byelection when it doesn\u2019t actually change the complexion of government, then when can you?\u201d he said. Sean Dromgoole, who stood for Labour at the last general election, said he believed a lot of \u201ccounty Tories\u201d would not vote. \u201cThey\u2019ll sit on their hands; they\u2019re genuinely ashamed of this Conservative government,\u201d he said, adding Labour may be able to appeal to the many liberal people who moved to Somerset during Covid. At the social initiative shop Share Frome, , customers and staff welcomed the byelection. \u201cOur MP has been absent for such a long time,\u201d said one staff member, Heidi Joyce. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been represented at all. Frome can handle a byelection now and a general election next year.\u201d Andrew Lee, editor of the Leveller newspaper, said the byelection was important as the constituency struggled with issues such as broadband speed, pollution on the Somerset Levels and affordable housing. \u201cWhoever wins the byelection is likely to have a very full inbox to deal with. And of course, they\u2019ll only be an MP for a maximum of 16 months before facing the electorate again. It\u2019ll be a tough gig.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64931aaf51ac33179f2db5b5", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/20/football-daily-email-big-championship-energy-league-table", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Football Daily | The Championship Energy league table, a division of unadulterated chaos", "lead": "<strong>In today\u2019s Football Daily:</strong> The Championship Energy league table", "author": "Michael Butler", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 15:53:18", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:43:43.992173", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/f4fd9b828bdf237496456b59ebc591284c9cb13d/0_300_4500_2700/500.jpg", "body": "BIG SECOND-TIER ENERGY IS COMING Is state-level wealth ruining your Saturday? Can\u2019t bring yourself to attend Non-League Day or watch your son or daughter hack it around the garden? Fear not, welcome to the Championship, a glorious compromise of quality and disorder to help you fall back in love with football. It is a division of unadulterated chaos. Pick a team, and who knows whether they will be automatically promoted or relegated. Some critics might complain about parachute payments, sure, but Leicester City are definitely, definitely going to get turned over by Rotherham next season, and there\u2019s nothing that you or Enzo Maresca can do about it. So with the fixture list out this week and some teams already in pre-season for 2023-24, Football Daily has created the Biggest Championship Energy league table, ranking each side by their Championship-ness. 1) Birmingham City We promise this is not just an alphabetical list. No current team has been in the second tier longer than Blues, who are deservedly crowned champions here, but haven\u2019t been above 10th since 2011-12 in the real table. Any team that had Troy Deeney \u2013 the protagonist of surely the Championship\u2019s greatest ever moment \u2013 as their skipper last season, was surely going to be the runaway leader here. 2) Huddersfield Town Neil Warnock. You merely adopted the Championship. He was born in it. Moulded by it. After last year\u2019s relegation battle, Town could easily finish anywhere from second to 24th this year under Warnock. It doesn\u2019t get any more Championship than that. 3) Millwall The Lions have just about everything it takes to be Championship legends. A manager named Gary. A 6ft 4in centre-back in Jake Cooper. The Den is pure Championship, absolute chaos from the moment you get off the train at South Bermondsey. They should not be good, but they are. And that is what the Championship is all about. 4) Watford The first of the hallowed \u2018yo-yo\u2019 trio \u2013 also made up of Norwich and West Brom. Possibly the most chaotic club in English football, so always going to challenge, but Watford\u2019s recent success in the Premier League sees them finish just outside the automatic places here. Val\u00e9rien Isma\u00ebl is the club\u2019s 18th manager in 13 years. Any club that can count Elton John and Harry the Hornet as club legends deserves a playoff berth. 5) Norwich They may have flickered between the Premier League and the Championship, but Norwich certainly feel more at home in the latter. The presence of condiments, Delia and the East Anglian derby\u2019s welcome return \u2013 aka El Tr\u00e1ctico, aka the Old Farm \u2013 means a strong showing for the Canaries here. 6) Queens Park Rangers Tucked in the White City estate, Loftus Road is a Proper Football Stadium, complete with pillars restricting your view, a postage stamp for a technical area and Kevin Gallen in the hospitality suites. An injection of pure EFL energy in the form of Gareth Ainsworth saw QPR safe last season, and sees them consolidate their Championship-ness here. 7) Sheffield Wednesday The Owls haven\u2019t been in the Championship for a couple of seasons, but the departure of manager Darren Moore sees them crash back in the second tier with a bang. If they can bring just half of the League One playoff vibes into this campaign, they will challenge for the top six. 8) Blackburn Rovers Failing to build on last season\u2019s promising campaign and falling back into competitive mediocrity would be textbook Championship. Rovers\u2019 excellent use of the loan system (a key part of second-tier transfer dealings) \u2013 Harvey Elliott, Adam Armstrong, Harrison Reed and Tosin Adarabioyo have all arrived from Premier League clubs in recent years \u2013 sees them comfortably in the top half here. And that\u2019s not even mentioning the departed Ben Brereton D\u00edaz. 9) Bristol City If someone can get Nigel Pearson talking about ostriches again, the Robins should make a late run for the top six. 10) Hull City Congratulations if you can name a single Hull player. Which, in this table, is a strength. Hull creep into the top 10 on account of the city recently being named as the UK City of Culture. The Championship is all about being aspirational. 11) Preston North End Mid-table specialists, Preston have not finished higher than seventh and lower than 14th since promotion to the Championship in 2015. Instantly forgettable these days, that doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t hold you to a goalless draw, which is a very Championship trait. 12) Cardiff City Apart from two single seasons in the Premier League, Cardiff have been Championship perennials since the name change from Division One. No team with a managerial back catalogue of Warnock, Dave Jones, Neil Harris, Mick McCarthy can be relegated from this list, so a comfortable mid-table berth it is. 13) Swansea City Too good for League One, not good enough for the Premier League. The appointment of manager and dance innovator Michael Duff (D/DM R) from Barnsley is very Championship and should go down a treat on Wind Street. 14) Stoke City Cold, wet, windy nights. Technically, the heritage of this idiom is from the Premier League, but anyone that has been to Tuesday night games in Staffordshire in recent years will tell you Stoke are right at home in this division. 15) West Bromwich Albion With the parachute payments finally running out, it feels like this could be a season of struggle for the Baggies. Which is why, in this league, they will probably get automatic promotion in the actual table. A bit too successful and rich to be a classic Championship side of the genre, so mid-table here it is. 16) Ipswich Town As nicknames go, it doesn\u2019t get more Championship than \u201cThe Tractor Boys\u201d. Minus points for having Ed Sheeran as a fan (and shirt sponsor). 17) Sunderland Bonus points for Tony Mowbray \u2013 especially when his press conferences are dominated by a love of chocolate. Demerit points for the Netflix documentary, which must either be glossy (Drive to Survive, Full Swing) or a rags-to-riches story (Last Chance U, Wrexham), not an upcoming season that ends on a high. 18) Leicester City Jamie Vardy might be an EFL legend but having won the Premier League title in 2016 and the FA Cup in 2021, the Championship is no longer familiar territory for the Foxes. Back-to-back relegations is tough to take, any potential return of Anthony Knockaert this summer would surely see Leicester safe. 19) Leeds United Of the three teams relegated from the Premier League, Leeds certainly feel the most Championship, but their fans are also the most likely to be chanting \u201cwe are Premier League\u201d by February. A real shame that Sam Allardyce is not still at the helm. What could have been. 20) Rotherham Really a League One side masquerading as a Championship team, but like a lesser Millwall, they still have the capacity to spring a few surprises. But after a few good years at the New York Stadium, could this season be a step too far? 21) Southampton It\u2019s been 11 seasons since Saints were languishing in the second tier. With James Ward-Prowse and Rom\u00e9o Lavia still at the club (for now), the Championship just doesn\u2019t feel right, although the imminent arrival of Russell Martin as manager should save them from the drop. 22) Middlesbrough Championship stalwarts, Boro are now in the enviable position of being too trendy for the second tier, with their liquid football and stable owner in Steve Gibson. Have you seen Michael Carrick in a turtleneck? Woof! Far too $exy for the second tier. Down you go. 23) Coventry City Cov have been as chaotic as they come, but the playoff finalists simply don\u2019t belong in the Championship. They belong in League One or in the higher echelon of the past, where we can talk endlessly about Mustapha Hadji and Youssef Chippo, Peter Ndlovu and retro kits. With apologies, they are relegated. 24) Plymouth Argyle Not complete strangers to this division, having surfed the Championship waves from 2004-10 (Emile Mpenza! Taribo West!), but having spent seven seasons in League Two since, survival here definitely feels a step too far, especially after the ongoing rebuild of last year\u2019s League One champions.
