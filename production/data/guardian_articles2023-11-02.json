There were not enough hospital beds or dedicated wards. Supplies of personal protective equipment for health workers was soon in a shambles. Testing and tracing was a non-starter. Procurement policies verged on the corrupt. The care sector was not properly integrated. More generally, the NHS was bureaucratic and many staff alienated, even before the stresses of the pandemic."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Some of this reflected the years of public sector austerity since 2010.

The idea that the state should be the universal provider had morphed over the decades in favour of a range of mixed public-private provisions."}, {"type": "text", "text": "When Covid struck there was thus no consistent approach to ensuring state needs in a modern way. Covid quickly exposed the cost to the state of this uneven approach, leaving Johnson and his ministers with few levers that they could confidently pull to secure national objectives, even if they had agreed \u2013 which they did not \u2013 about what those objectives should be.

Here are seven crucial things you should look for \u2026"}, {"type": "headline", "text": "1 Power and memoryNot all laptops are created equally. Though most home laptops will work just fine for browsing Facebook or watching a few YouTube videos, business users need a laptop that will help get work done without fuss. This means you\u2019ll need a device that doesn\u2019t break a sweat when you ask it to open dozens of browser tabs, a Zoom call, and multiple spreadsheets and documents all at the same time."}, {"type": "text", "text": "The crucial factors to look for here are the amount of RAM \u2013 the temporary memory used by software your machine is currently running \u2013 and processing power."}, {"type": "text", "text": "On the former, the general rule is that bigger numbers generally translate to better performance. So if you\u2019re expecting heavy workloads, it might be wiser to go with, say, 32GB instead of 16GB of RAM."}, {"type": "text", "text": "And on the latter, look to modern laptop chips such as Intel\u2019s Core i5 and i7. The i5 presents a nice balance between performance and price, while the i7 is specifically optimised for multitasking across business applications \u2013 enabling you to create presentations, run reports and PowerBI analytics smoothly."}, {"type": "headline", "text": "2 Battery lifeDoing business is about moving quickly to take advantage of new opportunities, and working flexibly to meet changing conditions. But you can\u2019t move quickly or flexibly if you\u2019re tethered to a plug in the wall. So a major factor to prioritise is battery life."}, {"type": "text", "text": "The good news is that in recent years battery chemistry has improved significantly. Dell laptops, for instance, can often run for 8-10 hours on battery alone, to get you through the working day without you needing to down tools and hunt for a socket."}, {"type": "headline", "text": "3 Form factorLaptops come in different designs and sizes, and it is important to choose the right form for what you need to do. For example, if you\u2019re planning to mostly sit at your desk crunching data, then something beefy with a large screen and powerful processor might make the most sense. But if you need a device you can sling into your carry-on luggage and take to meetings around the world, then something more portable may be in order, such as a 13in laptop."}, {"type": "text", "text": "There are also other less conventional form factors to consider. For example, if your work involves marking up documents or drawing diagrams, then you might want to consider something like one of Dell\u2019s Latitude 2-for-1 laptops, which are also available with a hinge that enables the screen to fold all the way around, so your computer can be used like a tablet."}, {"type": "headline", "text": "4 SecurityA business is only as secure as its weakest link, and every digital device is a potential entry point for hackers and malware. It\u2019s no wonder that the phrase \u201centerprise\u201d (business tech) has become a byword for toughened security."}, {"type": "text", "text": "So, when device shopping, look for hardware and software features such as on-device encryption, secure network connectivity, BIOS tampering notifications, and authentication credentials protection, each of which provide additional layers of security to keep your data safe."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Dell laptops with Intel vPro come with unique additional hardware-based security inside. This reduces the attack surface of the chip inside the PC, which keeps your most critical security credentials separate from the rest of the device, or a special external privacy filter, which narrows the viewing angles from which you can see the screen, to prevent anyone snooping on your computer as you work on the train, for example."}, {"type": "headline", "text": "5 Connectivity and compatibilityA work laptop has to play nicely with other devices. It might need to plug into wired networks, connect to peripherals such as scanners or printers, or maybe you will need to mirror the display to a larger screen or projector."}, {"type": "text", "text": "This is not a job for laptops with just one or two ports. Sure, you could add a dongle \u2013 but that\u2019s just one extra annoyance to remember to pack on your next business trip."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Instead, consider a PC that seeks out the best wifi signal available along with connectivity options, whether that is wifi, LTE or 5G. In addition, make sure they have plenty of USB ports, HDMI video output, and support for the latest peripheral devices such as a wireless headset, to keep you productive throughout the day."}, {"type": "headline", "text": "6 Value for moneyBusinesses often buy a batch of laptops to kit out a team. Ideally you want to find a vendor who can cater to the whole team, so that they can be deployed at scale."}, {"type": "text", "text": "One advantage of choosing a company such as Dell is that it offers a range of models and configurations for different users with different requirements. But what unifies it is a common platform, common add-on tools (such as security features), and common hardware. This makes it easier and, crucially, more affordable to support an entire team, as factors such as device management can be performed at scale across your business."}, {"type": "headline", "text": "7 Maintenance and supportAs with all IT investments, you need to prepare for when something goes wrong. For a home user, a problem can be annoying, but it is less likely to be mission-critical. But for businesses, time spent fixing a cracked screen, for example, or reconstructing lost data, can be felt directly on the bottom line."}, {"type": "text", "text": "That\u2019s why for businesses in particular, it\u2019s important to not just choose the right devices, but to make sure there is the technical expertise on call to assist or to show up at your doorstep on the same day your business requires it. Intel vPro can provide remote management, which means its IT teams can help support businesses with their laptops. And this is an area where scale helps, as larger suppliers such as Dell have the international reach and depth of knowledge to be ready and waiting, to help keep your business running and keep your team productive."}, {"type": "headline", "text": "Dell makes business technology work for you.
