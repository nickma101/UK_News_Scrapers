But now that's all changed.Benefits including health and pension plans have also been the subject of talks.But SAG-AFTRA says that, after four weeks of intensive talks, film and TV bosses have refused to budge.What do the studios say?The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) - the association representing major Hollywood studios including Walt Disney and Netflix - disputes the SAG-AFTRA's version of events.It says a deal, including better pay and AI safeguards, has been offered, and accused the union of walking away from talks.In a statement, it said: \"We are deeply disappointed that SAG-AFTRA has decided to walk away from negotiations.\"This is the union's choice, not ours. In doing so, it has dismissed our offer of historic pay and residual increases, substantially higher caps on pension and health contributions, audition protections, shortened series option periods, a groundbreaking AI proposal that protects actors' digital likenesses, and more.\" \n\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\n\n\n0:45\n\n\n\n\n\n'It's war'\n\n\n\nWhen is the strike and how long will it last?The walkout was officially set to begin at midnight on Friday 14 July (Los Angeles time).SAG-AFTRA said picket lines would start the following morning, with the strike continuing indefinitely.No date has been set for when it will end.When asked how long it would last, union president Ms Drescher told reporters at a press conference on 13 July that it was \"up to\" film studios.What does the strike mean for movie and TV fans?A lot depends on how long it goes on for. If the dispute is resolved quickly, disruption may be limited.But if it drags on, as some fear, many film releases will be delayed and television shows could go off air.What makes the industrial action so historic is that, for the first time in 63 years, both SAG-AFTRA and WGA (the Writers Guild of America) will be on strike at the same time.Members of the WGA have been striking for the last two months and that has already had a big impact on productions such as season five of Stranger Things, season two of The Last Of Us, season six of The Handmaid's Tale and Game Of Thrones spinoff A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms: The Hedge Knight.With actors and performers joining writers, that disruption is only going to get worse.In short, Hollywood is effectively being shut down and will come to a near-standstill. With no scripts, and no performers to bring them to life, many studios will fall dark.If both strikes were to continue on for many months, next year's theatrical release schedules could run into difficulties, causing a big problem for studios who put much time and energy into selecting the release dates for their films.Numerous film festivals leading into awards season could also be hit, with carefully planned campaigns falling foul due to lack of actors to share the buzz of their films.The 75th Emmy TV awards is also due to take place in September.But trade magazine Variety has reported organisers are considering delaying the ceremony to November or even January due to the Hollywood walkouts.Other upcoming dates which could be hit include the Toronto and Venice film festivals.Looking beyond the inevitable disappointment of movie and TV lovers, the strike is likely to have a big impact on the financial side of the business too.The box office has recently begun picking up post-pandemic, with the US nearing $4bn for the year and running 30% ahead of the same January-to-early June period.It's a pickup that would inevitably suffer from prolonged actor walkouts.News and broadcast work would not be directly affected by the strikes. \n\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\n\n\n0:55\n\n\n\n\n\nThe stars of Oppenheimer spoke of their support

commercials contract.The US actors' union successfully defended the \"pay-for-play\" TV advert payment formula, by which actors are paid residuals for the number of times their commercial airs, and reached an agreement over cable and internet advertising.Prior to that, US stars staged a 95-day strike over terms for paid television and VHS tapes back in 1980, achieving a 32.5% wage increase and a 4.5% of the gross revenues for home media releases. \n\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News\nInstall the Sky News app for free\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does it mean for UK performers?Still recovering from the COVID pandemic, and now dealing with a cost of living crisis, the UK film industry already has plenty on its plate.Equity, the British performing arts and entertainment union, has offered its support to the US strike and said in a statement that it \"stands full square behind our sister union in their claim, and the action their Board have agreed to take\".While events in the US will not directly affect those working in the UK, it is thought that British performers who are members of SAG-AFTRA and working in the US will lawfully be allowed to take part. \n\n\nPlease use Chrome browser

which has 47,000 members, has not called its own strike in solidarity with US actors.However, Paul W Fleming, the general secretary, said the union was always \"strike ready,\" describing it as one of the \"key objectives\" of the union.The UK's current Pact-Equity contracts are due to enter negotiations later this year, having not been updated since 2021, when a transitional contract was put in place during the pandemic.Deals are normally struck every two to four years.Pact is the UK trade body which represents independent production and distribution companies.With all the same issues at stake as the US actors, it's likely that the influence of AI, streamer payment rates and self-taped auditions will also form key parts of the upcoming UK negotiations.Mr Fleming says a \"framework\" setting out \"exactly what AI is and where it is used\" is what now needs to be put in place to protect performers.Equity is already in talks with ITV over AI clauses in their agreements.So watch this

brother Tristan also faces human trafficking and organised crime charges, alongside a charge of inciting others to violence.The brothers are seeking at least $5m (\u00a33.8m) in their lawsuit, which was filed on Tuesday against the woman, her parents, another woman who lived at the Tates' estate and a male friend of the woman.The Tates say the five conspired to falsely accuse them of human

stage ranked among Wall Street's most successful hedge funds, and individuals including Sir Lloyd Dorfman, the Travelex billionaire.The valuation that Vanquis was in talks to pay for Snoop was

\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf there's limited evidence, why has the WHO made this declaration?The scale used by the IARC indicates the level of evidence there is for a substance being carcinogenic.The IARC uses four categories: 1 - causes cancer; 2A - probably causes cancer; 2B - possibly causes cancer and 3 - no evidence available on cancer risk. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAspartame was classified as 2B, \"possibly carcinogenic\", on the basis of limited evidence for cancer in humans (specifically hepatocellular carcinoma, a type of liver cancer).Other possible 2B carcinogens in the group include aloe vera, bracken ferns, lead and working as a hairdresser. \n\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News\nInstall the Sky News app for free\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scale does not say how much exposure you need to raise your cancer risk - it just identifies the substances as hazards.Alice Davies, health information manager at Cancer Research UK, told Sky News: \"Something being classed as a carcinogen doesn't tell you how much it could increase the risk of cancer.\"Sometimes there are things that might cause cancer in theory, but in reality the dose that you're exposed to is too low to increase your risk.\"So, for example, processed meat and smoking are both carcinogens but smoking causes about 54,000 cases of cancer in the UK each year whereas processed meat only causes about 5,400.\"So how much aspartame can I have a day?This is where another arm of the WHO comes in, the Joint WHO and Food and Agriculture Organisation\u2019s Expert Committee on Food Additives - JECFA for short.JECFA reviewed the data on aspartame consumption and said adults can safely consume up to 40mg per kilo of body weight.This does not change the daily limits recommended previously.That means an adult who weighs 70kg could consume 2,800mg of aspartame a day.Aspartame is found in drinks including Coke Zero, Diet Coke, Diet Pepsi, Pepsi Max, Sprite Zero and Fanta Zero.A can of diet drink typically contains about 200mg of aspartame. So a 70kg adult could drink 14 cans without going over the safe daily limit for aspartame. \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nFile pic\n        \n\n\n\nWhat does a carcinogen do to your body?Cancer is a disease of the cells, and a carcinogen is something that disrupts the way cells work.A carcinogen might damage the cells themselves or it might damage your DNA, Ms Davies from Cancer Research UK said.For example, a gene that normally prevents cells from replicating too much could be damaged, leading to cells multiplying uncontrollably.Do I need to worry about aspartame causing cancer?Rather than worry about things that might cause cancer, Ms Davies said it is better to address confirmed causes of cancer, such as smoking, alcohol and obesity.\"The most important thing really you can do to reduce your risk of cancer is to not smoke, to keep a healthy weight, have a healthy balanced diet, cut down alcohol and stay physically active.\"The Food Standards Agency (FSA) agrees. It says the JECFA report into aspartame is not something people should worry about, as long as they follow the advice that's already out there.Professor Robin May, the FSA's chief scientific adviser, said: \"JECFA's report supports the FSA's view that aspartame is safe to consume at current permitted use levels.\"The IARC and WHO will continue to monitor new evidence and encourage independent research groups to develop further studies on the potential association between aspartame and cancer.The FSA said it welcomed this extra research, calling for \"more and better studies\" into the potential risks of aspartame consumption.\n"}, {"_id": "64b140c051ac33184f948c99", "url": "https://news.sky.com/story/hollywood-strike-hollywood-will-grind-to-a-complete-halt-as-actors-and-writers-both-walk-out-it-could-last-for-months-12920725", "primaryCategory": "business", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Hollywood will grind to a complete halt as actors and writers both strike - it could last for months", "lead": "Writers have been treading the pavements with picket signs outside the Netflix building in Hollywood for two months now.", "author": "\nMartha Kelner\n", "datePublished": "2023-07-14 11:05:00", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:34:08.521637", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "SkyNews", "image": "https://e3.365dm.com/23/07/70x70/skynews-hollywood-strike_6218221.jpg?20230714044308", "body": "\nWriters have been treading the pavements with picket signs outside the Netflix building in Hollywood for two months now.The midday sun is punishing but they stride on - some wearing headphones, others chatting with friends.\n\n\n\nEvery couple of minutes, a passing motorist beeps their horn in support. \n\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\n\n\n0:56\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat's behind Hollywood actors' strike?\n\n\n\nA huge cheer erupts as they hear news that the actors will soon be joining them on the picket line.They know a walkout of 98,000 members of SAG-AFTRA, the actors' union, makes their strike action even more impactful.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn total, an estimated 160,000 actors and performers are expected to take part.Production had been limping along in a small number of shows and films which were already written.This dual strike, the first for 63 years, means the entertainment industry will grind to a complete halt almost immediately.Without writers and actors, very little can be achieved. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We didn't want it to come to this,\" Michele Mulroney, the Writers Guild of America vice president, tells me, \"We would rather be practising the craft we love of writing and acting.

All the pain, the joy. It's what we love to watch.\"The strike also means the red carpet events, the press junkets and the film premieres will stop - almost overnight.

public finances are already reeling from COVID, cost of living support and higher interest rates.\n\n\n\nThe national debt hit a 60-year high of \u00a32.56trn in May - equivalent to 100% of national GDP for a year.The OBR's fiscal risks and sustainability report stated that the government's plans for stabilising and then reducing debt as a share of national output were relatively modest by historical and international standards.That was despite a previous warning from the watchdog, in March, that the UK's tax burden was on course to hit the highest level since the Second World War by 2027/8.\n\n\n\n\n\nIts conclusions also stated that as the baby boomer cohort retires and pushes up the cost of the so-called triple lock, state pension spending was expected to be \u00a323bn higher in 2027/8 than at the start of the decade.It also warned that rising take-up of electric vehicles was expected to cost \u00a313bn a year in lost fuel duty by 2030.The report, which looks at the long term risks, highlighted a number of immediate financial burdens including a projection that the hit from record long-term sickness in the workforce will cost the state a further \u00a36.8bn this year in benefit payments.It all makes for grim reading in Number 11 Downing St as the chancellor seeks an opportunity to deliver some goodies to the public ahead of the next election.

domestic product (GDP) of 0.1%.Perversely, a flatlining economy is actually and temporarily good news for the government and Bank of England as both seek to bring down stubbornly high inflation.Weaker demand in reaction to rising interest rates is what Bank policymakers are looking for before they can halt the tightening cycle that has resulted in 13 consecutive increases in Bank rate to date.Rising interest rates, and market expectations for rates, are bad news for the taxpayer as well as wider borrowers, such as mortgage holders, because they have forced up borrowing costs.

interest rate, on core 10-year UK government bonds hit 2008 financial crisis levels earlier this month.Many UK IOUs are linked to inflation, making the cost of servicing the existing debt pile worse.The OBR's report said: \"The 2020s are turning out to be a very risky era for the public finances.\"In just three years, they have been hit by the COVID pandemic in early 2020, the energy and cost-of-living crisis from mid-2021, and the sudden interest rate rises in 2022, whose consequences continue to unfold.\"This rapid succession of shocks has delivered the deepest recession in three centuries, the sharpest rise in energy prices since the 1970s, and the steepest sustained rise in borrowing costs since the 1990s.\"And they have pushed government borrowing to its highest level since the mid-1940s, the stock of government debt to its highest level since the early 1960s, and the cost of servicing that debt to its highest since the late 1980s.\"Chancellor Jeremy Hunt responded: \"In common with many advanced economies, the UK's level of debt remains elevated following recent global shocks, including the pandemic and energy prices.\"This highlights why it is important to deliver on the Prime Minister's priority to get debt falling and to control borrowing to avoid adding inflationary pressures and risk prolonging higher inflation.\"That means taking difficult but responsible decisions on the public finances, including public sector pay, because more borrowing is itself inflationary.\"Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said: \"This report shows just how far we are falling behind our peers, how exposed our economy is, and again highlights that the government is failing to take action in areas like energy security to help get bills down.\"She added: \"It's time for them

Research by our Westminster Accounts project today revealed MPs earned an average \u00a3233 per hour for roles outside of parliament - 17 times higher than the national average and over 22 times more than the hourly minimum wage.\n\n\n\nThe data also showed MPs had spent almost 89,000 hours carrying out the work since the start of the parliament in 2019.All of this falls within the currents rules, as long as MPs declare who they worked for, for how long, and how much they were paid.Politics live: Truss paid \u00a315,770 an hour for second jobs\n\n\n\n\n\nAsked about the findings, the prime minister's spokesman said an MP's \"primary focus must always be on serving their constituency\", and that it would be their voters who \"decide if they've done a good enough job\" as their representative in Westminster.But they failed to commit to any changes to the rules that allow additional work to take place.Earlier, the SNP's former Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, said there was a \"legitimate debate\" to be had about MPs' outside earnings.Mr Blackford - who earned over \u00a338,000 for 31 hours work over the past four years - told Sky News it was \"important the public can have trust in those they send to parliament\" and people were \"rightly appalled\" by some of the \"eye watering\" sums being paid to MPs. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News\nInstall the Sky News app for free\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe pointed to former primes ministers Liz Truss and Boris Johnson - with the former being paid the equivalent of \u00a320,000 per hour for her speech in Taiwan and the latter receiving \u00a321,822 per hour when all his outside work was taken into account.The SNP MP added: \"Being an MP is a very important job, it is a full-time job.

Her team are cock-a-hoop with the resolution to teacher\u2019s pay.\n\nIn the Department for Education, the extra money will be found by using underspends for this year and next that would usually be returned to the Treasury.\nEducation officials characterise this allowance by the chancellor as coming close to new money being provided.\nBut there is an issue with using one-off annual underspends to fund permanent pay commitments.\nCome the next spending review, the extra money needed for the pay rises will need to be baked into broader government plans.\nAs it stands the overall budget for those plans looks far too tight to accommodate these bumper pay rises.\nFor many, this is more evidence that spending plans for after 2024 are a complete fiction.\nBut they are potentially a fiction that both parties will fight next year\u2019s election committed to.\nAs for doctors, the news is less positive for the government.\nIt appears that both sides are locked in a total stalemate, with Rishi Sunak refusing more talks with the BMA.\nFor junior doctors, this is seen as more existential than a simple pay negotiation - it is about stopping medics leaving the UK and how the profession is valued.\nThe practical outcome, however, will be more strike action extending through the year.\nThat\u2019s bad for patients.\nBut given his commitment to cut waiting lists, it\u2019s also bad for the prime minister.\n\n\nBut the general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, Paul Nowak, told Sky News it would be \"remiss of the government to ignore the concerns of NHS staff\".\"I think [junior doctors] have been very clear all along that what they want to see is a pathway to pay restoration,\" he said. \"That's really important if we're going to solve the recruitment and retention crisis in our NHS.\"Now, I don't think [the unions] believe the government is going to put 35% on the table this year.

So a 70kg adult could drink 14 cans without going over the safe daily limit for aspartame. \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nFile pic\n        \n\n\n\nWhat does a carcinogen do to your body?Cancer is a disease of the cells, and a carcinogen is something that disrupts the way cells work.A carcinogen might damage the cells themselves or it might damage your DNA, Ms Davies from Cancer Research UK said.For example, a gene that normally prevents cells from replicating too much could be damaged, leading to cells multiplying uncontrollably.Do I need to worry about aspartame causing cancer?Rather than worry about things that might cause cancer, Ms Davies said it is better to address confirmed causes of cancer, such as smoking, alcohol and obesity.\"The most important thing really you can do to reduce your risk of cancer is to not smoke, to keep a healthy weight, have a healthy balanced diet, cut down alcohol and stay physically active.\"The Food Standards Agency (FSA) agrees. It says the JECFA report into aspartame is not something people should worry about, as long as they follow the advice that's already out there.Professor Robin May, the FSA's chief scientific adviser, said: \"JECFA's report supports the FSA's view that aspartame is safe to consume at current permitted use levels.\"The IARC and WHO will continue to monitor new evidence and encourage independent research groups to develop further studies on the potential association between aspartame and cancer.The FSA said it welcomed this extra research, calling for \"more and better studies\" into the potential risks of aspartame consumption.\n"}, {"_id": "64b140c451ac33184f948cab", "url": "https://news.sky.com/story/aspartame-how-concerned-should-you-be-about-possible-cancer-link-and-will-big-brands-start-changing-their-recipes-12920666", "primaryCategory": "technology", "subCategories": "test", "title": "How concerned should you be about aspartame - and will big brands start changing their recipes?", "lead": "Has one of the world's most widely used artificial sweeteners just gone sour?", "author": "\nThomas Moore\n", "datePublished": "2023-07-14 08:28:00", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:34:12.191837", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "SkyNews", "image": "https://e3.365dm.com/23/07/70x70/skynews-diet-coke-aspartame_6218218.jpg?20230714044015", "body": "\nHas one of the world's most widely used artificial sweeteners just gone sour?Aspartame, which is found in some of the biggest brands of low-calorie food and drink, has been classed as a possible cancer risk.\n\n\n\nThe health warning will no doubt cause a bit of a stir, particularly as it comes from an offshoot of the World Health Organization.Diet Coke, Muller Light yoghurts, Wrigley's Extra chewing gum and many more everyday items are affected.So how concerned should you be? First, it's worth understanding what's happened.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) divides substances into three categories of hazard that matter here. So far it has assessed about 1,000 of them - and the classification reflects the strength of the scientific evidence.At the top, in class 1, are things known to cause cancer, including tobacco and alcohol.Then there's class 2A, with chemicals and substances that have a \"probable\" link, such as red meat.And finally class 2B, with the \"possible\" link. Here, aspartame is now listed alongside aloe vera and pickled vegetables. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo that puts the sweetener in the lowest category of hazard.It reflects the rather weak evidence of a link.The limited human research either shows no increased risk from consuming aspartame, or a weak association - though in these studies the IARC can't rule out lifestyle, diet or underlying health issues affecting the results.At the same time as the IARC's assessment, another safety body called JECFA (which reports to the UN) has looked at the risk of consuming aspartame as a food additive.They set the acceptable daily intake for aspartame at 40mg per kilogram of bodyweight back in 1981.After a fresh review they've left the recommended limit unchanged. That's reassuring.A 70kg adult would reach the limit by drinking the equivalent of roughly 14 cans of Diet Coke a day.An average 10-year-old weighing 32kg could safely consume just over six cans in a day.Most people will be well within those limits, and have nothing to worry about.Children are perhaps more likely to exceed the limit because of their smaller body size.But it's hard to see big brands changing their formulations based on weak evidence of risk.So if you are worried about your or your child's aspartame intake then switching from fizzy drinks to water is about all you can do - not easy once you have a sweet tooth.\n"}, {"_id": "64b140c451ac33184f948cac", "url": "https://news.sky.com/story/cerberus-heatwave-european-data-shows-land-temperatures-are-scorching-and-its-about-to-get-much-worse-12920365", "primaryCategory": "technology", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Scorcher: Data on Europe's heatwave shows its land is being baked - and it's about to get much worse", "lead": "The heatwave affecting southern Europe has been building for months.

There's also no option to tailor your timeline to just people you follow, instead it largely shows you content it thinks you like (spoiler: I hope you like brands). For all the problems people have with Twitter, these fundamentals are at least still in place there.Read more:What is Threads missing at launch?Why are so many apps adopting the same look?Navarra says Threads' sudden launch (seemingly moved forward to take advantage of the fallout from Musk's decision to apply temporary reading limits for all Twitter accounts) and swift demand means it hasn't had any chance to \"establish a sense of community or identity\", housing both Instagram diehards and Twitter refugees.Rebecca Tyrrell, a social lead at LADbible Group, says \"there will be many Twitter users who don't use Instagram and may not embrace Threads\", and many who've joined from Instagram having never used Twitter.But you likely don't curate your Instagram feed based on who's got the best chat - and Threads shows why. \n\n\n\n\n\nSpreaker\n\n                This content is provided by Spreaker, which may be using cookies and other technologies.\n                To show you this content, we need your permission to use cookies.\n                You can use the buttons below to amend your preferences to enable Spreaker cookies or to allow those cookies just once.\n                You can change your settings at any time via the Privacy Options.\n            \n\n                Unfortunately we have been unable to verify if you have consented to Spreaker cookies.\n                To view this content you can use the button below to allow Spreaker cookies for this session only.\n            \n\nEnable Cookies\nAllow Cookies Once\n\n\n\nClick to subscribe to the Sky News Daily wherever you get your podcastsFor now, your main motivation to open Threads is likely curiosity - how are things panning out? Why are so many people signed up? It's the shiny new toy of social media, and the fear of missing out is strong.\"There's always the chance the novelty could wear off and when the dust settles it won't be quite so exciting and people will revert to normal behaviour,\" says Navarra.In this case, normal behaviour likely means going back to Twitter. It may feel like a bomb's gone off, but talk of its imminent demise seems - not for the first time - exaggerated.Regardless, Threads is certainly enjoying its honeymoon phase.

led to his arrest.Tate's brother Tristan also faces human trafficking and organised crime charges, alongside a charge of inciting others to violence.The brothers are seeking at least $5m (\u00a33.8m) in their lawsuit, which was filed on Tuesday against the woman, her parents, another woman who lived at the Tates' estate and a male friend of the woman.The Tates say the five conspired to falsely accuse them of human trafficking and rape, costing them their freedom and millions of dollars in income from their lucrative social media, podcasting and business ventures.They were first arrested at a property in Bucharest in December last year and held in custody until March, when they were released under house arrest.The brothers are accused of tricking seven women into sexual exploitation on fake promises of a relationship, forcing them into pornography and subjecting them to physical violence.But the Tates' lawyers claim the brothers are victims of the Florida woman, calling her \"a professional con artist\".The lawsuit claims she pursued a sexual relationship with Tristan Tate in order to move to Romania, then tried to defraud the brothers. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen that failed, she conspired with the others to make false statements to Romanian and US embassy authorities that led to the arrests, the lawyers say.\"At no point did the Tate brothers engage in human trafficking,\"

They know this makes their strike action so much more powerful.\nProduction had been limping along in a small number of shows and films which were already written. This dual strike, the first for 63 years, means the entertainment industry will grind to a complete halt almost immediately. Without writers and actors, very little can be achieved. \n\nIt heaps pressure on the production studios and streaming giants to reach a resolution. But after 70 days, the writers are yet to get back around the negotiating table.\nTheir grievances are very similar to those the actors have. The two sides seem very far apart and a long and harsh summer could be in store.\n\n\nProductions hit by the writers' strike include season five of Stranger Things, season two of The Last Of Us, season six of The Handmaid's Tale and Game Of Thrones spinoff A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms: The Hedge Knight.The decision for performers to join them on strike means Hollywood is likely to come to a virtual standstill - with many predicting an autumn TV schedule full of reality TV as a result.AMPTP - which represents the likes of Netflix, Disney and other studios - said it was \"deeply disappointed\" by the union's decision.It added: \"This is the union's choice, not ours.\"In doing so, it has dismissed our offer of historic pay and residual increases, substantially higher caps on pension and health contributions, audition protections, shortened series option periods, a groundbreaking AI proposal that protects actors' digital likenesses, and more.\" \n\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\n\n\n0:14\n\n\n\n\n\nActress Margot Robbie said she supports the actors' strike\n\n\n\nEquity, the British actors' union, said in a statement on Thursday that it \"stands full square behind our sister union in their claim, and the action their Board have agreed to take\".While the US actors' strike will not directly affect those working in the UK, it is thought that British performers who are members of SAG-AFTRA and working in the US will lawfully be allowed to take part.\n"}, {"_id": "64b140c751ac33184f948cb6", "url": "https://news.sky.com/story/us-actors-strikes-why-are-hollywood-stars-walking-out-and-what-does-it-mean-for-film-and-tv-industry-12920662", "primaryCategory": "entertainment", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Why are US actors striking and what does it mean for film and TV industry?", "lead": "Hollywood actors are going on strike after talks with studios broke down, joining film and television writers who have been on picket lines since May.", "author": "\nBethany Minelle\n", "datePublished": "2023-07-14 02:05:00", "dateScraped": "2023-07-14 14:34:15.653220", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "SkyNews", "image": "https://e3.365dm.com/23/06/70x70/skynews-actors-strike-us-writers_6203110.jpg?20230630090232", "body": "\nHollywood actors are going on strike after talks with studios broke down, joining film and television writers who have been on picket lines since May.Fran Drescher, the president of the US actors' union, says its walkout will impact \"thousands if not millions of people\".\n\n\n\nThe strike, organised by the Screen Actors Guild -

realistic yet fabricated videos created by AI algorithms. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nTom Cruise at a New York premiere of Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One\n        \n\n\n\nThe streaming boom - which provides the bulk of TV actors' work - is also a big factor in contract negotiations.Series have become shorter, breaks between seasons longer, and the unions say that although series budgets are rising, that increase is not being reflected in the share of the money coming to performers.Residuals - payments for the reuse of credited work - are also much smaller on streamers compared to broadcast TV rates.Actors have also flagged the burden of \"self-taped auditions\" - when actors are asked to film their own audition and send it in directly for consideration by the casting director.This cost was previously the responsibility of the casting and production teams, who would set up auditions at a set location themselves and organise the filming of invited actors. But now that's all changed.Benefits including health and pension plans have also been the subject of talks.But SAG-AFTRA says that, after four weeks of intensive talks, film and TV bosses have refused to budge.What do the studios say?The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) - the association representing major Hollywood studios including Walt Disney and Netflix - disputes the SAG-AFTRA's version of events.It says a deal, including better pay and AI safeguards, has been offered, and accused the union of walking away from talks.In a statement, it said: \"We are deeply disappointed that SAG-AFTRA has decided to walk away from negotiations.\"This is the union's choice, not ours.

If the dispute is resolved quickly, disruption may be limited.But if it drags on, as some fear, many film releases will be delayed and television shows could go off air.What makes the industrial action so historic is that, for the first time in 63 years, both SAG-AFTRA and WGA (the Writers Guild of America) will be on strike at the same time.Members of the WGA have been striking for the last two months and that has already had a big impact on productions such as season five of Stranger Things, season two of The Last Of Us, season six of The Handmaid's Tale and Game Of Thrones spinoff A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms: The Hedge Knight.With actors and performers joining writers, that disruption is only going to get worse.In short, Hollywood is effectively being shut down and will come to a near-standstill. With no scripts, and no performers to bring them to life, many studios will fall dark.If both strikes were to continue on for many months, next year's theatrical release schedules could run into difficulties, causing a big problem for studios who put much time and energy into selecting the release dates for their films.Numerous film festivals leading into awards season could also be hit, with carefully planned campaigns falling foul due to lack of actors to share the buzz of their films.The 75th Emmy TV awards is also due to take place in September.But trade magazine Variety has reported organisers are considering delaying the ceremony to November or even January due to the Hollywood walkouts.Other upcoming dates which could be hit include the Toronto and Venice film festivals.Looking beyond the inevitable disappointment of movie and TV lovers, the strike is likely to have a big impact on the financial side of the business too.The box office has recently begun picking up post-pandemic, with the US nearing $4bn for the year and running 30% ahead of the same January-to-early June period.It's a pickup that would inevitably suffer from prolonged actor walkouts.News and broadcast work would not be directly affected by the strikes. \n\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\n\n\n0:55\n\n\n\n\n\nThe stars of Oppenheimer spoke of their support for the strike, before walking out of its London premiere\n\n\n\nHas a US actors' strike happened before?The last time Hollywood actors went on strike was in 2000 in a six-month dispute over their commercials contract.The US actors' union successfully defended the \"pay-for-play\" TV advert payment formula, by which actors are paid residuals for the number of times their commercial airs, and reached an agreement over cable and internet advertising.Prior to that, US stars staged a 95-day strike over terms for paid television and VHS tapes back in 1980, achieving a 32.5% wage increase and a 4.5% of the gross revenues for home media releases. \n\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News\nInstall the Sky News app for free\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does it mean for UK performers?Still recovering from the COVID pandemic, and now dealing with a cost of living crisis, the UK film industry already has plenty on its plate.Equity, the British performing arts and entertainment union, has offered its support to the US strike and said in a statement that it \"stands full square behind our sister union in their claim, and the action their Board have agreed to take\".While events in the US will not directly affect those working in the UK, it is thought that British performers who are members of SAG-AFTRA and working in the US will lawfully be allowed to take part. \n\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\n\n\n0:14\n\n\n\n\n\nActress Margot Robbie said she supports the actors' strike \n\n\n\nCould an actors' strike happen in the UK?As an independent union, Equity, which has 47,000 members, has not called its own strike in solidarity with US actors.However, Paul W Fleming, the general secretary, said the union was always \"strike ready,\" describing it as one of the \"key objectives\" of the union.The UK's current Pact-Equity contracts are due to enter negotiations later this year, having not been updated since 2021, when a transitional contract was put in place during the pandemic.Deals are normally struck every two to four years.Pact is the UK trade body which represents independent production and distribution companies.With all the same issues at stake as the US actors, it's likely that the influence of AI, streamer payment rates and self-taped auditions will also form key parts of the upcoming UK negotiations.Mr Fleming says a \"framework\" setting out \"exactly what AI is and where it is used\" is what now needs to be put in place to protect performers.Equity is already in talks with ITV over AI clauses in their agreements.So watch this space.\n"}, {"_id": "64b140c851ac33184f948cb7", "url": "https://news.sky.com/story/kevin-spacey-tells-jury-of-romantic-touching-and-consensual-sex-act-denying-sexual-assault-claims-12920492", "primaryCategory": "entertainment", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Kevin Spacey tells jury of 'romantic' touching and consensual sex act -

but has denied accusations of \"aggressive\" sexual offences.After hearing several days of evidence from his four accusers and other prosecution witnesses, Spacey entered the witness box at Southwark Crown Court in London on Thursday to have his say for the first time.At the end of the day, the Hollywood actor described the impact of sexual abuse allegations against him first being made public in the US in 2017, saying his \"world exploded\" as there was a \"rush to judgement\", and that he lost \"everything in a matter of days\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe became emotional, fighting back tears, as he addressed a statement he released in response - in which he also came out as gay publicly for the first time - saying he was \"under a lot of pressure\" to say something and hoped this would be a \"positive\" in the wake of the \"terrible accusation\".Read the latest developments from courtThe 63-year-old, who is best known for films including The Usual Suspects and American Beauty, as well as political drama House Of Cards, has pleaded not guilty to sexual offence charges relating to four men, which are alleged to have happened in the UK between 2001 and 2013.Giving evidence, Spacey told jurors he was a \"big flirt\" - and said when he learned the first complainant had made claims against him, he felt \"crushed\" that he would \"stab me in the back\".Addressing a separate allegation by another alleged victim, Spacey denied drugging him and said they had a \"lovely evening\" and a consensual sexual encounter, before the man became \"awkward\" and \"hurriedly\" left his flat in London.First complainant was 'funny and charming and flirtatious' - Spacey \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first alleged victim, a driver, has accused the star of sexually assaulting him several times during the early 2000s - including one occasion when he claims Spacey grabbed him \"so hard I almost came off the road\".This \"never happened\", Spacey told the court - adding: \"I was not on a suicide mission.\"Describing their encounters, the actor said he touched the complainant in \"romantic\" ways and that they had \"a very fun time\" together. \"He was a lads' lad,\" the star told the court. \"He was funny and charming and flirtatious.\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\nJurors heard that Spacey and the alleged victim did not have sex because the man \"made it clear that he did not want to go any further... and you just respect how far someone wants to go\".Answering questions from his defence barrister Patrick Gibbs, the star accepted touching the complainant but said: \"It did not happen in a violent, aggressive, painful way. It was gentle... and it was in my mind romantic.\"Asked by Mr Gibbs if there was any reluctance from the alleged victim to his advances, Spacey said: \"No. The only thing he made clear is he did not want to go any further than we were going and I respected that.\"The man said things such as \"this is new for me\", Spacey told the court, \"so I think that he may have been surprised by his reaction\".'We had a consensual\u2026 very nice and lovely evening'Responding to allegations made by a former aspiring actor - which have led to the most serious charge, of causing a person to engage in penetrative sexual activity - Spacey said he believed they shared an \"intimate moment\".Earlier in the trial, the complainant accused Spacey of drugging him and said he woke to find the actor performing a sex act on him.\"We had had a sexual encounter after which I had gone to the bathroom and I came back from the bathroom and it was like\u2026 something had changed,\" Spacey told the court.\"The person that I had this intimate moment with was suddenly awkward and fumbling\u2026 and I don't want to say ran out\u2026 but hurriedly left. And it felt very odd.\"The man's behaviour \"concerned\" him, the actor told the court. He said he rang him after he left to check he was okay.Spacey denied drugging the man and performing a sex act on him while he was asleep, saying this allegation \"makes no sense\".He told the court. \"We had a consensual and, I believe, a very nice and lovely evening. If he regretted it immediately I don't know, I can't speak for him, but something was weird - it was strange.\"West End event assault claim 'madness' \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAllegations made by a man who claims Spacey assaulted him during an event at a West End theatre in the mid-2000s were also put to the actor - who described them as \"madness\".The alleged victim has accused the actor of subjecting him to a \"barrage of vile\" and \"hardcore\" comments before grabbing his crotch \"like a cobra\" striking.\"I never said any of the things that he claims I said to him, and wouldn't - and never have to anyone in my life,\" Spacey told the court.\"It never happened,\" he said of the alleged incident, and told jurors he did not recognise the man \"at all\".Spacey also told the court that he \"primarily\" has no issue with the allegation made by a man who claims the actor kissed his neck and grabbed his crotch at a property he was staying at in the Cotswolds in the early 2010s.The actor told jurors he did not remember doing this but accepts that he might have done. \"We all had some drinks\u2026I made a pass and I'm only happy that he testified that the moment he told me he was not interested, I stopped,\" he told the court.Spacey addresses coming out statement in 2017Towards the end of his evidence, Spacey told jurors he had been looking to come out as gay for two years before he did - in a statement released in response to an allegation of an unwanted sexual advance made by actor Anthony Rapp in the US.He acknowledged this statement \"upset\" members of the LGBTQ+ community.\"I was under a lot of pressure that I had to say something\u2026 if I didn't it was going to be a nightmare, a PR nightmare,\" he told the court.\"Members of the LGBTQ+ community were upset because I came out while I was responding to an accusation... now I understand why it was read that way but I hadn't put those two things together.\"Spacey continued: \"I thought in the face of this terrible accusation maybe I can do something at least positive.

And if not that then maybe a job in academia.\"But he's got to get past what is clearly a severe mental breakdown at the moment.\"He added: \"You can be a very highly paid and very famous and very respected television presenter and be a vulnerable person too.

This isn't Victorian times, modern relationships aren't always conventional.But in a role that, by default, embodies BBC values, at the very least a level of integrity and honesty should come with that bumper six figure pay packet.Take the man out of this and for the BBC itself an even bigger headache - winning back public trust. Proving it can act quickly in a crisis, showing that it isn't above taking its talent to task if it needs to.On this it's looked slow and incompetent, taking seven weeks to talk to Edwards is surely inexcusable. \n\n\n\n\n\nSpreaker\n\n                This content is provided by Spreaker, which may be using cookies and other technologies.\n                To show you this content, we need your permission to use cookies.\n                You can use the buttons below to amend your preferences to enable Spreaker cookies or to allow those cookies just once.\n                You can change your settings at any time via the Privacy Options.\n            \n\n                Unfortunately we have been unable to verify if you have consented to Spreaker cookies.\n                To view this content you can use the button below to allow Spreaker cookies for this session only.\n            \n\nEnable Cookies\nAllow Cookies Once\n\n\n\nClick to subscribe to the Sky News Daily wherever you get your podcastsOf course, Edwards must prioritise getting better.While no criminal offence has been committed, but with new allegations reported of staff, current and former, allegedly receiving social media messages from the anchor which made them feel uncomfortable, this now becomes something else.Workplace culture must be put in the spotlight, whistleblowing procedures checked and the power balance dynamic examined.It is a mess.
