Paul, John and George are in a dressing room at some point in 1963, shirts untucked and ties undone, either dissecting the gig just gone or discussing the one to come.

On 5 January, he was groggy and incoherent, and armed with an air rifle. His girlfriend called the police. As they surrounded the hotel room, Evans appeared to raise the rifle towards one of them. He was shot six times and died, aged just 40."}, {"type": "text", "text": "None of the Beatles attended his funeral, which was arranged by singer Harry Nilsson, though Harrison gave the Evans family GBP 5,000 and turned up at the family home in 1982 to apologise for how he had treated his friend. In a final indignity, Evans' ashes went missing for a month when they were flown back to England, until they were found in a Heathrow storage room. The picture Evans had envisioned on the cover of his memoirs -smiling and wearing a cowboy hat - instead took up permanent residence on his parents' mantelpiece."}, {"type": "text", "text": "After the Evans family settled on Womack as the person to tell Mal's story during the pandemic, a box arrived at Womack's house.

At a glance, it still seems to be about car heists and strip clubs and drug deals and alligators and underground antics.

They often rest on the premise of defeating an enemy; if that enemy is a person, killing them is allegorical, a means to an end to reach the next stage of the game. For this reason, it would be reductive to draw direct comparisons between GTA and reality, between players' behaviour in Vice City and San Andreas and their behaviour in real life. Numerous studies have been conducted into the effects of violent video games and there is no substantive evidence that there is a causal link between playing them and real life violence."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Yet it's also true that this is a product that consumes endless hours of people's lives and immerses them completely in the universe, with little of the critical distance most of us rely on when we watch, for example, a violent film, and none of the satire that is often fundamental to other visual media concerned with moral depravity.

In GTA V there is a mission that involves the player helping a paparazzo upskirt a female celebrity.

Players are encouraged to buy and run strip clubs. Prostitutes are everywhere and visiting one boosts your health score - but, naturally, you have to pay them, which is a definite minus. Easily fixed, though - on GTAForums.com I find the helpful suggestion: 'pick up the Ho and drive to the beach right near the sea and she will do her business, she will boost your health to 150, when she gets out kill her and get your money back'."}, {"type": "text", "text": "All this is just part of the fabric of a game in which winning is achieved by dominance, aggression and depraved behaviour (GTA also got in trouble in 2006 due to a racially specific altercation in which the player is told by another character to 'kill the Haitian dickheads').
