Arriving this week is everything is alive, the band\u2019s second record post-reunion. The album is Slowdive as we have always known them: masters of shoegaze, an evanescent genre named for its player\u2019s tendency to literally gaze at the warrens of effects pedals by their feet. On everything is alive, Slowdive show off their arsenal: reverb-heavy guitars and a rolling rhythm section. Genteel vocals feel their way blindly but effortlessly through a fog of tremolo they have navigated hundreds of times before.

In advance of its world premiere this weekend in Venice, Cooper, a non-Jewish actor, has been excoriated in the media for wearing a prosthetic nose as Bernstein. It was naive of him not to have anticipated the furore his make-up was going to cause. Nonetheless, no one who sees the film will argue that this is anything other than an affectionate portrait. Cooper is effortlessly charming as the musician, playing him as a gregarious and lovable figure whose face seems to be fixed into a near-permanent smile."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Bernstein is a mass of contradictions. He\u2019s a conductor, teacher and TV personality as well as a composer. He writes both orchestral works and Broadway musicals. He needs privacy and solitude to create but loves to live his life flamboyantly in public."}, {"type": "text", "text": "It can\u2019t be said that the script, which Cooper co-wrote with Josh Singer, is especially taut. The storytelling is choppy and episodic. Scenes are strung together in a sometimes random fashion. However, Carey Mulligan is magnificent as the musician\u2019s South American wife, Felicia, a successful actor in her own right. She a warm, glamorous figure who mothers Bernstein even as he betrays her, and looks after his wardrobe (one reason why he becomes more dapper as the film goes on). Mulligan (who looks certain to win awards nominations) captures her character\u2019s pragmatism, imperiousness and, in the latter scenes, her extreme vulnerability."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Tensions in the marriage erupt because Lennie is bisexual and can\u2019t give up his male lovers.

Like Lady Gaga\u2019s Ally Maine in A Star is Born, Bernstein enjoys a meteoric rise.

He is only 25 at the time, a young bohemian on the make."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Bernstein is prodigiously talented but often far too busy socialising or teaching students to do justice to his own gifts. He\u2019s ambitious, sometimes ruthless and yet has a laidback bonhomie that marks him out as very different from the hard-driving fictional conductor played by Cate Blanchett in last year\u2019s Oscar contender, Tar. He is the type of man so desperate for company that he won\u2019t even lock the bathroom door."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Author Tom Wolfe famously satirised Bernstein as embodying \u201cradical chic\u201d. He was a wealthy, privileged New Yorker who hosted swanky parties for the Black Panthers at which he would serve little Roquefort cheese morsels rolled in crushed nuts.

He generally finds original ways to frame scenes. Several of the most heated spats between Bernstein and Felicia take place in the bedroom, as he is changing his socks or folding his trousers. There\u2019s a devastating moment of betrayal in which Bernstein is spotted by Felicia at the end of a corridor in an embrace with his lover Tommy (Gideon Glick). She doesn\u2019t say anything and he tries to pass it off as nothing important, but it\u2019s at this point their marriage begins to unravel."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Cooper also uses moments from Bernstein\u2019s work, for example, sailors hoofing it up in On the Town, to reveal details about his life. As an actor, he goes to extreme lengths to portray Bernstein accurately. He is shown playing the piano seemingly very proficiently. Everything about his performance from the hair to the gestures to that already notorious nose has clearly been thought about deeply. This, though, isn\u2019t one of those biopics portraying a long-suffering artist tormented by his own gifts. In order to create, Bernstein needs the music to \u201csing in\u201d him. He is at his best when he is happiest \u2013 and he is at his happiest when Felicia is by his side."}, {"type": "text", "text": "\u201cA work of art does not answer questions. It provokes them; and its essential meaning is in the tension between the contradictory answers,\u201d Bernstein famously said, in a quote that features in the film (produced by Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg). Fittingly, then, we never learn exactly what makes Bernstein tick. Cooper shows us his subject\u2019s mix of magnetism, volatility and childlike egotism but he remains a strangely elusive figure.

Its hired assassin hero (Michael Fassbender) is the latest in a very long line of movie hitmen with existential leanings. We never learn his name but we hear a lot about his philosophy on life. In the\u00a0voiceover\u00a0that runs throughout the movie, we discover that he likes to listen to The Smiths while on a job. He lives by various sacred rules, \u201canticipate don\u2019t improvise\u201d, \u201ctrust\u00a0no one\u201d and \u201cforbid empathy\u201d among them. Underlining his strangely poetic nature, he even occasionally makes reference to Dylan Thomas. "}, {"type": "text", "text": "A bravura opening sees him waiting for a small eternity high up in a building in Paris to take a shot at the next victim he has been assigned to murder. Ready to take as much time as the job needs, he does a bit of yoga and fiddles with his weaponry. He has little interest in the identity of his victim. The killer is a bit of a voyeur. Like James Stewart in\u00a0Rear Window, he uses his\u00a0high-powered\u00a0binoculars to peer into the lives of everyday people as they go about their business, maybe drinking coffee or making love. He seems to be the consummate professional. \u201cIf you are unable to endure boredom, this work is not for you,\u201d he tells us. Then the fateful moment comes when he finally has an opportunity to pull the trigger\u2026 and he misses. "}, {"type": "text", "text": "Fassbender excels in this type of role, as the lone wolf anti-hero who keeps his emotions firmly in check. He plays his character in a typically saturnine and intense style, his brow furrowed, his concentration absolute. When he flees the scene in Paris, he forces himself to show no sign of the panic he clearly feels. He dresses up as a German tourist realising that he\u2019ll blend in and that no one likes German tourists anyway \u2013 and so he will be left well alone. In the course of the movie, he goes on to do some very nasty things indeed and yet we still always take his side. "}, {"type": "text", "text": "Fincher, working with a screenplay from Andrew Kevin Walker (who also wrote his classic serial killer\u00a0Se7en), directs in as terse\u00a0a\u00a0way as Fassbender acts. This is a film with no narrative flab. Nonetheless, the suspicion remains that the director is not taking the assignment entirely seriously. Every so often, at moments of maximum tension, he will undercut proceedings with some comic schtick. For example, in the midst of a brutal fight with a\u00a0kick-boxing\u00a0heavy who\u2019s trying to kill him, Fassbender reaches into a kitchen drawer hoping to find a knife. He ends up with a cheese grater instead. The sudden blasts of Morrissey singing his most deadpan and lugubrious ballads heighten the sense that the filmmakers are only playing with the hitman genre. The film is adapted from a graphic novel by Alexis \u201cMatz\u201d Nolent and it\u2019s no surprise that it has such little emotional depth."}, {"type": "text", "text": "After his ignominious failure in Paris, the killer retreats to the Dominican Republic to hide out. He quickly discovers that his bosses have put out a contract on him. Worse, his girlfriend has been viciously assaulted (although she has refused to divulge any information about him). He vows revenge against her attackers. The story is divided into chapters following him as he pursues lawyers and rival assassins everywhere from New Orleans to Chicago. "}, {"type": "text", "text": "Tilda Swinton has a glorious cameo as a well-spoken hitwoman who is described several times as looking \u201clike a Q Tip\u201d. She is a thin, elegant and very witty figure whose approach to the art of killing is even more nihilistic than that of Fassbender. She likes fine food, malt whisky and ice cream \u2013 and never loses her poise even at moments of maximum peril. She gets most of the best lines in the movie although her screen time is fleeting. "}, {"type": "text", "text": "The Killer\u00a0is very slickly made. In its better moments, it has the same relentless intensity as films like Don Siegel\u2019s\u00a0The Killers\u00a0(1964)\u00a0and\u00a0John Boorman\u2019s\u00a0Point Blank\u00a0(1967) in which Lee Marvin is dishing out retribution against former associates.\u00a0The filmmaker\u00a0always shows\u00a0the same painstaking attention to detail as his homicidal hero does to the logistics of murdering his adversaries. Fassbender is well cast and gives a typically committed performance \u2013\u00a0one leavened by moments of very deadpan humour.\u00a0However. The Killer also\u00a0often drifts into the realm of self-conscious pastiche.\u00a0It\u2019s questionable, too, whether Fincher brings anything fresh to the genre. There is little here that audiences won\u2019t have seen before in all those other revenge thrillers in which disgruntled hired killers turn their ire and their fire against their former paymasters.\u00a0"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Dir: David Fincher.
