Here is a roundup of the day\u2019s main news: Jens Stoltenberg, Nato\u2019s secretary general, has said alliance members must ensure Ukraine keeps getting enough arms to pursue its counteroffensive against Russia. Ukraine is taking significant casualties and making slow progress towards the Russian main line of defence, western officials have admitted in one of the west\u2019s first assessments of the Ukrainian counteroffensive launched on 4 June. Ukraine reported incremental advances in its counteroffensive against Russian forces on Wednesday, in what the country\u2019s deputy defence minister described as \u201cextremely fierce\u201d fighting. In the past day, Ukrainian troops had advanced 200-500 metres in various areas near the largely devastated eastern city of Bakhmut, and 300-350 metres in the direction of the southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia, Hanna Maliar said. UN nuclear chief Rafael Grossi delayed a trip to the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station on Wednesday for security reasons, as heavy fighting raged in southern Ukraine. The Kremlin said it was concerned by unconfirmed media reports that a senior Chechen commander had been wounded in Ukraine. Earlier on Wednesday, the defence ministry\u2019s TV channel reported that Adam Delimkhanov, head of Chechnya\u2019s national guard, had been injured in Ukraine. Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov later claimed that Delimkhanov was alive and well. Kalibr missiles hit the southern Ukrainian city of Odesa at 2.40am on Wednesday, setting a warehouse, a business centre, an educational institution, restaurants and shops ablaze. It was a one of a number of attacks across the country on Wednesday that left 13 civilians dead and 24 injured. After a destructive feud between his top military chiefs and the mercenary warlord Yevgeny Prigozhin, Vladimir Putin has appeared to side with his top brass, calling for Russia\u2019s \u201cvolunteer detachments\u201d fighting in Ukraine to be placed under direct control of the defence ministry. The decision severely undermines Prigozhin, who has turned Wagner\u2019s role in the capture of Bakhmut into an outsized public profile in Russia that he uses to berate Putin\u2019s generals and promote himself. Speaking to a group of pro-war bloggers on Tuesday, the Russian president said he welcomed the defence minister Sergei Shoigu\u2019s initiative to force mercenary groups to sign contracts with the ministry \u2013 an order Prigozhin has refused to follow. You can read more on this story from my colleagues Pjotr Sauer and Andrew Roth here: The death toll from a strike on a warehouse and apartment block in the central Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih has been raised to 12 after the death of a 67-year-old man in hospital overnight, as my colleague Daniel Boffey reports. The destruction of the Kakhovka Dam has led to a \u201cdire humanitarian crisis\u201d in flooded communities downstream, the United Nations in Ukraine has said. The dam, part of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant, was breached in the early hours of 6 June, allowing some of the 18 cubic kilometres of water it held back to surge down across a swathe of southern Ukraine. The damage resulting from the collapse has forced the evacuation of thousands of people, flooded national parks and jeopardised water supplies to millions of people. The Ukrainian government has now requested the UN to help launch a post-disaster needs assessment that will look in depth at the long-term implications of the devastating destruction of the dam, the United Nations in Ukraine tweeted. Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov has said that Adam Delimkhanov, one of his senior commanders, is alive and well, dismissing reports that he had been killed or injured in Ukraine. Kadyrov, who has led Chechnya since 2007 and is a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, said in a post on the Telegram messenger app on Wednesday that Delimkhanov was \u201calive and well and not even wounded\u201d. Kadyrov added that he had known Delimkhanov was uninjured from the start of what he called \u201ca fake information attack\u201d, but had remained silent in order to embarrass Ukrainian media outlets which had reported on the commander\u2019s alleged injury. There had been unconfirmed rumours on Ukrainian social media channels that the Chechen commander had been killed in an artillery strike in southern Ukraine. Asked about the reports of Delimkhanov, head of Chechnya\u2019s national guard, being injured, the Kremlin earlier on Wednesday said it was \u201cworried\u201d and was waiting for clarification about what had really happened (See post at 13:35). Russia appears to have doubled the number of trained dolphins defending Sevastopol naval base in Crimea, evidence seen by Naval News suggests. Analysis indicates the number of trained dolphins has increased from 3-4 to 6-7. This means dolphin patrols might have increased in frequency and have possibly been covering a wider area. Russia has a history of training dolphins for military purposes, using the aquatic mammal to retrieve objects or deter enemy divers. The Sevastopol naval base is crucial for the Russian military, as it sits in the southern tip of Crimea which Moscow seized in 2014. Ukraine had also trained dolphins at an aquarium near Sevastopol, in a program born out of a Soviet-era scheme that fell into neglect in the 1990s. Jens Stoltenberg, Nato\u2019s secretary general, has said alliance members must ensure Ukraine keeps getting enough arms to pursue its counteroffensive against Russia. Kyiv\u2019s Western backers will meet on Thursday at Nato headquarters in Brussels to get the latest update from Ukraine\u2019s defence minister on the progress of the assaults, AFP reports. \u201cThe most obvious thing is to ensure they have the weapons, the supplies, the maintenance to continue to conduct the offensive,\u201d Stoltenberg told journalists. He added that there was always recognition that Ukraine would suffer losses as it seeks to breach heavily fortified Russian lines. Stoltenberg said: There will be casualties, also, when it comes to modern Nato equipment. No one expected there to be zero casualties. The realities of this is fierce, fierce fighting. Ukrainian troops have advanced 200-500 meters at various sections of the front line around the small eastern city of Bakhmut and 300-350 meters in the southern Zaporizhzhia region, Ukraine\u2019s deputy defence minister said. The UN nuclear chief, Rafael Grossi, delayed a planned trip to Ukraine\u2019s Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant until it is safer to travel, a senior Ukrainian government official said on Wednesday. The Kremlin said on Wednesday it was concerned by unconfirmed media reports that a senior Chechen commander had been wounded in Ukraine and was awaiting clarification about what had really happened. Earlier on Wednesday, the defence ministry\u2019s TV channel reported that Adam Delimkhanov, head of Chechnya\u2019s national guard, had been injured in Ukraine. Overnight, Russian missile attacks killed three people in the Black Sea city of Odesa and three in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine, Ukrainian officials said on Wednesday. Ukraine is taking significant casualties and making slow progress towards the Russian main line of defence, western officials have admitted in one of the west\u2019s first assessments of the Ukrainian counteroffensive launched on 4 June. The officials\u2019 sombre tone was clearly designed to lower expectations of a transformative breakthrough. However they nevertheless insisted the counteroffensive was \u201cgoing in the right direction\u201d and the losses were not unexpected. They said the counteroffensive was still in its early days and involved a form of warfare not seen in decades as Ukraine forces are forced to build single lanes of armoured vehicles through mines heading to main Russian defences that in some cases may be still as far as 20km away. \u201cThe vulnerability of the classic single lanes through the minefields make the Ukrainian armoury very vulnerable to attack,\u201d the officials said. The officials denied Ukraine had lost as many as 120 armoured vehicles \u2013 a figure touted by Moscow. One official said: \u201cThe Russian manoeuvre and defence approach is proving challenging for the Ukraine and costly to attacking forces hence the advance at the moment is slow\u201d. The officials suggested there is likely to be \u201cgrinding costly warfare likely for many months to come. This is incredibly difficult. They are going against a well-prepared line that the Russians have had months to prepare. Russia has generally put up a good defence from their well-prepared positions and falling back to tactical lines. Whilst they are inflicting casualties on the Russians they are not significant because the Russians are choosing the time to withdraw in a manner similar to the way the Ukrainians defended themselves against Russian vehicles. \u201cThe idea that the Russians were just going to melt away and the Ukrainians were going to drive straight through their defensive line was in people\u2019s wildest dreams. \u201cIn this conflict the advantage has always been with the defender\u201d. The officials said it may not be clear for as long as three months whether the offensive could be classified as a success. Most of the vehicles that have been damaged have been hit by mines. As the Ukrainians advance they are also more exposed to drone assaults. The officials played down suggestions that this assault was likely to give Ukraine a tactical advantage as early as September, and so give it space to reopen talks with Vladimir Putin. \u201cWe are a long way away from Ukraine being in a position to reopen negotiations\u201d, the officials said. The slow progress is likely to place greater pressure on the west to signal to Putin that it is prepared for a long haul, and will not treat the counteroffensive as Ukraine\u2019s one shot at reclaiming its territory. Ukraine has long feared support may decline in the west if the supply of western arms does not produce early tangible results. Western officials admitted that western-supplied jets may not be available in the short term, even if training of Ukrainian pilots is now underway. The officials also suggested Putin might have taken a truth serum before meeting military correspondents where he said Russia was suffering severe tank losses and suffering problems with its military industrial base. Even though there was still a huge amount of confusion about exact Russian deployment, the officials said the vast majority of Russian forces are now committed to positions on the line partly due to the sheer size of the line that has to be defended. That gave Russia little room for further manoeuvre to deploy reinforcements if a point in the line became vulnerable. By contrast Ukraine was holding back some of its heaviest armoury, including Challenger tanks. Turkey\u2019s president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan has rebuffed growing international pressure on Ankara to ratify Sweden\u2019s Nato membership bid before the western defence alliance meets in July. Western officials had hoped Erdo\u011fan would soften his position on the diplomatically charged issue after he secured a hard-fought re-election last month (AFP reports). But Erdo\u011fan signalled no major shift in comments released by his office while Turkish and Swedish officials were locked in last-minute negotiations in Ankara. Sweden and its Nordic neighbour Finland ended decades of military non-alignment and applied to join the US-led defence bloc in response to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Turkey and fellow Nato member Hungary ratified Finland\u2019s membership this year. But both countries\u2019 parliaments have yet to approve Sweden\u2019s entry. Turkey is pushing Sweden to ban and crack down on rallies by Kurdish supporters of a group recognised as a terrorist organisation by Ankara. Sweden hopes to be able to determine who was behind the Nord Stream gas pipeline sabotage by the autumn, the prosecutor leading the country\u2019s investigation told Swedish radio, Reuters reports. In September 2022, several unexplained underwater explosions ruptured the Nord Stream 1 and newly-built Nord Stream 2 pipelines that link Russia and Germany across the Baltic Sea. The blasts occurred in the economic zones of Sweden and Denmark and both countries say the explosions were deliberate though they have yet to single out who was responsible. There has been an update on the fire that broke out on Wednesday at the Novocherkassk power station in Russia\u2019s southern Rostov region, close to the border with Ukraine (See post at 12:54). Citing reports, the Kyiv Independent tweeted that the fire was said to have started due to \u201cnon-compliance with safety precautions during repair work\u201d. Here are some pictures of a local clean up effort in Odesa after a missile attack hit the southern Ukrainian city. The Duma, the lower house of Russia\u2019s parliament, said on Wednesday it had voted to give its initial backing to legislation that would allow the defence ministry to sign contracts with suspected or convicted criminals to fight in Ukraine. More than 15 months into its invasion of Ukraine, Russia is trying to recruit more soldiers for Europe\u2019s largest land conflict since the second world war. Under the proposed changes, a contract could be concluded with someone being investigated for committing a crime, or who is having their case heard in court, or who has been convicted \u2013 but before the verdict takes legal effect, according to the database of the Duma. People convicted of sexual crimes, treason, terrorism or extremism would not be able to sign up, Reuters reports. Those who do sign up would be exempt from criminal liability upon completion of their contract or if they receive awards for their combat prowess. The Wagner mercenary group was previously allowed to recruit convicts from prisons to fight in Ukraine, but said in February it had stopped. Prison rights activists say the defence ministry has taken over that process but wanted to make changes. The new changes being examined by the Duma do not cover recruitment of people already serving their sentences and the defence ministry has not commented. The Kremlin said on Wednesday it was concerned by unconfirmed media reports that a senior Chechen commander had been wounded in Ukraine and was awaiting clarification about what had really happened, Reuters reports. Earlier on Wednesday, the defence ministry\u2019s TV channel reported that Adam Delimkhanov, head of Chechnya\u2019s national guard, had been injured in Ukraine (See post at 10:32am). Delimkhanov, who is a member of the Duma as well as commander of the Chechen division of the Russian national guard, is widely seen as the Caucasian region\u2019s second most senior official, behind Ramzan Kadyrov. Vladimir Putin will hold talks in Moscow on Wednesday with Cuba\u2019s prime minister, Manuel Marrero Cruz, the Kremlin said. Russia is seeking to bolster relations with Latin American, African and other non-western countries as the west tries to isolate and economically punish it for its invasion of Ukraine. Germany enshrined a Nato commitment to spending 2% of its gross domestic product on defence and identified Russia as the biggest threat to European security as the government announced its first ever National Security Strategy on Wednesday. Here are some of the highlights of Germany\u2019s strategy outlined in a policy document and at a government press conference, as reported by Reuters: Russia is the biggest threat to peace in the Euro-Atlantic area Russia is trying to destabilise European democracies, weaken EU and Nato German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said it is important to continue to discuss security guarantees for Ukraine, including when the war ends Germany\u2019s military budget was the seventh largest in the world last year behind the US, China, Russia, India, Saudi Arabia and the UK. Nato members pledged in 2014 to move towards spending 2% of GDP on defence by 2024. A fire broke out on Wednesday at the Novocherkassk power station in Russia\u2019s southern Rostov region close to the border with Ukraine, state-owned news agency RIA reported. It did not say what had caused the blaze. Here is an update on the UN nuclear chief\u2019s trip to Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant being delayed due to travel safety concerns (See post at 09:34). The head of Russian-installed authorities in Zaporizhzhia region, Yevgeny Balitsky, also said the trip was delayed. \u201cWe will wait for Grossi at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant on 15 June, the visit is delayed by a day,\u201d he was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying. German Galushchenko, Ukraine\u2019s energy minister, said the trip had been pushed back, possibly by days, Reuters reports. Russian news agency Interfax quoted a Russian-installed local official as saying Grossi would visit on Thursday. Ukraine has accused Russian military forces of attacking a car near the two countries\u2019 shared border, and killing six people. Writing on Telegram, Ukraine\u2019s general prosecutor\u2019s office said the attack happened on Tuesday in the Sumy region, in eastern Ukraine. These claims could not immediately be independently verified. Moscow is yet to officially comment on the allegations. The International Committee on the Red Cross, under ferocious criticism from the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, admitted the principles of neutrality under which it operates have been put under unprecedented strain by the Ukraine war. It also defended the quality of its response to the floods caused by the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam in southern Ukraine, saying it had been working tightly with the Ukrainian Red Cross to coordinate efforts to supply drinking water. Juerg Eglin, ICRC\u2019s head of delegation in Ukraine, also revealed that Russia was continuing to refuse to give the body access to the Russian-occupied side of the Dnipro River, where the ICRC estimates that most of the 50,000 people affected by the floods are living. Refusing to share the Russian explanation for refusing to grant access since the discussions were not over, he said: \u201cWe are ready to intervene on both sides of the river and have made concrete requests.\u201d The ICRC said hundreds of thousands had been affected in a different way upstream of the dam, and that the risk of mines was becoming a growing threat to the civilian population. He added that ICRC staff were working under the risk of shelling. More broadly, the ICRC said it had now visited 1,500 prisoners from both sides, and that the visits had led to improvements in conditions in Russia. It had also delivered 2,500 messages between prisoners and relatives. Defending the ICRC from Zelenskiy\u2019s longstanding criticism, the organisation said the principles under which it operates were not always understood. Ariane Bauer, ICRC\u2019s regional director for Europe and central Asia, said: \u201cThe current environment we are in is extremely mediatised. Our efforts are not always visible. Our discrete approach can sometimes seem out of sync with today\u2019s realities of today\u2019s information space. \u201cNeutrality and trust remain central to meeting our objectives and they cannot be dissociated one from another. Remaining neutral means we stick to our principles \u2013 the very principles that help people that need our support. \u201cRemaining neutral shows that we care for the mandate we were given by states that were signatory to the Geneva convention. We have seen neutrality under strain and misunderstood in this conflict and many others, but perhaps more in this than others. For us, neutrality is not a moral position, it is a tool that helps us work and get access to prisoners of war and populations in hard-to-reach areas.\u201d She refused to comment on whether Ukrainian prisoners of war in Russia were in worse conditions than Russians held in Ukraine, but said improvements in conditions in Russia had followed ICRC visits to Russia. Russia had also cooperated with the ICRC by setting up lists of named prisoners held under its authority, she said. The water receded by another 32cm in the Kherson Region, in southern Ukraine, overnight, but 28 de-occupied settlements are still flooded, the Kyiv Post cited the regional military administration as saying on Wednesday morning. In the early hours on Tuesday last week, footage began to emerge of water spilling from the strategically important Nova Kakhovka dam in southern Ukraine. The Ukrainian army\u2019s southern military command said the dam had been blown up by Russian forces. The local Russian-installed mayor has called it a \u201cterrorist act\u201d. Ukraine reported incremental advances in its counteroffensive against Russian forces on Wednesday, in what it said was \u201cextremely fierce\u201d fighting Reuters reports. In a post on Telegram, the deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, said the Ukrainian actions had had \u201cpartial\u201d success. In the past day, Ukrainian troops advanced 200-500 metres in various areas near the small eastern city of Bakhmut, and 300-350 metres in the direction of the south-eastern city of Zaporizhzhia, she said. She reported continuing fighting near the village of Makarivka in the direction of the southern port city of Berdiansk, and said battles were raging in the areas of Novodanylivka and Novopokrovsk in the Mariupol direction. Maliar said: Our troops are moving in the face of extremely fierce fighting, and air and artillery superiority of the enemy. If you haven\u2019t already seen it, this stark piece from our colleague Lorenzo Tondo is well worth a read \u2026 The war in Ukraine has driven the largest annual increase of people forcibly displaced by persecution, conflict, violence and human rights violations in decades, according to the UN refugee agency. In 2022, the number of displaced people grew by 21%, standing at an estimated 108.4 million at the end of the year. That is likely have risen to more than 110 million people in May 2023, with Russia\u2019s invasion and the war in Sudan being the biggest drivers of the growth, according to a report released on Wednesday by UNHCR. \u201cThese figures show us that some people are far too quick to rush to conflict, and way too slow to find solutions. The consequence is devastation, displacement, and anguish for each of the millions of people forcibly uprooted from their homes,\u201d said Filippo Grandi, the UN high commissioner for refugees. Wagner chief reiterates refusal to sign contracts with Russian defence ministry Russian mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin on Wednesday reiterated the refusal of his Wagner fighters to sign contracts with the defence ministry, a day after the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said the agreements were needed. In a rare direct show of defiance towards the Russian leader, Prigozhin said: \u201cNone of Wagner\u2019s fighters is ready to go down the path of shame again. That\u2019s why they will not sign the contracts.\u201d In a televised meeting on Tuesday, Putin backed a call by the defence ministry for \u201cvolunteer\u201d fighters in Ukraine to sign contracts with the country\u2019s military command, widely seen as a means to assert control over Wagner. Putin said that contracts were necessary to allow all participants in Russia\u2019s campaign in Ukraine to receive the social support payments to which they are entitled. These include compensation to fighters if they are wounded, and to their families if they are killed in action. Prigozhin has waged a bitter public feud with Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and the army top brass since last year, accusing them of failing to provide adequate support and ammunition to Wagner forces in Ukraine and so causing them to suffer higher casualties. In Wednesday\u2019s remarks, however, he said he thought a \u201ccompromise solution\u201d would be found between Putin and parliament to enable Wagner fighters to receive social guarantees and certified status as combatants. (Via Reuters) More here on the missing Chechen commander Adam Delimkhanov \u2026 Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov has made a bizarre appeal for information from Ukrainian intelligence over the location of Adam Delimkhanov, his right hand man and a member of the Russian state Duma. The message on Kadyrov\u2019s official Telegram account followed reports of a strike on Delimkhanov\u2019s convoy in the Zaporizhzhia region which is at the heart of the Ukrainian counter offensive. Kadyrov writes: \u201cI myself can\u2019t find Adam Delimkhanov in any way. He doesn\u2019t get in touch. I ask Ukrainian intelligence to provide information on exactly what place and what positions were hit, so that I can still find my dear BROTHER. I promise a generous reward and I ask you to help.\u201d Russia\u2019s defence ministry quoted the State Duma as confirming Delimkhanov had been injured but they provided no further information. Kyrylo Sazonov, a Ukrainian military blogger, has claimed on his Facebook account that Delimkhanov was killed in an attack near the city of Prymorsk, west of Mariupol, after Ukrainian intelligence had spotted a motorcade of SUVs. He writes: \u201cThere were no wounded... All the bodies were taken away by helicopters. They arrived in half an hour.\u201d Senior commander of Russia\u2019s Chechen forces in Ukraine has been wounded \u2013 report A senior commander of Russia\u2019s Chechen forces fighting in Ukraine has been wounded, Russia\u2019s defence ministry television channel Zvezda reported on Wednesday, citing the press service of the state Duma, the lower house of parliament. Adam Delimkhanov, who is a member of the Duma as well as commander of the Chechen division of the Russian national guard, is widely seen as the Caucasian region\u2019s second most senior official, behind Ramzan Kadyrov. In a message posted on Telegram, Kadyrov wrote that he could not contact Delimkhanov, and asked for help finding his \u201cdear brother\u201d. Delimkhanov, a former Chechen separatist who eventually switched sides to Moscow along with much of the region\u2019s leadership, had taken a prominent role in Russia\u2019s military campaign in Ukraine, commanding Chechen forces in Mariupol in the conflict\u2019s early days. Earlier on Wednesday, Ukrainian media reported that Delimkhanov had been killed in an artillery strike in southern Ukraine. (Via Reuters) Reuters has a useful explainer on the Russian tactical nuclear weapons that are to be stationed in Belarus, and which the country\u2019s president, Alexander Lukashenko, mentioned earlier (see here). Putin said that \u201ctactical\u201d nuclear weapons \u2013 so called as they are designed for battlefield use \u2013 would be sent to Belarus, but did not say exactly which warheads would be deployed or where. Lukashenko said the warheads were three times more powerful than the atomic bombs the US dropped on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945. The Hiroshima bomb, made from highly enriched uranium-235, was about 16 kilotons (equivalent to 16,000 tonnes of TNT), while the Nagasaki bomb, made from plutonium-239, was about 21 kilotons, according to the World Nuclear Association. If Lukashenko is correct, the Russian warheads would have a yield of about 48 to 63 kilotons each. Russia has about 1,816 non-strategic nuclear warheads, according to analysis of Russia\u2019s nuclear weapons by Bulletin of Atomic Scientists magazine. Putin said Iskander mobile short-range ballistic missiles, which can deliver nuclear warheads, had already been handed over to Belarus. Russian sources say the Iskander has a range of 500km (310 miles). Putin also said 10 Belarusian aircraft had been adapted to carry the warheads. Belarus said Su-25 aircraft had been adapted to carry the warheads. The Sukhoi-25 jet has a range of up to 1,000km (621 miles), according to Russian sources. The Federation of American Scientists has said the weapons could be based at Lida airbase, 40km (25 miles) from the Lithuanian border. If so, the delivery vehicles could reach most of Ukraine, almost all of eastern Europe, including the Baltic states, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Czech Republic, Romania, a swathe of Germany, as well as some of Denmark, Sweden and Finland. Cities such as Berlin and Stockholm would be in range. Putin said Russia would finish the construction of a special storage facility in Belarus on 7-8 July and that the weapons would be deployed soon afterwards. Lukashenko has made different comments. He seemed to indicate last month that the weapons were already on the move while on 13 June he said the weapons would be deployed in \u201cseveral days\u201d. He has also said that there could be \u201cnuclear weapons for everyone\u201d who joined the Russia-Belarus union. In a video published on 14 June, Lukashenko said his country had started taking delivery of Russian tactical nuclear weapons. Germany is aiming to reduce its dependence on commodities through diversification of supply, and to create incentives for firms to hold strategic reserves, according to a summary of its new national security strategy. The strategy, which is expected to be published in full later on Wednesday, comes a year and a half after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, which exposed Germany\u2019s reliance on Russia for energy. It also contains a commitment for Germany to spend an average of 2% of economic output on defence, according to the summary \u2013 a weaker pledge, however, than the one made by chancellor Olaf Scholz days after the Russian invasion in a landmark speech heralding a \u201cturning of era\u201d or Zeitenwende in German foreign policy. Scholz had said Germany would start to invest more than 2% of economic output on defence, up from about 1.5%, after years of resisting pleas from Nato allies to do so. (Via Reuters) Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to the Ukrainian interior ministry, has shared a video which purports to be an interview with a woman who was trapped under rubble after a Russian strike overnight, whose husband did not survive the attack. The UN nuclear chief, Rafael Grossi, has delayed a planned trip to Ukraine\u2019s Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant until it is safer to travel, a senior Ukrainian government official said on Wednesday. Grossi had been expected to visit the facility on Wednesday after talks in Kyiv on Tuesday, but a diplomatic source said the visit would be delayed by \u201csome hours\u201d. The Russian news agency Interfax quoted a Russian-imposed local official as saying Grossi would visit the plant on Thursday. \u201cHe\u2019s waiting to be able to travel safely,\u201d said the senior Ukrainian government official, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity. The official did not say when Grossi would arrive at the plant in southeastern Ukraine. Here are some more images from the news wires showing the damage in Odesa, where at least three people have been killed and 13 wounded. Sweden hopes to be able to determine who was behind the Nord Stream gas pipeline sabotage by the autumn, the prosecutor leading the country\u2019s investigation told Swedish radio. Reuters reports that Mats Ljungqvist, the prosecutor leading the Swedish investigation, told Swedish Radio he had met the German prosecutor and that they were working together but declined to give further details. \u201cI hope that we at least this autumn will be able to make a decision regarding indictments, at least that is the ambition as things stand now,\u201d Ljungqvist told Swedish public service broadcaster SR. \u201cI think, actually, in time, [who carried out the sabotage] will be brought to light.\u201d Germany has confirmed its investigators raided a ship in January that may have been used to transport the explosives used to blow up the pipelines. German media reported the boat could have been used by a small Ukrainian or pro-Ukrainian group. Ljungqvist told Reuters in April that the main scenario was that a state or a state-backed group was behind the attack. A former campaign leader for the jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was sentenced to seven years and six months in prison on Wednesday for \u201ccreating an extremist organisation\u201d, Reuters reports, citing the rights group OVD-Info. Navalny supporters reacted with outrage to the sentence against Liliya Chanysheva. Navalny, Putin\u2019s best-known opponent, is serving sentences totalling more than 11 years in a penal colony for fraud and other charges that he says were trumped up to silence him. He faces further \u201cextremism\u201d charges that could extend his term by decades. Human rights groups and western governments view Navalny as a political prisoner. Andriy Yermak, head of the office of the Ukrainian presidency, has used the strike on Odesa to reiterate Ukraine\u2019s frequent calls for a tightening of economic sanctions on Russia. In a post on Telegram, he said: The Russians shelled the city with Kalibr cruise missiles. Civilians died. Each of these missiles has at least 40 foreign components. Without microelectronics, Russia will not be able to produce them. Sanctions must be strengthened, in particular, against those who help the terrorist country to obtain components for weapons. A planned visit by the UN nuclear chief, Rafael Grossi, to Ukraine\u2019s Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been delayed by \u201csome hours\u201d, a diplomatic source has told Reuters. No reason has been given for the delay. Suspilne reports that the number of people killed due to the rocket attack on Kryvyi Rih on Tuesday has increased to 12. Citing the city authority, it said a 67-year-old wounded man died in the hospital overnight. Dmitry Medvedev, long-term ally of Vladimir Putin and currently deputy chair of the security council of Russia, has said on Telegram that Russia needs to put in a demilitarised zone as far west as Ukraine\u2019s Lviv, which he referred to by its Russian name Lvov and German name Lemberg. He went on to say that, as a result of the Nord Stream sabotage, for which he cited \u201cwestern complicity\u201d, that Russia should have \u201cno restrictions left to refrain from destroying the cable communications of our enemies, laid along the ocean floor\u201d. Here are some images released by the emergency services in Ukraine showing the aftermath of strikes in Kramatorsk and Kostyantynivka, Donetsk region. Three people have been killed and another three injured in an early morning Russian attack on Kramatorsk and Kostyantynivka in Donetsk, according to the regional governor. Suspilne, Ukraine\u2019s state broadcaster, reports that at least five houses were destroyed and about 20 more were damaged in Kramatorsk, while two houses were destroyed and 55 were damaged in Kostyantynivka. It cites the regional governor, Pavlo Kyrylenko. He stated that the attack happened at 5am local time (3am BST). The UK\u2019s Ministry of Defence has issued its daily intelligence briefing on how it sees the situation on the ground in Ukraine. It claims: In the last two weeks, there has been an uptick in Russian tactical combat air sorties, especially over southern Ukraine. This has almost certainly been in response to reports of increased Ukrainian offensive operations, as the Russian Aerospace Forces (VKS) attempt to support ground troops with airstrikes. Despite the uptick, VKS\u2019 daily sortie rate remains much lower than the peak of up to 300 daily missions early in the war. This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog in London.

Last week the Kakhovka dam in the city was destroyed, flooding swaths of land and forcing thousands to flee one of the biggest environmental disasters in Europe for decades. The administration also said that shelling of the nearby village of Plodovoye disrupted power supply there. Reuters could not independently verify the report. Ukraine and Russia deny targeting civilians in their military operations. Each side has accused the other of shelling the flooded areas in the aftermath of the dam blast. Separately, the administration said 7,200 people had been evacuated from the flooded areas in the past week, including 421 children. \u2013 Reuters The Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, says he won\u2019t hesitate to use Russian tactical nuclear weapons if faced with an act of aggression. Lukashenko\u2019s comment contradicts earlier statements by the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, who has said that nuclear weapons stationed in Belarus would remain exclusively under the control of Moscow. On Tuesday, Lukashenko said \u201ceverything is ready\u201d for the Russian nuclear weapons\u2019 deployment, adding that \u201cit could take just a few days for us to get what we had asked for and even a bit more\u201d. Asked later by a Russian state TV host whether Belarus had already received some of the weapons, Lukashenko responded: \u201cNot all of them, little by little.\u201d He appeared to confirm that his government had taken possession of some weapons from Russia and added that they were three times more powerful than the atomic bombs dropped on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. God forbid I have to make a decision to use those weapons today, but there would be no hesitation if we face an aggression. But in a later media appearance on Russian TV on Tuesday, he clarified he would consult with Putin before using any of the weapons. Listen, if a war starts, do you think I will look around? I pick up the phone, and wherever he is, he picks it up. If he calls, I pick it up any time. It\u2019s no problem at all to coordinate launching a strike. Russian officials had no immediate comment on Lukashenko\u2019s remarks. \u2013 AP The International Atomic Energy Agency chief, Rafael Grossi, is expected to visit the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to \u201cmake his own assessment\u201d on the risks posed to the operation by the war in Ukraine. Before his site visit, Grossi met the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, on Tuesday night to discuss the issue after the destruction of the Kakhovka dam, which formed a reservoir that provided cooling water for the plant. Speaking to journalists before his visit, Grossi said the situation complicated \u201can already precarious nuclear safety and security situation\u201d. It is a step in the wrong direction, it is yet another step in the weakening of the safety net that one has in any nuclear power plant. Grossi said he would assess the integrity of the station\u2019s water channels and cooling pond, and clarify whether the pond has been mined. I would say \u2013 again without having visited and on the basis of what my team there is informing me \u2013 there will be water (in the pond) for a few weeks, or maybe a month or two. There is no immediate situation: there is water there, but it could be going down. He also said that even if the reservoir empties \u201cthere are alternatives\u201d such as pumping in water or drilling for groundwater. Three people have been killed and at least 13 injured in a Russian missile attack on the southern Ukrainian city of Odesa, Ukrainian forces have said. Air defences downed two Kalibr cruise missiles, but authorities said the attack still struck civilian infrastructure including a business centre, an educational institution, a residential complex, restaurants and shops. The warehouse of a retail chain was also hit in the attack, causing a fire to break out. Work is under way to clear the debris and a search is taking place for people trapped under the rubble. Hello and welcome back to our live coverage of Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine \u2013 this is Royce Kurmelovs bringing you the latest developments. Three people have been killed and at least 13 injured during a missile attack on the city of Odesa, Ukrainian officials said on Wednesday. Authorities say the attack struck civilian infrastructure in the southern port city and work is under way to pick through the rubble in the search for survivors. The head of the UN\u2019s nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, has met the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to discuss risks to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant before a planned visit to the facility. After the meeting, Grossi told journalists that he planned to travel to the plant on Wednesday so he could \u201cmake [his] own assessment\u201d as to \u201cwhat kind of danger we have\u201d. Zelenskiy has praised the courage of Ukrainian troops during the early stages of his country\u2019s counteroffensive and singled out units operating near the besieged city of Bakhmut, saying: \u201cThere is forward movement in various areas.\u201d Zelenskiy also praised several other units, thanking them \u201cfor your strength\u201d. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, claimed that Ukrainian losses during the conflict were near \u201ccatastrophic\u201d and that the counterattack had not been successful in any area. The Russian president made the claim during televised meetings with war correspondents and military bloggers. \u201cThis is a massive counteroffensive, using strategic reserves that were prepared for this task,\u201d Putin said. \u201cThey lost over 160, we lost 54 tanks, and some of them are subject to restoration and repair.\u201d In other news: Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, has said his country won\u2019t hesitate to use Russian nuclear weapons in the event his country is threatened with repression. The US House of Representatives has voted unanimously on a resolution calling for Russia to immediately release the imprisoned US journalist Evan Gershkovich. Moscow has flagged that it may withdraw from the Black Sea grain deal, after Putin said he had been cheated by the west, who had failed to deliver on a promise to help bring Russian agricultural goods to world markets. A Russian missile strike on a block of flats in Kryvyi Rih in central Ukraine has killed 11 and injured more than 30 people, according to an updated casualty list provided by Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Tuesday. The US president, Joe Biden, has met Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg before a major meeting of the alliance next month in Lithuania where questions about Ukraine\u2019s membership are expected to be addressed. The US government has announced a new military aid package for Ukraine worth $325m which includes artillery rounds, anti-aircraft systems and 15 new Bradley infantry fighting vehicles. The UK Ministry of Defence has announced a $115m air defence package for Ukraine. Latvia has allocated another $460,000 in aid to Ukraine after the Kakhova dam disaster. Ukrainian forces have been confirmed to have liberated the village of Neskuchne on Tuesday after Reuters journalists were able to reach the area.

Garland\u2019s comments, made at a press event on Wednesday, are the first time he has commented publicly about the indictment since Trump pleaded not guilty to federal criminal charges on Tuesday, Reuters reports. Garland said: When I appointed Mr Smith, I did so because it underscores the justice department\u2019s commitment to both independence and accountability. Smith was a \u201cveteran career prosecutor\u201d who has \u201cassembled a group of experienced and talented prosecutors and agents who share his commitment to integrity and the rule of law\u201d, Garland continued. He added: Any questions about this matter will have to be answered by their filings in court. Asked what role he had in the indictment process, Garland replied: My role is completely consistent with the regulations that set forth responsibilities to the attorney general under the special counsel regulations, and I followed those regulations. Donald Trump raised more than $2m at a fundraising event at his golf resort in Bedminster, New Jersey, just hours after appearing in a Miami federal court on Tuesday, according to a report. A \u201ccandlelight dinner\u201d with top donors and campaign bundlers raised $2.04m, Politico reported, citing a person familiar with the campaign. The former president addressed his supporters after he arrived at the Bedminster resort on Tuesday evening, and was seated at table with donors and supporters that included the Republican senator, Tommy Tuberville, from Alabama, according to the news outlet. Republicans have spent today digesting Tuesday\u2019s arraignment of Donald Trump, the most recent GOP politician to occupy the White House. Mike Pence, Trump\u2019s former vice-president who has broken with him, tried to thread the needle, simultaneously calling the allegations \u201cvery serious\u201d while worrying about the politicization of the justice department. At the Capitol, several Republican senators warned of retaliation over the charges, while a high-profile House committee announced a hearing looking into a Trump-era report that was critical of the FBI. Here\u2019s what else has happened today so far: Fox News appeared to repudiate an on-screen label that called Joe Biden a \u201cwannabe dictator\u201d. Biden has instructed White House officials and the Democratic Party\u2019s offices not to comment on the charges against Trump, according to a report. If you have been wondering where the best place to store classified documents in your home is, here is the answer. Republican senators are scrambling to defend Donald Trump from the charges unveiled yesterday, and from future indictments. Jack Smith, the special counsel who indicted the former president over the classified documents found at Mar-a-Lago, is also investigating his involvement in the January 6 insurrection, and the overall effort to overturn the 2020 election, and could file separate indictments over those matters. CNN reports that GOP senator Lindsey Graham has warned against doing that, while another lawmaker, John Cornyn, equated the charges against Trump to the scandal over Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server: On Fox News, GOP senator Marsha Blackburn was eager to draw attention to the president\u2019s son Hunter Biden, a Republican fixation who may soon be in legal trouble of his own: In a statement to the Washington Post, Fox News said an on-screen caption displayed last night that refers to Joe Biden as a \u201cwannabe dictator\u201d was \u201caddressed\u201d. Fox News has long been a mainstay of American conservative media, and the chyron reading \u201cwannabe dictator speaks at the White House after having his political rival arrested\u201d appeared during a split-screen showing Biden while the network was covering Donald Trump\u2019s speech at his New Jersey golf club after his arraignment. A Fox News spokesperson told the Post \u201cthe chyron was taken down immediately and was addressed\u201d, without providing specifics. You can read more about the dust-up, which was over the top even for a network with a history of deference to Trump, below: If you, too, have a stash of classified documents at your property and would like to keep them safe, then read Guardian reporter Wilfred Chan\u2019s exploration into the best places to store such material: Let\u2019s say you\u2019re a world leader who has improperly retained juicy national security secrets after leaving office. What would be a safer place to stash them: your bathroom or your garage? According to the House speaker, Kevin McCarthy, who on Monday defended Donald Trump after photos released by federal investigators showed boxes of classified documents piled high next to a shower in the ex-president\u2019s Florida resort home, the answer is the bathroom. \u201cA bathroom door locks,\u201d the California Republican said. That would be more secure, McCarthy argued, than the location where classified documents were found stored in Joe Biden\u2019s residence: in his garage \u201cthat opens up all the time\u201d. Donald Trump Jr would have been right at home in the crowd that gathered outside the Miami federal courthouse yesterday as the former president was being arraigned, the Guardian\u2019s Richard Luscombe reports: Even by Florida\u2019s already unorthodox standards, the arraignment of Donald J Trump, the ultimate carnival barker, in Miami on Tuesday afternoon was something of a circus. The concept of a former leader of the free world appearing before a federal judge to deny he stole and retained some of the nation\u2019s most sensitive secrets \u2013 keeping some in a bathroom \u2013 was surreal enough. But the historic act of the twice impeached, twice indicted ex-president actually doing so, while remaining the runaway favorite to win the Republican party\u2019s nomination for next year\u2019s general election, was extraordinary. Joe Biden may be keeping quiet about Donald Trump\u2019s indictment, but the former president\u2019s family is out in full force and decrying the charges. On rightwing Real America\u2019s Voice, Donald Trump Jr held forth with his customary apocalyptic rhetoric about the allegations against his father: Joe Biden has refused to publicly comment on the federal charges leveled against his predecessor Donald Trump over allegedly hoarding government documents from his time in the White House, and Politico reports the president has also instructed Democratic party offices to do the same. While many top Democratic lawmakers have condemned the allegations against Trump, neither Biden nor top officials at the White House or his re-election campaign have spoken out about the indictment and his arraignment in Miami yesterday. Politico reports that some Democrats \u2013 none of whom would allow their names to be used \u2013 believe the strategy is a missed opportunity to cast Trump as reckless and boost Biden\u2019s re-election chances. Here\u2019s more from their story: Biden has privately told aides that he is disgusted by Trump\u2019s behavior but is adhering to his promise that the Department of Justice would have independence from the White House. The DNC, meanwhile, has advised members of Congress seeking guidance on what to say that they should not comment on the Trump probes if they are speaking publicly in their role as Biden campaign surrogates. While Biden has framed his stance as in line with longstanding tradition, it is not uncommon for presidents to occasionally weigh in on ongoing criminal investigations. Biden has at times done so himself \u2013 including weighing in before the verdict was announced in the 2021 trial of the white Minneapolis police officer who killed George Floyd. Some people in Biden\u2019s orbit believe that the moment calls for his imprimatur, outlining for the nation the gravity of a former president facing charges in a federal court. Others believe it would be political malpractice to not make Trump\u2019s woes a campaign issue and privately said that they wish the president\u2019s campaign would take on the issue directly. They argue that the charges connected to Trump\u2019s alleged reckless mishandling of some of the United States\u2019 top secrets shows that he is unfit for the job. And they believe that both the ongoing January 6 and Georgia election interference probes illuminate their central campaign arguments. Top Donald Trump ally Taylor Budowich does not think much of Mike Pence\u2019s stance on the former president\u2019s indictment: Last week, Budowich, who heads the Maga Inc super Pac, was called to testify before a federal grand jury investigating Trump. As the Guardian\u2019s Royce Kurmelovs reports, Fox News was particularly strident in defending Donald Trump following yesterday\u2019s arraignment: Fox News labelled US president Joe Biden a \u201cwannabe dictator\u201d who attempted to have \u201chis political rival arrested\u201d during a live broadcast of Donald Trump\u2019s post-arraignment speech. The network was the only major cable news network to carry Trump\u2019s Tuesday evening speech live, with CNN and MSNBC choosing not to air the address. Towards the end of the speech, viewers were presented with a split screen carrying a separate speech from Biden at the White House. Below the image, the news chyron read: \u201cwannabe dictator speaks at the White House after having his political rival arrested\u201d. Donald Trump may have put an end to Mike Huckabee\u2019s White House ambitions by hoovering up his evangelical Christian support base in the 2016 primaries, but the former Arkansas governor and Baptist minister is nonetheless a fan of the ex-president. In an appearance on Fox Business today, Huckabee reached for the Old Testament to describe Trump\u2019s current legal peril: Mike Pence went on CNBC this morning to simultaneously express dismay at what Donald Trump is alleged to have done, while insinuating bias in the justice department. It was pretty much the same thing as what he said to the Wall Street Journal\u2019s editorial board, and seems to be indicative of how he\u2019ll handle the investigation of his former boss in his ongoing presidential campaign: As big of a deal as Donald Trump\u2019s arraignment yesterday was, the Guardian\u2019s David Smith reports that court rules denied the public the ability to view key elements of the proceedings: With a presidential-style plane and motorcade, a bunch of flag-waving fans and a lawyer shouting alternative facts, the latest season of The Trump Show \u2013 let\u2019s call this one The Defendant \u2013 again filled every TV screen on Tuesday. But the most important scene of all was missing. And no one was happier about that than Donald Trump himself. Americans were denied the chance to see and hear the former US president, the first to face federal criminal charges in America\u2019s 247-year history, sitting in court and taking his medicine. It was like To Kill a Mockingbird without Atticus Finch\u2019s closing argument or A Few Good Men without Colonel Jessup erupting: \u201cYou can\u2019t handle the truth!\u201d Instead of Twelve Angry Men, it was Twelve Angry Maga Men waving flags outside court. The Republican-led House judiciary committee announced it would on 21 June hold a hearing with former justice department special counsel John Durham, author of a much-hyped report which found that though the FBI bungled parts of its investigation into Donald Trump\u2019s ties with Russia, there was no proof of a deep-state conspiracy against the then president. The committee is chaired by Jim Jordan, a prominent defender of Trump among House Republicans, who has this year been leading a subcommittee aimed at proving to voters that \u201cweaponization of the federal government\u201d is to blame for the criminal cases against the former president. If you are wondering what Donald Trump did after his history-making indictment in Florida yesterday, the Guardian\u2019s Maanvi Singh has the answer: Hours after facing criminal charges for the alleged mishandling of classified documents, Donald Trump told a crowd of supporters at his golf resort in New Jersey that his indictments were a \u201ccorrupt\u201d and \u201cpolitical pursuit\u201d designed to destroy him. Donors and supporters chanted Trump\u2019s name, cheered him on and sang \u201chappy birthday\u201d. \u201cI just got charged,\u201d joked the former president, who turns 77 on Wednesday. \u201cA wonderful birthday.\u201d The former president was in Miami earlier in the day for his arraignment in the classified documents case. Federal prosecutors have accused him of wilfully withholding classified documents and obstructing justice, charging him with 37 federal counts including 31 violations of the Espionage Act. Former vice-president Mike Pence was Donald Trump\u2019s deputy for four years, and fell out with him only when the then president pushed him to stop Joe Biden from taking office. When Pence announced his presidential campaign last week, he drew a stark contrast between himself and Trump, but that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s completely on board with the federal charges against the former president. \u201cHaving read the indictment, these are very serious allegations. And I can\u2019t defend what is alleged. But the President is entitled to his day in court, he\u2019s entitled to bring a defense, and I want to reserve judgment until he has the opportunity to respond,\u201d Pence told the conservative editorial board of the Wall Street Journal in an interview yesterday. But he also was wary of the fact that the indictment was brought under the Biden administration. \u201cAfter years of politicization, it\u2019s hard for me to believe that politics didn\u2019t play some role in this decision,\u201d Pence said. He called on attorney general Merrick Garland to explain \u201cwhat if any role he played, or his judgment played, in the decision to move forward with an unprecedented indictment of a former President of the United States\u201d. Good morning, US politics blog readers. What a day yesterday was. After becoming the first former president ever to be federally indicted, Donald Trump appeared in court in Miami and pleaded not guilty to dozens of federal charges related to the classified government documents found at Mar-a-Lago. The hearing was merely the start of what is expected to be a long legal road for Trump, which could lead to him doing jail time, or simply being pardoned if he or a fellow Republican wins the White House in 2024. Polls continue to show a solid majority of GOP voters back him and view the charges as politically motivated, but anti-Trump Republicans pointed to the unprecedented indictment as evidence that the former president cannot be allowed his job back. The latest counterargument came from Mike Pence, who reversed his earlier wariness towards the prosecution by telling the Wall Street Journal \u201cI can\u2019t defend what is alleged\u201d. We\u2019ll keep an eye out today if the political calculus changes further. Here\u2019s what else is going on today: The state department just announced secretary Antony Blinken will travel to Beijing later this month, likely in a bid to cool tensions with China that have climbed for various reasons lately, including over the country\u2019s affinity for spy balloons. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre briefs the press at 1.45pm ET. Will she finally offer the Biden administration\u2019s official view on Trump\u2019s indictment to the reporters that are sure to inquire? Almost certainly not, but you can expect them to try. House Republicans have long mulled impeaching homeland security secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, and while they haven\u2019t decided whether or not to go through with that yet, the homeland security committee is at 10am holding a hearing on \u201cSecretary Mayorkas\u2019s Dereliction of Duty\u201d."}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e70109", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2023/jun/14/lancashire-v-hampshire-notts-v-warwickshire-county-cricket-live", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": [], "title": "Lancashire beat Hampshire, superb Surrey chase down 500: county cricket \u2013 live", "lead": "Join Tanya Aldred for live updates from the latest round of County Championship matches", "author": "Tanya Aldred", "datePublished": "2023-06-14T17:45:26Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.293695", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/38ef3fa22c1513261364549a23de1e4d0114d21f/0_116_4477_2686/500.jpg", "body": "An epic run chase, the slowest century in Championship history, Yorkshire breaking their parched spell in a thriller, Lancashire\u2019s first win of the season and more.

DIVISION ONE Chelmsford: Essex 462-9dec and 170-7dec BEAT Somerset 167 and 269 Essex win by 196 runs Canterbury: Kent 301 and 344 v Surrey 145 and 452-4, Surrey need 49 to win Southport: Lancashire 374 and 142-4 BEAT Hampshire 142 and 371 Lancs win by six wickets Trent Bridge: Nottinghamshire 155 and 436-6 v Warwickshire 571-9dec Notts lead by 20 DIVISION TWO Chesterfield: Derbyshire 111 and 453 LOSE TO Yorkshire 353 and 215-7 Yorkshire win by three wickets Chester-le-Street: Durham 630 v Glamorgan 390 and 372-7 Glamorgan lead by 132 Bristol: Gloucestershire 368 and 202 v Leicestershire 350 and 49-0 Leics need 172 to win Hove: Sussex 348 and 447-7 v Worcestershire 410 and 195-2 Worcs need 191 to win Astonishingly, it looks as if \u2013 thanks to Clarke - Notts will hold off Warwickshire now \u2013 some mammoth second innings totals in this round. Weather related? The BBC commentators just suggested that the approaching/passing thunder storms had made batting tricky in Surrey\u2019s first innings. Or perhaps days of heat has worn out the bowlers. Notts 431-6, lead Notts by 15. A super innings that has almost \u2013 almost \u2013 taken Glamorgan to safety. The Glammy lead 131, three wickets in hand. Applause too for VDG whose 32 has held up an end. Ben Foakes toe-ends a long-hop off and must leave the stage for 124. Canterbury stands to applaud him off. The partnership 207, Surrey 437-4. The good ship Sibley remains steady. A much less statty, but possibly more stylish, 198 balls. Surrey 425-3, need 76 to win. Dom\u2019s stats in full \u2013 511 minutes, 368 balls: the slowest in minutes and balls in history. Respect. 1. Ben Duckett 2. Zak Crawley 3. Ollie Pope 4. Joe Root 5. Harry Brook 6. Ben Stokes * 7. Jonathan Bairstow + 8. Moeen Ali 9. Stuart Broad 10. Ollie Robinson 11. James Anderson Easy as he goes, big (not) bad Dom makes it to three figures. Slow, steady, eight hours plus, 363 balls, his first century since returning to Surrey. His plod has made the impossible, possible. Stand and bow. Some sparky business up in Division Two too: Glamorgan only lead Durham by 76 \u2013 not enough against the Championship\u2019s walking talking Bazballers \u2013 unless the last three wickets can hold out: Cooke (77) and van der Gugten the men in the middle. Gloucestershire are nine down for 192, which would leave Leicestershire a very chaseable total \u2013 currently 214. Chris Wright 4-49. And Worcestershire, 132-1, are making a good stab of their chase \u2013 254 needed against Sussex. Jake Libby, out for 198 in the first innings, is 79 not out. A huge effort of concentration from Joe Clarke has taken Notts in sight of Warwickshire\u2019s mammoth 571-9, with 177 in six and a half hours. Three wickets for Rushworth, Warwicks have a session and a half to survive. Notts 366-6 following on, trail by 50. Surrey born and bred, this can\u2019t be seen as a jinx when I say Surrey are as good as home and dry. Champagne not so much on ice as on the p of the pop. The largest fourth innings totals in County Championship history did you say? OK then 502-6 Middx v Notts 1925 498 Somerset v Derby 2006 493-6 Glamorgan v Worcs 1990 479-6 Somerset Yorkshire 2009 478-9 Surrey v Leicestershire 2001 Surrey, 371-3, need another 130 to chase 501, and the second highest run-chase in Championship history. Foakes escapes the umpires finger \u2013 a caught behind appeal turned down and a telling off for Hamidullah Qadri and Jack Leaning. Surrey need just 145, Kent seven unlikely wickets. Sibley needs just nine for three figures \u2013 the essential anti Bazball in action. If you haven\u2019t gone for your siesta, and are suitably refreshed, we\u2019re off again. Five games still standing after Essex bowled out Somerset just before lunch - Chelmsford: Essex 462-9dec and 170-7dec BEAT Somerset 167 and 269 Essex win by 196 runs Essex 22 points, Somerset 2.

A couple for Sam Cook, a couple for Simon Harmer, and a super catch for the ageless knight. Surrey \u2013 they\u2019re going do it, aren\u2019t they? Dom Sibley\u2019s highest score of the season, 84 not out, Ben Foakes a gentle up-yours 59. New ball neutered, \u201cjust\u201d 173 needed, ten minutes till lunch. Division Two dance: Billy Root and Chris Cooke doing their best to hold off the potent de Leede (4-38), Glamorgan 231-5, trail Durham by nine runs. Apologies to Mike Wiltsher, who emailed in at 11.29 to point out that \u201cKiran Carlson gone in the first over this morning for 35 without adding to his score, c Miles b de Leede. Glamorgan now 170-5, still 70 runs behind.\u201d Callum Parkinson, playing his first Championship game of the year, has a Gloucestershire wicket, but Olly Price and Miles Hammond have put on a sparkly partnership of 69. Playing for handshakes at five. And Worcestershire are chasing \u2013 in theory. 343 to win against Sussex, currently 43-0. Lord\u2019s, The Oval and Trent Bridge get a men\u2019s Ashes Test in 2027 and 2031, Edgbaston, and the Ageas Bowl in 2027, Headingley and Old Trafford in 2031. Headingley also host a women\u2019s Test during the 2027 Women\u2019s Ashes, the Ageas Bowl in 2031. Lord\u2019s, The Oval, Edgbaston, Headingley, and Old Trafford host Indian Tests in 2025; Lord\u2019s, The Oval, Edgbaston, Old Trafford and the Ageas Bowl in 2029. After being absent for so long, England Women will play at Lord\u2019s every year between 2025 and 2031, and all 18 counties will host at least three women\u2019s white ball games. No Tests for Durham or Cardiff. Southport: Lancashire 374 and 142-4 v Hampshire 142 and 371 Lancs win by six wickets A stroll in the end, with Dane Vilas rediscovering some lost form (64 not out) and easing Lancs over the line for the loss of just two more wickets. To play the if only game \u2013 if only Hampshire\u2019s fielders had held onto Salt in the first innings, and Vilas in the second\u2026 Chesterfield: Derbyshire 111 and 453 v Yorkshire 353 and 215-7 Yorkshire win by three wickets Is this where it all starts to turn around? Dom Bess lumps the ball over his front leg across the rope and past the fold up seats. Yorkshire complete their first Championship win since 17 April 2022, 17 long games without success. Shan Masood 95 not out against his old club, Bess 41 at a run a ball. Derbyshire a valiant fight back \u2013 ultimately in vain - after being bowled out for 111 in the first innings. The first email of the day drops by, from Freddie and Frankie. Hello! \u201cGood morning Tanya, \u201dMy seven month old son and I are watching Derbyshire vs Yorkshire. I am trying to teach him life lessons about disappointment as early as possible and the Yorkshire batters are really helping. \u201dThere has been lots of speculation about which spinner could replace Leach for England, and no one mention\u2019s poor Dom Bess. Best haircuts on the county circuit and a pretty decent international record. Have a great day! Come on Yorkies! All the best from Berlin\u201d I feel for Dom Bess too. Here he is being presented with his England cap. Yorkshire nearly there, just nine needed. Derby need three wickets. Bess 29, Masood 95. This might be of interest for those of you pressed into work on Friday. Thanks to Mes for the tip-off. Kent have taken the new ball \u2013 Lancs are halfway home \u2013 a wicket for de Leede at Durham. At Chesterfield, no more wickets have fallen, Yorkshire need 37 and Dom Bess has 17. Remember this? They learnt it all here you know. A swift whip round the grounds: Southport -Lancs on course, 59-2, 81 needed. Chesterfield \u2013 yikes! Malan in \u2013 and out \u2013 for 0. Seven down, fifty still needed. Canterbury \u2013 501? no trouble. Surrey press on. A minute\u2019s silence at Trent Bridge and Chelmsford before play started: Surrey\u2019s Jordan Clark on the hare and the tortoise: \u201cIt\u2019s obviously a good pitch to bat on, the boys dug in exceptionally well. Sibley survived 200 odd rocks to see the day out and that fantastic innings by Jamie just shows how good a player he is. \u201cIt was an unbelievable knock, in my opinion probably one of the best I\u2019ve seen. I can only imagine he just thought instead of the pressure being on him he\u2019d pile it back on them. I didn\u2019t see him play too many shots out of anger, it was just the timing of the ball and placement. He\u2019s pure class really. \u201cBoth of them complimented each other really, really well. He allowed Sibley to not be rushed. He played an amazing anchor role and didn\u2019t look troubled.\u201d So much to read \u2013 deep dive into Bazball with Ali, Andy and Andrew Samson. The day\u2019s main event started at 5.35pm at Southport, as Lancashire started their chase of 140 against Hampshire for their first win of the season. With Keith Barker kicking up dust at one end, and Mohammad Abbas slipping in on silent cat paws at the other, it was never going to be easy. First innings centurion Phil Salt snicked Abbas\u2019s fourth ball through to James Vince; and George Balderson was snaffled behind off Barker the following over (5-2). But Josh Bohannon and Dane Vilas, reprieved by Vince at first slip just before the close, reduced the target to 92 at stumps. Earlier Vince, sleeves pulled up a hitch and a bit, shirt unbuttoned, had danced to 87. He is in the form of his life, averaging 70, but the door is surely closed on any further England selection. Out came the peachy straight drive, the peachy off-drive, but no-one was able to stay with him quite long enough to set Lancashire a more pressing target, though Kyle Abbott\u2019s gung-ho 23 was handy. Balderson grabbed three wickets, while George Bell, aiming at Barker\u2019s footholes, grabbed his first, to the evident disgruntlement of Liam Dawson \u2013 who later consoled himself with a waffle cone from the ice cream van. A scintillating century by Jamie Smith, off just 70 balls, gave Surrey a chance of their highest successful run chase against Kent. Dom Sibley, 61 not out off 212, played the role of the wily old pro. Essex set Somerset a hefty 466 to win, and were well on their way to victory, Matthew Critchley adding a half century and two wickets to his first-innings hundred. A century from Joe Clarke kept Nottinghamshire hopes semi-alive following on against Warwickshire. In Division Two, Yorkshire\u2019s search for their first win of the season stumbled into the dark woods as first Derbyshire cracked 453, spearheaded by a fifth-wicket stand of 277 between Leus du Plooy (170) and Haider Ali (146); and then Yorks lost late wickets, closing with 65 still needed, four wickets left. The match destiny rests with Shan Masood, unbeaten on 68. It was Bas de Leede day at The Riverside, an unbeaten 85 helping Durham to 630, before he snaffled three for 25, leaving Glamorgan in deep trouble. Sussex take a lead of 297 into the final day at Hove against Worcestershire, and Leicestershire were 350 all out at Gloucestershire, 18 runs behind their hosts. DIVISION ONE Chelmsford: Essex 462-9dec and 170-7dec v Somerset 167 and 172-4 Canterbury: Kent 301 and 344 v Surrey 145 and 263-3, Surrey need 238 to win Southport: Lancashire 374 and 48-2 v Hampshire 142 and 371 Lancs need 92 to win Trent Bridge: Nottinghamshire 155 and 267-4 v Warwickshire 571-9dec DIVISION TWO Chesterfield: Derbyshire 111 and 453 v Yorkshire 353 and 147-6 Yorkshire need 65 to win Chester-le-Street: Durham 630 v Glamorgan 390 and 159-4 Bristol: Gloucestershire 368 and 9-0 v Leicestershire 350 Hove: Sussex 348 and 359-6 v Worcestershire 410 Good morning! It\u2019s day four and all to play for round the grounds. Can Derbyshire pull it out of the hat, or will Shan Masood take Yorkshire to that longed-for win. Can Lancs really Lancs-up a (seemingly) simple chase? Will Surrey complete a record run-chase against plucky Kent, can Somerset? Notts and Somerset are on the ropes, as are Glamorgan, and a draw looks certain at rain-dappled Bristol. *** A moment here, to remember the young cricket lovers Barnaby Webber and Grace Kumar, who were killed in Nottingham yesterday along with a man in his fifties, as yet unnamed. These were the words of Barnaby Webber\u2019s parents: \u201cComplete devastation is not enough to describe our pain and loss at the senseless murder of our son. \u201cBarnaby Philip John Webber was a beautiful, brilliant, bright young man, with everything in life to look forward to. \u201cA talented and passionate cricketer, who was over the moon to have made selection to his university cricket team.\u201d \u201cAt 19 he was just at the start of his journey into adulthood and was developing into a wonderful young man. \u201cAs parents we are enormously proud of everything he achieved and all the plans he had made.\u201d Woodford Wells Cricket club, where Grace Kumar was a junior club captain said, \u201cGrace Kumar was \u201cfun, friendly and brilliant\u2026a fiercely competitive, talented and dedicated cricketer and hockey player.\u201d Rest in peace."}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e7010a", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/14/manchester-united-pull-out-of-harry-kane-chase-tottenham-transfer", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": [], "title": "Manchester United pull out of Harry Kane chase as cost proves out of reach", "lead": "Manchester United have ended their interest in signing Harry Kane from Tottenham Hotspur this summer", "author": "Exclusive by Jamie Jackson and Jacob Steinberg", "datePublished": "2023-06-14T17:28:09Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.293701", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/80f714e42f3e33bfea48fe3ca388137837d91872/516_58_3862_2317/500.jpg", "body": "Manchester United have ended their interest in signing Harry Kane from Tottenham Hotspur this summer, feeling that the money it will take to lure the England striker to Old Trafford is unrealistic. The United manager, Erik ten Hag, had made the player his primary summer target and is disappointed that it has fallen through, but understands the club cannot go past a certain point when it comes to the transfer fee and the overall package for a 29-year-old, who has one year left on his contract. Daniel Levy, the Spurs chairman, is keen to hold on to Kane, in the hope that he signs a new contract and despite the knowledge that he could lose the striker for free next summer. Real Madrid have also expressed an interest in Kane, but with Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 now a possible option they may opt against pursuing a deal for the England captain. The Napoli striker Victor Osimhen remains of interest to United but he too is likely to be out of their reach, with Napoli understood to be asking for a fee of \u20ac150m (\u00a3130m) for the 24-year-old. United are still keen to sign the Atalanta forward Rasmus H\u00f8jlund, who has had an impressive first season in Serie A after joining from Sturm Graz. The 20-year-old scored nine times in 32 league games for the Bergamo side and United like the potential he is showing, but he would not be seen as a regular starter in the No 9 position in 2023-24 even if they could sign him during the summer. Atalanta could, however, ask for as much as \u00a350m for the Dane. United are also looking to strengthen in midfield and have had an opening offer of \u00a340m for Mason Mount rejected by Chelsea. Mount has agreed personal terms with United but Chelsea want \u00a370m plus add-ons for the 24-year-old. Mount\u2019s contract runs out next year and talks over an extension have stalled. The likelihood remains that he will leave Chelsea this summer as the club\u2019s owners do not want to keep players whose contracts are running out. Ten Hag wants more dynamism in midfield and he admires Mount\u2019s athleticism, pressing and versatility. Arsenal, Liverpool and Bayern Munich have also been monitoring the situation."}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e7010b", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/14/home-office-u-turn-on-festival-drug-tests-puts-people-at-risk", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": [], "title": "Home Office U-turn on festival drug tests \u2018puts people at risk\u2019", "lead": "Exclusive: Festival organisers say onerous new licence rules for onsite drug testing could endanger lives", "author": "Rajeev Syal Home affairs editor", "datePublished": "2023-06-14T17:18:55Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.293707", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/04c3a04761b10f6863e4422c900dc9b6a5aa64a0/0_272_4000_2400/500.jpg", "body": "The Home Office has been accused by leading festival organisers of endangering the lives of revellers after in effect blocking on-site drug testing last weekend. The Parklife festival in Manchester last weekend was for the first time since 2014 unable to test confiscated pills because the government department said they needed to apply for a special licence. The development has deeply concerned those running the UK\u2019s largest festivals, who use onsite testing facilities to check on drugs and can then warn attenders and the emergency services about possible casualties. Melvin Benn, the managing director of Festival Republic, which runs Leeds and Reading festivals, said: \u201cEvents at this year\u2019s Parklife are extremely worrying for everyone in the industry, and even more importantly festivalgoers. \u201cIf festival organisers fear their safeguarding measures will be pulled at the 11th hour, then how can we guarantee the wellbeing of our guests?\u201d Parklife, which attracted about 70,000 dance music fans to Heaton Park, has for eight years worked with Greater Manchester police and the drug-testing charity The Loop to test confiscated drugs on site. The drugs, confiscated by the police or security and usually in pill or powder form, are tested in a cabin on site. If the tests show that the drugs are a serious threat to health, a \u201cpush notification\u201d alert is sent to revellers warning them that the drug is dangerous. Medics on site can also submit drugs for testing if an attender suspected of taking a dangerous substance falls ill. Advocates say it helps drug users make informed choices and reduces the risk of overdoses. But days ago, the Home Office told The Loop to apply for a separate licence instead of relying on its agreement with the police. As a result, drugs were not tested, and no drug alerts were sent to ravers. This is believed to be the first time that a testing organisation has been advised by the Home Office that it must obtain a Home Office licence to continue with \u201cback-of-house\u201d onsite testing at a festival. The decision will cast doubt on whether similar testing can take place at bigger festivals this summer such as Reading and Creamfields. Sacha Lord, the founder of Parklife, said that the decision put young people\u2019s lives at risk and warned that it could be replicated at other festivals with younger attenders. \u201cDrug testing onsite has been an essential part of the work we do with the support of Greater Manchester police to keep festivalgoers safe. This move is a disappointing, senseless U-turn of government policy that puts people at risk,\u201d said Lord, who is also the night-time economy adviser to the mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham. \u201cThis huge misstep from the Home Office could set a potentially dangerous precedent for the summer\u2019s festival season. We call for an immediate reversal of this decision so that organisers can continue to prioritise the safety of festivalgoers.\u201d In a statement, the Home Office has said that it would always in future ask drug testing organisations to seek licences. A Home Office spokesperson declined to comment on individual licensing applications, but said: \u201cAnyone interested in undertaking lawful activities involving the possession, supply or production of controlled drugs, including those who wish to provide drug testing services, need to apply for a Home Office licence. \u201cFestival organisers in consultation with local partners are responsible for decisions relating to drug testing at festivals. We will continue an open dialogue with prospective licensees throughout the festival season.\u201d According to festival organisers, it can take more than three months to arrange for a Home Office licence to be granted, and it can cost over \u00a33,000. Sources said the Home Office expects to check premises weeks in advance, but most drug testing facilities at festivals \u2013 in temporary cabins or tents \u2013 are erected in the days before the event. GMP said it would not comment on decisions made by the Home Office, but added: \u201cThe testing of drugs at music festivals remains an important tool in building our intelligence around specific drugs and helping to keep people safe.\u201d The Loop, a small charity which works closely with the Home Office, declined to comment. The law as it stands remains unclear on drug testing, according to a parliamentary report. A report from the culture, media and sport select committee last summer said that while the Home Office can issue licences for organisations to handle controlled drugs, these \u201chave always been for fixed sites, permanent laboratories and not for mobile facilities\u201d such as tents in festival fields. Prof Fiona Measham, founder of The Loop, told MPs that the cost of a licence for each festival would be prohibitive, and even if The Loop was licensed it would not be specifically for drug checking, which is different from handling substances. \u201cI would appreciate having greater clarity about the legislative and policy framework that we operate in because legal opinions differ,\u201d she said. In its response to the committee\u2019s report, the government backed \u201cback-of-house\u201d drug testing, which is the testing of drugs after they have been confiscated. \u201cThe government will continue to support back-of-house testing on substances that have been seized, as this can provide useful intelligence and enable festival organisers and other partners to implement harm reduction measures,\u201d it said."}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e7010c", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/14/stuart-broad-picked-over-mark-wood-by-england-for-first-ashes-test", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": [], "title": "Broad and Moeen get nod for Ashes opener as England throw down gauntlet", "lead": "Ben Stokes has named his England team for the first Ashes Test at Edgbaston, opting for the experience of Stuart Broad over the pace of Mark Wood", "author": "Ali Martin at Edgbaston", "datePublished": "2023-06-14T17:05:06Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.293715", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/cd8493317e6946abbfddebf1ce6b80e398a5dd74/298_227_4630_2781/500.jpg", "body": "Stuart Broad is poised for a raucous reunion with David Warner in front of a full house at Edgbaston after pipping Mark Wood for a spot in the first Ashes Test against Australia that gets under way on Friday. Continuing a trend of his captaincy, Ben Stokes once again opted to name his England team two days out from the start of a hotly anticipated series opener against Australia, confirming a return for Moeen Ali after his two-year retirement from Test cricket and restoring both Jimmy Anderson and Ollie Robinson to the XI. The pair\u2019s expected returns after minor niggles \u2013 plus Stokes previously stating his desire to have 90mph pace in his quiver \u2013 had given rise to the prospect of Broad making way initially. This, despite a strong start to the summer with Nottinghamshire and six wickets during the recent mismatch against Ireland at Lord\u2019s. But an experienced 36-year-old with an insatiable hunger for Ashes cricket has received the nod from Stokes and England\u2019s head coach, Brendon McCullum. It now puts Broad on collision course with Warner, the opener he removed seven times in 10 innings during their last encounter with a Dukes ball four years ago. The one caveat to this mouthwatering instant rematch is that since Robinson\u2019s return last summer, Broad has been relegated from his usual role as Anderson\u2019s new-ball partner to first change. But it may be that a freewheeling captain like Stokes cannot resist whipping up the famously vocal Hollies Stand and switches back initially. While naming his England team early is a typically bold move from Stokes, the selection of a trusted campaigner like Broad may also reflect a degree of pragmatism. Battling a knee issue himself, the captain has only just returned to bowling in training and though Wednesday\u2019s latest session was encouraging \u2013 Stokes upping his work with roughly five overs of grunt in the nets \u2013 a Test match is a different proposition. Allied with this concern is the late loss of Jack Leach as the team\u2019s ever-present spinner over the past 12 months. At his best, Moeen offers greater attacking threat than the man he has replaced and has four left-handers to target in the Australian top seven. But the all-rounder, who missed training on Wednesday to collect an OBE at Windsor Castle, is also less likely to keep things tight. Given Wood is a high-velocity pace bowler who would have to be used more sparingly by his captain than Broad, and has not played a Test match since last December himself, deploying both him and Moeen could have left England light. Already without Jofra Archer this summer, they have instead delayed his entry into the series. The counter to this is an Edgbaston pitch that looks hard and true after a week of hot weather in Birmingham and may end up crying out for a bowler like Wood who can transcend the conditions. During the 2021/22 Ashes in Australia, the 33-year-old was arguably the one England player to emerge in credit, claiming 17 wickets and getting Australia\u2019s top order hopping at the crease. Wood was confirmed as fit to play this week and with a seven-day gap before the second Test at Lord\u2019s that starts on 28 June, there was no need for England to consider his workload early in the series. Rather, this is a purely tactical call by Stokes and McCullum, a leadership pair who can point to a fair degree of credit built up during a buccaneering run of 11 wins from 13 Tests. Sitting 18 wickets away from 600 in Test cricket and entering his ninth Ashes series, Broad can hardly be considered a contentious pick. And it may also be that Robinson\u2019s ability to get lateral movement on flat surfaces \u2013 as shown during the 3-0 victory in Pakistan \u2013 offsets any concerns about England\u2019s potency with the older ball. Either way, Australia represent the stiffest opponent of the Stokes/McCullum era, World Test Champions no less after last week\u2019s 209-run victory over India at the Oval. The tourists are yet to make a decision on the fit-again Josh Hazlewood. But regardless of whether he can usurp Mitchell Starc or the in-form Scott Boland, an attack led by captain Pat Cummins, boasting superior spin in Nathan Lyon, and augmented by an allrounder in Cameron Green, will still be formidable. It will also present a new challenge for a young turk like Harry Brook, whose rollicking start to Test cricket came on the docile surfaces of Pakistan and then against a fast-medium attack in New Zealand. While the Yorkshireman overcame Neil Wagner\u2019s short ball during the second of those tours, there will now be a step up in velocity. \u201cObviously they might have a little bit of extra pace, but if they bowl quicker it tends to go to the boundary quicker,\u201d said Brook. \u201cI\u2019ve heard great things about the atmosphere here, especially in the Ashes. I\u2019ve got a few mates who are going to be sat in the Hollies Stand as well. I\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be a few pints thrown down. It should be good.

The country\u2019s deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, said she could report just partial success over the last 24 hours, during which the progress of Ukraine\u2019s forces had been measured only in the hundreds of metres as they sought to advance in the east and south. Western officials added to the sombre tone as they briefed that Ukraine was taking significant casualties and making slow progress towards Russia\u2019s main line of defence, in one of the west\u2019s first assessments of the Ukrainian counteroffensive launched on 4 June. \u201cThe Russian manoeuvre and defence approach is proving challenging for Ukraine and costly to attacking forces, hence the advance at the moment is slow,\u201d an official said. They added that \u201cgrinding, costly warfare\u201d was likely for many months to come. \u201cThis is incredibly difficult,\u201d the official said. \u201cThey are going against a well-prepared line that the Russians have had months to prepare.\u201d The downbeat assessments came as what was described as extremely fiercefighting spilled over again into Ukraine\u2019s urban centres. Kalibr missiles hit Odesa at 2.40am on Wednesday, setting a warehouse, a business centre, an educational institution, restaurants and shops ablaze. It was a one of a number of attacks across the country on Wednesday that left 13 civilians dead and 24 injured. The death toll from a strike on a warehouse and apartment block in Kryvyi Rih was also raised to 12 after the death of a 67-year-old man in hospital overnight. Natalia Humeniuk, a spokesperson for Ukraine\u2019s southern defence forces, said there was a pattern to the recent strikes. \u201cThe missile attack on the Odesa region was apparently aimed at the objects sought by the enemy in the area of logistics support for the defence forces,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have already begun active operations at the front. The same attack took place earlier in Kryvyi Rih. \u201cThis is an area that the Russians interpret as an area of resources for the defence forces. They also attacked Odesa. They attacked a warehouse with water and consumer goods. They also hit a business centre. The Russians say: \u2018We are hitting decision-making centres,\u2019 so apparently for them it is a business decision-making centre.\u201d Andriy Yermak, the head of the office of the Ukrainian presidency, said Moscow\u2019s liberal use of cruise missiles showed the need for a tightening of economic sanctions on Russia. \u201cThe Russians shelled the city with Kalibr cruise missiles. Civilians died. Each of these missiles has at least 40 foreign components,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout microelectronics, Russia will not be able to produce them. Sanctions must be strengthened, in particular against those who help the terrorist country to obtain components for weapons.\u201d Russia has been able to bypass western sanctions on key weapons components through the use of third countries. The UK-based Conflict Armament Research organisation identified 144 European, Asian and US manufacturers last year whose components were ending up in advanced weapons such as Kalibr cruise missiles. Kyiv has suggested that progress is being made in recent days in its long-anticipated counteroffensive, with 100 sq km said to have been liberated in recent days. Vladimir Putin, however, has said his forces have imposed \u201ccatastrophic\u201d losses upon Ukraine\u2019s military. In a post on Telegram, Maliar said Ukrainian forces had advanced 200m to 500m in the region around Bakhmut and 300m to 350m south easterly in the Zaporizhzhia oblast on Wednesday. \u201cOur troops are moving in the conditions of extremely fierce battles, aviation and artillery superiority of the enemy,\u201d she said, adding that Russia was also suffering heavy material losses. Sources suggested that only 10% of the Ukrainian reserve amassed for the renewed offensive was yet in play. Rafael Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, who met Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, on Tuesday, was forced to delay a scheduled visit to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Russian-controlled territory on Wednesday as a result of the fierce fighting in the oblast. Grossi had earlier spoken of being \u201cvery concerned\u201d that the nuclear plant could become embroiled in the counteroffensive, with particular anxiety caused by the recent damage done to the Kakhovka dam, which has led to a reduction in the water levels of a reservoir used to cool the facility. In Odesa, one man, named only as Volodymyr, told local media that he had been with his wife and three-week-old daughter when a Kalibr missile hit near their apartment in the early hours of Wednesday. \u201cWe were sleeping in our bedroom when we heard an explosion, all the windows were shattered, and we heard a loud screeching sound from the entire building,\u201d he said. \u201cThen we grabbed the baby and ran to the bathroom to be behind two walls. Only after that we realised that there were no windows, no doors, no idea what was happening.\u201d Belarus\u2019s president, Alexander Lukashenko, said his country had started taking delivery of Russian tactical nuclear weapons, some of which he boasted were three times more powerful than the atomic bombs the US dropped on Japan in 1945. Lukashenko, who said he would coordinate with Putin should the need arise to use nuclear weapons, said the warheads would be on Belarusian territory \u201cin several days\u201d, although there has been no independent verification of his comments. He said: \u201cWe have always been a target. They [the west] have wanted to tear us to pieces since 2020. No one has so far fought against a nuclear country, a country that has nuclear weapons.\u201d"}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e7010e", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2023/jun/14/nottingham-attacks-police-latest-news-updates", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "subCategories": [], "title": "Nottingham attack: thousands join vigil outside Nottingham University students\u2019 union \u2013 latest updates ", "lead": "Families of Barnaby Webber and Grace Kumar, two of the victims, attended as staff and students led series of tributes", "author": "Caroline Davies (now) Tobi Thomas and Hamish Mackay (earlier)", "datePublished": "2023-06-14T17:01:01Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.293726", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/02f378aff5ac4f0b8fc07e5d83a90a6decdc0313/0_0_2560_1536/500.jpg", "body": "Paramedics arrived at the road where Barnaby Webber and Grace O\u2019Malley-Kumar were fatally stabbed within five minutes of being called, East Midlands ambulance service (EMAS) said.

Cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was being performed by police. In response to all three incidents, we sent a number of ambulance resources to the scene including ambulance cars, double crewed ambulances, our Hazardous Area Response Team (HART), a specialist practitioner, tactical managers, and we were supported on scene by medics and colleagues from the air ambulance. EMAS transported five patients to hospital via land ambulance. A former pupil at a secondary school where Ian Coates used to work described him as an \u201camazing man\u201d whose kind words and encouragement paved the way for the life she now leads. Kaleigh Wylie, 35, from Nottingham, said she attended the River Leen school in Bulwell, also known as the Bulwell Academy, in the early 2000s when he was the caretaker. \u201cIan helped pave my life from the age of 16 and I am where I am today for the kind words and encouragement from Ian,\u201d she told the PA news agency. \u201cHe loved his job, he loved us children, it\u2019s just heartbreaking.\u201d She said he would organise fishing tournaments for pupils at the school. \u201cHe never shouted, never got angry with any of us children, and we all know us children are a handful as teenagers, but he never did. \u201cHe would talk to us, encourage us to do better with life and he always kept us out of harm\u2019s way. \u201cHe was just a fantastic bloke.\u201d Grace O\u2019Malley-Kumar\u2019s father, Sanjoy Kumar, thanked those present \u201cfor your support, for taking the time to be here. All you guys, everywhere that I can see, a sea of people. Such a lovely sign of unity, the bond you have.\u201d \u201cGrace was also, like Barney, she loved coming up to Nottingham. In fact, we couldn\u2019t get her down.\u201d He continued: \u201cThe love that we have out here, I just wish we had it everywhere. \u201cLook out for each other, that\u2019s the big thing. Look after your friends, and look after the people around you. It\u2019s so important.\u201d He said his daughter \u201cloved being here, and she loved all of you\u201d. She was \u201cfull of her stories\u201d. \u201cYou have all touched her life and hence ours. \u201cWe have children who were taken away prematurely from us and that should never happen to any parent. But all I can say is all of you, thank you for the things you did for our daughter and Barney. And look out for each other.\u201d The tearful fathers of Barnaby Webber and Grace O\u2019Malley-Kumar addressed the vigil. \u201cI\u2019m lost for words, I\u2019ve lost my baby boy,\u201d David Webber said. \u201cI cannot comprehend how I am going to deal with it. \u201cMyself and Emma and Charlie and his family and friends \u2026 I know Barney would be super touched by everyone that\u2019s here. \u201cHe loved it. He loved it here. He couldn\u2019t wait to come back. It drove me mad. \u201cHis heart will be with you guys forever and thank you so much. I really can\u2019t say much more.\u201d The families of Barnaby and Grace were seen embracing each other. Many of those attending the vigil could be seen wiping away tears and quietly consoling each other. Students and staff laid flowers. The families of the two students also laid flowers. Grant Walton, from the university chaplaincy, began the vigil by saying: \u201cThis is one of those moments which we hoped we\u2019d never encounter. \u201cStudents and staff of the university, community members and, most importantly, family and friends of precious Grace and Barnaby, some travelling many miles to be with us.\u201d The university\u2019s vice-chancellor, Prof Shearer West, said the lives of the two 19-year-olds had been \u201ccurtailed\u201d by a \u201cseemingly random\u201d act of violence. Thousands of people joined a vigil outside the students\u2019 union at the University of Nottingham to pay tribute to Barnaby Webber and Grace Kumar. Their families sat in the front row and were clearly very emotional as staff and students led a series of tributes. Daisy Forster, the community officer at the union, said: \u201cWhat should have been one of our biggest celebrations turned into one of our darkest days. \u201cWhat was taken from us yesterday will never be given back and the shock waves echo through our student community.\u201d She paid condolences to the students\u2019 families and said they had \u201c38,000 students standing behind them\u201d. The sons of Ian Coates said their father was due to retire in four months. Lee Coates told reporters: \u201cIf we had to think about it, he\u2019d be lying in a bed with us holding his hand, him dying naturally in 20 to 30 years\u2019 time.\u201d \u201cNot dying on a street because some guy decided it\u2019s not his day today,\u201d Lee\u2019s brother James added. Lee continued: \u201cHe was due to retire in four months, he was still grafting. \u201cIt\u2019s rocked everyone\u2019s world.\u201d James added: \u201cHe was everyone\u2019s friend, always willing to help. \u201cNobody deserves this but he definitely didn\u2019t. None of them did, it\u2019s a tragedy.\u201d The suspect in the triple knife attack in Nottingham was arrested after allegedly approaching police officers with a knife, it has been revealed. The 31-year-old man remained in custody on Wednesday as detectives try to establish why a man went on the rampage stabbing three people to death and driving into pedestrians with a van he had stolen from one of his victims. Counter-terrorism officers are assisting the investigation by Nottinghamshire police, but multiple sources say the suspect\u2019s mental health is an active line of investigation, as police try to determine a motive. The Guardian understands that investigators believe the suspect was residing in Nottingham and had previous links to London. Police gave a sequence of events for the series of attacks that left two 19-year-old University of Nottingham students, Grace Kumar and Barnaby Webber, dead. A third stabbing victim was Ian Coates, a school caretaker in his 60s, whose van the man stole and then used to drive into pedestrians near the Theatre Royal, injuring one man critically, as well as two others. Read the full report here: Lee and James Coates, the sons of Ian Coates, have described him as a \u201cmassive, massive football fan\u201d and a \u201cgreat father\u201d , adding that his death had \u201crocked everyone\u2019s world\u201d. Speaking at the scene where their father was found fatally stabbed, they told reporters the school caretaker would have been on his way to work at the time of the attack. \u201cWe know as much as everybody else,\u201d Lee said. \u201cHe was a die-hard Forest fan and an avid fisherman. \u201cHe used to take underprivileged kids fishing just to get away from crime. \u201cYou genuinely couldn\u2019t find a nicer guy.\u201d Ian Coates\u2019s grandson left a bouquet of flowers at the scene on Magdala Road, with a note reading: \u201cMissed every minute and every hour. We miss you dearly.\u201d Lee Coates left a vintage England shirt with a message in marker pen reading: \u201cDad, love you always and forever.\u201d James Coates, left a Nottingham Forest shirt on the pavement with a message written on it, which said: \u201cDad, taken too soon, rest in peace, you will be missed. Love you, J x\u201d Grace O\u2019Malley-Kumar\u2019s family has released this photograph through Nottinghamshire police. The three victims of the Nottingham attack have been formally identified as police confirmed they all died of knife wounds. Nottinghamshire police said University of Nottingham students Barnaby Webber and Grace O\u2019Malley-Kumar, both aged 19, died after having been stabbed while Ian Coates, 65, was later found dead from knife injuries in Magdala Road after he was attacked and had his van stolen. The family of Grace O\u2019Malley-Kumar have spoken of their \u201ccomplete and utter devastation\u201d . A statement, released through Nottinghamshire police, said: Grace was an adored daughter and sister; she was a truly wonderful and beautiful young lady. Grace was not just a sister to James but his best friend. He is completely heartbroken. As parents, words cannot explain our complete and utter devastation. She will be so dearly missed. We were so incredibly proud of Grace\u2019s achievements and what a truly lovely person she was. She was resilient and wise beyond her years. Grace was so happy in life fulfilling her ambition of studying to become a doctor whilst playing topflight hockey at university. She leaves behind devastated extended family and friends. We request that all media outlets stop invading our privacy while we face this sorrow. The home secretary, Suella Braverman, said the people of Nottingham should feel safe despite being \u201cshaken beyond belief\u201d by a deadly attacks in the city. She offered assurances when pressed by MPs to ensure Nottinghamshire police has all the resources it needs in the aftermath of the attacks. She also cautioned people against speculating about the attacks, warning it \u201cruns the risk of being counterproductive\u201d, PA media reports. The Conservative MP Lee Anderson (Ashfield) sought assurances over public safety, saying: Nottingham is a beautiful city with wonderful people, and I doubt the people of Nottingham and Nottinghamshire will ever come to terms with this vile and cruel act. The public want answers and more importantly they need to know that they\u2019re safe on the streets of Nottinghamshire. So what reassurances can the home secretary give to the people of Ashfield and the whole of Nottinghamshire, and Nottingham city especially, that they are safe and the police are getting all the resources that they need? Braverman replied: People can feel safe in Nottingham going forward. I know that is difficult for many people to feel in the immediate aftermath of a terrible incident of the type we have just seen, but they must know the police are working flat out to get to the bottom of this. Ultimately we all want justice and we\u2019re also backing the police and all of the other professionals to ensure they can do their operational work as effectively as possible.\u201d In a statement, the vice-chancellor of Nottingham University, Prof Shearer West said: It is hard to find the words to express the shock and grief felt across our institution at the senseless loss of two first year students who have had their bright futures brutally curtailed by a seemingly random act of violence. Grace was a medical student, thriving in her first year of study and inspired to a career in medicine by work placements in a GP surgery and her volunteering for the nationwide vaccination programme during the Covid-19 pandemic. She was a talented sportswoman, playing international hockey for both the U16 and U18 England hockey team and Essex U15 women\u2019s cricket. She was held in the highest regard by her tutors and team mates alike. Barnaby was a history student, with a particular personal interest in geopolitics of both the USA and China. His tutors recall his energy as a student and as fun, friendly, and full of life in his seminars. He too was a sporting talent, playing hockey, rugby and cricket for his school and local clubs and excelling at sports at Nottingham. His role in the combined cadet forces also saw him exhibit his volunteering and leadership skills. The university is supporting Grace and Barnaby\u2019s families at this immensely difficult time, and I hope to meet them privately today to express my deep condolences and continue to offer every support at our disposal \u2013 although I recognise that nothing will compensate for the loss of a cherished daughter and son. I will also join the families at our campus vigil on the Djanogly Terrace at 4pm, where I hope as many of our staff and student community as possible can attend to remember our fellow students and show our support for their families. Against this backdrop of deep sadness and loss, I hope we can draw some comfort from the public reaction locally, nationally, and indeed globally to this dreadful crime. Nottingham is a wonderful and distinctive city, and our university and civic communities are united both in our grief and in our knowledge that this terrible act is not what our city is about. Press Association reports that CCTV from a residential care home appearing to show a man dressed in black attempting to gain access to a bay window is being examined by detectives. Alex Pridmore, a trustee of the All Saints Shelter charity, which runs the home, said the footage showed someone trying to gain access through a ground-floor window at about 4am on Tuesday. Pridmore said: \u201cNone of our residents were hurt. A resident had woken up and shut the window and was able to prevent the man coming in. \u201cThe CCTV has been provided to the police. The resident alerted security, we have 24/7 security on the door.\u201d A resident at the home, who did not wish to be named, said he \u201cpunched\u201d the glass of his bay window to frighten off the man. Nottinghamshire Police force has provided an update on its investigation. In a statement posted online, the force said that, in addition to the three victims, another man is in critical condition in hospital: Police can provide a sequence of events that led to a man killing three people with a knife and then using a vehicle to attack three others. Detectives have spent countless hours piecing together the movements that led to three people losing their lives, which includes extensive CCTV coverage and eyewitness accounts. It is known that a man attacked two University of Nottingham students with a knife on Ilkeston Road on Tuesday 13 June. A call was made to police at 4.04am. Police quickly attended and found a male and female student, both 19, in the street unresponsive. Investigations have then revealed that a man matching the description of the suspect had attempted to gain entry to a supported living complex in Mapperley Road but had been denied entry. This incident was not reported to the police at the time. Police believe the suspect has then attacked a man and stolen his van. A call was received by a member of the public and upon police attendance he was found deceased on Magdala Road with knife injuries. The stolen van was then used by the suspect to run over three members of the public in the Milton Street area. One man is in hospital in a critical condition while others are believed to have suffered minor injuries. A short while later, police managed to detain the suspect by using a Taser when he abandoned the vehicle and approached officers with a knife. All three victims\u2019 families are being supported by specially trained officers. Detectives are still keeping an open mind on the motives of the attacks and a 31-year-old man is still in police custody. He has been arrested on suspicion of murder. There have been reports suggesting that police are no longer working with counter-terrorism policing. This is not the case, and counter-terrorism policing continues to work alongside Nottinghamshire police. There have also been reports that other calls were made to Nottinghamshire police about the suspect before he carried out the attacks in Ilkeston Road. This is not the case. Chief constable Kate Meynell said: \u2018First and foremost my thoughts are with all the families affected by this shocking series of events. \u2018It is unimaginable to understand what they are going through. \u2018I am very aware of the impact that these horrendous crimes will have had not only on Nottingham and Nottinghamshire but also across the whole country. \u2018I am determined that we will work with community members, students from both universities and others impacted to reassure and support them. It is important that as a city we stand together. \u2018I would like to thank the public for their response to these tragic incidents. We have received a high number of calls with people offering information and support. Anyone with information can contact our casualty bureau on 0800 0961011.\u2019 Amanda Pritchard, the chief executive of NHS England has paid tribute to first responders during the Nottingham attacks. Speaking at the NHS ConfedExpo conference in the city, she said: \u201cI would also like to say a special thank you to the ambulance crews and other NHS and emergency service staff who responded to the appalling tragedy in Nottingham yesterday. \u201cOur thoughts and sympathies are with those injured and killed, along with their friends and loved ones. \u201cThis terrible incident is a reminder of the bravery of paramedics and other \u2018blue-light\u2019 staff who can never know what they will be confronted with when they leave their home and their loved ones to clock on for their shift.\u201d The University of Nottingham vice-chancellor, Prof Shearer West, said the university was \u201cin a state of shock\u201d after the \u201cdevastating news\u201d of the deaths of the students Barnaby Webber and Grace Kumar. \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible tragedy. These were two wonderful, talented students,\u201d she told the Guardian. \u201cWe are doing everything we can to support the families. I\u2019m a parent myself, it\u2019s unimaginable to me what they must be going through.\u201d West said she had read the students\u2019 personal statements from their university applications, and that both were \u201camazing sportspeople and academically excellent\u201d. \u201cThey were incredible people,\u201d she said. \u201cGrace, for example, volunteered as a Covid vaccinator.\u201d West said she hoped the incident would not put off prospective students attending the university in future. \u201cIt was a random act of violence, these things cannot be predicted. We do what we can to keep our community as safe as we can. But understandably people will think, \u2018that could have been me\u2019,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d very much hope people will look to the positives of Nottingham and not let this deter them from wanting to come here. These terrible crimes are not the city I know.\u201d Welfare support is being provided for staff and students affected by the deaths, she said, while police have increased patrols in student areas to provide reassurance. A vigil is to be held at the university students union at 4pm today Suella Braverman has addressed the House of Common regarding the attack. She said: \u201cI would like to make a statement about the horrific events in Nottingham. Nottinghamshire police have confirmed that a 31-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder after three people were killed in Nottingham city centre early on Tuesday morning. \u201cThe same individual is suspected of stealing a van and then running over another three people who are now being treated for their injuries, one of whom remains in critical condition. \u201cWe know that a knife has been used in these attacks, and two of the victims were students at Nottingham University. The third victim was the owner of the van that police believe the suspect stole and was used to run down those pedestrians. \u201cI know that the whole house will joun me in expressing our sorrow and that our thoughts and friends are with the victims families, friends, and all those affected. All of us extend a hand of friendship to the people of Nottingham. \u201cThe house will appreciate the critical importance of following due process at all times. It\u2019s completely natural to seek answers immediately when something terrible happens. \u201cBut it\u2019s also vital that those answers are wholly accurate. Speculating out loud is never helpful and runs the risk of being counterproductive. \u201cI can tell the house that the police are working flat out to establish the full facts and provide support to everyone affected. They are currently keeping an open mind as to the motives behind these attacks but I can confirm Nottinghamshire police are being assisted in their inquiries by counter terror police. \u201cThough, this does not mean that it is currently being treated as a terrorist attack.\u201d The home secretary makes a statement on the Nottingham attacks in the House of Commons here: The prime minister Rishi Sunak has paid tribute to the victims of the Nottingham attack, saying the thoughts of all in the House of Commons are with the injured and the families of those who died. Speaking at the start of prime minister\u2019s questions, Sunak said: \u201cI know the whole house will want to thank the emergency services for their ongoing response to the shocking incident in Nottingham yesterday. \u201cOur thoughts are with those injured and with the families of those who lost their lives.\u201d The family of the Nottingham University student Barnaby Webber have described their \u201ccomplete devastation\u201d at the \u201csenseless murder of our son\u201d, who was killed in a series of attacks in the city. Webber\u2019s parents, David and Emma, along with his younger brother, Charlie, said the 19-year-old was a \u201cbeautiful, brilliant, bright young man, with everything in life to look forward to\u201d. The family, from Taunton, Somerset, issued a statement to the PA Media news agency after Webber\u2019s death in an incident in Nottingham in the early hours of Tuesday. You can read Jessica\u2019s full report here: A property under police guard on Ilkeston Road today was raided once before in the past year, according to local residents. Taxi driver Mohammed Ali, whose uncle owns the barber shop next door, said: \u201cIt happened about seven or eight months ago, on a Sunday. They arrested some guys. I think it was drug-related.\u201d Ali said he had assumed the property was empty ever since because it then went on the market and they had not see anyone coming or going. But his uncle said they would occasionally see windows open, suggesting someone was living there. They didn\u2019t know who. Ali, who drives for Uber, said he was too upset to work yesterday. \u201cI pick up students all the time. They are like family members.\u201d Bancroft\u2019s school in London has paid tribute to its former student Grace Kumar, posting a statement on its website. The post said: \u201cIt is with great sadness that we announce the death in Nottingham under tragic circumstances of one of our recent leavers from 2022, Grace O\u2019Malley Kumar. \u201cWe are desperately shocked and saddened by Grace\u2019s sudden death in these truly terrible circumstances. She left Bancroft\u2019s only last year and was a hugely important part of our community. An immensely gifted and dedicated scholar and sportswoman, she was hugely loved and greatly respected and admired by all. She was outstanding in every respect and will be missed terribly. \u201cIt will take everyone in the Bancroft\u2019s community a considerable time to come to terms with this shocking news, but above all our thoughts are with Grace\u2019s family and friends at this difficult time.\u201d The third victim has been named locally as Ian Coates, who found fatally stabbed on Magdala Road before the suspect is believed to have stolen his van and driven at pedestrians in Milton Street. The school where Coates worked have described him as a \u201cmuch-loved colleague\u201d who went the \u201cextra mile\u201d for pupils. Ross Middleton, the executive headteacher at Huntingdon academy, said: Ian was a much-loved colleague who always went the extra mile for the benefit of our children and will be greatly missed. As a school community, it will take time to process this deeply upsetting news. We wish to extend our sympathy and condolences to all those affected by yesterday\u2019s tragic events. Students in Nottingham living near yesterday\u2019s attacks say they did not dare walk home last night. Tobi Klejbach, a 21-year-old law student living just off Ilkeston Road, said: \u201cWe came back last night from York and decided to get an Uber from the station instead of walking.\u201d He said many students used to leave their doors unlocked but not any more. \u201cWe are thinking that if someone can just randomly attack people in the street what\u2019s to stop them trying random doors too?\u201d His friend Ingrid Ukoeniann, 21, a pharmacy student, said: \u201cWe are feeling really scared. It could have happened to any of us. We are always going out and walking home. You always think this sort of thing would never happen to you but now you know it could.\u201d Taunton school have posted a statement in tribute to Barnaby Webber, describing him as a \u201cmuch-loved, kind and engaging character\u201d. The full tribute said: \u201cThe Taunton school community is heartbroken by the recent, tragic, news about Barnaby Webber. Barnaby joined us in the nursery and studied here all the way through to the end of the sixth form, leaving just last year. In his long association with the school, he touched the lives of many staff, pupils and parents and his loss will be very difficult to come to terms with. He was a much-loved, kind and engaging character. That a young man of such promise should lose his life in these circumstances is utterly devastating. \u201cWe send our love and deepest condolences to his family. We continue to do all we can to support them and all in our community affected by these events. When the time comes, we will find a fitting way in which to remember Barnaby and his special contribution to our school. \u201cIn the meantime, we ask for respect for the privacy of Barnaby\u2019s family and send our condolences to the families and friends of all the victims in this awful attack.\u201d A dozen bouquets of flowers were left at the scene on Ilkeston Road as tributes were paid to students Barnaby Webber and Grace Kumar. PA reports that the cordon that had been put in place was lifted on Wednesday, with two officers still stood outside a property that appeared to be the subject of police searches on Tuesday afternoon. Our North of England editor Helen Pidd is at the scene and has said that the suspect\u2019s flat on Ilkeston Road remains under police guard today, with officers stationed front and back. There is no front door on the property after it was raided yesterday. Ilkeston Road reopened last night to traffic. What we know about the Nottingham attacks so far \u2013 video report Three people were killed and a further three were taken to hospital in Nottingham in what police described as a \u201chorrific and tragic incident\u201d on Tuesday morning. A 31-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder after two people were found dead, having been stabbed in the street on Ilkeston Road shortly after 4am. Not long after, police were called to Milton Street in the city centre after someone tried to run over a group of people over. A man in his 50s was also found dead further north on Magdala Road. Police believe his van was stolen and then used to drive at the pedestrians Man arrested after three people killed in Nottingham Nottingham: police keeping \u2018open mind\u2019 about attack which left three people dead and three in hospital \u2013 latest updates Nottinghamshire police said yesterday that the investigation was in its early stages and officers needed to work out the motive behind the attacks. The force said they were keeping an open mind and working alongside counter-terrorism police, as would normally be the case for an incident like this. Aside from the 31-year-old, who remains in custody, no other arrests have been made and the police have said they are not looking for anyone else. Police searched a number of addresses across the city throughout the day - including a raid on a property in Ilkeston Road, the street where two people were earlier found dead, by armed officers. In Magdala Road, where the man in his 50s was found dead, police have set up a forensics tent. Forensic officers were also looking at a dented white Vauxhall Vivaro van in Bentinck Road, near the scene of the arrest. Southgate hockey club have paid tribute to Grace Kumar, saying: \u201cIt is with profound sadness that we have learned of the death of Grace O\u2019Malley Kumar, a huge talent &amp; much loved member of Southgate U18\u2019s &amp; W1\u2019s. We are shocked &amp; devastated by the news, our thoughts &amp; sincere condolences are with Grace\u2019s family, friends and teammates.\u201d A bouquet of flowers has been left outside the tennis club on Magdala Road in Mapperley Park, where a man was stabbed to death in yesterday\u2019s attacks. The road has now reopened and the forensic tent had gone, but the side entrance to the tennis club remains cordoned off. The man has not yet been named by police. Nottingham University\u2019s Student Union (SU) have said that they will hold vigil at 4pm today on campus at the Djanogly Terrace, outside Portland Building, in a moment of reflection and support led by the Chaplaincy and Student Union Officers. The Chaplaincy will be holding an informal space for gathering and reflection throughout the day tomorrow at the Oasis, the university\u2019s multi-faith centre. The flag on Nottingham\u2019s Council House has been lowered to half-mast and a book of condolence opened following yesterday\u2019s attacks. People are also being invited to lay flowers on the steps of the Council House while the lights on the building will be lowered at night as a mark of respect. The city will come together at a vigil to be held in the Old Market Square on Thursday evening, 15 June, from 5.30pm, when the lord mayor, Cllr Carole McCulloch and leader of the council, Cllr David Mellen, will be joined by Shearer West, the vice-chancellor of the University of Nottingham and representatives from faith communities who will lead a minute\u2019s silence at 6pm from the steps of the Council House. People are welcome to join from home by lighting a candle in their window or doorstep. Mellen said: \u201cOur city remains in shock after the tragic death of three people. We know the impact of these awful events will be felt not only by the victims\u2019 families and friends but by the wider Nottingham community and so it is important that we take time to join together to share our grief and to remember the people we have lost. \u201cThe vigil will be a chance for people to come together to mourn and to show the world how Nottingham takes a stand against violence. \u201cWe are extremely grateful for the messages of support our city has received from near and far and the professional and swift response provided by our emergency services.\u201d Grace Kumar\u2019s former cricket club, Woodford Wells CC, has paid tribute to her, saying they were \u201cdevastated\u201d by the news of her death. In a post, the club said: \u201cDevastated to hear the news about former Wells Baby Belles captain, Grace Kumar. A fiercely competitive, talented and dedicated cricketer and hockey player. Our thoughts are with Sanjoy, Sinead and James at this time and everyone who knew Grace \u2013 fun, friendly and brilliant.\u201d The family of Barnaby Webber have described their \u201ccomplete devastation\u201d at the \u201csenseless murder of our son\u201d, saying he was a \u201cbeautiful, brilliant, bright young man, with everything in life to look forward to\u201d. Parents David and Emma Webber, and younger brother Charlie, said Barnaby, who attended the University of Nottingham, was \u201cat the start of his journey into adulthood and was developing into a wonderful young man\u201d. We are yet to hear from the Nottinghamshire police today, but yesterday the force said it was not looking for any other suspects: The family of university student Barnaby Webber, 19, who was killed yesterday, have paid tribute to him, saying he was a \u201cbeautiful, brilliant, bright young man, with everything in life to look forward to\u201d. His parents David and Emma, and younger brother Charlie, told the PA news agency: Complete devastation is not enough to describe our pain and loss at the senseless murder of our son. Barnaby Philip John Webber was a beautiful, brilliant, bright young man, with everything in life to look forward to. A talented and passionate cricketer, who was over the moon to have made selection to his university cricket team. At 19 he was just at the start of his journey into adulthood and was developing into a wonderful young man. As parents we are enormously proud of everything he achieved and all the plans he had made. His brother is bereft beyond belief, and at this time we ask for privacy as a family to be allowed time to process and grieve. We will not be making any further statements, particularly in relation to the police investigation. We are so proud to release these photographs, chosen by us as a family, of an amazing son, brother, grandson, nephew and friend. Thank you for your understanding, and to everyone who has supported us in this awful journey so far. Last night, Somerset-based Bishops Hull Cricket Club paid tribute to the other student victim, Barnaby Webber. In a statement posted online, it said: Today we learnt of the death of our dear friend and team mate, Barnaby Webber. Barney was attacked at the early hours of this morning walking home with a friend after a night out on 13/06/2023 and had lost his life. \u2018Webbs\u2019 joined the club back in 2021 and has since then been a key part of our club and made such an impact in such a short space of time. Playing more than 30 games for the club, scoring 622 runs, and taking 29 wickets, his memory will live on. As a club we would like to invite family, friends, club members and members of the village and public who wish to pay their respects and lay some flowers at the club. As we reported earlier, one of the student victims has been named as Grace Kumar, a hockey player with England U18s. This morning, England Hockey posted a statement on Twitter: The leader of Nottingham city council, David Mellen, has been on BBC Breakfast this morning. He says there will be another vigil held for the three people who were killed in the street attacks on Tuesday. There will be further opportunities for people to come together.I know the universities are doing something this evening and we will be doing something in the square in Nottingham on Thursday for people to come together because people feel a desperate sense of sadness and want to be together in this difficult occasion. He added: I\u2019m sure there will be huge shock: it\u2019s the end of term, they were due to have a graduation ball last night that was cancelled. As I said, they will have a vigil at the university later on today. For parents, from a distance, I can imagine this is a big time of anxiety, all I would say as leaders and councillors we will work together with the police to keep this city as safe as we possibly can. A vigil for the victims was held at St Peter\u2019s church in Nottingham city centre yesterday. The Guardian\u2019s Fabio De Paola was there and took these photographs: Nottingham University has confirmed the two teenagers were their students. As statement read: It is with great sadness that we confirm the sudden and unexpected death of two of our students following a major incident in Nottingham city centre overnight. The Student Union\u2019s graduation ball \u2013 which had been due to take place on Tuesday evening \u2013 was abandoned. A man who did not give his name told the BBC he had witnessed the two students being attacked with a knife on Ilkeston Road, at about 4am on Tuesday. He reported hearing screams and saw a man \u201cdressed all in black with a hood and rucksack grappling with some people\u201d. He told the broadcaster: \u201cShe was screaming \u2018Help!\u2019 I just wish I\u2019d shouted something out of the window to unnerve the assailant. I saw him stab the lad first and then the woman. The lad collapsed in the middle of the road. \u201cThe girl stumbled towards a house and didn\u2019t move. The next minute she had disappeared down the side of a house, and that\u2019s where they found her. I\u2019d say it all happened within five or six minutes.\u201d David Mellen, the leader of the local council, told BBC Radio Nottingham that those struck by the van were \u201cwaiting at a bus stop early in the morning\u201d. Lynn Haggitt, a witness, told Channel 4 News she saw a van hitting two people in Nottingham. \u201cAt half past five I saw a van pull up at the side of me,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was white, all white. There was a police car behind it coming up slowly, no flashing lights. The man in the driver\u2019s seat looked in his mirror and saw the police car behind him.\u201d She said the white van then drove up to \u201cthe corner of the street and went into two people\u201d. \u201cThe lady ended up on the kerb, and then he backed up the white van and speeded up Parliament Street with the police cars following him,\u201d she added. Dimitrious Lawani, a witness to the arrest, said two officers were pulling a man with Tasers pointed at him, and said he heard shouts of: \u201cGet down, get out, stop fighting.\u201d Two 19-year-old students and a man in his 50s were stabbed to death, and a further three people injured when a stolen van was driven into them, in an early morning rampage across Nottingham on Tuesday. A 31-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder. Counter-terror police were helping officers with their investigation but Nottinghamshire police insisted they were keeping an \u201copen mind\u201d about the motive. The two students at Nottingham University were found unresponsive on Ilkeston Road, north-west of the city\u2019s centre, at 4am. Detectives believe the suspect then stole a white van, whose driver was later found stabbed to death on Magdala Road, two miles from where the teenagers were found. The van was then driven into people standing at a bus stop near Nottingham\u2019s Theatre Royal at approximately 5.30am, leaving one man in critical condition and two others suffering minor injuries, police said. Officers said they were not looking for anyone else in connection with the attacks and, during the hours afterwards, armed police staged a series of raids across the east Midlands city. One of the students was named locally as Barnaby Webber. The second student was named in media reports as Grace Kumar, a hockey player with England U18s. A 31-year-old man remains in police custody \u2013 arrested on suspicion of murder \u2013 after two 19-year-old students and a man in his 50s were stabbed to death, and a further three people injured when a stolen van was driven into them. One of the students was named locally as Barnaby Webber, the second student was named in media reports as Grace Kumar, a hockey player with England U18s. The man in his 50s has not been named. Counter-terrorism police are assisting the investigation as detectives tried to understand what triggered the horrifying events, but with Nottinghamshire police still leading the investigation. Police are trying to locate any phones or computers the suspect used in the hope they can shed some light on what happened. At this stage, there is still a lot we don\u2019t know about yesterday\u2019s tragic events \u2013 but we will bring you updates here as we get them."}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e7010f", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/14/steve-borthwick-billy-vunipola-england-rugby-world-cup", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": [], "title": "Steve Borthwick insists Billy Vunipola still part of England\u2019s World Cup plans", "lead": "Billy Vunipola is on course to be fast-tracked back into England\u2019s Rugby World Cup side with Steve Borthwick regarding him as a crucial part of their plans", "author": "Robert Kitson", "datePublished": "2023-06-14T17:00:09Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.293732", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/f274b0677e5eca8c1d29f589ca4454a4d07c4f09/0_139_3935_2361/500.jpg", "body": "Billy Vunipola is on course to be fast-tracked back into England\u2019s Rugby World Cup side with Steve Borthwick making clear the Saracens No 8 has a potentially key role to play in this year\u2019s tournament. The head coach omitted Vunipola from his initial Six Nations squad in January but now appears to regard the 30-year-old as a crucial cog in his squad plans. Vunipola is still recovering from the knee injury which ended his season prematurely in April but Borthwick expects him to be ready to play in August when England have four pre-tournament warm-up fixtures. \u201cHe\u2019s certainly part of our plans as we go forward,\u201d Borthwick said. \u201cHe\u2019s been an important player for England for a number of seasons and I think he has the potential to be an important player for England.\u201d England\u2019s back-row pecking order is far from settled with Exeter\u2019s Sam Simmonds having made himself unavailable for the World Cup for family reasons before his summer move to Montpellier. It leaves Vunipola, Alex Dombrandt, the returning Zach Mercer and, potentially, Bordeaux\u2019s Tom Willis jostling for position as Borthwick and his assistant coaches seek the right blend for France. The head coach is also expected to find out this week whether the Exeter hooker Luke Cowan-Dickie will be fit and firing for the World Cup. Cowan-Dickie\u2019s planned move to Montpellier has broken down but he is due to have further tests in the next couple of days to establish whether nerve damage in his neck has eased sufficiently to allow him to resume full-contact training. Borthwick has admitted there has been \u201ca high level of anxiety\u201d among England\u2019s London Irish contingent in the wake of the Exiles\u2019 collapse into administration last week. Otherwise, though, Borthwick has been pleasantly surprised by the fitness of those in camp in Bagshot this week, having suggested in March that he did not feel his players were fit enough. \u201cI have been really impressed with the shape we are in,\u201d said Borthwick, still without a clutch of established players who featured in the Premiership playoffs. \u201cThat tells me we have got a very ambitious group of young men here. \u201cI\u2019ve said to the players that if they\u2019re in camp it\u2019s important to take their opportunities. I\u2019m always looking for the 33 that we\u2019re going to take to France, but I\u2019m also always looking for the next player that\u2019s going to be in. \u201cWe have got a lot of good players \u2026 I think it is exciting what the team can potentially achieve in France. The more time I spend with the players the more I am excited about it.\u201d Changes to the format of next season\u2019s Champions Cup pool stages have been confirmed with the 2023-24 competition set to involve four pools of six, rather than the more convoluted system of two pools featuring 12 teams apiece. Each club will play four pool stage matches against four different clubs who are not from their same domestic league. Elsewhere, Florian Grill has been elected as the French rugby federation\u2019s (FFR) president just three months before they host the men\u2019s World Cup.

As he prepares for a new series to start at the same venue on Friday, the 34-year-old has said he is a better player now than the one who haunted England\u2019s bowlers four years ago. Edgbaston is home of the famously raucous Hollies Stand, with the atmosphere possibly contributing to the fact that of all the home grounds where they have played more than six matches it is England\u2019s most successful: they have won 53.7% of 54 Tests here. But Smith said he remembers nothing of the noise \u2013 \u201cI sort of blocked it all out and just went about my business\u201d \u2013 and that for him, the ground holds only positive memories. \u201cThat Test match is probably my favourite out of my career so far, given the circumstances and the importance of a first Ashes Test, particularly away from home,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve got some wonderful memories and some things I can draw on. I know it\u2019s a new series \u2013 you go to different grounds around the world that you\u2019ve done well at and you can take some positives out of those [memories] and move forward with them, but ultimately it\u2019s another game.\u201d The International Cricket Council considered Smith the world\u2019s fourth-best Test batter in 2019 but he comes into this series at No 2, the meat in an all-Australian ranking sandwich between Marnus Labuschagne at No 1 and Travis Head at No 3 (the last time one team hogged the top three in the batting charts was when West Indies\u2019 Gordon Greenidge, Clive Lloyd and Larry Gomes ruled the world in 1984). \u201cI hope I\u2019m better,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI strive every day to be better so I hope that I\u2019m a better player. I think my Ashes series before that back home [in 2017-18, when he averaged 137.40] was reasonable as well so I\u2019ve had a couple of good ones. It would be nice to repeat it, but I\u2019m just going to go out there and go through my routines and do what I need to do. Hopefully I can score some runs and help the team out.\u201d This will be Smith\u2019s fourth Ashes series in England and he is yet to win one, with defeats in 2013 and 2015 followed by a draw in 2019. \u201cAshes series are what you\u2019re judged on,\u201d he said. \u201cLast time we came over here we got close to winning \u2013 the next best result was drawing and we did that. But it\u2019s certainly something I\u2019ve wanted to tick off my bucket list in my career, and I know it\u2019s the same for a lot of the other boys as well.\u201d Smith promised Australia would \u201cgive it a good hot crack\u201d, saying that though they were working on plans to counteract England\u2019s anticipated positive approach they had no intention of \u201ctrying to keep up with their fast-paced game\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m sort of getting in my mind different things that they\u2019ll come up with and how I\u2019m likely to play it,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we\u2019ve seen in the last 12 months, they do some funky things. I think one of my big strengths is being able to adapt on the go, to understand what they\u2019re trying to do and solve the problem out there in the middle. I\u2019ll just focus on my game and try and counter each thing they come up with \u2013 but we\u2019re expecting some different stuff, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d Given the recent hot, dry weather and the nature of the pitch \u2013 Smith described \u201ca fair amount of grass albeit it was quite dead grass \u2026 quite furry but not really live grass\u201d \u2013 spin may come to play a crucial role in this Test. \u201cThere\u2019ll be times when we put a bit more pressure on and times when we just have to absorb it,\u201d Smith said of facing Moeen Ali, who returns to the England side after an absence of nearly two years. \u201cSome of the fields they set, with players up and things like that, might allow us to be aggressive and get away with it at times.\u201d England have had similar thoughts about the Australian spinner, the considerably more match-honed Nathan Lyon. \u201cIf he bowls a good ball then I\u2019m going to respect it. Other than that, I\u2019m going to try and take him on,\u201d said Harry Brook. \u201cHe could get a lot of wickets, but hopefully we\u2019re going to hit him for a lot of runs.\u201d Brook spent some of Tuesday\u2019s training session bowling his medium-pacers in the nets \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s an option for Stokesy if the other boys are knackered,\u201d he said \u2013 but more encouraging for England was the apparent fluency with which Ben Stokes himself bowled. \u201cIn my opinion he\u2019s the best all-rounder in the world and has been for many years now,\u201d Brook said. \u201cSo to have him back on the park and bowling quick is a big boost for us.\u201d"}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e70111", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jun/14/nobodys-happy-junior-doctors-strike-oxford-nhs", "primaryCategory": "society", "subCategories": [], "title": "\u2018Nobody\u2019s happy\u2019: junior doctors in Oxford voice NHS frustrations", "lead": "As 72-hour strike gets under way, there are concerns over staffing, infrastructure and morale", "author": "Sammy Gecsoyler", "datePublished": "2023-06-14T16:52:05Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.293743", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/26f0b23a9ef2525f099d925a625dcec31c78dd3f/0_448_6720_4032/500.jpg", "body": "The chants and honks of support during a strike can be cathartic for some, but for others it can be a time for sombre reflection. \u201cI don\u2019t have a good answer for that, not one that doesn\u2019t include a few swearwords,\u201d said one junior doctor with two children, who did not want to be named, when asked about the impact her job has had on her family.

Other times the ventilation systems are broken, meaning surgical theatres get too hot and operations are cancelled. \u201cOn top of all that, you\u2019re understaffed,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it gives a good idea why it is so hard to work in the system at the moment.\u201d A junior doctor who was nine months into her training, and who did not want to be named, said working in the NHS was \u201clike fighting a fire with a bucket of water\u201d. They said: \u201cConditions for patients and ourselves are at an all-time low. Corridor medicine is becoming so common that at a nursing conference, one of the talks was about corridor medicine. The other day I was sat on a stepladder because there was no chair.\u201d Ashok Chhabra, 31, has worked in the NHS since he was 18. \u201cI was a porter and I loved it,\u201d he said. His enthusiasm has waned in the intervening 13 years. \u201cBeing a junior doctor comes with lots of rotations, which means moving to different hospitals,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can be exhausting to be moved around the country. It breaks down your friendships and you see people\u2019s relationships break down. Some have to move three hours away from their partner for a rotation.\u201d Chhabra said morale had plummeted post-Covid. \u201cThere\u2019s no social environment. Nobody\u2019s happy to be there any more. Those days where you had to push were hard. They have become the norm.\u201d Dr Matt Bilton, a BMA representative, said: \u201cOver the past 15 years, pay for doctors has failed to keep up with inflation pretty much every single year, and as a result, doctors are now paid approximately 30% less in real terms than they were in 2008.\u201d In March, Labour said it would double the number of medical school places to 15,000 a year. Speaking to a crowd of picketers, Bilton criticised the policies of the Conservatives and Labour. \u201cRishi Sunak puts his hands in his pockets, has a rummage around and offers 5%. Pocket change,\u201d he said. \u201cMeanwhile, Keir Starmer calls for more medical students, missing the point entirely. Fix the leaky bucket by pouring more water in.\u201d He said the poor pay and conditions was leading to a retention crisis. Davies plans on staying in the NHS to complete her current training programme. \u201cMy husband\u2019s Australian. It\u2019s very difficult for me to say that I\u2019m not seriously looking at going to Australia,\u201d she said. Sanchit Turaga, 30, a junior medical registrar, is leaving the NHS for now to start a PhD in October. He said: \u201cContinuing in this situation isn\u2019t sustainable for a lot of us.\u201d"}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e70112", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/14/ronnie-knight-obituary", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "subCategories": [], "title": "Ronnie Knight obituary", "lead": "London nightclub owner and criminal who helped fellow crooks evade justice on the \u2018Costa del Crime\u2019 in Spain", "author": "Duncan Campbell", "datePublished": "2023-06-14T16:42:44Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.293748", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/4c10cc4f5307e6fe678c192a75eb66831c05b962/0_524_5097_3059/500.jpg", "body": "Ronnie Knight, the former London club owner, wide boy, convicted criminal and ex-husband of the actor Barbara Windsor, played as big a part as anyone in establishing the south of Spain as the \u201cCosta del Crime\u201d. For many years he acted as an unofficial consul for British criminals seeking a home away from the bothersome gaze of the police. Knight, who has died aged 89, first came to public attention in the 1960s through his marriage to Windsor, then a rising star of musicals, whom he had started dating while still married to his childhood sweetheart June, the mother of his two children. He dabbled in various illegal enterprises, including a Soho peep-show business, although some of the large profits had to be handed over to corrupt Scotland Yard detectives. A very sociable if flash character, he found his metier running the Artistes and Repertoire nightclub in London, which changed its name to the A&amp;R. It became a hang-out for members of showbusiness and the underworld, reflecting the mutual fascination between those two worlds in the 60s and 70s. Born to Nellie and Jim in east London, Knight grew up, after being briefly evacuated to Cambridge during the second world war, in the bombed-out East End. He had a nodding acquaintance with the Kray twins, for whom he carried out an occasional service. His younger brother, David, was stabbed to death in a gangland fight in 1970 in which Knight was also involved. Four years later the man who killed him, Alfredo Zomparelli, who had received a four-year sentence for manslaughter, was shot dead in the Golden Goose, a Soho amusement arcade. In 1980 Knight was accused of having arranged the murder of Zomparelli, something he had always vowed to do. He stood trial at the Old Bailey and was acquitted. By 1985 he was divorced from Windsor, whose showbusiness career had flourished, and he had moved to Spain, where he and Windsor had already bought a property. At the time it was an attractive destination for UK criminals because of the lack of an extradition treaty between the two countries. He established himself in Fuengirola with a bar called Wyn\u2019s and later with an Indian restaurant, both catering to the growing expat British population. \u201cIf I\u2019d got commission for every Londoner I\u2019d introduced to the delights of the Costa del Sol,\u201d he wrote in Blood and Revenge (2004), one of his two ghosted memoirs, \u201cI would have earned fortunes.\u201d In 1987 he became the unwilling subject of the television programme The Cook Report, which was investigating criminals on the run. No article or television show on the Costa del Crime was complete without a picture of the tanned Knight and his third wife, Sue Haylock, a young blonde whom he had met at the A&amp;R. Their Spanish wedding attracted tabloid and police attention, with Knight supposedly sending out glasses of champagne to the plain-clothes officers detailed to monitor it. Cocaine and alcohol took their toll, and the law was now on his tail in connection with his role in the \u00a37m Security Express robbery in 1983; two of his brothers, Jimmy and Johnny, had already been convicted for their parts in it. In 1994 he was charged with handling \u00a3315,000 of the proceeds. Offered a \u00a3150,000 deal by the News of the World under which he would grant them and Sky News exclusive access as he returned to the UK to give himself up, Knight decided to leave Spain and face the music. The deal did not work out as he had hoped and, to make matters worse, a photo of Knight in his cell in Wormwood Scrubs prison appeared in the press while he awaited trial, a clear contempt of court. He pleaded guilty to the handling charge and was jailed for seven years. The high-rolling Costa days were over, as was his marriage to Sue. In 2002 he was reported to have launched a now-defunct website, Crooks Reunited, as a supposed forum for ex-cons and even former prison officers; sex offenders and paedophiles were told they could not join. He eventually moved into sheltered housing in Cambridge, suffering from Parkinson\u2019s and dependent on the charity of friends. He is survived by his children, Lorraine and Garry, from his first marriage, which ended in divorce. \u2022 Ronald Knight, club owner, born 20 January 1934; died 12 June 2023"}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e70113", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/14/bha-refuses-to-give-in-to-activists-royal-ascot-demands", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": [], "title": "Racing chiefs reject Animal Rising\u2019s call for TV debate amid Royal Ascot threat", "lead": "The British Horseracing Authority refuses to be \u2018coerced into any activity by threats of protests\u2019 before next week\u2019s Royal Ascot", "author": "Greg Wood at Ascot", "datePublished": "2023-06-14T16:33:32Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.293773", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/01e82cf65171e155564fb47511d90f4f4d005051/418_302_4621_2774/500.jpg", "body": "The British Horseracing Authority has said it would \u201cnever allow British horse racing to be coerced \u2026 by threats of protests\u201d . It has also rejected a suggestion by Animal Rising that it could suspend its ongoing attempts to disrupt the sport if the BHA and Ascot agreed to a televised debate before the Royal meeting next week. Animal Rising caused a 15-minute delay to the Grand National at Aintree in April when a small number of its members briefly gained access to the course. The animal rights group also organised a protest at the Epsom Derby this month when Ben Newman, one of its members, ran on to the track near the furlong-pole shortly after the start of the race. Newman pleaded not guilty to causing a public nuisance and is due to reappear at Guildford crown court on 6 July. Newman\u2019s incursion on to the track followed repeated claims by Animal Rising that as a non-violent organisation, it would not risk injury to horses or riders by attempting to disrupt a race after it had started. While the group disputes whether Newman was on the track before the off, a failure to stick to earlier assurances was also referenced by the BHA on Wednesday as it responded to Animal Rising\u2019s invitation to a debate. Louisa Hillwood, one of three members of Animal Rising involved in a media event on Wednesday morning, said \u201cdisruption is only one part of direct action \u2013 the other half is dialogue, which is just as important. \u201cBefore the Epsom Derby we reached out to the British Horseracing Authority and the Jockey Club in good faith to have discussions about what we intended to do. \u201cOur position with Ascot is that we have also reached out to start dialogue with them, to call on them to accept a televised debate with Animal Rising and until then we will not rule out the possibility of disruption. If the racing industry really believes in what they are doing, they should have no concerns about defending it publicly.\u201d The idea was swiftly dismissed by Julie Harrington, chief executive of the BHA, in a statement backed by Ascot racecourse. \u201cAnimal Rising said they will cease their protest activity this summer if British racing agrees to take part in a public debate about \u2018the morals of horseracing\u2019. We will never allow British horseracing to be coerced into any activity by threats of protests. \u201cAnimal Rising have shown by their reckless actions at the Epsom Derby that their public promises cannot be trusted. They have demonstrated they are prepared to commit potentially unlawful acts and to directly threaten the safety of horses and people to generate publicity around their wider aims. These aims include the end of all use of animals by human beings. Once again I call on Animal Rising to end their reckless acts against a sport legally enjoyed by millions of people every year.\u201d Animal Rising suggested it intends to widen the aim of its action. \u201cAnimal Rising will be looking to cancel the Greyhound Derby final in Towcester,\u201d Robert Gordon, another spokesperson for the group, said. \u201cIt\u2019s the biggest race in this cruel sport, arguably the most prestigious competition in the world with first prize money of \u00a3175,000, which is more than 10 times greater than the next most valuable race. This is the pinnacle of dog racing and we plan to be there to disrupt it.\u201d"}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e70114", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/14/grandiose-lofty-elizabeth-gilbert-russia", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "subCategories": [], "title": "Elizabeth Gilbert was ridiculed for shelving her Russia-set novel, but I quite admire her | Emma Brockes", "lead": "It was a fantastically grand gesture by the writer.

Rarer is the writer who takes a stand in total opposition to their commercial interests. On Monday, however, that\u2019s what Elizabeth Gilbert, the novelist and self-help guru, did when she posted a video to social media, outlining her decision to withhold publication of her new novel indefinitely in deference to sensitivities around the war in Ukraine. The statement triggered an avalanche of inflamed commentary and scorn, and a reboot of a discussion that has continued, on and off, for decades about Gilbert and what exactly her deal is. Gilbert\u2019s novel is set in Russia but has nothing to do with Vladimir Putin. Instead, The Snow Forest follows the fortunes of a family in 1930s Siberia trying to escape the reach of the Soviet government. It also has an environmental theme, highlighting the destruction of the natural world by industrialisation. Nonetheless, as Gilbert outlines in the video, she has received an \u201cenormous, massive outpouring\u201d from her readers in Ukraine, expressing \u201canger, sorrow, disappointment and pain\u201d at her decision to set a novel in the land of the oppressor. On that basis, she is making a \u201ccourse correction\u201d and \u201cremoving the book from its publication schedule\u201d. My first response after watching this video on Monday was: wow, her publishers must be thrilled by this last-minute turn of events. (In her note on Instagram, Gilbert promised a full refund to all those who had preordered the book.) Then, I had to marvel at Gilbert\u2019s cast-iron ability to annoy vast numbers of people in different ways to those in which she\u2019d annoyed them before. In the wake of the video post, negative reaction focused on the tenuousness of the connection between the subject matter of the novel and the situation in Ukraine, and suggested it offered slim pretext for a boycott. By that reasoning, it was pointed out, no piece of fiction might be set anywhere in the world with fraught or undemocratic politics, on the understanding that it acts as a tacit endorsement. I can see the merits of this argument. It was a fantastically grand gesture on the part of Gilbert, who, since the success of Eat, Pray, Love almost 20 years ago, has developed a persona so lofty that it is almost up there with Edith Sitwell\u2019s. (The poet, famously, used to regard her enemies through a pair of lorgnettes, an effect almost pulled off by Gilbert\u2019s massive glasses.) Gilbert addresses her readers as \u201cdear ones\u201d, with the kind of airy manner one suspects is undergirded with steel. And, clearly, she believes that the withdrawal of a piece of fiction might be considered meaningful in the context of a people surviving a war. To my surprise, however, my final response to Gilbert\u2019s gesture was one of admiration. It had an eccentricity to it that, politics aside, seemed to me impossible not to find broadly pleasing. With her racket-sized glasses and solemn delivery, she appeared entirely invulnerable to charges of ridiculousness. There were no hedges or caveats, none of the kneejerk female instinct to apologise for causing a disturbance. A strand of criticism about Gilbert going back to the success of her memoir is that, under the guise of a hippyish outlook, she pushed through a cynical, market-savvy piece of writing. But it seems to me that one indisputable fact about her is that she absolutely believes, with a fervour that in more irony-clad minds seems distasteful, in whatever the project to hand is. And looking back, much of the criticism of Eat, Pray, Love appears off the mark. The memoir was published in 2006 and told the story of a year in Gilbert\u2019s life in which she travelled \u2013 to Italy, India and Indonesia \u2013 in an effort to fix herself after her divorce. It wasn\u2019t marketed as self-help but that\u2019s how the book landed and, 12 million copies later, Gilbert was accused in some quarters of pre-cooking her revelations, on the basis that she sold the book before setting out on the journey. There are valid criticisms of the book \u2013 the tone frequently tips towards a winsomeness that\u2019s not to everyone\u2019s taste \u2013 but the fervour of the backlash seemed an inevitable result of the sour grapes that attend a spectacular success in a field where most projects abjectly tank. The charge that she was not only insufferable but disingenuous doesn\u2019t stand up, either, given the work that came later. Whether it\u2019s your cup of tea or not, Gilbert\u2019s style, which might be broadly characterised as a sort of disciplined gushing, has been consistent across the nonfiction titles. (Also: her book about creativity, Big Magic, is genuinely useful and sensible.) These days, I tend to think that Gilbert is more interesting than she is given credit for. I\u2019ll never get fully on board with \u201cdear ones\u201d, but I think in a social media landscape in which meekness and conformity and throwing everything between quote marks is encouraged, this kind of earnestness is bold and refreshing.

Russian Asset Tracker, a collaborative project led by the Guardian and the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, won the Innovation award at the European Press Prize in a ceremony held in Tbilisi, Georgia, on Friday. The project involved more than 100 journalists from media organisations across the world, including Le Monde in France, Miami Herald in the US and NDR in Germany. The Guardian\u2019s Juliette Garside, Simon Goodley, Kalyeena Makortoff, Jasper Jolly, Pamela Duncan, David Blood, Niamh McIntyre and Rob Davies all worked on the investigation. In the wake of Russia\u2019s brutal assault on Ukraine, governments around the world imposed sanctions on many of President Vladimir Putin\u2019s enablers. The investigation tracked down as many of these assets as possible, and compiled them in the Russian Asset Tracker database for the public to see and use. More than $17bn (\u00a313bn) of global assets \u2013 including offshore bank accounts, yachts, private jets and luxury properties in London, Tuscany and the French Riviera \u2013 were linked to 35 oligarchs and Russian officials alleged to have close ties to Putin. The assets included a \u00a3250m UK property collection amassed by the former Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich, while the project also uncovered how Alisher Usmanov, the Russian oligarch once said to be the UK\u2019s richest person, claimed to have placed hundreds of millions of pounds of his assets into an irrevocable trust, potentially leaving them outside western governments\u2019 sanctions regimes. The investigation was published in March 2022, less than a month after Russia invaded Ukraine. The European Press Prize judges said the work of tracking the assets of oligarchs was \u201cimportant\u201d, and they praised the presentation and transparency of the reporting, adding: \u201cIt is very relevant, it is a story that we need now.\u201d"}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e70116", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/14/knesset-vote-to-be-delayed-row-as-judicial-overhaul-row-continues", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": [], "title": "Israel\u2019s Knesset vote to be delayed as judicial overhaul row continues", "lead": "Fresh protests expected against proposals as opposition members threaten to quit compromise talks", "author": "Bethan McKernan in Jerusalem", "datePublished": "2023-06-14T16:23:56Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.293789", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/c9549cbef09d38310ff621c1fe31ebf6e031205a/296_0_3076_1846/500.jpg", "body": "A key vote in Israel\u2019s Knesset related to the government\u2019s bitterly contested judicial overhaul is set to be delayed at the behest of the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, in a move that could torpedo negotiations with the opposition and galvanise the anti-legislation protest movement. Parliamentarians were due on Wednesday to elect two political representatives to the country\u2019s nine-member judicial selection committee, the composition of which is one of the most important issues in the now six-month-old political crisis. Historically, one political appointee has been chosen by the government and one by the opposition, but several hardliners in Netanyahu\u2019s religious-nationalist coalition had demanded that both positions be filled by government representatives. The vote is widely viewed as a referendum on the judicial overhaul package\u2019s future. Maintaining the status quo would appease the opposition but anger Netanyahu\u2019s far-right coalition partners and some members of his Likud party, threatening the stability of his government. The imminent retirement of two supreme court judges has raised the stakes. Netanyahu had delivered mixed messages before the scheduled vote, only for his coalition to announce at the last minute that it would vote against all candidates. If the secret ballot ends in a stalemate, a new vote must be held within 30 days. Opposition members of the Knesset said this week that if their nominated representative was not elected to the committee on Wednesday, they would withdraw from compromise talks brokered by Israel\u2019s figurehead president, Isaac Herzog. The negotiations have yielded little so far. Protests against the judicial changes are expected on the streets of Tel Aviv on Wednesday evening. \u201cNetanyahu has lost control of his government and is being held hostage by extremists,\u201d the centrist opposition leader, Yair Lapid, said as the voting was held. \u201cHe is destroying Israel\u2019s democracy, our economy, our security and the unity of our society.\u201d Netanyahu returned to office in late December for his sixth stint as prime minister at the head of the most rightwing government in Israeli history. It quickly announced wide-ranging legislation to curb the outsized power of the supreme court and its perceived leftwing bias. The measures could also help Netanyahu evade prosecution in his corruption trial, in which he denies all charges. Critics at home and abroad say the overhaul would erase democratic norms and politicise the judiciary. The proposals, introduced in January, sparked Israel\u2019s biggest ever protest movement, buoyed up by unexpected pressure from Tel Aviv\u2019s tech sector and military reservists. The months of political turmoil have damaged the shekel, which dropped more than 2% against the dollar before the vote on Wednesday, before regaining slightly to 1.4% down."}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e70117", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/jun/14/labour-gongs-for-cronies-row-rishi-sunak-keir-starmer-boris-johnson-pmqs-uk-politics-live", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": [], "title": "No 10 criticises Nadine Dorries for delaying her resignation \u2013 as it happened", "lead": "PM\u2019s office says Mid Bedfordshire deserves \u2018proper representation\u2019 and delay to resignation \u2018obviously unusual\u2019", "author": "Andrew Sparrow", "datePublished": "2023-06-14T16:21:40Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.293794", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/269e4d68840160b03813c1a56b608173a83358a9/584_229_5377_3226/500.jpg", "body": "A long-awaited report that will find Boris Johnson misled parliament over Partygate has been signed off by the privileges committee, marking the end of a year-long inquiry that saw him quit the Commons in fury at its findings. It is due to be published early tomorrow morning. Downing Street is heaping pressure on Nadine Dorries to stand down as soon as possible, saying her constituents in Mid Bedfordshire deserve certainty. Human rights campaigners have begun legal action against the home secretary, Suella Braverman, after she forced draconian new police powers through parliament in a move described by the House of Lords as a \u201cconstitutional outrage\u201d. The rules will come into force tomorrow, Chris Philp, the policing minister, says. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) has admitted Covid testing was \u201ca significant weakness\u201d in the UK\u2019s early pandemic response and stressed the need for proper funding to prepare the nation for the next emergency. My colleague Aubrey Allegretti has some more Tory reaction to the Guido Fawkes/Bernard Jenkin story. (See 4.21pm.) In the Lords last night the Green party peer Jenny Jones tried to pass an amendment blocking the protest disruption regulations now being challenged by Liberty. (See 3.34pm.) It was defeated by 154 votes to 68. With Labour support, the Jones motion would have passed. Vernon Coaker, the Labour home affairs spokesperson, told peers that what the government was doing was \u201ca shocking betrayal of our unwritten constitution\u201d. But he defended Labour\u2019s decision not to vote for the Jones amendment, saying that it would respect the convention that the Lords does not block secondary legislation. (The Lords is a revising chamber; secondary legislation cannot be revised.) Coaker told peers: I understand why some people would wish that to be otherwise but, as His Majesty\u2019s Opposition, we will respect convention. We will respect tradition and the right way of doing politics in our country. But, as Jones said in her speech, there is precedent for the Lords blocking secondary legislation. It happened in 2015, when peers voted to delay a planned cut in tax credits. A month later George Osborne, the then chancellor, said he was abandoning the proposed move (in effect, a \u00a34.4bn welfare cut) for good. From 1968 to 2015, five other pieces of secondary legislation were voted down by the Lords, a report subsequently said. Sir Jonathan Jones, a former head of the government\u2019s legal department, said today this episode showed the need for a new approach to scrutiny of secondary legislation by parliament. Hannah White, director of the Institute for Government thinktank, said peers should have voted down the regulations. While Vernon Coaker told peers last night that Labour was respecting convention on the Lords and secondary legislation, at PMQs in the Commons today Keir Starmer told Rishi Sunak he should ignore convention on resignation honours. (See 1.46pm.) Boris Johnson has launched a fierce attack on the Tory MP Sir Bernard Jenkin, who sits on the Commons privileges committee, following a claim that Jenkin attended an event where birthday drinks were served. The story first appeared on Guido Fawkes, a Westminster gossip blog that in the past has published a lot of material favourable to Johnson. It claims that on 8 December 2020 Jenkin attended an event in the office of Dame Eleanor Laing, the deputy speaker, where drinks were served to mark the birthday of Jenkin\u2019s wife, Ann (a Tory peer, and a friend of Laing\u2019s). At the time meetings were only allowed for work purposes. Bernard Jenkin told the website he did not attend any drinks party during lockdown. Asked specifically if he had a drink at the 8 December event, he said he could not remember. But Johnson has issued a statement challenging Jenkin to clarify what happened, and implying that he may be a hypocrite. He said: If this is true it is outrageous and a total contempt of parliament. Bernard Jenkin has just voted to expel me from parliament for allegedly trying to conceal from parliament my knowledge of illicit events. In reality of course I did no such thing. Now it turns out he may have for the whole time known that he himself attended an event \u2013 and concealed this from the privileges committee and the whole house for the last year. To borrow the language of the committee, if this is the case, he \u201cmust have known\u201d he was in breach of the rules Why didn\u2019t he say so? He has no choice but to explain his actions to his own committee, for his colleagues to investigate and then to resign. Jenkin has been contacted for a comment. The privileges committee report into Johnson is out tomorrow. But it is not primarily about Johnson breaking lockdown rules; it is about the claims that he misled MPs when he answered questions about Partygate in the Commons. Liberty, the human rights group, has announced that it will mount a legal challenge against controversial new protest laws that come into force tomorrow. It is taking Suella Braverman, the home secretary, to judicial review, arguing that in implementing the \u201cserious disruption\u201d regulations she has exceeded her powers. The Public Order Act 1986 (Serious Disruption to the Life of the Community) Regulations have been widely criticised by civil liberty campaigners and others because they will make it easier for the police to stop and arrest people holding peaceful protests. That is because they lower the threshold for what counts as \u201cserious disruption\u201d under the Public Order Act. In a move that is specifically designed to target Just Stop Oil, and its slow-walking protests used to hold up traffic, the regulations also allow the police to take into account the cumulative impact of protests, not just the disruption caused by a single incident. The regulations are particularly controversial because Braverman originally tried to include them in the Public Order Act 2023. But her amendments were voted down in the Lords, and could not be reinserted in the Commons because they were introduced late, and so Braverman is implementing them in the form of secondary legislation. Secondary legislation receives less scrutiny than primary legislation, it cannot be amended and it is very hard to block. A Lords committee said it could not find any precedent for a government using secondary legislation to introduce a measure only recently blocked by parliament in primary legislation. This is one of the main arguments used by Liberty in its judicial review. In a statement, Katy Watts, a lawyer for Liberty, said: The home secretary has sidelined parliament to sneak in new legislation via the back door, despite not having the powers to do so. This has been done deliberately in a way which enables the government to circumvent parliament \u2013 who voted these same proposals down just a few months ago \u2013 and is a flagrant breach of the separation of powers that exist in our constitution. This is yet another power grab from the government, as well as the latest in a long line of attacks on our right to protest, making it harder for the public to stand up for what they believe in. The wording of the government\u2019s new law is so vague that anything deemed \u2018more than a minor\u2019 disturbance could have restrictions imposed upon it. In essence, this gives the police almost unlimited powers to stop any protest the government doesn\u2019t agree with \u2026 We\u2019ve launched this legal action to ensure this overreach is checked and that the government is not allowed to put itself above the law to do whatever it wants. It\u2019s really important that the government respects the law and that today\u2019s decision is reversed immediately. The text of Liberty\u2019s pre-action letter to the home secretary is here. The Commons privileges committee report into claims Boris Johnson misled MPs about Partygate is due at 9am tomorrow, and will run to 30,000 words, according to the Times\u2019 Steven Swinford. This is from ITV\u2019s Robert Peston on Rishi Sunak boasting at PMQs about delivering the fastest wage growth in years. Train drivers have voted overwhelmingly to continue taking strike action for the next six months in their long-running pay dispute, PA Media reports. PA says: Aslef said a re-ballot of its members showed they are \u201cin it for the long haul\u201d. Unions involved in industrial disputes have to hold a fresh ballot every six months to ask their members if they want to continue taking action. Aslef balloted 12,500 of its members at 15 train operators, with most voting by more than 90% in favour of continuing with strikes and other forms of industrial action. Commenting on the result, Mick Whelan, the Aslef general secretary, said: Once again our members have decided that we are in this for the long haul. Train drivers are sick to the back teeth of their employers and the government failing to negotiate in good faith, and blaming drivers for their inability to manage services and the rail industry effectively. The Conservative MP Aaron Bell has criticised Nadine Dorries for delaying her decision to resign. Speaking on the World at One, Bell also implied that she had been neglecting her parliamentary duties since she started a job as a TalkTV host earlier this year. Asked about Dorries not formally resigning as an MP, even though she said on Friday she would be doing so \u201cwith immediate effect\u201d, Bell said: I don\u2019t know what Nadine\u2019s doing to be honest. I think it would be good for her constituency in Mid Bedfordshire \u2026 if they could have proper representation, because Nadine\u2019s barely been seen in parliament these last six months while she\u2019s been earning money on telly. Bell also said that the party was now \u201cunited behind Rishi Sunak\u201d and that the row about Johnson\u2019s honours list was over. He said: Actually this is over now. Boris Johnson is no longer a member of parliament. The vast, vast majority of the parliamentary party are completely united behind Rishi Sunak. The long-awaited report that will find Boris Johnson misled parliament over Partygate has been signed off by the privileges committee, marking the end of a year-long inquiry that saw him quit the Commons in fury at its findings, Aubrey Allegretti reports. He says: Seven MPs on the cross-party group, which has a Tory majority and Labour chair, held multiple meetings on Tuesday and endorsed the report at around 7pm, the Guardian has been told. A damning assessment of Johnson\u2019s promise that no Covid rules were broken and claims he was repeatedly assured the gatherings were within the rules is on course to be published on Thursday morning. Johnson cannot be suspended from parliament \u2013 a punishment he was likely to face \u2013 because he announced he was stepping down last Friday and formally left the Commons on Monday. However, the privileges committee is keen to ensure he does not get away scot-free. It is likely to recommend that he be blocked from being given the pass offered to most former MPs granting him privileged access to the Westminster estate. Here is the full story. No 10 has criticised Nadine Dorries for delaying her resignation. (See 11.19am.) At the post-PMQs lobby briefing, asked about Dorries not yet formally resigning her seat, Rishi Sunak\u2019s press secretary said: It\u2019s obviously unusual to have an MP say they will resign with immediate effect and for that not to take place. The prime minister believes the people of Mid Bedfordshire deserve proper representation in this house and he looks forward to campaigning for the Conservative candidate in the byelection. Asked if that meant Dorries\u2019 constituents were not currently being served properly, the spokesperson said: The prime minister believes that it\u2019s important that they have certainty. Rishi Sunak had quite a torrid PMQs. And the opposition leader was terrific. But that opposition leader was the SNP\u2019s Stephen Flynn. Keir Starmer was less impressive today, and his performance can be chalked up as an example of when the commentariat assumes there is an open goal, the ball often doesn\u2019t make it to the back of the net. It did when Flynn gave it a punt. Here is his opening question. During his ill-fated leadership bid late last summer, the prime minister warned of the perils of mortgage rate rises, indeed he stated, and I quote: \u2018It\u2019s going to tip millions of people into misery and it\u2019s going to mean we have absolutely no chance of winning the next election.\u2019 Given that mortgage rates continue to rise, does he still agree with his own electoral analysis? \u201cWhich is absolutely why our economic policy sets as our number one priority to reduce inflation,\u201d Sunak said, as he started his reply, but he was about as discomforted as he ever gets by the question, and he ended his first response with a feeble non-sequitur about SNP MSPs sending Nicola Sturgeon flowers. There were at least two other questions that left Sunak metaphorically winded. They were from the Labour MPs Lyn Brown (see 12.03pm) and Taiwo Owatemi (see 12.25pm). But the Starmer script did not seem to unfold quite so well. Colleagues who were sitting in the chamber say Sunak was getting less support from his MPs today than he normally does. (On TV it is harder to judge, because television does not give an accurate presentation of noise levels at PMQs, which can be deafening.) On screen, though, Sunak may have come over better. It felt as if he managed to fend off Starmer. Starmer opened with a question echoing the case made by Wes Streeting on his broadcast round this morning; that the country is in a mess because the Tories are just squabbling over peerages. (See 9.25am.) Although logically flawed (perhaps the country is just in a mess because the government is hopeless, even the most competent administration in history might have had a row about honours), this fits with what many or most people think, and for a quick hit, it might have worked. But Starmer persisted, asking Sunak to explain why he did not just veto Boris Johnson\u2019s honours list, and challenging him to commit to blocking Liz Truss\u2019s. This was probably the highlight of his six questions. It\u2019s not just Johnson \u2013 the prime minister\u2019s immediate predecessor is hoping to reward those who made her reign such a rip-roaring success. On her honours list are the masterminds of that kamikaze budget \u2013 the economic extremists of the Institute of Economic Affairs, those whose disastrous ideas crashed the economy and left the country to pick up the pieces. Will the prime minister block that honours list or will he buckle to her as well? To Guardian readers, and many others, the Johnson honours list was an absolute shocker, and Starmer was absolutely right to say that it should have been scrapped. But as Labour leader Starmer has approved new peerages himself (he is committed to abolishing the Lords, but many in the party assume that will never happen), and Sunak had a reasonable comeback, saying (correctly) that he just acted in line with convention, and highlighting the fact that Starmer approved the controversial peerage for Tom Watson. The honours row is a Westminster process story. Sunak, understandably, was keen to move on, and he attacked Labour over policy in answers that did not sound like the usual attempt to change the subject because Starmer was talking about the government\u2019s economic record. In response to the jibe about the Liz Truss budget, Sunak said: If you want disastrous economic ideas all you have to do is [look at] Labour\u2019s economic policy on energy. It\u2019s an energy policy that seeks to ban all new British oil and gas drilling, jeopardising 200,000 jobs and our energy security at a time of international conflict. Despots like Putin are the only people who will welcome such a policy. His predecessor once said he wanted British jobs for British workers \u2013 his policy is British jobs for Russian workers. This won\u2019t necessarily pass a fact check test (Russia is subject to sanctions, and the Labour policy is all about replacing North Sea oil with UK renewables, not Siberian gas), but for the purposes of PMQs knock-about it was perfectly adequate. The highlight of PMQs, and probably the only point people will remember by next week, was Philip Davies dancing on the political grave of Boris Johnson. (See 12.35pm.) This is significant because it shows just how diminished Johnson now is. Even to his own side, he has become laughing stock. Sunak says the Conservatives are delivering for voters in Uxbridge, whether it is opposing Ulez, or keeping police stations open. And that is it. PMQs over Philip Davies also said Sunak had left behind an \u201cidiotic\u201d proposal to ban buy one, get one free offers for junk food. That is wrong, particularly when there is a cost of living crisis. Will the government scrap this? Sunak says the introduction of this policy has been postponed. No final decisions have been made, he says. Philip Davies (Con) uses his question to have a go at Boris Johnson. He says Johnson has complained about the government not being Conservative enough. If only Johnson had had a majority of 80 and been in a position to do something about it, he says. One of the socialist landmines the prime minister has inherited from the former member for Uxbridge and South Ruislip [Boris Johnson] \u2013 I\u2019m sure the prime minister remembers him, he\u2019s the one who said that we should be more conservative \u2013 if only he had had a majority of 80 and been prime minister he might have been able to do something about it. This is from the i\u2019s Paul Waugh. Claire Hanna (SDLP) says Northern Ireland is one of the most dangerous places for women. The absence of an executive does not help. Will the government help encourage moves to protect women there? Sunak says services would operate better if the executive were running. Henry Smith (Con) says the eurozone is in recession, and the UK is experiencing growth. Sunak says the Tories are delivering. He says various bodies have upgraded their UK growth forecasts. Mohammad Yasin (Lab) says capital spending limits are preventing the building of new mental health services in his constituency. Sunak says the government is investing record sums in the NHS. Virendra Sharma (Lab) says Ukraine\u2019s largest mobile phone operator has kept services going during the war. Will the PM support services like this at next week\u2019s Ukraine investment conference? Sunak welcomes the question, and says support for Ukraine will continue. Elliot Colburn (Con) asks about plans for a hospital in his constituency. Sunak says the government remains committed to the Epsom hospital plan. Taiwo Owatemi (Lab) asks about a constituent who has had to go private after told he would have to wait five months for heart treatment. The British public deserve better, she says. Sunak says he is sorry to hear about this case. The government is investing record sums in the NHS, he says. Fabian Hamilton (Lab) asks Sunak to accept that the scrapping of housing targets was the wrong decision. Sunak says he makes no apology for respecting the views of communities. Labour may want to build over the green belt, but that is not something the government will do, he says. Gary Sambrook (Con) asks about homes in Birmingham not meeting the required standards. He says a leaked Labour memo from the council has blamed the Labour group on the council. Will the government intervene? Sunak says the failings in Birmingham are unacceptable. He says the regulator for social housing has intervened. Kim Johnson (Lab) asks Sunak to scrap the two-child limits for benefits claimants. Sunak says this ensures fairness, because it requires families on benefits to make the same decisions as families in work. Theresa Villiers (Con) asks Sunak to condemn the plan to expand the Ulez zone in London. Sunak says this will raise costs for families in London. And Keir Starmer totally backs the London mayor\u2019s plan, he says. Neale Hanvey (Alba) says Keir Starmer recently deliverd a one nation vision for Scotland. But he sounded like a Tory. Which party leader is the biggest threat to Scotland, the Tory on the right or on the left? Sunak says he and Hanvey probably agree Starmer should not be running the country. Stephen Flynn, the SNP leader at Westminster, says Sunak said last year the Tories would have no chance of winning the election if mortgages were going up. Does he still agree? Sunak says that is why the government wants to get inflation under control. He says the only thing the SNP can agree on is to send flowers to Nicola Sturgeon. (He is referring to a decision by SNP MSPs.) Did Flynn sign the card? Flynn says Sunak should grow up. He asks Sunak to apologise for the damage he has caused. Sunak criticises the SNP\u2019s record. Starmer challenges Sunak to call an election now. Sunak criticises Labour for voting against the illegal migration bill. Starmer says Liz Truss wants an honours list for allies who made her premiership such a success. Will Sunak block that? Sunak says under Labour\u2019s energy policy to stop new oil and gas developments, 200,000 jobs would be at risk. Russia would welcome that. He says Gordon Brown promised British jobs for British workers. Starmer is offering British jobs for Russian workers. Starmer says mortgage payers are paying the price for \u201cthis endless cycle of chaos and destruction\u201d. Sunak says Rachel Reeves has watered down her plan for \u00a328bn borrowing, while Ed Miliband says it still stands. Starmer says honours should be for public service. He asks if Sunak\u2019s message to the public is: if you don\u2019t like these honours, tough. Sunak say Starmer proposed an honour for Tom Watson, who spread vicious conspiracy theories. Starmer says the PM did sign off the honours list. That means those who threw a Downing Street party the night before the late Duke of Edinburgh\u2019s funeral will get an award. Why did the PM not block that? Sunak says he followed precedent. His predecessors may not have approved of honours for Tom Watson and Shami Chakrabarti. As a knight, Starmer should know that. Keir Starmer echoes what Sunak said about Nottingham and Grenfell Tower. He says all across the country people are worried about prices and mortgages. So why has the Tory party spent the week arguing about which of them gets a peerage? Sunak says he followed the resignation process to the letter: In line with a long-established convention of previous prime ministers having the ability to submit honours, I followed the process to the letter, in convention of longstanding process. It is, by the way, a longstanding convention that prime ministers on both sides to this house have followed in the same way that I did. Mark Pawsey (Con) invites Sunak to attack Labour\u2019s dependency culture. Sunak agrees. He says unemployment is at record low levels. Lyn Brown (Lab) says the ONS says food prices were rising at 16.8% in January. The most recent figure are 19.1%. This makes a mockery of the PM\u2019s pledge to halve inflation, he says. Sunak says of course he recognises this. That is why he made a pledge to halve inflation. It is now falling, he says. And he says the government is still helping families, notably by paying half their energy bills. Rishi Sunak starts by thanking the emergency service for their response to the \u201cshocking\u201d incident in Nottingham yesterday. He says MPs will also remember the 72 people who lost their lives on the sixth anniversary today of the Grenfell Tower fire. PMQs starts in about 10 minutes. Here is the list of MPs down to ask a question. The Tories have not said yet when the two byelections will take place, but they have to take place between 21 and 27 working days from the issuing of the writ. That means they will either be on Thursday 13 July or Thursday 20 July. In the Commons Simon Hart, the chief whip, has just moved the writ for byelections in Selby and Ainsty, and in Uxbridge and South Ruislip. Back at the home affairs committee, Tim Loughton (Con) asks about the asylum application backlog. He says that, at the rate applications are being processed now, the legacy backlog won\u2019t be cleared by the end of the year. Suella Braverman, the home secretary, says she is not as pessimistic as Loughton is. She expects the processing rate to speed up. Q: You need to process at the rate of 10,630 applications per month for the rest of the year. But you are not going to achieve that in the next few months. So there would have to be a much bigger monthly processing rate by the end of the year. That is not going to happen, is it? Braverman says more people are being hired, and processing rates will speed up. She says she is not as pessimistic as Loughton. Loughton says he is not being pessimistic. He is just looking at the numbers. Braverman says, taking into account the extra number of decision makers, whose numbers will double at least, and a streamlined process, there will be a \u201csubstantial uptick\u201d in the processing rate. Nadine Dorries, the former culture secretary and Boris Johnson ally, is going to delay her resignation, to prevent Rishi Sunak being able to schedule three potentially damaging byelections on the same day, Jason Groves from the Mail reports. Simon Hart, the chief whip, is expected to move the writ today for two byelections \u2013 in Boris Johnson\u2019s Uxbridge and South Ruislip constituency, and in Nigel Adams\u2019s Selby and Ainsty. On Friday Dorries said she was resigning \u201cwith immediate effect\u201d, and the Tories had expected to hold the byelection in her Mid Bedfordshire constituency on the same day. But now it turns out that her definition of \u201cimmediate\u201d seems to include \u201cany time in the next month or so\u201d. In the comment below Shropshirefella asks: Given that Nadine Dorries has given her intention to quit as an MP \u2018with immediate effect\u2019, but is yet to follow the formal process and given that her prolonged presence seems to be a distraction and continuation of the Johnson soap opera, could Sunak sack her or otherwise expel her from the party? Could the Tories cut her loose and do her resignation for her? Sunak could in theory suspend or expel her from the party, but a) it would be hard to justify doing this to her and not to Johnson or Adams; b) it would hugely antagonise her allies in the media, including the Daily Mail, where she writes a column, and TalkTV, where she has a show; and c) this would not get her out of the Commons anyway. Once an MP has been elected, it is very, very hard to get rid of them. The recall election process provides one route, but Dorries has not done anything to provoke a recall election. In extremis, the Commons can also vote to expel a member. But this has only happened in the past in cases of gross misconduct or contempt, and it has not happened recently. It is not an option for Sunak in this case. After PMQs, at around 12.30pm, Suella Braverman will be making a statement to MPs about the fatal attacks in Nottingham. We will be covering that on our Nottingham live blog. Alison Thewliss (SNP) goes next. Q: You have two children. What would you do if one of them went missing? Braverman says she would call the police. Q: There are 154 unaccompanied asylum seeker children who have gone missing from hotels. What are you doing about them? Braverman says it has been very hard to find accommodation for asylum seeker children. Now there are no unaccompanied asylum seeker children in hotels. They are with foster parents. Q: But what are you doing about the missing ones? Braverman says the Home Office works with local authorities. There is a protocol to follow. Q: Do you know their names? Braverman says she is not involved in these cases personally. That is a matter for the police. She says she has no power to detain unaccompanied asylum seeker children in hotels. She asks Thewliss if is suggesting they are detained. Thewliss says she is suggesting the Home Office cares about these cases. Braverman says it is incredibly difficult to find people who do not want to be found. Q: Is it that they do not want to be found? Or is it that they are in the hands of traffickers? Braverman says she cannot say what happens to these children. Some people claiming to be children are adults. She says 50% of age assessment cases are resolved in the Home Office\u2019s favour. Diana Johnson asks Braverman how many of the 1,800 Albanians who have been returned to their country arrived in the UK on small boats. Braverman says she does not have that figure. She says they are not all small boat arrivals. Lee Anderson, the Conservative party deputy chair, is asking the questions now. He says when Sir Mark Rowley, the Metropolitan police commissioner, gave evidence, there was some disagreement as to whether the police could stop protesters blocking the streets. (Rowley and Anderson had a row about it.) He asks if the police can now stop protesters doing this. Braverman says she thinks they can \u2013 particularly after last night\u2019s vote in the Lords. Q: So will you tell the police to stop protests like this? Braverman says the police are operationally independent. She says she gets \u201cincredibly frustrated\u201d when she sees people being disrupted by these protests. Fell put it to Braverman that customers were not learning to protect themselves from online fraud because, if they are cheated, they tend to get their money back from banks. He suggested that people were being \u201ccoddled\u201d. It was as if they were leaving their front door open, leaving themselves vulnerable to burglary, he said. Braverman said Fell had a point. She told him: I think that\u2019s a really important point and I\u2019m passionate about increasing awareness - much like practice changed when it came to wearing a seatbelt \u2026 I think we need a step change when it comes to online activity. We are far more vulnerable than we appreciate and I think people\u2019s lives are lived so politically online that they forget that there are fraudsters operating in that online world. I think there needs to be a cultural change and a greater level of awareness amongst individuals about how they can secure themselves properly online, whilst also buying their theatre tickets and booking their holidays. I don\u2019t think we have yet a sufficient level of personal responsibility. Simon Fell (Con) is asking the questions now. Q: Why are you only committed to reducing fraud by 10%? Braverman says a 10% reduction would mean hundreds of thousands fewer victims. Stopping fraud is a complex challenge, she says. Q: Are you making progress in recruiting more caseworkers? Braverman says she has 1,281 full-time equivalent asylum decision makers. That is 48% more than in July 2022. She says they want to get that to 2,500 by September. Q: You said in a letter last night you would get to 1,800 by the summer. When is the summer? Braverman avoids the question. She says there has been a proactive effort to recruit more staff. Q: Are those figures gross or net? We have been told the attrition rate is 47%. Braverman says those of figures for the total cohort. Q: But in your letter you say you do not have records of people leaving. So how do you know what your total figure is. Braverman says they know the size of their workforce. Daniel Hobbs, director of asylum, protection and enforcement at the Home Office, who is giving evidene with Braverman, says the attrition rate has gone down. It is now 28%. Johnson expresses doubt as to whether the Home Office will be able to get staffing levels up to 2,500 by September. Q: Has the backlog of asylum applications fallen or risen. At the end of last year the figure was 131,292. But in May it was 137,583. Braverman says the backlog of cases that were in place in June last year has gone down, but about 17,000. She says this is the backlog the PM has committed to reduce. Talking about a legacy backlog is legitimate, she says. Johnson now moves on to the illegal migration bill. She says the equalities impact assessment said it would disproportionately impact women. Q: If a woman who had been trafficked for sex purposes came to the attention of the authories, would she be detained under the illegal migration bill? Braverman says 80% of people coming on small boats are men. So women are only a small proportion of small boat arrivals. Q: But could someone be detained if they were a victim of modern slavery? Braverman says the modern slavery protections have been abused. That is why the rules are being tightened. Q: But would someone be subject to arrest and detention. Braverman says it would depend on the circumstances. Q: You are not sure. Braverman says it is complicated. There are exemptions, which can allow women not to be detained. If people are part of a police investigation \u2026 Q: Say they are not. Say a woman has just arrived, and is being used for sex trafficking. What happens to this woman? Braverman says that would be an illegality. If they go to the police, or if they are part of a police investigation, they could claim an exemption to the removal powers in the bill. But the government must ensure people cannot continue to game the rules, she says. Johnson says the committee has asked for evidence that the system is being gamed. It has not received any. Braverman says she gave the committee examples. Q: Only two. It was four, says Braverman. Johnson concedes it was four. Suella Braverman, the home secretary, is giving evidence to the Commons home affairs committee. It is a session on \u201cthe work of the home secretary\u201d, and so anything come come up. There is a live feed at the top of the blog. Diana Johnson, the committee chair, starts by naming what she describes as a pimping website, and asks why it has not been banned. Braverman says she has not heard of the website mentioned by Johnson. But she says pimping is a heinous practice. Johnson says she looked at the website yesterday. There were 297 adverts for women in Hampsire, Braverman\u2019s constituency. She said many used the same number. And adverts said women were \u201cnew in town\u201d, or only there for a short period. These are all red flags for women being trafficked, she says. She says she reported this to the police. Daniel Finkelstein, the Tory peer, has used his Times column today to argue that Rishi Sunak should double down on his criticism of Boris Johnson, to distance himself from his predecessor but one. Finkelstein argues: While Boris Johnson is wittering on about a peerage for Nigel Adams to disguise the fact that he is being suspended from parliament for misleading it, he has done Sunak one favour. He has removed from the prime minister the obligation of pretending that he and Johnson are in harmony. There has long been warfare but now the warfare is open. The costs of this are clear. It makes the Tories look like a rabble. Actually, delete the words \u201clook like\u201d. But the benefit is that Sunak is now able to say what he really thinks about his predecessor. And such frankness would allow him to take advantage of one of his main strengths. He warned first Johnson and then Truss against a policy of reckless borrowing. He was prepared first to resign and then lose a leadership contest to assert a principle that has been entirely vindicated. He showed prescience and courage and was ultimately victorious. Finkelstein also has a good take on how Johnson failed to obtain peerages for his allies. What happened over the peerages is a little like Johnson\u2019s negotiation over the Northern Ireland protocol. He failed to listen to the details, collapsed his position, imagined he had a deal on his own terms, reassured his allies that he had won a great negotiating triumph and then, discovering he had let his friends down, furiously refused to abide by any agreement at all, claiming it was the other side who had reneged. Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, also attacked the Tories over Boris Johnson in an interview with Times Radio. He said: I think it does say something about the culture of the Conservative Party and the clown show that continues to roll on. It is a total shambles. Rishi Sunak is too weak to lead it. Even if he is trying to focus on the issues of the day, he\u2019s being dragged off with the clown show. And I think it\u2019s one of the many, many, many reasons why it\u2019s time for a change of government, and only Labour can provide that change and the quality and stability of government that we need. Good morning. Rishi Sunak faces PMQs today. Among the many problems in his in-tray are another strike by junior doctors starting this morning, rising mortgage rates and Nick Macpherson, a former Treasury permanent secretary, warning that the election due next year could coincide with the economy going into recession. But, Westminster being Westminster, much of the focus at PMQs may end up being on what has been described as the Boris Johnson \u201cclown show\u201d (now on day six of its run). Here is Aubrey Allegretti\u2019s overnight update on where we were on that last night. There are at least four things we might learn in relation to this story today. 1) Will Sunak escalate his attack on Johnson? After studiously avoiding doing anything that might antagonise Johnson, his small band of loyal supporters in the party, and his much more powerful allies in the Tories media, for most of his premiership, Sunak did publicly criticise him on Monday. Will he double down on this, or retreat? 2) Will the Commons privileges committee publish its report today? Almost certainly not was the steer last night, but nothing in this saga has been certain. 3) Will the government move the writs for the two byelections pending today, in Johnson\u2019s seat and Nigel Adams\u2019, and when will they be? 4) Will Nadine Dorries, who said on Friday that she was standing down as an MP \u201cwith immediate effect\u201d, get round to doing so? She hasn\u2019t yet. Interesting and entertaining as it is, the Johnson pantomime is ultimately quite trival compared to the fact that the UK\u2019s economic performance is lacklustre, many workers are no better off in real terms than they were a decade or more ago, and important public services do not function properly. Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, was giving interviews this morning on the junior doctors\u2019 strike, and he sought to link it with the Johnson shenanigans. He told the Today programme: I think the reason junior doctors are out on strike is because they don\u2019t have someone to negotiate with. I think the question at this stage, having failed to get to a negotiated settlement, is where\u2019s the prime minister? If he\u2019s got an hour of his time to sit with Boris Johnson negotiating gongs for cronies and peerages in the House of Lords, he should have an hour at least to negotiate an end to these terrible strikes which are causing misery for the doctors involved and even more importantly misery for patients who are seeing their operations delayed and cancelled. Technically, this is not a good argument; prime ministers can deal with more than one issue at a time, and Sunak has a lot more than an hour of his time on NHS pay issues. But that\u2019s irrelevant, because voters will believe Streeting has a point when he says the Johnson row is a distraction. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.45am: Suella Braverman, the home secretary, gives evidence to the Commons home affairs committee. 11.30am: Gillian Keegan, the education secretary, gives a speech on AI and education. 12pm: Rishi Sunak faces Keir Starmer at PMQs. After 12.45pm: MPs begin a debate on an SNP motion calling for the creation of a Commons cost of living committee to investigate what is driving up prices, how Brexit has contributed, and what the government should do in response.

The Blackening doesn\u2019t just hear those cries; it needles its crowd for more reactions, bigger this time. From Tim Story, the director of Fantastic Four and Ride Along, the film starts with a group of college friends reuniting at a creaky woodland cabin \u2013 replete with drinks, drugs and marathon games of Spades. Premiering at last year\u2019s Toronto film festival, Story\u2019s feature releases this weekend pegged to Juneteenth \u2013 the emancipation holiday marking its second year in federal observance. Just when the love triangle between strait-laced Lisa (Dear White People\u2019s Antoinette Robinson), fuckboy Nnamdi (House Party\u2019s Sinqua Walls) and gay bestie Dewayne (the Emmy nominee Dewayne Perkins, who produced and co-wrote the film with Girls Trip\u2019s Tracy Oliver) threatens to kill the vibe, half of the couple hosting the gala turns up dead (SNL\u2019s Jay Pharoah); the fate of the other mate (Insecure\u2019s Yvonne Orji) still hangs in the balance. The only way the friends can save her is by playing the Blackening, like Life meets Saw but with the most racist Monopoly man you\u2019ve ever seen \u2013 a talking sambo doll face. Trivia categories run the gamut from basic TV (How many seasons did \u201cDark Aunt Viv\u201d get on the Fresh Prince?) to advanced hip-hop math (How many blunts are there on Nas\u2019s One Mic?) When the contest turns on a trick question the friends become fair game for the slaughter. The film\u2019s fighting spirit is born from a recognizable brand of consciousness. Which is to say there is never a time when these Black people aren\u2019t fully aware that they are in exactly the kind of situation that other Black people will scold them for getting into. Getting out of it means getting the small details right \u2013 down to turning a friend\u2019s pistol grip from sideways to upright so the bullets actually hit the big bad. Having all Black characters just complicates the age-old genre problem of whom to kill off first, an idea Perkins first wrestled with in a 2018 sketch. Even Officer White (The Drew Carey Show\u2019s Diedrich Bader) is hip to his particular dubiousness. The friends still make plenty of mortal mistakes \u2013 splitting up, going to a second location and turning on one another even as the audience urges them otherwise. But the blunders are easily excused because the characters making them are smartly drawn. King (House Party\u2019s Melvin Gregg) is the thug turned peacemaker \u201cballs deep in the sunken place\u201d (his partner is white, you see) who nonetheless came on this trip packing heat. Allison (Empire\u2019s Grace Byers) is the biracial militant whose beef with The Man traces to the suspicions she harbors toward her actual white father. Shanika (The Farewell\u2019s X Mayo) oscillates from turn-up queen to voice of reason and back again. But the clear standout in this group is Clifton, the bespectacled two-time Trump voter some will strain to recognize as Jermaine Fowler \u2013 Coming 2 America\u2019s heir aberrant. The time working with Eddie Murphy rubbed off on this character, a chip off the ol\u2019 Jiff Ramsey. He stands in for the sheepish minority who have no idea how to play Spades, and no hope of learning from peers who treat the game as a cultural heirloom passed down only to the truly Black. Clifton\u2019s response to that rejection is a strike for those at the cookout (ahem) who still don\u2019t know how to play Spades \u2013 less a game of chance than of ESP, as The Blackening rightly makes clear. Never mind that most of us would be happy to exact revenge over a table of dominoes, still one of the easiest and most accessible games in the world. As a horror The Blackening isn\u2019t the scariest. But that\u2019s not the point of this film \u2013 a Fubu satire smack in the sweet spot between Get Out and Scary Movie. Explicitly comic while stopping just short of slapstick, it\u2019s a film best seen in a theater with a Black audience that will sing along with Allison as she struggles through the second verse of Lift Every Voice (AKA the Black national anthem). The filmgoers at my Atlanta screening were never howling more than when Dewayne randomly dropped into the jingle for O\u2019Reilly Auto Parts, the most surprising entry on the universal Black factboard by far. Where Michael Jackson\u2019s Thriller and the Fugees\u2019 Killing Me Softly With His Song winked at the very audience embracing them, The Blackening throws its arms around its crowd and squeezes hard. If you\u2019re feeling at all frightened, it\u2019s because you\u2019re just not feeling the love.

Supporters waved Italian flags with Forza Italia \u2013 the name of the party he founded in 1994 \u2013 written on them and, in reference to his long association with AC Milan football club, chanted: \u201cThere\u2019s only one president.\u201d The arrival of his coffin was greeted with applause after it had been escorted by traffic police to the cathedral from Villa San Martino, Berlusconi\u2019s home in Arcore 20 miles away. Giorgia Meloni\u2019s rightwing coalition government, of which Forza Italia is a junior member, also bestowed Berlusconi, who died of leukaemia on Monday at the age of 86, with a national day of mourning. Milan Cathedral was closed off to tourists as 2,000 official guests including Meloni, whose rise to power was facilitated by Berlusconi, her predecessor Mario Draghi, Hungary\u2019s nationalist prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, and Qatar\u2019s emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, took to their pews. The service was broadcast live on two huge screens on Piazza del Duomo by Mediaset, the television network owned by Berlusconi and the vehicle through which he was able to nurture the populist instincts of the electorate. Standing among the crowd, Elisa Canclini, who worked for Berlusconi for 27 years, first at his holding company, Fininvest, and subsequently at Mediaset, described her former boss as a person who was \u201cfull of humanity and intelligence\u201d, and had \u201cgreat foresight and class\u201d. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t like a boss, he was like one of us,\u201d she said. Canclini\u2019s most abiding memory of Berlusconi, Italy\u2019s longest-serving prime minister since the second world war, was when he nicknamed her \u201cthe blond Gullit\u201d \u2013 in reference to Ruud Gullit, the former Dutch international who played for AC Milan, which Berlusconi owned between 1986 and 2017. \u201cI had long curly hair,\u201d she said, while showing an old photograph taken alongside Berlusconi and other colleagues. \u201cIt was one of the nicest moments when he gave me that nickname.\u201d Roberto Lotti, who previously worked for an AC Milan fans association, travelled from Tuscany to pay his respects. \u201cI met Berlusconi when he bought the club,\u201d Lotti said. \u201cHe was totally different from any of the previous owners \u2013 he captured the imagination, and then had a lot of success with the team.\u201d The death of Berlusconi, who despite being embroiled in countless trials and sex scandals, received only one conviction \u2013 for tax fraud \u2013 has divided Italy, leaving many disgusted by the state funeral and national day of mourning. While it is not unusual for former prime ministers and other government ministers to be granted a state funeral, a national day of mourning is the choice of whoever is in power. Sessions in parliaments have been scrapped, while rightwing councils across the country have observed a minute of silence. Simona Stante, who was in Milan for work, said she was \u201csick and tired\u201d of all the \u201cfawning\u201d coverage given to Berlusconi by the mainstream press since his death, with the exception of La Repubblica, Il Fatto Quotidiano and Domani. \u201cHe still manages to control all the information,\u201d Stante said. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy to give him a state funeral \u2013 as if he was a saint. Not even [the judges] Paolo Borsellino and Giovanni Falcone got one, and they fought against the mafia all their lives.\u201d Riccardo Magi, the secretary of the small leftwing party, Pi\u00f9 Europa, described Berlusconi as a \u201cfailed statesman\u201d who should not be \u201cbeatified\u201d. \u201cI reiterate my condolences, but I think this ongoing beatification is wrong,\u201d Magi said. \u201cHe foolishly managed public finances \u2026 and caused Italy to lose prestige and credibility at an international level. Not to mention justice, which he never managed to make reforms on.\u201d One person familiar with Berlusconi\u2019s wrath is Bill Emmott, a former editor of the Economist who sparked controversy after running a front page of an issue in April 2001 headlined: \u201cWhy Silvio Berlusconi is unfit to lead Italy\u201d. Berlusconi lost a defamation case against the publication in 2008. Emmott said: \u201cMy first thought was that he was very lucky to die when there was a rightwing prime minister of a government of which he formed part. Would [former prime ministers] Paolo Gentiloni or Mario Draghi have [given such a funeral]? I doubt it. You could be respectful but you wouldn\u2019t have to go this far. \u201cBut for Meloni, it felt like the most prudent thing to do to honour the man who made it possible for her to be prime minister of Italy. Looking at comparisons with Falcone and Borsellino is morally correct but beside the point \u2013 this is an exercise of power.\u201d Berlusconi\u2019s countless trials and tribulations, including the infamous \u201cbunga bunga\u201d sex parties, appeared to wash over his supporters. \u201cI don\u2019t feel affected by bunga bunga,\u201d said Giulia Marinoni, 25, who had travelled from Parma to Milan. \u201cHe [Berlusconi] always showed respect for women, and brought women into the party and to power \u2013 Italy\u2019s first female prime minister is there thanks to him.\u201d Canclini said Berlusconi\u2019s judicial challenges were down to \u201cpeople who were jealous of him\u201d, adding: \u201cSo they always put him in a bad light. Yes, he made a few errors, but we all make those.\u201d Critics have argued that Berlusconi, who was elected prime minister three times, exploited his vast wealth to seduce poorer voters into voting for him. But Canclini disagrees. \u201cI don\u2019t see him as a manipulator, but as an extremely educated person. There will never be anyone like him \u2013 he was a genius,\u201d she said."}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e7011a", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/14/nauseating-hateful-tv-how-the-idol-has-single-handedly-resurrected-torture-porn", "primaryCategory": "tv-and-radio", "subCategories": [], "title": "Nauseating, hateful TV: how The Idol has single-handedly resurrected torture porn", "lead": "Sam Levinson\u2019s miserable drama despises its characters \u2013 and its audience.

The term \u201ctorture porn\u201d became popularised around 20 years ago in the mid-2000s, when \u2013 after the success of Saw \u2013 cinemas were rife with films such as Hostel 1 and 2, which saw young tourists tortured by death cults. The Human Centipede featured other tourists stitched together anus to mouth, while A Serbian Film depicted a man being drugged and made to commit unspeakable acts by yet another death cult. Eventually, the fashion for extreme brutality died down, only for horror to become \u201celevated\u201d \u2013 and emphasise dramatic elements and metaphors over gore. Until The Idol, that is. The drama stars Lily-Rose Depp as a pop singer attempting a comeback, who is taken in by a slippery Svengali (the Weeknd, a Grammy-winning musician). It may not contain death cults or severed limbs (yet), but it is so commited to artlessly making its protagonist suffer that it has single-handedly resurrected torture porn. Sam \u201ccreator of Euphoria\u201d Levinson\u2019s latest HBO show was controversial before it premiered. Rolling Stone reported that anonymous sources who worked on it described it \u201clike sexual torture porn.\u201d But Levinson has managed to dig below the already low expectations by creating a show so vacuous and cruel that it\u2019s hard to believe it\u2019s on HBO, the network that just wrapped up Succession. One of the problems with \u201ctorture porn\u201d was not so much the violence, but the misanthropy \u2013 how much contempt it shows for its characters. Like Hostel before it, the Idol is content to degrade and humiliate characters, then ask viewers to revel in their misery. The show\u2019s landscape is unrelentingly bleak, depicting a music industry filled with cruel charlatans who are \u201cgauging if you still got it\u201d rather than looking at their fragile singer as a human being. But it saves most malice for Depp\u2019s pop star protagonist, Jocelyn. It\u2019s unclear whether Depp and the Weeknd are playing characters medicated to the point of dissociation, but both only convince when playing up their characters\u2019 utter lack of natural talent and charisma. Every moment of shame and pain is savoured. Just as The Human Centipede revelled in the crude surgery and scatological consequences, The Idol wants you to fixate on every failure, injury and moment of despair Joss faces. Even with Depp\u2019s limited acting abilities, those moments are nauseating. Each bump and divot on her face is lit to make her appear unwell and sallow, and her humiliation, both sexual and otherwise, is luxuriated in. Her mental health problems are labelled \u201csexy\u201d by an unfeeling executive, a young upstart choreographer undermines her musical and performance skills, and she is humbled by a random naked hanger-on called Chloe who, after skinny-dipping in her pool, outshines her on the piano. Even as she tries to mount a triumphant comeback, there is no hope to cling to. Her new single is dated and terrible, and she struggles with the rudimentary choreography. Joss tries desperately to make her music video good but admits that, at best, it is \u201cgoing to be ironic in a way the fans aren\u2019t going to understand,\u201d \u2013 a line that practically breaks the fourth wall and apologises for the show itself. A dancer accidentally punches her in the groin when a lift goes wrong, and she eventually crumbles into a heap, shoes filled with blood and thighs that look like she has taken a cheese grater to them. This is just the latest in a cavalcade of misery; as a journalist played by Hari Nef reminds us, \u201cContext is important here because her mother died of cancer, she had a very public breakdown and she was cheated on.\u201d As she suffers and bleeds, the show has no insight into the struggles of pop stardom beyond gruelling punishment. At every turn, side characters get in digs about Jocelyn, rolling their eyes at her creative input and pointing out that \u201cDyanne is outdancing\u201d her or the background dancers \u201care kind of out-femming her\u201d. And in the arms of Tedros (the Weeknd), the sex is as unpleasant to watch as it would be to experience. The deeply unsexy scenes amount to little more than the Weeknd spouting the sort of dirty talk that would be carved into the bathroom stall of a sixth form college \u2013 with Depp gagging in between performative moans. Perhaps the worst part of The Idol is that, as well as being \u201ctorture porn\u201d, it fails to be genuinely shocking. It\u2019s a gruelling slog that seems to hate its characters and audience. Only two episodes into its five-episode run, it has outstayed its welcome. Previews for episode three show Jocelyn declared \u201cbrainwashed\u201d as her career is in free fall, but who cares? At this point, we have all suffered enough."}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e7011b", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/14/letter-joan-wall-obituary", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": [], "title": "Letter: Joan Wall obituary", "lead": "<strong>Kathleen Guard writes: </strong>She was a lovely teacher, and we, her pupils, were thrilled when she was chosen to play for England at Wembley", "author": "Kathleen Guard", "datePublished": "2023-06-14T15:48:41Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.293825", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/8d6921aa377d605b438f0f1d509dd4764118bd07/0_507_1709_1025/500.jpg", "body": "In 1958 Joan Wall went to Church Drive secondary school for girls, in Arnold, north-east Nottingham, to teach cookery in the two wooden huts in the school garden fitted out as kitchens.

Publishers, which were previously reluctant to approach the subject, are increasingly seeking out realistic and explicitly neurodiverse protagonists, often by authors who are themselves neurodivergent. Elle McNicoll, who until now has been published only by the small independent Knights Of, was recently at the centre of a five-publisher bidding auction for the world rights to her next two books, of which MacMillan Children\u2019s Books was the eventual victor. The first book is due this autumn. Largely credited with kickstarting the revolution, McNicoll, who won the 2020 Waterstones children\u2019s book prize for her debut novel A Kind of Spark, said that in the past year she had seen a \u201chuge shift\u201d in publishers\u2019 attitudes. \u201cUntil very recently, neurodiverse characters in books have been not flattering or aspirational,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been written by non-neurodiverse authors and are so two-dimensional that they border on the offensive. \u201cAll too often, even where there is a neurodiverse character, they are secondary and they die during the book,\u201d she added. \u201cTheir death is a rite of passage for the main character.\u201d She said her success had made publishers realise that \u201cdiversity is a commercial \u2013 and not just a moral \u2013 issue\u201d. \u201cFor a long time, publishers didn\u2019t treat neurodivergent readers as customers,\u201d she said. \u201cBut now they\u2019re reassessing what they think neurodiversity is and realising that while it might not be talked about in the corporate world or their office spaces, it\u2019s talked about a lot in schools, which is where they\u2019re targeting their products.\u201d Lizzie Huxley-Jones, whose first book in the Vivi Conway series was published in June, said: \u201cBeing published was a refreshing example of a publisher taking risks.\u201d \u201cPublishers are starting to realise that cases of neurodiversity are massively underdiagnosed across society and that there are more experiences out in their target audiences than they might have thought,\u201d added Huxley-Jones, whose pronouns are they/them. \u201cBut there is still a long way to go,\u201d they said. \u201cElle\u2019s success has shown the hunger for authentic neurodiverse characters as opposed to the ones we\u2019ve had in the past, who are written from the outside and, as a result, are stereotypes lacking interiority, emotionality and depth.\u201d Marina Magdalena\u2019s first book in the Antigone Kingsley series, which features a girl with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, was published in April. Magdalena, who has ADHD, wrote the book because she wanted her neurodivergent daughter to have a relatable female role model in fiction. \u201cGrowing up, my daughter struggled with book characters like Hermione Granger, who were super-organised: she just felt so far removed from them,\u201d Magdalena said. \u201cI wanted to give her a character with all the brilliance, innovation and originality that so often comes with conditions like ADHD but who also struggles with emotional regulation and organisation.\u201d Lauren Gardner, McNicoll\u2019s agent at Bell Lomax Moreton, said: \u201cThe publishing industry has really started to change and recognise that we need to be living in a world where any child can walk into a bookshop and see themselves reflected back at them.\u201d \u201cA lot of people are realising that we are all more neurodiverse and less neurotypical than we previously realised,\u201d she said. \u201cElle\u2019s work is revolutionary and I think it has given other publishers an opportunity to see how they can follow suit and give more authors like Elle the opportunities that perhaps they wouldn\u2019t have previously.\u201d Emily Beater, from Magdalena\u2019s publisher, SPCK, said a big influence on publishers had been parents\u2019 increased willingness to buy books with neurodivergent protagonists. \u201cIn the past, publishers might have thought parents didn\u2019t want their kids reading about children who struggle to regulate their emotions but it\u2019s different nowadays,\u201d she said. \u201cToday\u2019s gentler parenting is about helping your children reach their full potential not by shaming them for not being able to do something but in an alternative way if necessary.\u201d Caroline Carpenter from the Bookseller, a trade magazine, agreed. \u201cHistorically there hasn\u2019t been much neurodiversity in children\u2019s publishing but things are changing and one of the really important steps forward has been people who are neurodivergent themselves writing neurodiverse characters. \u201cSmall publishers are leading the way,\u201d she added. \u201cBut the big publishers are catching on.\u201d Tom Purser, head of guidance, volunteering and campaigns at the National Autistic Society, said: \u201cThere has been a disappointing lack of neurodiverse protagonists in books for children and young people. But it\u2019s brilliant to see that this is changing with more and more neurodiverse characters being represented in literature. \u201cMany people learn about what life is like for neurodiverse people through reading books, so it\u2019s important these depictions are realistic and represent the challenges neurodiverse people face as well as the huge contributions they make to our society,\u201d he added."}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e7011d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/14/lucy-letby-plumber-tells-jury-of-sewage-leak-in-neonatal-unit", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "subCategories": [], "title": "Plumber tells Lucy Letby murder trial of drainage problems at hospital", "lead": "Lorenzo Mansutti gives evidence after nurse said parts of neonatal unit were not a safe working environment", "author": "Josh Halliday North of England correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-06-14T15:41:43Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.293842", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/42dd20d837f3dfa656dde420ec0e846ef39b5636/138_171_967_580/500.jpg", "body": "Plumbers were called out \u201cweekly\u201d to drainage problems at an ageing hospital building where nurse Lucy Letby allegedly attacked 17 babies, a court has heard. A plumber, Lorenzo Mansutti, was the only person called to give evidence on behalf of the nurse as the defence closed its case on Wednesday. Letby, 33, denies murdering seven children and attempting to kill 10 others on the neo-natal unit at the Countess of Chester hospital in the year to June 2016. Mansutti, who has worked as a plumber on the hospital estate since 1986, confirmed Letby\u2019s recollection of an incident she suggested may have contributed to the unexplained deaths of babies. Giving evidence last month, Letby, 33, said parts of the neonatal unit were \u201cnot a safe working environment\u201d because there were \u201coften plumbing issues\u201d. She told jurors: \u201cWe used to have raw sewage coming out of the sinks [and] coming out on the floor in nursery one.\u201d Letby said the issues could have played a role in the unexplained deaths and collapses of babies as staff were unable to clean their hands. \u201cIt\u2019s a contributory issue if the unit is dirty and staff were unable to wash their hands,\u201d she said. Mansutti said there were issues with the drainage system at the hospital\u2019s women and children\u2019s building which he said was built in the late 1960s and opened in the 1970s. Asked by Benjamin Myers KC, defending, how often he was called out for \u201cthese sort of issues\u201d in 2015 and 2016, the witness replied: \u201cFor the whole building it was maybe weekly.\u201d He said he recalled that \u201cfoul water\u201d had come out of a sink in the intensive care suite \u2013 as Letby had claimed \u2013 but that he believed it was the only time this happened as improvement works were carried out afterwards. Mansutti said he did not attend the incident himself and could not recall when it happened as there was no formal record of it on the hospital\u2019s Datix risk management system. He gave details of 11 other plumbing incidents in the same building in the year to June 2016, the period when Letby allegedly murdered babies. Under cross-examination by the prosecutor, Nick Johnson KC, Mansutti accepted that about half of those issues happened in the labour suite and there would be \u201cno consequences\u201d on the neonatal unit. Myers confirmed there would be no further witnesses for the defence. He told the jury: \u201cThere\u2019s the case for Miss Letby.\u201d The judge, Sir James Goss KC, told jurors they would begin considering their verdicts in three weeks.

In a flat, open area south of Zaporizhzhia \u2013 bisected by hedges and a wide muddy track \u2013 about 12 Ukrainian armoured vehicles had become pinned down, bunched too close together near a minefield. In one video, shells and rockets can be seen tearing into the ground and into vehicles, including one of Ukraine\u2019s new German-supplied Leopard tanks and US Bradleys. Soldiers can be seen running through the smoke from one damaged vehicle to another. When the shooting was finally over, several Ukrainian soldiers were dead. Smashed vehicles had been left abandoned. Russian commentators were crowing over the failure. The two sides have given conflicting accounts of what happened on the afternoon of 7 June, about 4km south of the village of Mala Tokmachka, with Moscow almost certainly overemphasising the importance of the engagement and Kyiv attempting to downplay it. Only now, amid the fog of war, is it possible to ascertain what happened. As part of a wider effort in that area of the frontline, 20 Ukrainian armoured vehicles led by two specialised mine-clearing vehicles set off in what appears to have been a \u201cbreaching operation\u201d, targeting an area of higher ground held by Russian forces. Not long afterwards, brief posts on social media described how the column ran into difficulty close to a minefield, losing many of its vehicles. According to analysis by Deepstatemap, which tracks the status of the fighting in Ukraine, Kyiv\u2019s forces attempted two separate attacks, the first involving nine vehicles, the second 11. It appears the first group encountered mines, which alerted Russian defenders to their presence. The second group was quickly spotted by Russian reconnaissance drones and came under heavy artillery fire. At some stage it appears that four Bradleys \u2013 possibly from the second group \u2013 were sent to help retrieve troops from where they had been pinned down. According to Ukrainian accounts, the Russian fire led to the loss of one Leopard tank and four armoured personnel carriers. Other vehicles, including a second Leopard, appear to have been damaged. There are claims that this tank too was abandoned. Despite efforts by Russian sources to suggest a wider setback for Ukrainian forces in the area, it appears that much of the footage that emerged in the aftermath showed the same engagements from different angles. According to staff sergeant Valerii Markus of the Ukrainian 47th brigade \u2013 which was involved in the incident \u2013 Russia had hugely exaggerated the brigades\u2019 losses. In a video posted online this week, a visibly angry Markus said his brigade had lost five soldiers, not the large numbers claimed by Russia, and had inflicted far heavier losses on the Russian side. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for our soldiers,\u201d he said, aiming his anger at critics of what had occurred, \u201cbut they are fighting. They are recovering our land metre by fucking metre.\u201d The details of the failed assault remain important because of what they reveal about the challenges Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive faces against defensive positions Russia has had a year to prepare that are supported by Moscow\u2019s superior air power, which has been more visible since Ukraine began its offensive. Commenting on the events around Mala Tokmachka in an update in his Substack account, Phillips P O\u2019Brien, professor of strategic studies at the University of St Andrews, suggested that such losses were to be expected because of the nature of the fighting. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that this operation will take a while. Ukraine is trying to do something that has not been successfully accomplished (perhaps ever) before. They are trying to execute a wide-scale offensive with the use of armoured vehicles without air supremacy against an entrenched enemy that possesses a large supply of defensive weaponry. \u201cMany of the advantages Ukraine was able to use effectively in slowing any Russian advances to slower-than-snail pace over the last six months are now with the Russians. \u201cThe Ukrainians are having to contend with the fact that now they need to send forces forward, including tanks, APCs and other vehicles, and they must operate in an environment in which they are threatened by a large number of different systems \u2013 such as the almost ubiquitous handheld anti-vehicle missile.\u201d That sentiment was underlined in a briefing from western officials on Wednesday that suggested Ukraine was taking significant casualties and making slow progress towards the Russian main line of defence. They said the counteroffensive was still in its early days and involved a form of warfare not seen in decades as Ukraine forces were being forced to build single lanes of armoured vehicles through mines heading to main Russian defences that in some cases may be still as far as 20km away. \u201cThe vulnerability of the classic single lanes through the minefields make the Ukrainian armoury very vulnerable to attack,\u201d one official said. The officials suggested there was likely to be \u201cgrinding, costly warfare\u201d for many months to come. \u201cThis is incredibly difficult. Russia has generally put up a good defence from their well-prepared positions and falling back to tactical lines \u2026 The idea that the Russians were just going to melt away and the Ukrainians were going to drive straight through their defensive line was in people\u2019s wildest dreams.\u201d"}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e7011f", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/14/drinking-alcohol-bad-for-you-ignore-headlines-claim-otherwise", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "subCategories": [], "title": "Drinking alcohol is bad for you.

Consider a typical headline to a story covered with great enthusiasm by many major news organisations this week: \u201cModerate alcohol consumption may lower stress, reduce heart disease risk, study finds.\u201d Enthusiastic drinkers, drowning in a dark sea of health warnings, will cling on to such words as stricken sailors might hold on to the hull of their capsized boat. They will turn a blind eye to the facts of the story, although even the headline itself, with its \u201cmay\u201d and its \u201cstudy finds\u201d, suggests this scientific revelation isn\u2019t quite the slam dunk we might be hoping for. Once the study\u2019s methodology and conclusions are outlined, it\u2019s clear that the whole thing falls into the category of quite interesting, rather than this changes everything. But who needs that level of detail? If I\u2019m so minded, there\u2019s as much information in the headline as I\u2019m ever going to want or need to support my long-cherished pet theory about drinking. \u201cI knew it! I told you so! Drinking helps me deal with stress, ergo it eases the strain on my poor ticker, therefore I\u2019ll live longer and more happily.\u201d I\u2019ll file this fact away along with that one about red wine being good for you, as good as a health drink. The problem is that there are drinkers and industry PRs and libertarian anti-\u201cnanny state\u201d culture warriors who will be dredging up this story to drop into conversations many years from now. \u201cDon\u2019t you remember the study that showed \u2026?\u201d etc etc. And the headline above was quite responsibly written. Many aren\u2019t. A quick search for similar stuff put out there in the last year or so by our mainstream media yielded some beauties. How about: \u201cBeer is GOOD for you! Scientists claim two pints a day may slash your risk of dementia\u201d? And extra marks here for a quite ghastly second mention just below it: \u201cDrinking two pints a day slashed risk of the memory-robbing condition by a third.\u201d Memory-robbing condition? Oh, please. Also highly commended: \u201cCheers! Drinking beer makes you happier and healthier than if you are teetotal, scientists confirm.\u201d Confirm, mark you. Not even a \u201cmay\u201d or a \u201cclaim\u201d to keep it honest. But first prize has to go to: \u201cDrink \u2018thousands of varieties of wine\u2019 to boost immunity and improve mental health.\u201d Whaaat? \u201cProfessor Tim Spector says wine is good for improving gut health and is high in polyphenols, a group of natural defence chemicals.\u201d Ah yes, Professor Spector. A very clever man and no mistake. I once interviewed him about his book concerning what we eat and how we individually process certain food types differently. All clever stuff, but I got the feeling he was somehow a different breed from the rest of us, being slim and wise and sensible in all matters. I couldn\u2019t imagine him binge-eating anything and told him as much. He claimed otherwise but struggled to name anything specific he couldn\u2019t stop himself pigging out on. In the end, the best he came up with was that he occasionally went a bit overboard troughing too many cashew nuts. Cashews? I rest my case. So what was this advice to drink thousands of varieties of wine all about? Had he let himself go? I needn\u2019t have worried: once again the headline was deflated by the story. It turned out that any more than a small glass or two at one sitting would negate whatever magic the wine was working on your gut health. At that rate of intake, it\u2019s going to take him decades to drink enough of his thousands of varieties to put his theory to the test. Stay off the cashews, prof, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll live long enough to do it. In an era when studies of anything and everything generate reams of data that are widely available, you\u2019re likely to find something to support whatever you happen to believe in. Alcohol good, alcohol bad; Brexit good, Brexit bad; climate in crisis, climate OK; Earth round, Earth flat. The supporting data will be there for you somewhere. And, even better, someone will have published a story on it with a headline you can screenshot to cherish for ever. The issue of alcohol use, groaning under the weight of social convention, vast commercial interests and its own addictive properties, is ripe for this kind of headline-based sophistry. But if you search up a list of news stories on the subject over the years you find, as with the climate crisis, an overwhelming consensus: alcohol is really quite bad for you, end of. Railing against this inconvenient truth, the smattering of contradictory offerings look comically desperate. There\u2019s the plain unlikely \u2013 \u201cHeavy drinkers healthier and happier in later years\u201d \u2013 and the decidedly bemusing: \u201cAlcohol \u2018has benefits for older drinkers but young should go teetotal\u2019\u201d. On the other side of the argument, to counter all this, the public health lobby takes an ever more severe position. The World Health Organization is now saying that when it comes to alcohol consumption, there is no safe amount that does not affect health. While this might be technically true, it also has an absurdity to it. As David Spiegelhalter, then professor for the public understanding of risk at Cambridge University, pointed out when England\u2019s chief medical officer said something similar in 2018: \u201cThere is no safe level of driving, but the government does not recommend that people avoid driving. Come to think of it, there is no safe level of living, but nobody would recommend abstention.\u201d Lost in all this there must be a simple, usable truth that can be widely understood and accepted. Something along the lines of Michael Pollan\u2019s summation of his conclusions about diet: \u201cEat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.\u201d In the spirit of that, I suggest the following: drink alcohol if you must, if you enjoy it, but not much of it. And ignore the bloody headlines.

But unlike the best singers, actors and politicians, footballers work for us, the profundity of their joy in all this so complete as to render them immune from physical or mental fatigue. Consequently, it makes perfect sense that, after a long season \u2013 punctuated for the first time by a winter World Cup because footballers also work for human rights-abusing nation states \u2013 they must now schlep their carcasses through an international weekend that isn\u2019t even a weekend, halfway through June with the European summer at its height. Quite what this means for the Marbellan alcopops industry is hard to say, but at least we\u2019re being granted a break from the Jack Grealish meme-able content industry, hilarious though it is. Man likes Tin! Man has hair! Whatever next?! The amazing thing is that, while the Daily remains nostalgic for something like the thrill of Luke Young replacing Andy Johnson as England storm to a 2-1 home win that really puts the mighty Chagos Islands in their place, the Nations League is actually a good idea \u2013 an accusation infrequently thrown at Uefa. But it\u2019s unarguable that the groundbreaking discovery that competition improves competition has multiplied the quality of international football by many orders of magnitude; the problem being that a million times zero is still zero. Nevertheless, the semi-finals are upon us, beginning on Wednesday with Netherlands v Croatia in Rotterdam, and followed the next evening by Spain v Italy in Enschede. Netherlands have exchanged the jogo bonito of Louis van Gaal, his third spell as manager over, for the unbridled panache of Ronald Koeman, at the start of his second. Which ex is next is unclear \u2013 the Daily is hoping for either Fred Grim, one of football\u2019s greatest names, or D1ck Advocaat \u2013 but given the team recently lost 4-0 to France and needed a brace from Nathan Ak\u00e9 to muster a mere 3-0 win over Gibraltar, we may find out sooner than the greatest coach ever to look like Andy Pandy thinks. Croatia, meanwhile, are fresh from scrounging their way to the HR World Cup semi-finals, scoring just six goals in six games, with four coming against the famously miserly Canadian defence. They will, though, be confident of progressing to Sunday\u2019s final, partly because the Netherlands are rubbish and partly because the cosmos still owes Luka Modric over that whole Richard Hillman farrago. Then, on Thursday, Spain will pass the ball backwards and sideways against Italy. Their new coach, Luis de la Fuente, may have achieved almost nothing as a manager, but his surname translates as \u201cfrom the source\u201d \u2013 a far better reason to appoint someone than the \u201cabject failure at Everton and Barcelona\u201d the KNVB finds so compelling \u2013 though whether he can deploy his elemental origins to find a centre-forward remains to be seen. Italy, meanwhile, are fresh off a home defeat by England and a crushing 2-0 win over Malta. Or, put another way, though the players may be able to override their physical and mental fatigue, we may soon find that it\u2019s us unable to handle any more football.

From the opening shot Courtin-Wilson draws a stony overcast aesthetic, beginning with an ambiguous image of what seems to resemble a foggy, ashen skyline before a vague human outline emerges. Later, there are shots of misty skylines and bodies of water more cement-coloured than blue; it\u2019s as if the world around Rosenzweig is greying before his eyes, easing him through his last days. Courtin-Wilson and cinematographer Jac Fitzgerald very impressively texture the film in ways that make it feel stylish \u2013 but not so stylish as to detract from its impact. Man on Earth is an observational documentary that prioritises, above everything else, the subject and his circumstances. It\u2019s pitched at just the right level of immersion: a soft, spectral glow veneering more conventional fly-on-the-wall elements such as handheld camerawork. The director has said in an interview that inspirations for the film\u2019s palette include the Magpie by Monet, who was once described by John Berger in ways that perhaps also apply to Courtin-Wilson: an artist who \u201cwanted to paint not things in themselves but the air that touched things.\u201d Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning What can\u2019t be observed in Man on Earth in direct visual terms is the relationship between the director and his subject. The former bore a huge responsibility to the latter to tell his story responsibly and powerfully. And the latter was wise to entrust him: presumably Rosenzweig watched Courtin-Wilson\u2019s other films, several of which are also built on striking collaborations with intriguing people from various walks of life. For instance the Australian-born Tibetan Buddhist nun Robina Courtin, who was the subject of 2000\u2019s Chasing Buddha; the great Indigenous entertainer Jack Charles, who was the subject of 2008\u2019s Bastardy; and Daniel P Jones, an ex-convict who plays a fictionalised version of himself in the strikingly gritty, yet intensely poetic, 2011 drama Hail. Courtin-Wilson introduces us to Rosenzweig in an odd way, showing him mid-sentence or mid-statement, saying: \u201cAnd that\u2019s what my new philosophy in life is \u2013 ah, fuck it.\u201d There\u2019s a feeling we might have arrived a smidge too late to fully appreciate what he\u2019s saying. Which might be true in a broader sense too, in that it\u2019s obvious the best days for this sharp and quick-witted individual, worn down by time and sickness, are far behind him. Rosenzweig \u2013 who designed bathrooms for the likes of Elton John and Janet Jackson, and hung out with celebrities including the Sex Pistols and Blondie \u2013 has Parkinson\u2019s disease and has been given six months to live. The rakishly thin Rosenzweig reflects on the intense chronic pain he experiences, and how \u201cyou really don\u2019t have any concept of time when you have Parkinson\u2019s\u201d because \u201cthere\u2019s no need to know what day it is\u201d. One of his sons, Jessie, who is his carer, also comments on his condition, observing for instance how Parkinson\u2019s \u201cconstantly forces your body to move\u201d and thus constantly makes it burn energy. \u201cImagine swimming a hundred laps every hour,\u201d he says. Rosenzweig is resolute that it is \u201cabsolutely the right time\u201d to say goodbye, and he\u2019s \u201cready to go.\u201d Assisted dying allows the subject to make preparations and bid farewell to loved ones: a task Rosenzweig undertakes with bravery, introspection, and a wee bit of cheeky humour. The cameras are there until the very end: in his home, perched by his deathbed. The film\u2019s last 40 or so minutes in particular are \u2013 in a melancholic way \u2013 beautifully humane, but gosh it\u2019s heartbreaking: tears were rolling down my face and I have no doubt many viewers will respond similarly. We all arrive at the same destination as Rosenzweig in the end, but not all of us shuffle off the mortal coil exhibiting such strength of character.

Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Of course, taxes have a bit to do with housing prices. Last week the taxation statistics for 2020-21 showed \u2013 for the first time on record (going back to 1993-94) \u2013 that more property investors claimed a profit than a loss. That year, of course, was the year of the pandemic and record low interest rates, which made it somewhat harder for investors to have rental payments lower than their loan repayments: If the graph does not display click here But do not fear, the rising rates since April last year will see the numbers of negative gearers shoot up. And even the relative paucity of those claiming a rental loss did not change who is most likely to be negative gearing. Who are the negative gearers? Well, if you are ever in need of a surgical consult and can\u2019t get an appointment, your best bet might be to turn up to an auction, given nearly a quarter of surgeons negative geared in 2020-21.

Three months ago when the previous dwelling price figures were released, prices were falling and there was a sense that interest rates might as well. Cut to now, and rather than expecting the cash rate to be 3.8% by the end of the year, the market expects at least one more rate rise to 4.35% and an outside chance of two to 4.6%.

Such is the resilience of house prices that even though across the nation prices in March this year were lower than in 2022, they are not as low as you would expect, given the drop in home loans: If the graph does not display click here In the December 2020 quarter property prices were 3.2% below where they were a year earlier. Given home loans have been falling you would expect the March figures to show a bigger fall in property prices. But instead, the fall stabilised at 3.7%: If the graph does not display click here So this might be as big as the fall gets. The recent improvement in prices is not good for affordability. In all capital cities, the median price for a house is higher than it was when we entered the pandemic: If the graph does not display click here The price of apartments has not risen as quickly as houses but, except for Melbourne, the rise has still been very strong. In Melbourne the median apartment price across the city fell from $600,000 in June 2020 to $577,000, while in Hobart they have soared 42% from $394,500 to $560,000: If the graph does not display click here All up, when we compare property prices with household disposable income per capita the massive drop in affordability over the past three years is clear.

It does cost enough to be a non-starter for a lot of people: a family ticket will set you back $128 (two adults, two children), an adult ticket is $40 and children (3-12 years) are $28. Entry is timed in 15-minute increments, but you are free to stay for as long as it is open. The question that I, along with my family, was sent to answer \u2013 via complimentary tickets \u2013 was: is it any good? And, crucially, is it worth it? Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning The light festival component of Vivid \u2013 perhaps most famous for its light and drone shows over Sydney Harbour and the Opera House \u2013 has become a regular event in the calendar for our children, breaking up the long winter months between Easter and Halloween. And Sydneysiders as a whole have embraced the event \u2013 in a large part because most of it is free; more than 1.2 million visitors have poured off trains, ferries, buses and the light rail so far this year. The botanic gardens walk has been part of Vivid\u2019s annual free offering since 2016, when it began as a way to celebrate the garden\u2019s bicentenary. Back then there were about six light displays, including the Cathedral of Light: a 60-metre-long arch made up of thousands of fairy lights. It was hugely popular from the start. This year, though, it has been massively scaled up and ticketed, as a new event called Lightscape. The Lightscape mob have previously carpeted gardens around the world with light installations and soundscapes, including the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew in London. In Sydney there is now a 2.1km trail with 16 light displays, each with a different botanical theme and accompanying music. In one part, which we will call Game of Thrones, metal dragons breathe fire over a spiral of torches. This was a hit with the children. In fact, fire in general was a highlight for them; halfway along the trail were fire pits where they could toast mega marshmallows. But the marshmallows were $3.50 each, posing a serious challenge to my naturally frugal disposition. There would be good money to be made dealing some on the side if you snuck in a pack of Pascall, I thought. It\u2019s impressive for a public event in Sydney to even allow a combination of children and fire pits. Plus you can buy alcoholic drinks (beers were about $11, mulled wine was $13) and carry them with you as you admire the lights, rather than being corralled in a holding pen. Also very un-Sydney like. Some installations stood out, making use of the gardens and its unique collection of trees and plants; others felt familiar from the free incarnation. Dancing Palms \u2013 a palm grove brought to life by patterned projections \u2013 is like walking inside a living, moving leopard-skin print. A Moreton bay fig covered in snaking neon lights glows like a Technicolor Christmas tree. Sea of Light outside the Calyx turns grass into liquid, dancing in waves around a whale\u2019s head and tail; and in one field, blue and green cyber optic lights cluster like jellyfish with the city skyline glowing behind them. Others are less exciting: what looks like Bunnings festoon lights, for instance, have been wrapped around a grove of trees. A big part of the attraction of Lightscape is that it offers a reprieve from the overwhelming crush of people at Circular Quay. Vivid\u2019s popularity is the very thing that threatens its existence. The sheer weight of numbers makes it difficult and stressful, particularly for small children and parents with strollers. I was lucky enough to get a free ticket, but for most families $128 is a huge amount and add that to transport, dinner and drinks (there are pricey food trucks selling souvlaki, Malaysian food, jaffles and burgers), the price climbs well over $200. So, on balance, as mortgage rates climb and a packet of chips can cost $7, is it worth shelling out for? If this is your first Vivid, then yes. If you are visiting from overseas or interstate, it\u2019s also worth it. The lack of crowds is lovely and the walk is enjoyable \u2013 but if you\u2019ve been to Vivid before, it doesn\u2019t feel hugely different to other, free events you would have seen. Vivid is not exactly Hobart\u2019s Dark Mofo with pagan bonfires and nude midnight swims, but Sydney\u2019s image is of a summer city, of Rex Dupain\u2019s sunbather and a glistening sun-kissed harbour.

Wilkinson lodged the complaint on Tuesday alleging the broadcasts breached commercial television standards, and can escalate the complaint to the Australian Communications and Media Authority (Acma) if it is not resolved, her lawyers confirmed. The complaint relates to the Spotlight program shown on 4 June featuring an interview with Lehrmann, and a segment on Sunrise two days later which referred to a letter allegedly sent to Wilkinson by Brittany Higgins. The contents of the complaint are unclear, but lawyers for Network Ten, Wilkinson and Higgins, who alleges she was raped by Lehrmann, have raised serious concerns that Seven appeared to have improperly used evidence from Lehrmann\u2019s trial in the Spotlight program. The lawyers have raised these concerns with the network, the ACT DPP, the ACT supreme court and the Australian federal police, court documents show. The AFP are considering a complaint lodged by Ten last week, but the ACT supreme court confirmed on Wednesday that no application had been made regarding the concerns. Lawyers for Network Ten and Wilkinson made explosive allegations in the federal court last week that a \u201ccalculated\u201d and \u201cconcerted\u201d media campaign using restricted court material was being waged to pressure and dissuade witnesses from giving evidence in the defamation trial brought by Lehrmann. Lehrmann is suing Ten and Wilkinson over their initial reporting of Higgins\u2019s rape allegation, which he denies. The rape trial was aborted due to juror misconduct and a second trial was abandoned due to concerns about the risk it posed to Higgins\u2019s life. Lehrmann has also commenced defamation proceedings against the ABC for broadcasting a live address by Higgins to the National Press Club. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup A complaint to Acma is mentioned in the 307-page federal court affidavit filed by Marlia Saunders, a lawyer representing Network Ten. It is one of several developments outlined in the affidavit, which was filed as part of the defamation case Lehrmann is pursuing against Ten, its journalist Wilkinson, and the ABC. According to an email sent by lawyers for Wilkinson to Spotlight\u2019s executive producer Mark Llewellyn on 8 June, which is included in the Saunders affidavit, they had viewed a document described as Ten\u2019s Acma complaint, agreed with it and endorsed it, and \u201cwill be making a separate complaint on behalf of Ms Wilkinson and Mr [Peter] Fitzsimons\u201d. It is understood Ten\u2019s complaint is yet to be lodged. Separately, the Ten affidavit also reveals that lawyers representing Ten, Wilkinson and Brittany Higgins believe the extent of evidence leaked from Lehrmann\u2019s trial is not limited to Higgins\u2019s text messages and audio of a meeting between Higgins, her partner, David Sharaz, Wilkinson and another Ten journalist. In that audio, Wilkinson appeared to mock the Coalition by raising questions regarding the validity of Senator Jacinta Price\u2019s preselection to the National party and struggling to pronounce her name. According to the affidavit, lawyers representing Ten, Higgins and Wilkinson have claimed that other leaked material includes unseen footage from Network Ten, a draft of Higgins\u2019s book manuscript, audio recordings of interviews between the AFP and witnesses, an audio recording of two security guards at Parliament House on the night of the alleged rape, a statutory declaration signed by Higgins and extracts from Higgins\u2019s personal diary. The affidavit also shows that lawyers for Wilkinson believe the Seven Network reported a \u201cleaked\u201d text from Wilkinson\u2019s husband, Peter FitzSimons, to Higgins which was \u201cfalsified\u201d and \u201cdoes not exist\u201d, and that Wilkinson says she has no record of an \u201cangry\u201d letter that the Australian reported she was sent by Higgins. This is also the letter reported on by Sunrise, lawyers for Wilkinson say. Seven declined to comment. The Australian did not respond to a request for comment. The only response from either media outlet contained in the Saunders affidavit is from Justine Munsie, a lawyer acting for Seven, who wrote to Saunders on 8 June. Saunders had asked the previous day about whether an audio recording of the meeting between Higgins, Wilkinson and others, as well as the \u201crough cut\u201d of footage from the interview Wilkinson did with Higgins for The Project \u2013 both of which had featured on Spotlight \u2013 were taken from evidence provided to the supreme court. Munsie responded: \u201cWe are instructed that as far as our client is aware, the material referred to in your letter did not come into its possession in breach of the implied undertaking.\u201d Lawyers for Lehrmann have denied he is the source of the leaked material, both in the federal court and in multiple emails in the Ten affidavit. The affidavit also contains an email that the ACT acting DPP, Anthony Williamson SC, sent to Saunders on 6 June. In it, Williamson says that while it appeared evidence provided under subpoena had being used improperly, the source of the leak was unclear. He said that while he understood that Network Ten would \u201cfeel justifiably aggrieved about this apparent breach\u201d, it \u201cis not clear to me on the available information \u2026 who exactly breached the undertaking, and the circumstances surrounding that breach\u201d. \u201cOne reasonably available inference is that Mr Lehrmann provided the material to Channel 7 in breach of the undertaking,\u201d Williamson wrote. \u201cBut that, of course, [is] not the only reasonably available inference. It also remains reasonably possible that any number of other people who had access to the documents could have breached it. \u201cWhat is also unclear is the \u2018knowledge\u2019 of Channel 7 surrounding the provenance of the documents.\u201d Justice Michael Lee, who is presiding over the defamation case, last week rejected an application by lawyers for Ten and Wilkinson to question Lehrmann over the alleged breach, and suggested concerns about the leaks were better heard by the ACT supreme court through contempt of court proceedings.

How presumptuous, it ran, to announce his plan as though it was up to him. Like a lot of criticism, it came from those who weren\u2019t paying attention. Warner had accounted for that explicitly, naming a hometown farewell as his hope rather than his expectation, one that would happen only if he played well enough to stay in the team. Standing between him and that hope is another Ashes series in England, Warner\u2019s fourth. Nothing casts so long a shadow over this series as what happened in his third, in 2019, when he stumbled and stuttered to 95 runs in five Tests while falling every time to Jofra Archer or Stuart Broad. At the time it was talked up as the worst series return by a genuine batter in 10 innings. Not quite: England\u2019s Plum Warner made 89 runs in South Africa in 1906, a shocker of a tour decades before he had another managing the Bodyline team, and the West Indies legend Learie Constantine had a chastening visit to Australia in 1931-32 worth 72 runs. That still leaves Warner with bronze on an undesired podium. Other context includes a batch of Dukes balls that made life difficult for all openers. Where Warner averaged an easily calculable 9.5, Cameron Bancroft got sacked averaging 11 flat, Jason Roy got sacked averaging 13.75, and Marcus Harris saw out the series averaging 9.66. In a way, Warner was a victim of his own success, backed to stay in the team and turn things around even when he was struggling. But then, it\u2019s easy to forget that Warner was not waved through for 10 failures. After four low scores, he began the Leeds Test by scoring 61 under cloud so dark it was almost a night match, surviving repeated rain resumptions on what the ball-tracking data affirmed was the most difficult batting day of the summer. Bowling out England cheaply to follow, his innings gave Australia a lead that should have been matchwinning, if not for Ben Stokes and the final\u2011day miracle. Naturally, Warner was picked for the fourth Test, with the hope that he had turned a corner. After failing there, the only options to replace him for the fifth were Bancroft and Usman Khawaja, who had already been dropped themselves. By then there was little point. Even so, this time he will not get nearly so much rope. Two failures will be excused, four would likely be the end. Harris has spent three seasons in county cricket improving against English styles of bowling. Matthew Renshaw has spent seasons with Somerset and Kent. If Broad resumes a chokehold, Australia will tap. Warner is not the dominating presence he once was. He still carves boundaries through the off-side, but with more sense of risk, less of inevitability. When the going is tough \u2013 and to start an innings it is always tough \u2013 he makes sportswriters turn to metaphors of old boxers, ducking and weaving and jabbing, raging against the dying light. Even during his 200 against South Africa last Boxing Day, that was the style, battling through to an increasingly rare chance to swing back hard. Perhaps a combatant who can tactically use the ropes can do a job for Australia this series. That was Warner in the World Test Championship final, facing down a searing spell from Mohammed Shami and Mohammed Siraj after India chose to bowl first on a cloudy morning. He guarded his stumps, letting swing beat the edge, smothering it when straighter, then flaying six boundaries in 25 balls when the bowlers changed and the pressure came off. That 43 was exactly the sort of in-between score that can be ignored or amplified however the onlooker chooses. What it did was get Australia almost through the session, setting things up for Travis Head to come in after lunch without an emergency to attend to and get on with smashing his own eventual hundred. Do that in England and an opener has done a job. Keeping the job in mind is Warner\u2019s challenge and perhaps his salvation. With an ego as powerful as his forearms, he is all too aware of 2019. He will want to take down the home bowlers, especially Broad. He is also canny enough to know he has to survive first. When Broad takes the ball it will start one of the most anticipated individual contests in any Ashes. A contest that will either be Warner\u2019s last or will win him the right to decide what happens next."}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e70128", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/15/almost-every-victorian-indigenous-prisoner-has-enrolled-to-vote-for-body-negotiating-treaty", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "subCategories": [], "title": "Almost every Victorian Indigenous prisoner has enrolled to vote for body negotiating treaty", "lead": "First Peoples\u2019 Assembly will begin negotiations with Andrews government later this year", "author": "Adeshola Ore", "datePublished": "2023-06-14T15:00:07Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.293942", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/9d9fea5d5243b42b892b79477e0dbfdb7c3504a2/1112_933_1198_719/500.jpg", "body": "Almost every Victorian Indigenous prisoner has enrolled to vote for the body that will negotiate the state\u2019s nation-first treaty negotiations. The second iteration of the First Peoples\u2019 Assembly will begin negotiating a landmark statewide treaty with the Andrews government later this year, once its election results are announced in the coming days. It is also expected to be a key point of contact for the commonwealth\u2019s proposed voice to parliament, and could elect the members who will sit on the advisory body. A spokesperson for the assembly told Guardian Australia that its electoral roll had more than tripled since its inaugural elections were held in 2019, with more than 7,000 First Nations Victorians aged over 16 now enrolled to vote in assembly elections. Of those on the roll, the spokesperson said, about 10-15% enrolled to vote while in custody. This could amount to 700 to 1,050 people, including those held on remand or in youth detention centres. The latest Victorian government prison data showed there were 695 Indigenous adult prisoners as of June 2022. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The assembly has yet to reveal how many people listed on the roll went on to vote in the most recent election, the results of which will begin to be counted on Saturday. Amy Rust, the head of engagement and communications at the assembly, said it was vital to include the voices of incarcerated people to ensure a state-wide treaty would deliver \u201creal change for them and future generations. \u201cMob in prison have often experienced first-hand the impacts of colonisation and systemic racism. It might be through the criminal justice system or unfair policing,\u201d she said. \u201cThe journey to treaty needs to be done on our terms. To have faith in the process our community need to see that our thinking isn\u2019t being constrained by colonial structures and systems.\u201d Prisoners serving a sentence of fewer than three years are entitled to enrol and vote in federal elections \u2013 meaning those serving longer sentences will be ineligible to vote in the upcoming Indigenous voice referendum, which could occur as early as October. Voting for the 32-seat Victorian assembly closed on 3 June. The assembly\u2019s seats are comprised of 11 reserved seats for traditional owner groups formally recognised by the state, and 21 members elected by Indigenous Victorians. Victoria currently has 11 registered Aboriginal parties that are formally recognised by the government and covers about 74% of the state, according to the Aboriginal heritage council. The overhauled assembly will meet for the first time next month to elect two new co-chairs. Current co-chairs Marcus Stewart, a Nira illim bulluk man of the Taungurung nation, and Aunty Geraldine Atkinson, a Bangerang-Wiradjuri woman, are not re-contesting the assembly elections. Along with the state-wide treaty, traditional owner groups will also be able to negotiate separate treaties with the state government for issues relevant to specific regions of the state. Candidates have floated numerous ideas for the state-wide treaty, including a universal income for Indigenous elders and co-ownership of renewable energy infrastructure. Rust, who spoke at the Lowitja Institute International Indigenous Health and Wellbeing conference on Wednesday, said a state-wide treaty would seek to push for a permanent Indigenous decision-making body \u2013 which she described as a \u201cBlack parliament\u201d. She said it would differ from the proposed voice to parliament because it would not just advise the government, but have the power to make decisions on policy affecting First Nations Victorians. Victoria is the furthest progressed jurisdiction in enacting the voice, truth and treaty elements of the 2017 Uluru Statement from the Heart manifesto."}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e70129", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jun/15/vintner-wonderland-10-australian-white-wines-to-try-this-winter", "primaryCategory": "food", "subCategories": [], "title": "Vintner wonderland: 10 Australian white wines to try this winter", "lead": "White wine is not just for summer.

There\u2019s something romantic about a glass of shiraz, a comfy couch and a fireplace. But what about white wine? While a glass of riesling or sauv blanc might seem like the ideal match with warm weather, there\u2019s no need to retire white wine once the temperature drops. The key to selecting a good winter white is to choose styles that are weightier, more textural and have a greater concentration of flavour. These will stand up to those richer, fattier comfort foods we tend to gravitate towards during the cold season. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning Summer calls for chilled whites but when it comes to your fuller-bodied winter whites, don\u2019t serve them too cold. Their aromas tend to be more pronounced if they\u2019re served a touch warmer. My suggestion is: take your wine out of the fridge, pour yourself a glass and then leave the bottle out. There\u2019s no need for it to go back in the fridge. Instead, as the wine temperature increases by a few degrees, the aroma and flavour will evolve \u2013 and as a drinker, you\u2019ll get an appreciation and develop a preference for how you like your white wine to be served. Take a swirl on the wild side, and crack open these 10 Australian white wines this winter. Under $25 Duxton Vineyards, 2022 Rewild Fiano, Murray Darling, NSW (RRP $9.99, rewildwine.com.au) In my experience it\u2019s difficult to get fuller-bodied, textural whites under $20, by virtue of the fact they\u2019re more expensive to produce. What the team at Duxton has managed to achieve at this price point, however, is very good. Medium-bodied, with notes of juicy pear and bright citrus and a touch of creaminess on the palate, this is a wine that will transition from summer to winter drinking. For 10 bucks, you can\u2019t go wrong. Under $35 Billanook Estate, 2014 Late Harvest Sauvignon Blanc, Yarra Valley, Vic (RRP $25, billanookestate.com.au) There\u2019s something comforting about a sweet wine in winter. Crack a bottle of this in lieu of dessert \u2013 it\u2019s luscious and moreish. With layers of sweet citrus and spice, this wine reminds me of my mum\u2019s flourless orange cake after it\u2019s been warmed ever so slightly and finished with cream. Handpicked Wines, 2021 Trial Batch Riesling, Tamar Valley, Tas (RRP $28.99, handpickedwines.com.au) If you\u2019re looking for a fresh-tasting drop that will cut through those rich wintry dishes, give this one a whirl. There\u2019s a zesty, sherbet-like acidity that paired beautifully with my roasted pork belly and crackling. I reckon it would go alright with a butter chicken, too! Cullen Wines, 2022 Mangan Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc S\u00e9millon, Margaret River, WA (RRP $30, cullenwines.com.au) For those who like the vibrant aromatics of a savvy b but are chasing something with a little more weight for the cooler months, this is your wine. There are notes of stone and tropical fruits, citrus, orange blossom and thyme, while the addition of s\u00e9millon and verdelho grapes enhances its complexity. The result? A wine that is intensely flavoured, layered and made for winter. Under $50 Singlefile Wines, 2022 Single Vineyard Porongurup Fum\u00e9 Blanc, Great Southern, WA (RRP $35, singlefilewines.com) If you\u2019re not familiar with fum\u00e9 blanc, it\u2019s a style of wine made using sauvignon blanc grapes. Typically aged in oak, it offers a richer, more textural mouthfeel compared with unoaked sauvignon blancs. You could certainly lay this wine down for a few years or drink now if patience fails to prevail. It\u2019s a food-friendly wine that will pair splendidly with roast pork or pasta Alfredo. Yangarra Estate, 2021 Roussanne, McLaren Vale, SA (RRP $38, yangarra.com) Roussanne is made for winter \u2013 fuller-bodied, textural and complex. If you dig French food, it\u2019s the perfect partner for dishes like bouillabaisse, French onion soup, or any white meat doused in a creamy sauce. Here, Yangarra Estate serves up a drop that offers flavours of honey, quince, cashew and golden apple. A lovely wine that will evolve in the glass. Valentine Wines, 2022 Valentine Grenache Blanc, Heathcote, VIC (RRP $38, valentinewines.com.au) I don\u2019t often see a grenache blanc so when a mate suggested I give this a try, I was all for it. Bright citrus aromatics give way to apple and honeysuckle on the palate, offering up a rich mouthfeel supported by delicate spiciness and subtle minerality. When it comes to food pairing winemaker Dom Valentine is a proponent of classic, old-school meals such as chicken cacciatore, stroganoff, and chicken and leek pie. All Saints Estate, 2021 Family Cellar Marsanne, Rutherglen, Vic (RRP $45, (allsaintswine.com.au) You could argue the Rh\u00f4ne Valley in France is the birthplace of winter white grape varieties, and marsanne is one of the region\u2019s most valuable players. Winemaker Nick Brown is known for his marsanne, and this \u201921 release is ripe for the picking. Creamy and textural with notes of pear and quince, it is best paired with humble roast chook with crispy skin and veg. When it comes to marsanne, your patience will be rewarded. When cellared, it develops into a full-bodied wine, displaying flavours of marmalade, baked apple and roasted nuts. Lowe Wines, 2022 Mudgee White Gold Chardonnay, Mudgee, NSW (RRP $48, lowefamilywineco.com.au) Hands down one of the best chardonnays I\u2019ve tried of late. A red drinker\u2019s white wine, this sexy drop is packed full of texture and concentrated flavour. It has a lovely creamy mouthfeel while displaying bright lifted fruit on the palate. I love an oaky chardy so this was right up my alley, with nine months in new and one-year-old French oak. Exceptional value for a chardonnay of this quality. Over $50 Kooyong Estate, 2020 Faultline Chardonnay, Mornington Peninsula, Vic (RRP $60, portphillipestate.com.au) I grew up on the Mornington peninsula, so I\u2019m often asked what my favourite wines from the region are. This is one of them. Lemon rind, nougat, stone fruit and spice make this wine a textural masterpiece with killer length and moreish acidity. And it only gets better with age. Kooyong Estate produces two single vineyard chardonnays, Faultline and Farrago,. So if you\u2019re feeling bougie, nab a bottle of each and try them side-by-side.

Despite his legal efforts to have it changed, the document still listed Coonan as his mother. \u201cI had to submit myself to their generosity as to whether they were going to accept my identity as I presented it, or if they were going to insist that they had to be consistent with the government,\u201d Coonan, who did not want his full name published, said. \u201cI felt really humiliated and small.\u201d But the era in which the identity of trans and gender-diverse people such as Coonan were at odds with the Queensland government came to an end on Wednesday evening, with the passing of reforms to how parents are listed and their sex identified on birth certificates. The new laws allow for one or two mothers to be listed on a child\u2019s birth certificate, or one or two fathers \u2013 or for them simply to be listed as \u201cparents\u201d. They will also enable trans and gender-diverse Queenslanders to change the sex listed on their own birth certificate without \u2013 as was previously required \u2013 the need for sexual reassignment surgery. Coonan transitioned from identifying as a woman to a man at the age of 26 and went on to deliver three boys using a known sperm donor. He had already changed the sex on his own New South Wales birth certificate and his passport, after undergoing chest reconstruction surgery and taking hormones. But after the birth of his first son in February 2019, a Queensland midwife apologised as Coonan had to be listed as a mother on the birth certificate. Now, the repercussions of the new law will be felt beyond the borders of the sunshine state. Western Australia is also committed to joining every state and territory in Australia \u2013 bar one \u2013 by reforming its laws that require people undergo surgery before changing the sex on their birth certificate. New South Wales is the only other state or territory in Australia where the requirement still exists. Sexual reassignment surgery is a costly procedure that involves a number of health risks and is not readily available in Australia. Alastair Lawrie, policy and advocacy director at the Public Interest Advocacy Centre, said this was one of \u201ca wide range of LGBTIQ law reform issues\u201d upon which NSW would soon become \u201can outlier\u201d. \u201cNSW currently requires trans people to undergo genital surgery in order to access a new birth certificate, something many do not want and many of those who do cannot afford,\u201d Lawrie said. \u201cThere\u2019s a need for reform on birth certificates, there\u2019s a need for reform on anti-discrimination law, there\u2019s a need for reform on intersex surgeries, there\u2019s a need for reform on conversion practices. In all of those areas NSW is behind most other jurisdictions,\u201d Lawrie said. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Queensland\u2019s attorney general, Yvette D\u2019Ath, said the state\u2019s laws were a win for the LGBTQ+ community, allowing trans and gender-diverse people to self-identify. \u201cThis bill will help reduce the distress, fear, discrimination and privacy violations that many people in our communities face on an all-too-frequent basis,\u201d she said. But they did not receive unanimous support. The Liberal National party opposition, along with Katter\u2019s Australian party and the independent MP Sandy Bolton, voted against the bill. The debate became heated. D\u2019Ath criticised comments made by the LNP\u2019s deputy leader, Jarrod Bleijie, and others, saying they had \u201ccaused harm and hurt\u201d to people listening in the public gallery and apologised to the LGBTQ+ community on their behalf. The comments came after Bleijie, interjecting during a speech by the Labor MP Chris Whiting, said: \u201cFeminine identity? It\u2019s blokes in a dress.\u201d Bleijie later contributed to the debate, labelling the bill \u201can attack on women\u201d. The LNP MP Amanda Camm also opposed the laws, claiming \u201ca trans woman is \u2026 not a woman\u201d. The youth justice minister, Di Farmer, also apologised to the LGBTQ+ people sitting in the gallery for the nature of the debate. The Greens supported the bill despite a failed amendment, moved by the party on Wednesday, to scrap fees for people accessing and updating their documents. The Greens MP for Maiwar, Michael Berkman, said a lack of accurate documentation \u201cprevents people from enrolling in school, getting a driving licence, getting a job, opening a bank account and applying for housing\u201d. Similar reforms in the UK have generated fierce controversy, but the Green\u2019s federal LGBTQ+ spokesperson, Stephen Bates, said \u201cthings are different\u201d in Australia. He said similar reforms in every other state and territory except NSW had been well received by the general community. \u201cI think it is just a matter of time, honestly, before NSW follows the rest of the states and territories,\u201d the Brisbane MP said. \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasant inevitability.\u201d For Coonan, the polarised debate in Queensland parliament would be all too familiar. From the moment he came out, Coonan said \u201ceveryone had an opinion\u201d about his gender. So on the passing of the bill, he felt an overwhelming sense of relief. \u201cIt is the end of something that has caused lots of people grief,\u201d Coonan said. \u201cIt feels good \u2013 but also feels like something we shouldn\u2019t have had to go through.\u201d In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14.

The temporary ban will be announced on Thursday, when a state parliamentary inquiry into the public sector\u2019s use of consultants will begin, and follows revelations that PwC misused confidential federal government information for commercial gain. The NSW finance minister, Courtney Houssos, will promise the government would \u201ctoughen our regime\u201d against bad actors. The state\u2019s auditor general, Margaret Crawford, will appear before the inquiry on Thursday after publishing a report in March that found the government had spent around $1bn on consultants between 2017 and 2022. Spending on consultants within the state\u2019s local health districts, totalling at least $124m over 12 years, will also be an initial focus of the inquiry. In her report, Crawford noted local health districts were not required to produce annual reports and the department did not include their consulting expenditure in its annual report. She estimated about $89m on consultants had been spent in the five years to 2022. \u201cThere is no legislative requirement for local health districts and some other entities in the health cluster, besides the ministry of health, to publish individual annual reports,\u201d the report read. \u201cAs a result, itemised spending and other information on the use of consultants, estimated at over $89 million over the five-year period, are not included in any public reporting.\u201d Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Using data from annual reports, Guardian Australia can reveal local health districts spent even more than Crawford outlined. Audit reports from each of the districts reveal a spend of at least $124m since 2011, with at least four of the areas spending more than $10m each. The inquiry\u2019s chair, Abigail Boyd, said there were serious questions about the way the districts were set up and why they were not subject to stricter reporting requirements. \u201cThere seems to be a lot of consultants who have worked in or are still working across those boards but also within NSW Health,\u201d she said. \u201cIt raises questions \u2026 as to what\u2019s going on in those local health districts and whether that is actually a good use of public money.\u201d In 2011, the government and department reconfigured the state\u2019s health service with the addition of local districts. Multiple consultancy firms were commissioned to advise the department on how it should restructure, and that advice is now cabinet in confidence and restricted. The government established 15 districts \u2013 eight for metropolitan areas and seven in rural and regional locations. The health minister, Ryan Park, said the focus of the inquiry was \u201cabout ensuring we spend precious taxpayer dollars where they are needed so that we can deliver the essential health services our community needs\u201d. Consultants were employed after considerations of \u201ccost, quality, capability and capacity\u201d, according to a department spokesperson. \u201cNSW Health uses consultants strategically in a way that delivers value for money and supports the NSW public service,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cNSW Health primarily uses consultants when they bring specialist expertise on matters that are outside the normal work of the organisation, or when they provide additional resources to augment the internal team to work on issues that are critical and time-sensitive.\u201d The frequent use of consultants by governments at all levels in Australia has come under scrutiny over the past week after it was revealed PwC used confidential Australian government tax information for commercial gain. On the back of the revelations, the state government met with PwC to discuss their use of the firm.

But they couldn\u2019t help feeling like someone was missing. \u201cIt\u2019s times like that when you think she should be here,\u201d Ange says of their daughter Carmen, the birthday girl\u2019s late aunt. The Mahers lost Carmen 27 years ago in a road accident near Bendigo. Fatigued, Carmen fell asleep at the wheel and crashed into a tree. She was 18. The moments after the crash remain as vivid in the Mahers\u2019 minds as when it happened almost three decades ago. \u201cWe were home waiting for Carmen when we saw a police car drive up our driveway and a young policeman got out. He was crying so much,\u201d John says. \u201cOur eldest daughter Michelle had gone into town to work and was third on the scene of the crash. She stepped out the back seat of the police car with tears streaming down her face and I\u2019ll never forget what she said: \u2018Dad. Carmen\u2019s dead.\u2019\u201d John Maher is the founder of Carmen\u2019s Road Safety, an organisation that educates people about road safety and the effects of road trauma on loved ones. It was launched two years after Carmen\u2019s death when four youths died in a car accident in Eaglehawk, Victoria. \u201cThat was the catalyst for me to stop feeling sorry for myself and start thinking about what I could do to help other parents never go through what we now live with,\u201d John says. After speaking at five regional schools in his first year, Maher now visits up to 70 schools and other events each year in regional communities and cities across Australia. \u201cWhen I started giving talks at schools, Carmen became part of everybody\u2019s lives. She is empowering them to be safer road users,\u201d he says.

Last month, four people, including three teenagers, were killed in a car crash in Bochara near Hamilton, 300km west of Melbourne, after their car lost control and hit a tree. Maher regularly presents at schools in Hamilton including Baimbridge College, which was affected by the Bochara tragedy. He says the entire community is \u201cabsolutely devastated\u201d. \u201cA community like this is interlinked. If this tragedy affects a child, it affects the family, it affects the next-door neighbour, and it grows and it becomes a community that is affected by tragedy. \u201cThat tragedy grows to become support.\u201d The Southern Grampians Shire Council chief executive officer, Tony Doyle, says the crash has deeply affected the community but also galvanised a \u201cgenerosity of spirit\u201d, with people keen \u201cto contribute in any way possible\u201d. \u201cPeople in smaller communities are more familiar with each other in their surroundings, such as schools, communities, workplace, sport and community activities,\u201d Doyle says. \u201cIn many instances, local history connects generations of people. So even when people do not know the person directly they may know other family members or know of them through local narratives and stories that connect them as a community.\u201d Doyle says a multi-agency support and counselling response has been put in place for students, families and those who are dealing with the Hamilton crash. \u201cWhen tragedies like this happen it can ripple across whole sections of the community. Many people in Hamilton would know or know of the young people who died in the accident and their families,\u201d Doyle says. \u2018More needs to be done\u2019 The Victorian road toll as of 12 June was 143, up 34.9% on the previous year. \u201cNow that\u2019s just criminal,\u201d Maher says. While \u201csafety\u201d is taught in Victorian schools as part of the health and physical education curriculum, Maher is lobbying for a mandatory road safety subject in all schools. Having published a book about the impact of road trauma last year, he is applying for funding for it to be used as an educational tool in every year 10 classroom in Victoria. He says spending billions of dollars on road infrastructure, transport and safety is not enough to reduce the road toll. \u201cIf we don\u2019t change what\u2019s happening right now, which is very little education, we can expect more of the same on our roads. Someone has to be brave enough to make the decision to educate our future road users,\u201d Maher says. Ballarat mayor Des Hudson has spent years as the Victoria police youth resource officer delivering road safety and other community safety education programs including Fit2Drive. He says more needs to be done to \u201ctarget harden our young kids and new drivers\u201d and that all schools should deliver compulsory road safety programs. \u201cFactors such as open roads, darkness and oncoming vehicle glare, combined with driver inexperience all contribute to the increased road toll on regional and rural roads. It\u2019s a sad reality,\u201d Hudson says. \u201cWe need more education to give kids the ability to think more deeply about driving. Ultimately it comes down to the attitude of the individual. They might think that they\u2019re bulletproof but that\u2019s not the case.\u201d In 2021, 1,116 people died on Australian roads. Sixty-five per cent were from regional and remote communities, and more than 40% were aged between 17 and 39. The Australian National University reported the estimated cost of a fatal crash between 2016 and 2020 to be $3.2m. Maher says young people need to think seriously about the repercussions of driving dangerously before taking to the road. \u201cWhen something as traumatic as [a road fatality] takes place, it\u2019s going to devastate the whole area for so long. \u201cThink of what it will do to your family and your friends should you be seriously injured or lose your life on the roads, because in fact Carmen was the lucky one in our life. We\u2019re the ones who have lived without her for 27 years.\u201d Dellaram Vreeland is a freelance journalist based in Ballarat, Victoria.

Albanese will make the remarks at the National Museum on Thursday at a ceremony with Howard and Walter Mikac, who lost his wife and two daughters at Port Arthur. The ceremony will mark correspondence between Mikac and Howard entering the museum\u2019s collection. Albanese describes Mikac\u2019s first letter \u201cin ordinary blue Biro, on foolscap paper\u201d \u2013 dated 7 May 1996, nine days after the massacre \u2013 as \u201cone of the most extraordinary things I have ever read\u201d. \u201cThe opening sentence alone stands as a monument to the grace and bravery of a truly great Australian,\u201d Albanese says in an advance copy of the speech.

In December the fatal shooting of two Queensland police officers and a neighbour in Wieambilla renewed calls for a national firearm register more than three decades after it was first proposed. A national register would allow officers in any location in Australia to access the same information in real time, thereby determining if a person holds an interstate gun licence. It would help track guns and gun owners across the country. In April police ministers agreed to launch public consultation for the register before a decision by national cabinet in mid-2023. On 9 June police ministers met again in Brisbane, agreeing unanimously on options to be put to national cabinet. Mikac said after the deaths of his wife and daughters he felt \u201cpowerless and in deep grief\u201d but he was compelled to take action. \u201cWriting to prime minister John Howard was the logical choice. If our gun safety was going to change it had to come from the top. \u201cThese letters demonstrate the power of what one positive decision in a time of trauma and senselessness can achieve.\u201d In 1997 Mikac and a group of volunteers established the Alannah &amp; Madeline Foundation in honour of his young daughters. Howard, the inaugural patron of the foundation, said: \u201cWalter Mikac honoured the memory of his beloved wife and two little daughters, so tragically taken from him, by finding the courage to rebuild his life without them.\u201d"}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e7012e", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/14/covid-testing-was-a-weakness-in-early-pandemic-response-dhsc-tells-inquiry", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "subCategories": [], "title": "Covid testing was a weakness in early pandemic response, DHSC tells inquiry", "lead": "Health department and Cabinet Office make opening statements on second day of first module", "author": "Robert Booth Social affairs correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-06-14T14:53:25Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.294064", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/6ab7eb2b5ad2ba75f2b50214330fc58e2524c9e7/0_111_3400_2040/500.jpg", "body": "The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) has admitted Covid testing was \u201ca significant weakness\u201d in the UK\u2019s early pandemic response and stressed the need for proper funding to prepare the nation for the next emergency. While the DHSC said it would not claim \u201cit did everything right\u201d, its opening statement to the UK Covid public inquiry highlighted wider government choices on funding in what will be seen as turning the focus on Downing Street and the Treasury. \u201cWe need to be prepared for the worst by maintaining the resources and core capabilities that underpin a resilient health and care system and a healthy population,\u201d said Fiona Scolding KC, representing the DHSC. \u201cThe department is well aware that many will argue that extra resources in health and care is part of the answer to improve pandemic preparedness,\u201d she said. Meanwhile, the Cabinet Office \u2013 whose ministers include the prime minister and which leads UK-wide emergency preparedness \u2013 stressed in its opening statement that \u201chealth sector preparedness was managed by the DHSC\u201d. The Government Office for Science (GOS), which includes the chief scientific adviser, told the inquiry that the absence of a major domestic diagnostic industry and the difficulty of scaling test manufacturing was a \u201cnational weakness\u201d that led to vulnerability. An acute shortage of tests and laboratory capacity early in the pandemic meant it was not possible to test staff and residents in care homes, probably resulting in the seeding of fatal outbreaks. In the six weeks to 11 March 2020, the UK performed fewer than 30,000 Covid tests. In mid-March 2020, Germany was testing 50,000 people a day. GOS, which convenes the independent Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), also stressed the impact of historical funding decisions. \u201cChallenges in scaling and operations for public health infrastructure raise questions about the investments made in that system in preceding years and whether it had responded effectively to previous threats,\u201d said Matthew Hill, representing GOS. The statements came on the second day of the inquiry\u2019s opening module, which is examining the UK\u2019s preparedness for the pandemic, which claimed at least 226,977 lives in the UK. On Tuesday, lawyers for the bereaved accused UK leaders of presiding over a \u201ccarousel of chaos\u201d and it emerged that planning for a no-deal Brexit \u201ccrowded out\u201d pandemic preparations. \u201cIt is right to remember that this was a global pandemic,\u201d said James Strachan KC, representing the Cabinet Office. \u201cAnd each government had to make extremely difficult choices in mitigating the suffering and hardship caused to its citizens.\u201d The DHSC cited the need for an expansion in laboratories, sustainable occupancy levels in hospital beds and safe staffing, a high level of social care resilience and \u201ca workforce with the experience and numbers to cope\u201d, despite the department recently delaying publication of a long-awaited NHS workforce strategy. It addressed public divisions over its key decisions such as lockdowns, saying it \u201crecognises the strength of feeling amongst some that certain of the decisions made by us were wrong\u201d. Scolding said: \u201cSome people feel that lockdown should have been introduced earlier and for longer, others hold an opposite and contrary view.\u201d She said the department faced \u201ca series of hugely unpalatable options\u201d and \u201cdecisions were often extremely finely balanced\u201d. Sage was a key voice in lockdown decisions but its lawyer, Hill, said neither it nor government chief scientific advisers had a monopoly on science advice. \u201cThey provide evidence and advice to policymakers who weigh it against other sources of evidence and advice, economic, legal, ethical, political and on occasion national security advice, in order for policy decisions to be made \u2026 elected politicians make those decisions and are accountable to the electorate.\u201d The inquiry continues."}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e7012f", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/14/edinburgh-book-festival-hoping-greta-thunberg-bring-back-audiences", "primaryCategory": "books", "subCategories": [], "title": "Edinburgh book festival hoping Greta Thunberg will bring back audiences", "lead": "Fallout from Covid crisis has left event struggling financially after last year\u2019s \u2018traumatic\u2019 fall in sales", "author": "Severin Carrell Scotland editor", "datePublished": "2023-06-14T14:47:30Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.294075", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/96a7481434bb0d197f3606148ac846a0134f1dcd/269_324_2190_1314/500.jpg", "body": "The Edinburgh International book festival hopes a swathe of Booker prize winners, political leaders and a guest appearance by Greta Thunberg will help restore its finances after a \u201ctraumatic\u201d fall in sales last year. The world\u2019s largest book festival celebrates its 40th anniversary in August with events featuring Katr\u00edn Jakobsd\u00f3ttir, the Icelandic prime minister, the former Booker prize winners Ben Okri and Anne Enright, and the International Booker winners Georgi Gospodinov and David Diop. Thunberg is speaking at the 3,000-seat Playhouse theatre to discuss her appeal for climate action, It\u2019s Not Too Late to Change the World, as part of a series of \u201cclimate positive\u201d events at this year\u2019s festival. The festival has been forced into a series of emergency fundraising and cost-cutting measures after it miscalculated the continuing impact of the Covid crisis on its audiences last year. Nick Barley, who is curating his last book festival after 14 years in charge, said ticket sales last August were well below forecasts. The day before it opened, Salman Rushdie was attacked at an event in New York state, there were bin strikes in Edinburgh and rail strikes heavily cutting services. The fall in ticket sales forced Barley to appeal to private donors to ensure the event met its debts, while laying off seven members of staff, cutting its programming and dropping its previous collaborations with theatre companies to ensure it could break even. The festival has also contracted out its bookshop, a mainstay of its tented village in the city\u2019s New Town, to Waterstones as a cost-saving measure. \u201cIt was traumatic,\u201d Barley said. \u201cSo to make sure that the 2023 budget stacks up, we had to be very, very draconian in our budgeting. Which was tough.\u201d This year\u2019s festival will still feature nearly 600 events involving 470 authors and opinion formers, Barley said. They will include three authors who appeared at the first book festival in 1983: Michael Rosen, Alistair Moffat and AN Wilson. That is considerably less than the 900 events it staged in 2019, the year before the Covid crisis led to all of Edinburgh\u2019s festivals shutting down in 2020. The fringe and international festivals are also smaller this year. Even so, Barley is optimistic. He said: \u201cAll of the evidence seems to be that we will sell more tickets this year. And therefore if we do, the book festival will make a good surplus this year, to further build its reserves.\u201d Despite decisions by the fringe and international festivals to heavily curtail their online output, about 100 book festival events will be shown live online. Barley said streaming had significantly expanded its reach globally and its social demographics, enabling many people unable to reach Edinburgh or afford tickets to watch events. \u201cI think it\u2019ll be reckless of us to throw that away,\u201d he said. The festival left its traditional Charlotte Square venue in 2021 for Edinburgh College of Art due to the significant cost uncertainties during the Covid crisis. It moves next year to a new permanent venue hosted by the University of Edinburgh at its Futures Institute, adjacent to the city\u2019s busiest fringe venues \u2013 which is expected to allow it to significantly expand. Tickets for this year\u2019s event, which runs from 12 to 28 August, go on sale on 29 June."}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e70130", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2023/jun/14/uk-gdp-economy-april-growth-recession-us-federal-reserve-interest-rates-business-live", "primaryCategory": "business", "subCategories": [], "title": "Pound hits one-year high as City expects more interest rate hikes; WE Soda cancels London float \u2013 as it happened", "lead": "UK economy has bounced back from March\u2019s contraction, but experts fear rising interest rates will cause recession", "author": "Graeme Wearden", "datePublished": "2023-06-14T14:43:38Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.294084", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/b937b7957d3342bbd0ceee6bbf932208c24b21f1/0_43_3541_2124/500.jpg", "body": "Time for a recap\u2026. Britain\u2019s economy has returned to growth, after stumbling in March\u2019s bad weather. UK GDP expanded by 0.2% in April, driven by the services sector as consumer-focused companies such as pubs and bars saw more business. Expectations that UK interest rates could head steadily higher this year have lifted the pound to a one-year high against the US dollar. Jeremy Hunt has said the UK has no alternative but to raise interest rates to bring down inflation , as households brace for the Bank of England to increase borrowing costs further next week. Vodafone and the owner of Three have agreed a deal to merge their British telecoms networks in a move that will create the UK\u2019s largest mobile phone operator\u2026 but unions are urging ministers to block the deal. WE Soda, the world\u2019s largest natural soda-ash producer has abandoned plans to float in London, and blamed extreme caution among City investors. The worldwide peak in demand for oil is \u201cin sight\u201d and could come before the end of this decade, the global energy watchdog has said. The forecast came as Shell has abandoned plans to cut oil production each year for the rest of the decade\u2026 In other news\u2026 The EU has ordered Google to sell part of its advertising business, as the bloc\u2019s competition regulator steps up its enforcement of big tech\u2019s monopolies.

The maker of Pyrex kitchenware and the Instant Pot pressure cooker has filed for bankruptcy protection, blaming rising interest rates for its financial difficulties. Workers at Amazon\u2019s Coventry warehouse have voted to take a further six months of strike action, despite failing to win formal union recognition from the tech company. A report has discovered evidence that Amazon has ramped up fees and advertising costs for sellers.

And ower supplier E.ON Next has been ordered to pay \u00a35m in compensation to consumers for poor customer services, the energy watchdog for Great Britain has announced. Newsflash: The world\u2019s largest natural soda-ash producer has abandoned plans to float in London, and blamed extreme caution among City investors. WE Soda has just announced it has decided to cancel its proposed IPO on the London Stock Exchange, which had been expected to value the company at up to $8bn. Alasdair Warren, CEO of WE Soda said: \u201cSince our intention to float announcement some weeks ago, we had been encouraged by the breadth of investor engagement globally and the subsequent interest from prospective investors in our IPO. WE Soda is the largest and fastest growing producer of natural soda ash and one of the lowest cost producers of soda ash in the world. We are a leader within our industry, not only in terms of scale, but also in terms of innovation and sustainability. \u201cDespite this, the reality is that investors, particularly in the UK, remain extremely cautious about the IPO market and this extreme investor caution in London meant that we were unable to arrive at a valuation that we believe reflects our unique financial and operating characteristics. \u201cAs a result, we have decided to cancel our IPO on the London Stock Exchange. Notwithstanding this decision, our strategic priorities remain the same - our relentless focus on sustainability and safety, delivering on our growth projects in Turkey and the US.\u201d WE Soda\u2019s plan to float in the UK had been hailed as a boost to the City, so this is obviously a blow to London. Parliament\u2019s Treasury Commitee are quizzing the UK\u2019s financial regulator, over its supervision of Odey Asset Management. MPs have sent the Financial Conduct Authority 13 questions, following allegations against founder Crispin Odey of sexual misconduct against junior female members of staff. Questions include: What has been the nature and intensity of your supervision and engagement with Odey Asset Management over the last five years? To what extent has that engagement been driven by the allegations such as those in the Financial Times article? Given the very serious conduct allegations raised by the FT, has the FCA expanded any ongoing work into this matter? Have any attempts been made to seek further evidence from Mr Odey, Odey Asset Management or persons who have worked with Mr Odey? and: The FT today reported that Mr Odey threatened to sue the FCA over its investigation. Do you recognise that report? To what extent does the FCA take into account the litigiousness of the subject of an investigation in determining its approach? Were further resources required by any FCA investigation in the face of that threat? Odey, 64, claimed last week the FT report was a \u201crehash\u201d of previous reporting, and said the allegations within it were either untrue, or that his relations with women had at the time been \u201cconsensual\u201d. Odey was forced out of OAM last weekend. Harriett Baldwin MP, Chair of the Treasury Committee, says the committee is concerned about the experiences of women in the financial sector, and its culture: \u201cCulture in financial services, and the experiences of women in the industry, are ongoing concerns of the Treasury Committee. Journalists at the Financial Times have shone a light on deeply troubling allegations of conduct regarding the actions of a powerful individual. We look forward to receiving a response from the financial regulator on these important issues.\u201d The pound has just hit a new one-year high against the US dollar. Expectations that UK interest rates will keep climbing to fight inflation have lifted sterling to $1.269 against the dollar, the highest level since April 2022. Traders are betting that the Bank of England will continue to raise UK interest rates, from 4.5% today to perhaps 5.75% by the end of this year. The US Federal Reserve, though, could be close to pausing its rate hikes after inflation fell to 4% in May \u2013 just half as fast as the UK\u2019s 8.7% inflation rate in April. Today\u2019s US PPI data, showing easing prices pressures, has weakened the dollar, with traders betting the Fed will pause its rate increases tonight. This morning\u2019s GDP report, showing the UK returned to growth, could embolden the BoE to keep hiking UK borrowing costs when its Monetary Policy Committee meets next week. Analysts at Nomura predict the Bank will lift UK rates by a quarter-point, to 4.75%, at the June meeting, in a split decison. We expect the BoE to raise rates by 25bp at next week\u2019s meeting, then again in August and September. This week\u2019s strong labour market report reduces the likelihood of the Bank doing nothing in June, and raises the risk of 50bp. Indeed, markets are pricing a two-thirds chance of a 50bp rise at some point between now and September. At next week\u2019s meeting we would not be surprised to see a three-way split in the voting \u2013 two for no change, six for +25bp and one member for +50bp. Today\u2019s drop in US producer price inflation takes some pressure off the US Federal reserve, which is setting interest rates today (7pm UK time). Just in: The price rises charged by goods makers and services providers in the US has slowed, a sign that America\u2019s inflation problem is easing. The Producer Price Index for final demand fell by 0.3 percent in May, data just released shows. This was due to a 1.6% drop in prices charged for \u2018final demand goods\u2019, such as energy, while services prices rose 0.2% in the month. The report says: Sixty percent of the May decline in the index for final demand goods can be traced to a 13.8-percent drop in prices for gasoline. The indexes for diesel fuel, chicken eggs, jet fuel, fresh and dry vegetables, and iron and steel scrap also fell. Conversely, prices for tobacco products advanced 1.7 percent. On an annual basis, prices for final demand rose by 1.1% in the 12 months to May, down from 2.3% in the year to April, as inflationary pressures eased. A year ago, producers were hiking their prices by 11%, year-on-year, fuelling consumer inflation. Core PPI (which strips out foods, energy, and trade and is closely watched by US central bankers) was unchanged in May. The annual rate of PPI core inflation dropped to 2.8%. down from 3.3% in April. The Unite union are urging the government to block the merger of Vodafone and Three in the UK, calling it \u2018reckless\u2019. Gail Cartmail, executive head of operations for Unite said: \u201cThis deal will give a company with deep ties to the Chinese state an even more prominent place at the heart of the UK\u2019s telecommunications infrastructure. On top of that, it will hike people\u2019s bills and mean job losses for Vodafone and Three workers. The government must step in and stop this reckless merger and Unite is building a cross-party coalition to demand they do so.\u201d Three\u2019s owner, CK Hutchison Group Telecom, is based in Hong Kong. It launched the Uk\u2019s first 3G network around 20 years ago. The British economy is not in a wage-price spiral, a spokesman for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has told reporters in Westminster. Asked if the economy was in a wage-price spiral, the spokesman said: \u201cNo. I think what we have seen, and as the chancellor has said, the economy is showing resilience. \u201cWe are conscious about the potential for wage-price spirals and, of course, that is why we are making the difficult decisions when it comes to public-sector pay, and it is important we maintain that discipline.\u201d Yesterday\u2019s unemployment report showed regular pay rose by 7.2% per year in February-April, meaning a smaller fall in real pay (after inflation). Fears of a wage-price spiral have haunted the Bank of England for months, with policymakers fretting about so-called \u2018second round effects\u2019 (where firms hike prices to pay for higher wages, keeping inflation high). Over in parliament, the Treasury Committee has given its approval for economist Megan Greene to join the Bank of England\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) next month. Following a pre-appointment hearing yesterday, MPs say they are satisfied that Greene has the appropriate professional competence and personal independence for the role. During the hearing, Greene warned that bringing inflation all the way down to the 2% target (from 8.7% in April) will be tough, saying: \u201cI think that there is some underlying persistence and so getting from 10% to 5% ... is probably easier than getting from 5% to 2%.\u201d MPs do not have the power to block roles at the Bank, but their views do carry weight \u2013 as in 2016, when newly-appointed deputy governor Charlotte Hogg resigned following a critical report, after failing to disclose that her brother works for Barclays. Alphabet, which owns Google, says it disagrees with the EU\u2019s antitrust charge (see previous post). Dan Taylor, Google\u2019s vice-president of global ads, says: \u201cThe Commission\u2019s investigation focuses on a narrow aspect of our advertising business and is not new. We disagree with the EC\u2019s view.\u201d Newsflash: European antitrust regulators have hit Google with fresh charges of anti-competitive practices in its digital advertising business. The European Commission accuses Google of favouring its own online display advertising technology services, at the expense of rivals, which hurts online advertisers and publishers. The EC has set out its charges in a statement of objections, two years after it opened an investigation into the case. It suggests that Google may need to sell part of its online advertising business, saying: \u201cThe Commission\u2019s preliminary view is therefore that only the mandatory divestment by Google of part of its services would address its competition concerns.\u201d Ernest Doku, telecoms expert at Uswitch.com says there are potential pros and cons for consumers from the Vodafone-Three merger. Consolidation in the UK market - reducing four Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) down to three - brings a risk of reduced competition and subsequent increased prices, Doku explains. Doku adds: \u201cAt a time when millions across the UK are facing the highest mid-contract prices we\u2019ve ever seen, consumers need assurances that this merger will not result in even higher household bills. The pledge of a significant investment in 5G over the next decade is some solace that they will be building for a better future of connectivity, so long as it is adhered to. What we don\u2019t want to see is customers footing the bill with further increases to pricing. \u201cThey should also commit to ensuring smaller virtual networks (MVNOs) who rely on Three and Vodafone\u2019s infrastructure can continue to offer competitive value and service. \u201cAlso, while the cost saving benefits for Vodafone and Hutchinson are clear, the merged company needs to ensure it delivers an upside for consumers \u2013 specifically, its promise of innovation and an advanced standalone 5G network.\u201d Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, suggests getting regulatory approval for the Vodafone-Three merger \u201ccould be a tall order\u201d given the likely concerns over diminished competition and consumer choice. She explains: In 2016, the UK and European regulators blocked a takeover of O2 by Three, citing concerns about higher prices. However, Vodafone\u2019s new CEO Margherita Della Valle insists this deal will be \u2018great for competition.\u2019 Shares in Vodafone have jumped following the announcement reflecting the excitement among investors about the benefits of this tie-up after longstanding talks since last year. This is likely to be Della Valle\u2019s biggest accomplishment in the top job so far if the deal crosses the line. Investors have fallen out of favour with Vodafone lately with shares down 40% over the past 12 months even after today\u2019s jump, Scholar adds: The FTSE 100 telecoms business has been grappling with intense competition in Europe\u2019s largest economy, Germany where subscribers are falling, and services revenue is under pressure. It has also been having a tough time in Spain and Italy where mobile phone competition is fierce. On top of that, like many businesses, Vodafone has been facing pressures from inflation, particularly energy bills which are driving up costs and make profitability more of a challenge. As a result, Vodafone has been targeted by activist investors such as French telecoms billionaire Xavier Niel who has been arguing for consolidation. Perhaps this deal could reinvigorate Vodafone\u2019s bull case amid hopes that the combined entity will benefit from its increased force in the sector and economies of scale to fend off competition.\u201d The UK\u2019s competition watchdog, the Competition and Markets Authority, will judge whether the Vodadone-Three deal can complete, says James Robinson, senior analyst at research group Assembly. Robinson says the climate \u201cfeels less hostile\u201d than when a merger between O2 and Three was blocked in 2016 by the CMA and Ofcom. Last year, Ofcom dropped its long-held belief that a merger between any of the UK\u2019s big four mobile operators should be blocked at all costs. Robinson writes: \u201cWhile the CMA has remained tight-lipped, DSIT and Ofcom have publicly expressed their openness to consolidation, recognising the challenging financial state of both operators, the investment required for 5G, the need for more resilient networks and the emerging competitive pressure from big tech. \u201cWith the Government\u2019s recent Wireless Infrastructure Strategy, the merger announcement, with its commitment to investment and jobs, comes at an opportune moment. Together, Three and Vodafone would be better equipped to deliver ultrafast, reliable and secure mobile connectivity throughout the UK \u2013 the exact thing the Government\u2019s pro-investment strategy wants to see. \u201cThe CMA will be the decision-maker on the deal. Though the parties have made a strong case, the competition authority\u2019s review will soon reveal how well their arguments have landed. Its assessment is likely to focus on spectrum holdings, networking sharing agreements, access for MVNOs and retail prices for consumers. \u201cA combined Three/Vodafone will face calls from rivals to give up some of its enviable 5G spectrum holding. As divestment is a fairly standard mobile merger remedy, that shouldn\u2019t be a barrier to getting the deal through. Neither should network sharing, with competition issues relating to existing agreements easier to overcome than in the past. Vodafone and CK Hutchison also argue that the merger will be good for the UK, saying: The combined business will invest \u00a311 billion in the UK over ten years to create one of Europe\u2019s most advanced standalone 5G networks, in full support of UK Government targets. By having a best-in-class 5G network in place sooner, the merger will deliver up to \u00a35 billion per year in economic benefit by 2030, create jobs and support digital transformation of the UK\u2019s businesses. Every school and hospital in the UK will have access to standalone 5G by 2030. The merger of Vodafone and Three\u2019s UK networks is expected to close before the end of 2024, subject to regulatory and shareholder approvals. No cash is involved. The two sides are contributing different amounts of debt to the merged company, though, to achieve a 51:49 split between Vodafone and CKHGT. Shares in Vodafone have jumped to the top of the FTSE 100 leaderboard, up 4%, after the merger with Three was announced. Newsflash: A long-awaited merge between mobile phone networks Vodafone UK and Three UK has just been announced. Vodafone Group and CK Hutchison Group Telecom Holdings, which owns Three, have agreed a deal to merge their UK telecommunication businesses. Vodafone will own 51% of the combined business, with CKHGT holding 49%. The merger will create Britain\u2019s biggest mobile operator, analysts say, overtaking BT\u2019s (BT.L) EE and VM O2. Margherita Della Valle, Vodafone Group chief executive, says the merger is: \u201cgreat for customers, great for the country and great for competition.\u201d The two companies have been negotiating the merger for some weeks. They say the deal will mean customers of Vodafone UK and Three UK will get \u201ca better network experience\u201d with greater coverage and reliability at no extra cost. This will include: \u2026 certain flexible, contract-free offers with no annual price increases, and social tariffs. The combined company will reach more than 99% of the UK population with its 5G standalone network, \u201cdelivering to customers up to a six-fold increase in average data speeds by 2034\u201d. Canning Fok, Group Co-Managing Director of CK Hutchison, adds that the deal will help rollout a faster mobile network, explaining: Three UK and Vodafone UK currently lack the necessary scale on their own to earn their cost of capital. This has long been a challenge for Three UK\u2019s ability to invest and compete. Together, we will have the scale needed to deliver a best-in-class 5G network for the UK, transforming mobile services for our customers and opening up new opportunities for businesses across the length and breadth of the UK. Jeremy Hunt has said there is \u201cno alternative\u201d but to hike interest rates in a bid to tackle rising prices, the BBC reports. He also urged support for the Bank of England as it tries to squeeze out inflation. It\u2019s notable that Hunt (correctly) identifies that keeping inflation at target is the Bank\u2019s mission, given the government has set itself a target of halving the pace of price rises by the end of the year\u2026. Jeremy Hunt can claim that the UK is in a very different situation than last autumn (see earlier post), but the surge in borrowing costs is still politically very damaging, as it proved for Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng. Lord Nick Macpherson, a former permanent secretary (top civil servant) to the Treasury, has written an interesting thread about the surge in the UK\u2019s two-year borrowing costs yesterday. Macpherson, a Treasury veteran, says he can\u2019t remember a time when interest rates were rising steeply just 18 months before an election (or possibly sooner). He fears that the Bank of England will raise rates to a level where a recession next year becomes inevitable. Back in the City, sterling has hit a one-month high against the US dollar this morning, as investors anticipate higher UK interest rates. The pound has hit $1.264 this morning, the highest since 10th May. Jack Sirett, partner at global financial services firm Ebury, says today\u2019s GDP report has also helped the pound. \u201cPersistent inflation and higher interest rates continue to constrain the UK economy, yet April marked a welcome return to growth. The likelihood of recession continues to fade which should give the pound a boost. \u201cThe GDP print follows hot on the heels of data showing wages rising at their fastest rate in 20 years outside of the pandemic. It builds into the expectation that not only will the Bank of England be forced into yet another hike next week, but that the peak base rate could reach well above 5%.\u201d You can read the IEA\u2019s new forecasts for the oil industry here: IEA: Growth in global oil demand is set to slow significantly by 2028 Maybe Shell\u2019s new CEO, Wael Sawan, should take a look. This morning, Shell revealed it had abandoned plans to cut oil production each year for the rest of the decade, in a shift in approach to firmly target fossil fuels and increase payouts to shareholders. Instead, Shell now intends to stabilise liquids production to 2030, to achieve \u201ccash flow longevity\u201d. Shell, though, denies it has ditched its plans, as my colleague Jasper Jolly explains: It said that it had in fact hit the target within seven months of announcing it because of the $9.5bn sale later in 2021 of its interest in an oil project in the Permian Basin, Texas. Shell\u2019s output was 1.9m barrels of oil a day in 2019, and dropped to 1.5m barrels a day \u2013 a 21% decline. A Shell spokesperson: \u201cOur target of a reduction in oil production by 2030 has not changed. We\u2019ve just met it eight years early.\u201d Environmental scientist Angela Terry of One Home, which helps UK households adapt to a low cost, low carbon lifestyle, has welcomed the IEA\u2019s forecast that peak oil demand is close: Here\u2019s Dr Simon Evans of Carbon Brief on today\u2019s forecasts: Newsflash: Growth in global oil demand is set to slow significantly by 2028, with a peak in demand in sight before the end of the decade. That\u2019s the verdict from the International Energy Agency, in a new \u2018medium-term report\u2019. It predicts that the use of oil for transport will go into decline after 2026, due to increased take-up of electric vehicles, the growth of biofuels and improving fuel economy reduce consumption. Overall consumption is expected to be supported by strong petrochemicals demand, though, the IEA adds. It forecats that growth in the world\u2019s demand for oil is \u201cset to slow almost to a halt in the coming years\u201d. High prices, and concerns about security of supply following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, will speed the shift towards cleaner energy technologies, they say. The IEA predicts that global oil demand will rise by 6% between 2022 and 2028 to reach 105.7 million barrels per day (mb/d), due to \u201crobust demand\u201d from the petrochemical and aviation sectors. But annual demand growth is expected to shrivel from 2.4 million barrels per day this year, to just 0.4 mb/d in 2028, putting \u201ca peak in demand in sight\u201d. The report also predicts that demand growth in China is forecast to slows markedly from 2024 onwards, as the rebound in demand after the pandemic fades. IEA executive director Fatih Birol says: \u201cThe shift to a clean energy economy is picking up pace, with a peak in global oil demand in sight before the end of this decade as electric vehicles, energy efficiency and other technologies advance,\u201d said Birol adds that oil producers need to pay \u201ccareful attention to the gathering pace of change\u201d and calibrate their investment decisions accordingly, to \u201censure an orderly transition.\u201d British finance minister Jeremy Hunt has said the UK was in a very different situation on borrowing costs compared to last Autumn, when the mini-budget spooked the markets. Speaking after the cost of UK short-term borrowing surged to 15-year highs yesterday, Hunt told reporters: \u201cWe are in a very different situation to where we were last autumn.\u201d The yield (or interest rate) on two-year UK government bonds climbed to nearly 4.9% this morning, the highest since 2008. That adds to its surge yesterday, when rising wages fuelled forecasts that the Bank of England will hike interest rates several more times to fight inflation. Last autumn, the bond market was rocked by the unfunded tax cuts in Kwasi Kwarteng\u2019s mini-budget \u2013 which Hunt reversed upon taking office. The BBC\u2019s Faisal Islam has more details from Hunt: UK GDP is likely to have been weak in May, due to the extra bank holiday for the coronation, and strikes in the health and education sectors, other parts of the civil service, and on the rail network, says Martin Beck, chief economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club. Beck adds: The likelihood of a weak May for GDP means the EY ITEM Club expects output to be flat or fall slightly in Q2 as a whole, before a firm recovery in Q3. But the EY ITEM Club thinks the recovery will struggle to gain momentum thereafter, given the strong headwinds from still-high inflation and the lagged effects of tighter monetary policy.\u201d Britain\u2019s construction sector was hit by a drop in new housebuilding in April. Today\u2019s GDP report shows that new work in the construction sector fell by 1.0%. The ONS adds: At the sector level, the main contributors to the monthly decrease were seen in private housing repair and maintenance and private housing new work, which decreased 5.7% and 3.0%, respectively. Britain\u2019s housebuilders have already warned they are cutting back on the construction of new homes, as rising mortgage rates worried potential buyers\u2026 Eight of the 13 sub-sectors within UK manufacturing shrank in April, today\u2019s GDP report shows. The pharmaceuticals sector\u2019s output dropped by 5%, followed by manufacturing of computer, electronic and optical products, which fell by 3.8%. Households and businesses still face a difficult few months, despite the rebound in activity in April, says Ben Jones, lead economist at CBI Economics. Jones says the outlook is \u201cbrightening a little\u201d, with inflation having peaked, wholesale energy prices normalising and labour supply slowly improving. Jones adds: Inflation is coming down, but more slowly than expected, with interest rates set to rise a little higher. The combination of high inflation and rising debt service costs will constrain consumer cash-flow and dampen the housing market. The resurgence in activity in April is unlikely to last, fears Capital Economics. Ruth Gregory, their deputy chief UK economist, explains how a reduction in industrial action on the railways helped the economy to return to growth in April, by 0.2%. Some of the strength in April was due to fewer strikes by train workers in that month. Transport output rose by 0.5% m/m after the 1.7% m/m drop in March. As such, the rise was strongest in services output, which increased by 0.3% m/m after falling by 0.5% m/m in March. Equally, though some of the falls in activity in other areas in April were probably temporary too. Strikes by junior doctors and civil servants probably contributed to the fall in health output (0.9% m/m) and the subdued 0.1% m/m in public administration. But, high interest rates could pull the economy into recession, Gregory warns: We estimate that by the end of Q2 2023 less than 40% of the drag will have been felt and that more than 60% lies ahead. And we think interest rates need to rise further to quash inflation, from 4.50% now to a peak of 5.25%. That\u2019s why we still think a recession is on its way in the second half of this year. April\u2019s growth was probably not repeated in May, warns Suren Thiru, economics director at ICAEW (Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales). Thiru points out that bad weather hurt the economy in March. And he fears that rising interest rates will increase the risks of recession, saying: \u201cAlthough GDP rebounded in April, this reflects more the reversal of the squeeze on service sector activity from poor weather in March, than a meaningful improvement in our underlying growth trajectory. \u201cApril\u2019s upbeat reading should be followed by a notable decline in May GDP as the extra bank holiday for the Coronation and ongoing strike action will have stifled activity across much of the economy. \u201cWhile lower energy bills should boost incomes and support output over the summer, the financial squeeze from a higher tax burden and soaring borrowing costs means our economy may continue to tread water for some time. \u201cIf the Bank of England continues to hike interest rates, as is likely next week, they risk reigniting recession fears by further increasing the financial fragility of households and businesses.\u201d April\u2019s 0.2% growth means the UK economy made a positive start to the second quarter of 2023, having grown by just 0.1% in the first quarter (and shrinking in March). Jeremy Batstone-Carr, European strategist at Raymond James Investment Services, fears that \u201ca Herculean effort\u201d will still be needed to avoid a recession. \u201cToday\u2019s GDP growth of 0.2% proves that the UK economy opened the latest quarter more strongly than the previous quarter, boosting the possibility that economic activity will be resilient enough to help the UK sidestep a recession. However, it is far too soon to call the \u2018all clear\u2019, particularly with the Bank of England poised to remain on its rate-hiking mission to suppress inflation that remains too high for comfort.\u201d \u201cFollowing March\u2019s dip in economic activity fuelled by industrial action, April saw fewer days lost to strikes and was accompanied by the retail sector springing back to action. Manufacturing and industrial production remain resilient after a solid first quarter, supported by a positive trend in vehicle production, gas output and mining activity.\u201d \u201cWhile the UK economy is proving rather more resilient than its Euro Area counterpart, there remain grounds for continued caution. Consumer spending continues to be smothered by relentless inflation and households are under growing pressure from rising mortgage rates. Given these ongoing squeezes, a Herculean effort will still be required to avoid a recession.\u201d The \u201cwholesale and retail trade and repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles\u201d made the largest contribution to UK service sector growth, followed by the \u201cinformation and communications\u201d sectors. The latter was driven by growth in \u201cmotion picture, video and TV programme production, sound recording and music publishing\u201d, followed by computer programming and consultancy. This chart shows how the services sector lifted the UK economy in April (by growing by 0.3%), while production output (-0.3%) and construction output (-0.6%) shrank during the month: Reaction to this morning\u2019s growth figures is rushing in. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said: \u201cWe are growing the economy, with the IMF (International Monetary Fund) saying that from 2025 we will grow faster than Germany, France and Italy. \u201cBut high growth needs low inflation, so we must stick relentlessly to our plan to halve the rate this year to protect family budgets.\u201d Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said: \u201cDespite our country\u2019s huge potential and promise, today is another day in the dismal low-growth record book of this Conservative Government. \u201cThe facts remain that families are feeling worse off, facing a soaring Tory mortgage penalty and we\u2019re lagging behind on the global stage.\u201d UK bars and pubs had a relatively strong April, the Office for National Statistics reports, helping the economy grow by 0.2% during the month. There was also a rebound in car sales, after a drop in March which hit GDP. Activity in the education sector also increased, following strike action in March which hit output. But, health sector activity was hit by strikes as the pay row between unions and the government continued. Darren Morgan, director of economic statistics production &amp; analysis at the ONS, says: \u201cGDP bounced back after a weak March. \u201cBars and pubs had a comparatively strong April, while car sales rebounded and education partially recovered from the effect of the previous month\u2019s strikes. \u201cThese were partially offset by falls in health, which was affected by the junior doctors strikes, along with falls in computer manufacturing and the often-erratic pharmaceuticals industry. \u201cHouse builders and estate agents also had a poor month.\u201d Monthly UK GDP is now estimated to be 0.3% above its pre-coronavirus levels, set in February 2020, the ONS reports. Newsflash! The UK economy has returned to growth. UK GDP increased by 0.2% in April, new figures from the Office for National Statistics show, matching City forecasts. That follows the 0.3% contraction recorded in March. Over the three months to April, the economy only expanded by 0.1% The ONS says the services sector was the main contributor to the growth in monthly GDP in April, expanding by 0.3%. Output in consumer-facing services grew by 1.0% in April 2023, following a fall of 0.8% in March 2023. But the production sector shrank by 0.3% in April, while construction output shrank by 0.6%. Yesterday\u2019s turbulence in the financial markets gets plenty of coverage in today\u2019s newspapers. The i newspaper warns that mortgage misery is set to be as bad as the 1980s \u2014 with interest rates seen heading for 5.75% by next spring. The Financial Times highlights Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey\u2019s warning that inflation is \u201ctaking a lot longer\u201d than hoped to come down. The Daily Telegraph reports that Downing Street has \u201cordered banks to protect struggling homeowners from soaring mortgage costs\u201d, as markets bet interest rates could hit almost 6pc by the end of the year. The Prime Minister\u2019s spokesman said yesterday: The Chancellor has made clear his expectation that lenders should live up to their responsibilities and support any mortgage borrowers who are finding it tough right now.\u201d \u201cThere do remain a large range of mortgage deals available to the public, but we know this current situation may be concerning for some homeowners and mortgage holders.\u201d Deutsche Bank predict the UK economy expanded by 0.2% in April, rebounding from its March contraction. Their senior economist, Sanjay Raja, explains: After a surprise contraction in March, we see GDP expanding modestly in April. What do our models tell us? Our April nowcast sits at 0.2% m-o-m. What\u2019s driving the rise in activity? More services output, as some of the drag from industrial action unwinds. Consumer facing services, we think, will lead the rebound into spring. We also see construction output expanding a little (0.3% m-o-m). The one drag to GDP will likely come from industrial production, which we expect will see broad based weakness from energy, water, oil, and manufacturing production. We\u2019ll find out in 15 minutes if they\u2019re right\u2026. Looking ahead, Deutsche Bank continue to see UK GDP this year expanding by 0.3%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world econony. At 7am we discover how the UK economy fared in April, when the latest growth figures are released. Economists predict the UK returned to growth in April, with GDP tipped to have risen by 0.2% despite high inflation, rising interest rates and disruption caused by strikes. The economy shrank by 0.3% in March, meaning the economy only grew by 0.1% in the first quarter of this year [although this data may be revised]. That left the UK at the bottom of the G7 growth league since the pandemic, behind Germany, France and the US. But the UK has defied fears of a recession, so far anyway, with the economy showing more resilience than expected, assisted by easing energy costs after last year\u2019s spikes. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets sets the scene\u2026 As we look to today\u2019s UK April GDP numbers, we\u2019ve just come off a March contraction of -0.3% which acted as a drag on Q1\u2019s 0.1% expansion. The reason for the poor performance in March was due to various public sector strike action from healthcare and transport, which weighed heavily on the services sector which saw a contraction of -0.5%. The performance would have been worse but for a significant rebound in construction and manufacturing activity which saw strong rebounds of 0.7%. This isn\u2019t expected to be repeated in today\u2019s April numbers, however there was still widespread strike action which is likely to have impacted on public services output. The strong performance from manufacturing is also unlikely to be repeated with some modest declines, however services should rebound to the tune of 0.3%, although the poor March number is likely to drag the rolling 3M/3M reading down from 0.1% to -0.1%. Also coming up today Today\u2019s GDP report comes amid turmoil in the UK mortgage markets, as lenders scramble to reprice deals as UK borrowing costs soar. Yesteday, the interest rate on a two-year UK government bond jumped over the levels hit during Liz Truss\u2019s disastrous premiership, following faster-than-expected wage growth this year. Yesterday, the governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, warned that inflation was \u201ctaking a lot longer\u201d than hoped to come down. He told the House of Lords economic affairs committee: \u201cWe still think the rate of inflation is going to come down, but it\u2019s taking a lot longer than we expected.\u201d Tonight America\u2019s central bank sets interest rates, with many forecasters predicting the Federal Reserve will pause its cycle of higher borrowing costs. Yesterday, US inflation dropped to 4% in May, bringing some relief to households (and some envious looks from the Bank of England\u2019s headquarters\u2026).

The number of people suffering problems as a direct result of the sustained high temperatures in many parts of the country has resulted in some hospitals recording their highest A&amp;E attendance figures. The high pollen count and air pollution are also contributing to a major increase in demand for help at emergency departments just as the latest junior doctors\u2019 strike in England gets under way. Hospitals are also dealing with an increase in the number of people with hay fever and people having trouble breathing normally because they are suffering a flare-up of asthma. Some hospitals are struggling to cope with the extra demand, senior doctors said. The combination of the two events has created a \u201cvery challenging\u201d situation for the NHS, one said. \u201cThis week\u2019s heatwave, which stretches across the country, has seen some hospitals facing large increases in attendances as people experience conditions caused, or exacerbated, by the weather,\u201d said Dr Ian Higginson, the vice-president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, which represents A&amp;E doctors. \u201cComing at a time when the NHS is already struggling, and during a period of industrial action, we know that many emergency departments are facing considerable pressure.\u201d Five hospitals in south London have recorded all-time high attendances at their A&amp;Es this week as unusually high temperatures have promoted the UK Security Agency and Met Office to extend the heat health alert they issued until next Monday. For example, on Monday more than 1,250 people sought help at St George\u2019s, Epsom and St Helier hospitals in south London \u2013 more than the previous record of 1,170 and far above the usual attendance of about 800. \u201cWe have never been busier and with the strikes it\u2019s going to be a very challenging week,\u201d said Dr Richard Jennings, the group chief medical officer at the St George\u2019s Epsom and St Helier University hospitals and health group. \u201cThis weather has undoubtedly contributed to the rise in people \u2013 some who are vulnerable and very sick \u2013 coming to our emergency departments,\u201d he added. In a statement the group added: \u201cWhen temperatures rise, more people, especially those in high-risk groups, can suffer from illnesses like heat exhaustion and dehydration, as well as sunburn. \u201cThe pollen count is also very high, and there has been a surge in people visiting emergency departments with shortness of breath. This might not be anything to worry about, but it is scary and sometimes those who are experiencing it will need medical help.\u201d The chief executive of another trust, who asked not to be named, said: \u201cThe hospital is very busy because of the heat and pollen. Monday and Tuesday were our two busiest ever days for emergency care \u2013 and it is June! \u201cWe are going into the three-day industrial action with a full hospital.\u201d A source at another NHS trust said its two A&amp;Es were \u201cjammed [with] mostly walk-ins with lots of respiratory cases and hay fever. A very high day usually sees around 850 patients but earlier this week this was well over 1,000 across two EDs [emergency departments]\u201d. Several said there had been a new record number of patients turning up at A&amp;E on Monday, with heat-related conditions, including dehydration, to blame."}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e70132", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/14/nadine-dorries-failure-to-resign-officially-as-mp-frustrates-sunaks-attempt-to-reset-tories", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": [], "title": "Nadine Dorries frustrates Sunak by failing to officially resign as MP", "lead": "No 10 says constituents in Mid Bedfordshire deserve certainty as it piles pressure on ex-minister to stand down", "author": "Aletha Adu Political correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-06-14T14:40:00Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.294100", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/269e4d68840160b03813c1a56b608173a83358a9/584_229_5377_3226/500.jpg", "body": "Downing Street is heaping pressure on Nadine Dorries to stand down as soon as possible, saying her constituents in Mid Bedfordshire deserve certainty. The former culture secretary said last Friday she would \u201cimmediately\u201d step down, after she was denied a peerage in Boris Johnson\u2019s resignation honours. The Conservative party has moved the motion, known as a writ, for byelections in Johnson\u2019s Uxbridge and South Ruislip constituency and Nigel Adams\u2019s Selby and Ainsty seat as they formally resigned with a letter to the chancellor on Tuesday. But Dorries is yet to formally tender her resignation to Jeremy Hunt, frustrating Rishi Sunak\u2019s attempts to start preparing to replace her. The prime minister\u2019s press secretary said Sunak was \u201calways disappointed\u201d to see MPs leaving the house, but noted it was \u201cunusual\u201d Dorries had not yet formally resigned. \u201cWe are moving on with the two byelections of Uxbridge and Selby,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously unusual to have an MP say they will resign with immediate effect and for that not to take place. \u201cThe prime minister believes the people of Mid Bedfordshire deserve proper representation in this house and he looks forward to campaigning for the Conservative candidate in the byelection.\u201d Dorries, a fierce Johnson ally, is inflicting more pain upon the Tory party by delaying her official resignation. With the delay, Sunak could face an autumn byelection that would ruin his chances of trying to reset the party around its conference. A senior Conservative MP has accepted that the Tories are expected to lose all three byelections. If Dorries hands in her resignation soon, all three byelections could be held on one day, floated as 20 July. \u201cIt will be a complete washout. Once again, Rishi Sunak\u2019s attempts to reset the party are hampered by another Boris drama. The prime minister must think big picture now.\u201d The delay has left Dorries\u2019s constituents in limbo. A number of Conservative voters have criticised her record, describing her as an \u201cabsent MP who is too focused on writing books\u201d. The Conservative party chair, Greg Hands, paid a visit to Dorries\u2019s constituency on Sunday after at least 130 Liberal Democrat activists descended on the area in an attempt to win over voters. \u201cI pay tribute to Nadine,\u201d Hands said on Sunday. \u201cShe was 18 years the member of parliament here in Mid Bedfordshire, [and] was elected with 60% of the vote last time around. She has been a popular MP and has done brilliant work on keeping children safe with the online safety bill and all of those things. \u201cBut now we\u2019re moving on, we\u2019re looking forward to selecting a new candidate for Mid Bedfordshire as soon as possible and we\u2019re looking forward to winning this byelection here in Mid Bedfordshire.\u201d The byelections have been triggered by \u201cpolitical tantrums\u201d over peerages, according to the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, who has said Johnson and Sunak are damaging the UK\u2019s reputation internationally. Dorries, who accused Sunak of \u201cduplicitously and cruelly\u201d blocking her elevation to the House of Lords, had said she would be standing down with immediate effect. CCHQ had been holding byelection drills for at least a month, the Guardian understands, before Dorries, Johnson and Adams announced their intentions to quit in order to accept peerages, amid claims Johnson was told as early as March that a Dorries peerage would be rejected. The drills consisted of outlining what the priority issues within each seat were, and which ministers should make visits to each constituency and why."}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e70133", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/14/john-romita-sr-the-spider-man-artist-was-a-titan-of-the-comic-book-world", "primaryCategory": "books", "subCategories": [], "title": "John Romita Sr: the Spider-Man artist was a titan of the comic-book world", "lead": "The man who helped to bring an iconic character to life shaped the look of the Marvel Universe for decades", "author": "David Barnett", "datePublished": "2023-06-14T14:38:21Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.294108", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/6b9f1f9df3aa46a0af83933d0c241b28feab2a11/0_731_1250_750/500.jpg", "body": "The finest single panel of comics work ever produced \u2013 and I will fight you with a ready quip and feats of airborne acrobatics over this \u2013 appeared in The Amazing Spider-Man issue 42, released on 1 November 1966.

All credit, of course, to Steve Ditko, the uniquely talented artist who co-created Spider-Man with Marvel Comics\u2019 supremo Stan Lee four years earlier. Ditko\u2019s highly individual and instantly recognisable style always gave the Wall-Crawler a slightly dark, even sinister tone, redolent of the creepy-crawly origins of the superhero. In 1966 the world was changing. Star Trek and Batman were on TV, the moon was in the sights of the US, and the Summer of Love was on the horizon. And Romita brought Spider-Man out of the shadows and thrust him into a brave new sunshiney world that was just as fabulous and groovy in the pages of the comics as it was shaping up to be in real life. Marvel Comics had always reflected the real world more than its rival DC in the 1960s. While the latter\u2019s heroes patrolled the streets of fictional cities such as Gotham, Metropolis and Central City, the Marvel Universe was pretty much centred on New York, adding a verisimilitude to the action within the comics\u2019 pages. Romita\u2019s work on The Amazing Spider-Man \u2013 from issue number 39, in September 1966, after Ditko\u2019s abrupt departure from Marvel \u2013 ran for almost five years and pretty much defined Marvel\u2019s \u201chouse style\u201d for the coming decades. He brought a romance comics sensibility to superheroes, with as much care given to Mary Jane\u2019s bang-up-to-the-minute wardrobe of miniskirts and hairstyles as to the set-piece action sequences between wisecracking Spidey and his rogues gallery of villains such as the rampaging Rhino (like MJ, and many more mainstay characters, designed by Romita). Spider-Man, of course, wasn\u2019t Romita\u2019s first comics work; not even his first chance to stamp his mark on the Marvel Universe. The man often billed in the comic credits in Stan Lee\u2019s Barnum-esque fashion as \u201cJazzy\u201d John had started work in comics in 1949, aged just 19. His first work was uncredited, a 10-page gangster story for Timely Comics, which was the forerunner of Marvel. He cut his teeth on war, horror, science fiction and romance comics throughout the 1950s, and then late in the decade moved to DC Comics where he worked mainly on the hugely popular teen romance titles such as Young Love, Heart Throbs and Girls\u2019 Romances. Hearing that Romita was thinking of getting into commercial illustration after DC pulled the plug on many of its romance titles as the genre declined in popularity, Stan Lee, ever the comic book puppetmaster, met him for a three-hour lunch and persuaded him to take on Daredevil, with issue 12 of the blind superhero\u2019s title which came out in January 1966. It\u2019s hard not to imagine Lee quietly moving the pieces around the chessboard of his masterplan as he wrote a Daredevil issue later that year with Spider-Man (who had debuted in Amazing Fantasy issue 15 in 1962) as a guest star, to see how Romita would handle the character who \u2013 by accident, or more likely Lee\u2019s design \u2013 was shortly to become Marvel\u2019s flagship superhero. Romita was responsible for another Spider-Man image (which some of you might have thought I was going to claim as his very best in this column\u2019s first paragraph): the illustration from Amazing Spider-Man issue 50, in which a disillusioned Peter Parker walks away from his super-powered secret life, the Spider-Man costume dumped in a rubbish bin in an alleyway. Romita\u2019s time at Marvel Comics had such a wide-ranging impact that it seems surprising how relatively short his full-time artistic career was. By 1973 he was Marvel\u2019s art director, and though he was no longer working on full art layouts for books on a monthly basis, he designed many of the unforgettable characters who have been recognisable to comics readers \u2013 and later movie-goers \u2013 ever since: the Punisher, Wolverine, Luke Cage. Later in that decade there was another Jazzy John Romita in the Marvel credits \u2013 Romita\u2019s son, John Jr, who followed in his father\u2019s footsteps illustrating Spider-Man, Daredevil and a wealth of characters for Marvel, DC and other companies. It was John Jr who broke the news on Twitter about his father\u2019s death this week. John Romita Sr was as much of a titan of the comics world as any luridly costumed champion, and his loss will be mourned by comics fans across the globe. When Stan Lee put Romita on Spider-Man in 1966, Marvel Comics \u2013 and its growing army of fans \u2013 really did hit the jackpot. \u2022 This article was amended on 14 June 2023. An earlier version incorrectly implied that there had not been a regular Spider-Man title prior to 1966."}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e70134", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/14/nottingham-attack-suspect-was-arrested-after-approaching-police-knife", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "subCategories": [], "title": "Nottingham attack suspect allegedly approached police with knife before arrest", "lead": "Multiple sources say mental health of suspect, 31, is active line of investigation after deaths of three people", "author": "Vikram Dodd Police and crime correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-06-14T14:25:59Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.294117", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/a7b3557d60d05bf11890a82048c17f56cdff484d/0_209_1898_1138/500.jpg", "body": "The suspect in the triple knife attack in Nottingham was arrested after allegedly approaching police officers with a knife, it has been revealed.

Counter-terrorism officers are assisting the investigation by Nottinghamshire police, but multiple sources say the suspect\u2019s mental health is an active line of investigation, as police try to determine a motive. The Guardian understands that investigators believe the suspect was residing in Nottingham and had previous links to London. Police gave a sequence of events for the series of attacks that left two 19-year-old University of Nottingham students, Grace O\u2019Malley-Kumar and Barnaby Webber, dead. The third stabbing victim was Ian Coates, a school caretaker in his 60s, whose van the man stole and then used to drive into pedestrians near the Theatre Royal, injuring one man critically, as well as two others. Nottinghamshire police said by piecing together \u201cextensive CCTV coverage and eyewitness accounts\u201d they could now track the attacker\u2019s movements. At 4.04am on Tuesday they were called to Ilkeston Road, where the two students lay in the street, unresponsive after being attacked by a man with a knife. Police said they attended quickly. The man then tried to get into a hostel. Police said: \u201cInvestigations have then revealed that a man matching the description of the suspect had attempted to gain entry to a supported-living complex in Mapperley Road but had been denied entry. This incident was not reported to the police at the time.\u201d The hostel was close to the junction of Mapperley Road and Magdala Road, and it is on Magdala Road where Ian Coates\u2019s body was found in the street. \u201cPolice believe the suspect has then attacked a man and stolen his van,\u201d Nottinghamshire police said. The man took Coates\u2019s van and drove to the Milton Street area, allegedly turning it into a weapon to run over three pedestrians, two of whom at least were standing at a bus stop. One witness to this attack said police had pulled up behind the van shortly before. Shortly after this officers arrested a man. Police said: \u201cA short while later, police managed to detain the suspect by using a Taser when he abandoned the vehicle and approached officers with a knife.\u201d Police denied claims that they received calls about the suspect before his rampage of violence began. \u201cThere have also been reports that other calls were made to Nottinghamshire police about the suspect before he carried out the attacks in Ilkeston Road.

Results of the ballot came as the GMB union\u2019s 800 members at the site, known as BHX4, were on strike for the 19th day. The union said 99% of its members had backed extending the strike campaign, on a turnout of 54%. Trade unions must renew their legal mandate for strike action every six months. The GMB organiser Amanda Gearing said the vote showed staff were \u201cin it for the long haul\u201d, adding: \u201cThese workers are angry, they know their rights and they will not go away.\u201d Strike votes at two other Amazon warehouses, in Mansfield and Rugeley, failed to meet the required threshold, dashing the union\u2019s hopes of concerted action over the summer. In Rugeley, they fell short by four votes, however, and members are considering a re-ballot. The fresh vote for strikes in Coventry came after the GMB reluctantly withdrew an application for trade union recognition at BHX4 last week. With membership at about 800 after a recruitment drive, the union believed it had comfortably signed up more than half of the staff at the site. But the Central Arbitration Committee (CAC), which can grant statutory recognition, accepted evidence from Amazon that there were up to 2,700 workers employed there. Amazon has rejected the GMB\u2019s claim that it deliberately hired more than 1,000 staff in recent weeks to ensure the union would not be able to show that it had majority support. The GMB claims its strike action \u2013 which began in January when it had only a few dozen members in Coventry \u2013 is having a growing impact on Amazon\u2019s operations. Since the industrial action began, Amazon has increased pay for UK-based staff to \u00a311 an hour, and enhanced employment rights for parents; but GMB members in Coventry are calling for \u00a315 an hour and union representation at company discussions. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, told the GMB\u2019s annual congress in Brighton last week that he supported the union\u2019s move for recognition at Amazon, calling it a \u201cfantastic campaign\u201d.

The European parliament approved rules aimed at setting a global standard for the technology, which encompasses everything from automated medical diagnoses to some types of drone, AI-generated videos known as deepfakes, and bots such as ChatGPT. MEPs will now thrash out details with EU countries before the draft rules \u2013 known as the AI act \u2013 become legislation. \u201cAI raises a lot of questions socially, ethically, economically. But now is not the time to hit any \u2018pause button\u2019. On the contrary, it is about acting fast and taking responsibility,\u201d said Thierry Breton, the European commissioner for the internal market. A rebellion by centre-right MEPs in the EPP political grouping over an outright ban on real-time facial recognition on the streets of Europe failed to materialise, with a number of politicians attending Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s funeral in Italy. The final vote was 499 in favour and 28 against with 93 abstentions. European leaders are expected to push back on a total ban on biometrics, with police forces across the continent keen to utilise the potential to recognise criminals as they walk down a street or through public areas. The EPP had argued the technology could be of vital importance in combating crime and in counter-terrorism intelligence as well as in searches for missing children. Emotional recognition, which is used in parts of China to identify tired truck drivers, for example, will also be banned at work places and in schools under the proposed law. The European parliament president, Roberta Metsola, described it as \u201clegislation that will no doubt be setting the global standard for years to come\u201d. She said the EU now had the ability to set the tone worldwide and that \u201ca new age of scrutiny\u201d had begun. Brando Benifei, a co-rappoteur of the parliament\u2019s AI committee, which progressed the legislation to the voting stage, said that on facial recognition the law would provide \u201ca clear safeguard to avoid any risk of mass surveillance\u201d. His fellow co-rappoteur, Dragos Tudorache, said that if the legislation had already been in force, the French government would not have been able to pass a law this year to enable live facial recognition for crowd surveillance at the 2024 Olympics. To combat the high risk of copyright infringement, the legislation will oblige developers of AI chatbots to publish all the works of scientists, musicians, illustrators, photographers and journalists used to train them. They will also have to prove that everything they did to train the machine complied with the law. If they do not do so, they could be forced to delete applications immediately or be fined up to 7% of their revenue, which could run to hundreds of millions of euros for tech giants. \u201cThere are plenty of sharp teeth in there,\u201d Tudorache said. He said talks with the European Council and the European Commission would begin and that he would enter them with a mandate from the parliament rather than \u201cred lines\u201d on the disputed facial recognition issue. Benifei described the EPP\u2019s attempts to throw out the blanket ban on mass surveillance on the grounds that it would stop police using the tool for security as propaganda, because authorities would still be able to use biometric data including CCTV footage as they already do to pursue criminals. There is also growing clamour to regulate AI across the Atlantic, as pressure grows on western governments to act fast in what some describe as a battle to protect humanity. While AI proponents hail the technology for how it will transform society, including work, healthcare and creative pursuits, others are worried by its potential to undermine democracy. Even if the EU\u2019s ambitious target to reach an agreement on the law by the end of the year is achieved, it would not come into force until 2026 at the earliest, forcing the EU to push for a voluntary interim pact with tech companies. Margrethe Vestager, the EU\u2019s antitrust chief, told reporters that a balance might yet be struck as parliament reflected those who supported a ban on principled grounds relating to privacy as well as others who take a \u201cslightly more pragmatic or security-oriented approach\u201d."}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e70137", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/14/us-debt-ceiling-bipartisan-class-warfare", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "subCategories": [], "title": "The US debt-ceiling \u2018deal\u2019 was a giant exercise in bipartisan class warfare | Clara Mattei", "lead": "The elite consensus is clear: spending is fine when it supports military ventures, but bad when it supports social welfare", "author": "Clara Mattei", "datePublished": "2023-06-14T14:12:05Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.294144", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/7f9df521b0496f135eeadd6b03c35449e445c374/0_98_4522_2714/500.jpg", "body": "The headlines around the debt-ceiling legislation focused on the ability of the US to meet its financial obligations on time and in full through 2024.

But the actual terms of the debt-ceiling legislation reveal a political consensus that is at once troubling and longstanding.

Here, the bipartisan consensus is clear: federal overspending is fine when it supports military ventures; it is a problem when it supports social welfare. In navigating the debt-ceiling legislation and the price inflation that has persisted over the last year, US policymakers have consistently drawn on the failed economic doctrine of austerity \u2013 popularized in the 20th century and still prominent today \u2013 to intervene in a dysfunctional economy. In using these economic instruments, which are known to fail, they reveal their political ends. At its core, austerity is a suite of economic policies that aims to reduce aggregate demand among the largest population in any society \u2013 the working class. Rising interest rates and reduced social benefits, especially in an inflationary economy, require working classes to do more with less. This means working more hours for less money. And who benefits from that environment? A society\u2019s upper crust \u2013 the capital class. The recent debt-ceiling agreement, like the Federal Reserve\u2019s continued increases in interest rates, has been presented under the false pretense that curbing expenditures is a necessary intervention for an economy living beyond its means. This narrative is plainly false. In a capitalist economy like ours, it\u2019s never the size of the debt that matters. What matters is how that debt can be wielded to convince Americans to accept economic decisions as somehow unavoidable \u2013 painful concessions that are the result of rational deliberations from economic experts. The same excusing of economic pain is used to justify military spending at the cost of social spending. Many have argued, convincingly, that the military-industrial complex is to blame for this double standard, with defense spending doubling as a means of economic upward redistribution toward those with influence and power. But even for those who would be critical of that narrative, the question remains: where is the federal debate around unlimited defense spending? Where are the economic hawks lamenting the undisciplined excess of military adventure? This lack of economic self-reflection illustrates the power of another false principle guiding the American economy, including its tendency toward austerity: it\u2019s not whether the state spends but rather where the state spends. Under austerity capitalism, it is acceptable to use public resources to enrich the very few who profit from real wealth (in the form of dividends and interests), while widespread structural dispossession explicitly serves to \u201cdiscipline\u201d working people. In other words: economic policy is used as the most important economic lever to perpetuate class warfare. This principle is readily and concretely evident in the recent debt-ceiling legislation. Of the $15tn in excess US debt, more than half ($8tn) is due to war expenditure. Against any imperative of cutting expenditures, the latest debt agreement conspicuously exonerates military spending from any cuts. Meanwhile, US spending on the war in Ukraine is predicted to go up in the coming years, reaching $895bn in 2025. These are unprecedented numbers, a shocking 40% of global military expenditure. And while state spending boosts the profits of big shareholders in the military-industrial complex, and props up stakeholders in the Mountain Valley pipeline despite protests from climate activists in Appalachia, the same policy defunds the Internal Revenue Service, the agency charged with investigating tax evasion. As even the lightest examination makes clear, the US impulse to spend on its military serves the same interests as its refusal to enforce its tax code. Defenders of the Biden administration\u2019s debt-ceiling bill argue, plausibly, that the legislation could have been worse for working people if the priorities of the most conservative Republicans were met. But the specifics of this worst-case scenario offer little cover for what we got instead: a concretization of austerity policies and a whole new set of levers for one-sided class warfare.

The show \u2013 programmed at this year\u2019s Edinburgh fringe \u2013 examines one person\u2019s relationship with le fric (as \u201cdough\u201d translates in French) as a continuous transaction between themselves and others. Lescot opens this fast-paced, funny and bittersweet account with money his alter ego\u2019s grandmother put into trust for him as a baby and closes it after a spot of negotiation with the funeral director. In between, our hero\u2019s financial credits and debits include discovering the tooth fairy and pocket money, making a disastrous investment, being scammed, struggling to provide as a young father and haggling over a vacuum cleaner. \u201cMoney is not just money, it\u2019s the link, the quest or the evil that decides our relationships, our choices, our destinies,\u201d Lescot writes. Sitting in a Paris cafe opposite the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Ville, where his independent Compagnie du Ka\u00efros is based, Lescot, 52, admits the narrative is \u201cvery personal\u201d. \u201cI wanted to look at the entire life of a person from birth to death purely from the perspective of their relationship with money,\u201d he says. \u201cIt fascinates me because our entire life and existence turns around money \u2013 the fact of having it or lacking it. The play is a reflection on this and how relations between people are affected by money. \u201cThe (main) person in the play is not talented with money. In fact, he\u2019s a loser, but even as a loser he can find his way through life. He arrives at a kind of calm serenity even being such a loser with money and ends up finding a certain peace because by the end he has put some distance between himself and money.\u201d Lescot says he is \u201cable to find a kind of equilibrium in my own life through the play\u201d by looking at difficult things with humour. \u201cFor me, money is a means not a goal,\u201d he adds. \u201cI chose a career that isn\u2019t famous for making lots of money but I earn a good living and that is already a win. I have known difficulties and problems with money, I\u2019ve known what it is not to have money. My aim is to have enough, not to earn a lot.\u201d Dough was originally commissioned by the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise as one of a series of short plays. It was translated into English and performed in New York last year where the main character, Me, was played by Zach Lusk. He was supported by Matthew Brown and Hannah Mitchell who portray more than 40 characters in his life in a non-stop succession. The same three actors will perform in Edinburgh. The New York theatre critic Erin Kahn hailed it as \u201ca smart, mesmerising, nearly perfect production that reminded me why I love theatre\u201d. Lescot says he feels the play works better in English than in French. \u201cIts register is more suited to English and American theatre which is less about putting people and things in boxes. Of course, a tragedy is still a tragedy and a farce a farce in any language, but what I like about plays in English is that something can be very funny but at the same time hard and difficult.\u201d He adds: \u201cIt\u2019s a very rapid, non-stop look at a life in 60 minutes. It\u2019s all very simple, there\u2019s nothing on stage, just a rectangle of light and the various people around the main character who enter and leave the light. Often when we get older towards the end we look back on our lives and I have tried to do that in the play.\u201d So everything is about the money, it seems, except Lescot\u2019s decision to take Dough to Edinburgh. \u201cWe won\u2019t make any \u2026 not enough to cover the costs,\u201d Lescot says looking cheerful all the same. \u201cBut it\u2019s Edinburgh. It\u2019s an international platform for theatre, so I think it\u2019s worth doing. The most important thing is for the play to be seen, shown to a wider public and hopefully it will interest other theatres. Financially, it\u2019s a calculated risk.\u201d Dough is at Pleasance Dome, Edinburgh, 2-28 August"}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e70139", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/14/man-who-tried-to-break-into-hostel-might-have-been-nottingham-attacker", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "subCategories": [], "title": "Man who tried to break into hostel may have been Nottingham attacker", "lead": "Police cordoned off part of Seely Hirst House, which is near scene of stabbing", "author": "Helen Pidd North of England editor", "datePublished": "2023-06-14T14:05:03Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.294161", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/0fc2c4c2405d6554966793a03a9d61dd8801d3f0/0_116_3500_2101/500.jpg", "body": "A man who may have been the killer in the Nottingham attacks tried to break into a homeless hostel via an open window, according to a trustee of the charity that runs the hostel. Seely Hirst House, a residential care home for homeless people, is round the corner from Magdala tennis club, 30 seconds\u2019 walk from where school caretaker Ian Coates was stabbed to death on Tuesday morning. Police tape still cordoned off part of the hostel on Wednesday lunchtime as detectives continued to piece together the movements of the alleged attacker. Alex Pridmore, a trustee of All Saints Homeless Shelter, which runs the home, said: \u201cThe man tried to climb through a ground floor bay window, which was open, and the resident of that room woke up and rushed to the window to close it. The resident then alerted security.\u201d Pridmore added: \u201cThe intruder was not known to us.\u201d He said the resident was \u201cshaken\u201d but not physically harmed, and the man then ran off.

The resident said: \u201cI was awake from 4.15am because I have chronic COPD and can\u2019t breathe, so was watching TV when a black guy tried to climb in through the window. I pushed him away. He went away and then came back and tried to smash the window. No one is getting into my yard.\u201d Police believe the killer stole Coates\u2019s van and then drove it to the city centre, where he deliberately rammed three people waiting for a bus. Nottinghamshire police confirmed on Wednesday that a man matching the alleged killer\u2019s description attempted to break into the property on Mapperley Road, near the junction with Magdala Road. The incident happened sometime after 4am, when the two students were stabbed on Ilkeston Road, two miles away.

Coming so soon after Rachel Reeves tempered the green new deal pledge, telling the Today programme that \u201ceverything we do must rest on these pillars of economic and fiscal responsibility\u201d, it sounds like the kind of thing it would do. Labour says it never promised universal free childcare in the first place, and I went back to the primary text, a Bridget Phillipson interview from April: it\u2019s true. She talks about reimagining early years care as part of the education system, which makes it sound universal and free. But she also references Estonia as a model, where parents are guaranteed nursery places, but pay according to their means. The quality of the care is high, wages and qualifications are higher, and the sector is seen as a critical element of child development. This is in contrast to the Liz Truss and Jeremy Hunt model, where nursery is a place to park your child while you earn money, so the drive in the sector is to keep wages low and child:staff ratios high. I\u2019ve actually seen the Estonia model, although it was in Berlin, and 10 years ago: a hangover from reunification, East German universal provision overlaid with West German means-tested access. All the nurseries were good enough that people didn\u2019t opt out, and none of it was expensive, even for affluent people. I was struck not just by how happy everyone seemed with it \u2013 already, back then, in contrast to the swingeing costs we faced in the UK \u2013 but also the socially cohesive effect of parents from all classes putting their most treasured thing in the same place. I\u2019m not against that model, but when you add together higher wages for nursery staff, guaranteed places, affordable prices, better provision for parents doing long or irregular hours and a higher quality of care, it doesn\u2019t sound cheap. So if everything rests on the pillars of fiscal responsibility, it doesn\u2019t sound true. Critically, Labour\u2019s plan sounds both less generous and less likely to happen than the Conservatives\u2019 notion, which is to guarantee 30 free hours per week from the age of nine months. Is the gamble that everyone under 40 is so sick of Tory government that they\u2019ll vote Labour whatever the promise? The polls seem to bear this out, but when parents are spending more on nurseries than mortgages, the sheer pressure of that might be decisive when the time comes. My happy place is to default back to the question: when will Labour realise that you cannot inspire voters by ceaselessly counselling caution? But you cannot consider that seriously without making a proper reckoning of how much the Conservatives have polluted the ecosystem of campaigning. The Tory idea of more free hours from a younger age won\u2019t happen. The 30-hour model is hanging by a thread anyway, where the fees of the kids under three cross-subsidise the free hours of the kids over three. If everyone over nine months has 30 free hours, nurseries will go bust and people won\u2019t be able to find places, whatever they\u2019re entitled to. Better, cheaper childcare won\u2019t happen, just like the 40 new hospitals that won\u2019t happen, like the levelling up that isn\u2019t happening, like the taking back control didn\u2019t happen, like the \u00a3350m-a-week for the NHS didn\u2019t happen, like the restabilisation of the public finances that emphatically didn\u2019t happen. We parse these differences between Conservative prime ministers \u2013 Rishi Sunak is a jam tomorrow person, they say, unlike chaotic Liz Truss and blowhard Boris Johnson, who were jam all over everything, now, people. But the underlying reality of the project they share is that the jam is fake and tomorrow never arrives. This intense relaxation around breaking promises enables Sunak to simply lift anything that sounds popular \u2013 Phillipson suggests breakfast clubs, it\u2019s in Hunt\u2019s spring budget. \u201cParking his tanks on her lawn,\u201d the commentators say, using the lexicon of the olden days, when people only said things they intended to do. Now, when a Tory pinches your idea, it isn\u2019t cunning political plagiarism, it merely invites the idea into the graveyard of things that, by dint of having been promised, will never happen. How does an opposition party meet that challenge? With secrecy? By floating decoy ideas? How do you insist on this fundamental difference between your parties, that you are sincere and they are not? It\u2019s a genuine conundrum, with no obvious fix. All that\u2019s certain is, not like this: not by making continuous downward adjustments to the ambition of your project, as the fiscal envelope tightens. Which brings us to the crunchy bit of the Tory toxification, that fiscal envelope. Yesterday, yields on two-year government debt rose by 26 basis points; debt repayments are growing faster than any other element of government spending. Labour, seeking to regain a reputation for fiscal responsibility that it failed through its own negligence to protect during the Cameron years, has started to vocally prioritise prudence. This lends it an aspect of complete impotence, peddling a message: \u201cWhoever you vote for, in the end, the markets are in charge. Don\u2019t listen to your heart. Listen to your mortgage.\u201d Psychologically, Labour has elided the markets with the rightwing media, and assumes they\u2019ll be out to get any Labour government, and must be pre-appeased. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true. The high gilt yields are merely a logical response to the conclusion we\u2019ve all reached; if you\u2019re going to lend money to chancers, grifters and nihilists, you want to make it expensive. Labour should bet on itself to restore stability and ultimately prosperity, rather than essaying this Blairite script, \u201ceverything you want, so long as it sticks within our predecessors\u2019 spending promises\u201d. Times have changed, Tories have changed; their spending is wild and their promises are meaningless.

The haunting song of humpback whales conjures the stillness of the deep sea, drowning out the noise of the science museum \u2013 and the world \u2013 outside. This is The Great Animal Orchestra, a sonic voyage through seven ecosystems composed by the pioneering soundscape ecologist Bernie Krause. After its 2016 premiere at the Fondation Cartier museum in Paris and subsequent tour through Europe and Asia, the immersive exhibit arrives on the west coast for the first time. \u201cIt\u2019s about damn time,\u201d said Krause, who\u2019s called the San Francisco Bay Area his home since the late 1950s. Born in Detroit in 1938, Krause is best known for the musicality of his recordings of the natural world. For the last 55 years, he\u2019s evoked the textures and contours of global habitats by layering hundreds of wildlife sounds into succinct tracts, or soundscapes. Soundscape Dzanga-Sangha re-creates an early morning in the Central African Republic rainforest \u2013 precisely 8 September 1994 \u2013 beginning with the ambient hum of insects buzzing in the dark. The volume erupts at dawn as the first light triggers a chorus of wailing bird calls and croaking hyraxes, whose frequencies appear on a graph, or spectrogram, illuminating the digital walls of the theater. The insects register in the midrange of 6,000 hertz, while the hyrax barely breaks 2,000. The day climaxes with the bellowing roar of elephants thrashing in a salty marsh, a frequency so loud and so low that it sends ripples through a shallow pool of water on the theater floor. \u201cI wanted to give people a sense of the power of these animal narratives,\u201d Krause said, not only to convey the beauty of these habitats, but to highlight the urgency of the climate crisis ravaging our wildlife. His personal library of more than 5,000 hours of recordings holds snapshots of a rapidly deteriorating world. In Krause\u2019s estimation, \u201cAlmost 70% of my archive comes from habitats that have disappeared.\u201d Music of the natural world Soundscape ecology is a relatively new field that studies the acoustic relationships between living organisms. As a lifelong musician, Krause contributed to the field by thinking of natural sounds \u201cin musical terms\u201d, he said, as well as coining the word \u201cbiophony\u201d to describe the collective living sounds of an ecosystem. Reading spectrograms as musical notation, he noticed that animal sounds each operated at their own distinct frequencies, like singing particular parts of a song. In the early 1980s, when he posited that healthy ecosystems\u2019 sounds function as a highly structured organization, his ideas were dismissed; the scientific community was still recording animal sounds individually. \u201cGuys mostly went on the field with parabolic dishes that separated birds and frogs and insects and mammals out of context, out of the acoustic fabric of the environment,\u201d Krause said. Consequently, \u201cthey were never able to put Humpty Dumpty back together again in a way that actually sounded real.\u201d Krause made his first field recording in 1968 in the Muir Woods north of San Francisco, just after signing a Warner Brothers record deal. A tremendously successful electronic musician at the time, he was collecting sounds for In a Wild Sanctuary, a 1970 album remembered as a groundbreaking experiment in combining instruments with wilderness recordings and synthesizers. He recalls his immersion into the forest as a life-changing experience, a relief from his windowless recording studio and gnawing ADHD. Simply put, he said, \u201cI felt alive.\u201d After writing the score of Apocalypse Now in 1979 made him enough money to leave the entertainment industry forever, Krause earned a PhD in bioacoustics and spent the next decades retreating alone into the field and simply listening, waiting patiently for the revelations to emerge. A grand epiphany struck him one night in Africa in 1983 as he started to hear the origins of human music in the rhythm and percussion of the natural world. \u201cThis is an orchestra,\u201d he thought. \u201cThis is what enables us to dance and sing.\u201d An urgent plea for the environment The Great Animal Orchestra is an audiovisual collaboration between Krause and United Visual Artists (UVA), which programmed the spectrograms to illustrate his findings for viewers who might not share his ear. \u201cIn a healthy habitat, a spectrogram displays a wide range of animal vocalizations,\u201d Krause explained. These too offer a stark illustration of landscapes in flux. One unedited 1988 recording featured in the exhibition is from Lincoln Meadow, California, and shows a spectrogram dense with the bright, intricate song of finches, quails, sapsuckers and sparrows. In 1989, the orchestra sounds dimmer in comparison, but the difference is particularly stark on the spectrogram: the only visible frequencies belong to a single sapsucker and the flowing river. Between the two years, the meadow had looked exactly the same to Krause, but there lies the urgency of The Great Animal Orchestra: over the course of his career, he\u2019s heard the disappearance of different species before any problems had become visible. As time has worn on, Krause said he\u2019s felt little optimism in the progress against the climate crisis. Where in the 1960s, 10 hours in the field were enough to produce one hour of usable material, the time it takes today is now closer to 1,000 hours. In 2017, he and his wife, Katherine Krause, lost their home to deadly wildfires in Sonoma, California \u2013 a disaster of the type that experts say will happen more frequently and intensely as the planet warms. Krause has been something of an outsider for most of his career. \u201cI had this huge library of materials that nobody else was interested in,\u201d he said, releasing albums of his soundscapes through Wild Sanctuary, the environmental outreach organization he runs alongside Katherine. But shortly after he published his 2012 book, The Great Animal Orchestra, Fondation Cartier, a contemporary art museum launched by the French jeweler, approached him with a commission to create an immersive, audiovisual installation. The result is a poignant expression of the world\u2019s interconnectedness through sound. According to Krause, \u201cThey had a vision for it that was much bigger than mine.\u201d Krause maintains hope that his work can serve as a moving plea for the environment. \u201cWhen I create works of art I\u2019m able to reach people on an emotional level\u201d \u2013 more than any research paper ever could, he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know that there isn\u2019t some young kid out there who has the imagination and power of expression to convey to enough people that we have to make some changes. But it has to happen very fast.\u201d The Great Animal Orchestra will run at the San Francisco Exploratorium until 15 October 2023"}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e7013c", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/14/nso-group-spyware-pegasus-takeover", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "subCategories": [], "title": "Hollywood producer and chewing gum heir explore takeover of notorious spyware firm assets", "lead": "Robert Simonds and William \u2018Beau\u2019 Wrigley consider acquiring assets of NSO, blacklisted Israeli company behind Pegasus spyware", "author": "Stephanie Kirchgaessner in Washington", "datePublished": "2023-06-14T14:00:05Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.294186", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/a9086ac4b525a788c040749a0cae93eb93715575/0_223_6720_4032/500.jpg", "body": "An unlikely cast of characters including a Hollywood producer and the heir to the Wrigley chewing gum fortune are exploring a possible bid to take control of assets owned by NSO Group, the Israeli company behind one of the world\u2019s most sophisticated cyber-weapons. Robert Simonds, a US financier whose credits include producing several Adam Sandler films, has been engaged in talks to acquire the blacklisted spyware company\u2019s assets, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter. A firm owned by Simonds\u2019s friend, William \u201cBeau\u201d Wrigley \u2013 who was an heir to his family\u2019s chewing gum fortune and has since become involved in the cannabis industry \u2013 has conducted due diligence in connection to a possible NSO deal, according to a document seen by the Guardian. NSO, which is closely regulated by Israel\u2019s ministry of defence, sells its spyware to government clients around the world. It has faced intense scrutiny in the US, where the Biden administration in 2021 took the extraordinary step of placing the company on a blacklist and accused it of selling software tools that \u201cenabled foreign governments to conduct transnational repression\u201d. NSO has said it sells its spyware tool \u2013 called Pegasus \u2013 to government clients for use in fighting serious crime, like terrorism, and that it investigates credible allegations of abuse. A spokesperson for NSO said she was \u201cnot aware\u201d of Simonds\u2019s plans. Experts have speculated about NSO\u2019s future since it was added to the US blacklist, which bars the transfer of US technology to the company without a special licence. NSO is also being sued by Apple and Facebook in the US because of allegations that it has targeted the two companies\u2019 users. NSO has argued that its government clients \u2013 not NSO itself \u2013 controls its hacking tools. The Guardian reported in March that one of the company\u2019s original founders \u2013 Omri Lavie \u2013 emerged as NSO\u2019s new majority owner following a protracted legal fight over the group\u2019s future. Simonds then joined the board of Lavie\u2019s Luxembourg-based company, called Dufresne, shortly thereafter with the support of the company\u2019s remaining debt holders. One possible option being mulled by Simonds, sources suggest, would involve buying out remaining debt holders and other creditors and stripping assets like Pegasus \u2013 NSO\u2019s key hacking tool \u2013 out of NSO and transferring it into a new company. One person close to Simonds said the investor was \u201cdeep\u201d in deliberations over a possible takeover of NSO\u2019s assets but had not yet made up his mind about how to proceed because of several \u201churdles\u201d facing any potential deal. Those obstacles include possible resistance by Israeli authorities to any sale of the regulated entity\u2019s assets. The US government would not have a formal say in any deal. The US defence contractor L3Harris engaged in talks last year about a possible takeover of NSO\u2019s surveillance technology, in a deal that would have given an American company control over one of the world\u2019s most sophisticated hacking tools. But White House resistance to the deal ultimately disrupted the talks, after a Biden administration official noted that any such transaction by a major US contractor would raise \u201cserious counter-intelligence and security concerns\u201d. The person close to Simonds said the executive was considering an imminent resignation from the Dufresne board, and was mulling options including legal action in Israel that could potentially pave the way for a sale of NSO\u2019s assets. The person said Simonds had lined up potential investors to finance the possible acquisition of NSO\u2019s assets. Simonds did not respond to the Guardian\u2019s request for comment. Representatives for Wrigley did not respond to a request for comment. Simonds is not a known figure in the cyber industry. The US executive founded and previously served as the chairman of STX Entertainment and is known to have historically courted investors from China and India, as well as having a business dealings in Saudi Arabia. It is far from clear whether Simonds would be able to complete any deal to take over NSO assets but people familiar with his plans say he has privately discussed trying to put NSO\u2019s sought-after technology exclusively in the hands of \u201cFive Eyes\u201d, the intelligence alliance that includes the US, the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand."}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e7013d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/14/from-beckham-to-bale-british-players-real-madrid-jude-bellingham", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": [], "title": "From Beckham to Bale: the history of British players at Real Madrid", "lead": "After his \u00a388.5m move, Jude Bellingham will join a select group of British footballers to play at the Bernab\u00e9u", "author": "Guardian sport", "datePublished": "2023-06-14T13:58:25Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.294197", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/fc1b6b41931ccf82da78ebee51d1bb0fe5d528f2/0_0_5000_3000/500.jpg", "body": "Jude Bellingham will become the latest British player to represent Real Madrid after his move from Borussia Dortmund to the Spanish capital. We look at those that have gone before him. Laurie Cunningham (1979-84) The winger was a pioneer throughout his career. From being the first Black man to play a competitive game for England to being the first Englishman to represent Real Madrid in the professional era, Cunningham created history. He joined for \u00a3950,000 from West Brom in 1979. There were two fine seasons at Real Madrid, winning a league and cup double but a serious knee injury suffered in training meant his flying skills were somewhat reduced. Cunningham\u2019s 44 appearances brought 21 goals and a standing ovation at the Camp Nou after dazzling the Barcelona fans in El Cl\u00e1sico. He would leave permanently in 1984. Cunningham loved the lifestyle and married a Spanish woman. He returned to play for Rayo Vallecano but died in a car accident in 1989 in Madrid. Steve McManaman (1999-2003) McManaman followed in Cunningham\u2019s footsteps, deciding to leave Liverpool behind to sign for Real Madrid on a free transfer in 1999. McManaman immersed himself in the culture and learned Spanish quickly to help settle in his new surroundings. On the pitch he was a success, too, scoring a goal in the Champions League final to help Madrid lift the trophy at Valencia\u2019s expense, in his first season with the club. Despite this, Madrid were keen to get rid of McManaman but he refused to go despite being told he was surplus to requirements. His attitude won over the club and he was reinstated in the first team. He won two La Liga and Champions League titles, maintaining close ties to the club to this day. David Beckham (2003-07) The gal\u00e1ctico\u2019s galatico. When Sir Alex Ferguson decided the time was right Beckham to exit the Old Trafford stage door, there were two main options for him: Madrid or Barcelona. In the end, he chose los blancos, joining the club of Ra\u00fal, Roberto Carlos, Lu\u00eds Figo, Zinedine Zidane and Ronaldo. It should have resulted in a new era of Madrid dominance but he walked away after four years with a solitary La Liga title and no European honours. Like McManaman, Beckham was popular with his teammates, who saw beyond the brand and shirt sales, for his work ethic mixed with incredible ability. The decision to let him leave at the end of the 2006-07 season came early, allowing Beckham to make arrangements to head to MLS. He was out of the team and expecting to end his time in Madrid as a spectator, only for Fabio Capello to bring him back to help a resurgent team win the league title. Michael Owen (2004-05) There was a solitary season for Owen in Madrid. He joined as Beckham and his gal\u00e1cticos teammates, but he never looked like forcing Ronaldo or Raul out of the side. Although Owen was never a regular after his \u00a38m move from Liverpool, he managed 16 goals in 45 appearances at a goals-to-minute ratio that surpassed anyone else in the country. He notched the fourth in a victory over Barcelona but did not settle and was sold to Newcastle in the summer for double what Madrid paid. Owen\u2019s time in Madrid is best remembered for driving to the airport each day to pick up the English papers. \u201cIt took us two months to discover there was a newsstand 50 yards from the hotel,\u201d Owen said. \u201cWe felt right idiots.\u201d Jonathan Woodgate (2004-07) Fellow news-enthusiast Woodgate was another 2004 summer signing. The classy centre-back set Madrid back \u00a313.4m from Newcastle. Unfortunately, his time in Spain was a disaster from start to finish. Injuries meant he did not make a single appearance in his first season. On his belated debut, against Athletic Bilbao, a year later, he scored an own goal and was sent off. That was one of nine league appearances for the club. He was voted the worst signing La Liga signing of the 21st century in a Marca poll. Two years after joining, he left for Middlesbrough on loan, making the deal permanent in 2007. On the upside, he did learn Spanish and would go on to be an international scout for Liverpool in Spain and Portugal. Gareth Bale (2013-22) Four Champions Leagues, one La Liga, one Copa del Rey, two Spanish Super Cups and three European Super Cups would indicate Bale is a Real Madrid great but the final years of his time in Spain left him highly unpopular with fans. Bale scored 81 goals in 176 league appearances in a nine-year spell in Spain after signing for a world-record fee of \u00a385m from Spurs. He scored in three Champions League finals, including a successful penalty in the 2016 shootout. Bale will be best remembered for coming off the bench to score two goals against Liverpool in 2018. His first was an incredible overhead kick. His popularity waned the following season and he almost moved to China in 2019, before returning to Spurs on loan. One issue locals took with Bale was his penchant for golf. He held a banner after qualifying for Euro 2020, saying \u2018Wales, golf, Madrid. In that order\u2019, which did not please Madridistas. A final year in Spain for the 2021-22 season brought very little and he moved to MLS\u2019s Los Angeles for his swansong. Caroline Weir (2022-present) Weir became the first woman and second Scot \u2013 after John Fox Watson\u2019s solo appearance in 1948-49 season \u2013 to play for Real Madrid when she upped sticks from Manchester City in 2022. A move to Madrid was her destiny. Her arrival was announced on social media with footage of her doing kick-ups in the garden as a child with \u2018ZIDANE 5\u2019 on the back of her all-white Real Madrid kit. Nineteen goals in 28 appearances were enough to win Weir the award for the club\u2019s player of the season. In one of her first games, she scored the goal to knock her former employers Manchester City out of the Champions League. Honourable mentions There were three Britons who played for Real Madrid in their amateur era. Charles Wallace played a solitary game on loan for CF Madrid in 1908, on loan from Barcelona. Arthur Johnson, who was born in Ireland, and Guillermo Linney represented the club, in addition to Lindsay, Stampher and Vickerstaff, whose first names are unknown."}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e7013e", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/14/rust-film-shooting-weapons-supervisor-hungover-hannah-gutierrez-reed", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "subCategories": [], "title": "Rust film set weapons supervisor was likely hungover, prosecutors say", "lead": "Prosecutors say Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, charged with involuntary manslaughter, has a history of reckless conduct at work", "author": "Edward Helmore and agency", "datePublished": "2023-06-14T13:57:30Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.294205", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/f70e253c633b3d8e60d37bb83b57b366e3cb493b/0_234_3840_2304/500.jpg", "body": "Prosecutors in a case arising from the 2021 fatal shooting on the set of the movie Rust claim that the weapons supervisor on the production was drinking and smoking marijuana in the evenings during filming \u2013 and she was likely hungover when she loaded a live bullet into the revolver that actor Alec Baldwin used. The accusation was made in a response to a request by attorneys for the gun handler Hannah Gutierrez-Reed to have involuntary manslaughter charges against her dismissed, as her defense condemned what they said were \u201ccharacter assassination\u201d tactics in a mishandled case. But prosecutors in Santa Fe, New Mexico, also said Gutierrez-Reed has a history of reckless conduct at work, arguing that it would be in the public interest for her to \u201cfinally be held accountable\u201d. Witnesses in the case will testify Gutierrez-Reed was \u201cdrinking heavily and smoking marijuana in the evenings during the shooting of Rust\u201d, a new court motion said, adding it\u2019s \u201clikely \u2026 [she] was hungover when she inserted a live bullet into a gun that she knew was going to be used at some point by an actor\u201d, according to the Santa Fe New Mexican. But an attorney for Gutierrez-Reed accused prosecutors of having a weak case and therefore resorting to disguise that. \u201cThe prosecution has abandoned the idea of doing justice and getting to the actual truth apparently,\u201d Jason Bowles, the attorney for Gutierrez-Reed, said. Separately, prosecutors said they will make a decision within 60 days whether to re-charge Baldwin in connection with the October 2021 shooting death of the cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. The actor had been pointing a gun at the cinematographer during a rehearsal when it went off, killing her and wounding the film\u2019s director, Joel Souza. A charge of involuntary manslaughter against Baldwin was dropped in April after prosecutors cited new evidence about the revolver used in the fatal incident and the need for more time to investigate. Claims of political motivation are swirling. The New Mexico district attorney who charged Baldwin was forced to step down from the case in March. Lawyers for Gutierrez-Reed now say the charge against her is \u201ctainted by improper political motives\u201d. Her attorneys also claim that testing of the revolver involved in the shooting amounts to destruction of evidence. But it remains unclear how live rounds ever made it on to the Rust set and into the gun.

The company, which was fined \u00a390m in 2021 for discharging billions of litres of raw sewage into protected coastal waters, was ordered to publish 53 documents by the information commissioner at the end of last year because of the \u201csubstantial and weighty public interest\u201d. But the company said they contained \u201csensitive\u201d internal decision-making processes on a live issue relating to sewage discharges, and has refused to release them. Seven months on from the information commissioner\u2019s order to publish, Southern is taking the case to the first-tier tribunal to appeal against the ruling and to keep the documents secret. First reported in Private Eye, the 53 documents relate to discussion at board level in 2020 and 2021, including agendas and minutes of meetings of the board discussing sewage spills or storm overflows. Ofwat, the industry\u2019s regulator, has promised to apply new scrutiny to the boardrooms of water companies. Southern has tried to cite exceptions under the environmental information request (EIR) rules to defend its decision not to release the documents. But the information commissioner has said the exceptions largely do not apply and there is a public interest in releasing the documents. The company argued that the documents should remain secret because of \u201cthe need to protect Southern Water\u2019s internal processes of deliberation and decision-making and with regard to the sensitivity of the information and the circumstances surrounding the request\u201d. The company said the request for the documents on sewage spills or overflows in 2020-2021 related to live issues and should not be published. But the commissioner said the public interest favoured disclosing the information, and said there was even greater public interest because the company had pleaded guilty in July 2021 to 51 individual offences of discharging sewage illegally. Evidence presented showed the company had presented a picture of compliance to regulators that was deliberately misleading. \u201cSet against this backdrop, the commissioner considers that there is a substantial and weighty public interest in understanding what measures the public authority was taking, during the period covered by the request, to improve its performance and put measures in place to prevent a recurrence of the offences,\u201d the information commissioner has said. Ed Acteson, of the campaign group SOS Whitstable, said: \u201cSouthern is repeatedly saying it is going to be more transparent but we are just not sure that is the case.\u201d He said data on the company\u2019s Beachbuoy app had recently been changed to make it more difficult for the public to see where raw sewage discharges were taking place or their impact. Last year Southern was accused of \u201cenvironmental vandalism\u201d after discharging raw sewage for more than 3,700 hours at 83 bathing water beaches during the first eight days of November alone. The information commissioner said the company operated a monopoly and if customers were dissatisfied with the way wastewater was being handled, they did not have the right to ask another company to handle it instead. \u201cOne of the few powers consumers do have, is to make use of the EIR to seek environmental information such as this and use that information to hold the public authority to account, the information commissioner said.

He loved that part of the world, partly because he loved pretending he could ski, but also because a number of his greatest collectors were based around there, many of whom were friends, too. On this occasion, we went to visit the singer John Denver, who had a bunch of airplanes, from small private jets to this experimental bi-plane. When I saw it, I told Andy to jump in. But those things are actually pretty small and difficult to enter \u2013 it\u2019s not like you can just hop in. Andy couldn\u2019t manage it, so I told him to stand on the other side of the cockpit instead, and angled the lens to make it look as though he was inside the thing. It felt right shooting him in this strange old plane, because so much of our time together was spent travelling. It feels fitting, too, because even though Andy was a quintessentially American artist who never really looked to Europe for inspiration \u2013 from the Campbell\u2019s soup cans to the Brillo pads, he was American to the core \u2013 his work is now so global, there\u2019s almost nowhere in the world that his work hasn\u2019t travelled. His facial expression was a trademark in the photographs that he made public. It\u2019s this perfect neutrality: I\u2019m not happy, but I\u2019m not unhappy either. There was always an ambiguity he wanted to convey \u2013 almost as if it was up to the viewer to decide what he was doing, how was feeling, which \u201cAndy\u201d he was being on that particular day. He was the same in interviews. He would almost never go into detail. Answers were yes, no, or at most a few words here and there. He never wanted to let on what he actually thought. I think he sensed, before his time, the importance of never giving too much away, always keeping something back, out of the public gaze. It\u2019s funny because in private, he was just so different. He could talk about anything, all day long. He was a fantastic conversationalist, especially at a dinner party. There was a sophistication to the way he interacted with the world that I always admired. One thing I treasured about him was his naivety in the face of new things. He and I were the same in that respect: we were never too cool to be amazed by something. Maybe it was a new place, or new food \u2013 but he had an innocent enjoyment of new things that was always so pure. I think we became close because we had so much in common, beyond just our love of art and photography. We were both Catholic boys. We went to similar schools. We shared the same values. And we both had the same work ethic: when we worked, we worked hard; and when we played, we played really hard. Over the course of our friendship, I took more photos of him than I can count. There are a few where he had no idea he was being photographed: it was him without his \u201cAndy\u201d suit on if you like, but I don\u2019t find them more interesting than the others. I like my subjects to know they\u2019re being photographed, to pose a little, because it\u2019s a form of interaction with the photographer that can kind of go anywhere. It\u2019s so much more fascinating to me. I\u2019ve always loved portraiture, whether in a studio or out in the world. So many images are about the surface, but in a portrait, I want to get inside, to understand and express something deeper than an appearance. The first 15 minutes of any portrait session is about waiting until the person reveals themself. I\u2019m clicking the shutter, but I\u2019m usually not taking pictures. I\u2019m talking, asking questions, trying to understand who they are. Only then am I actually capturing that person: no matter what they\u2019re wearing, whether it\u2019s nothing or something really fabulous, it\u2019s only then you truly get to see someone. When that person allows themselves to be vulnerable with you, you can get a great photograph. People often ask me if I miss Andy. But there\u2019s really no time to miss him, because I\u2019m always involved with my photographs of him that I took, looking back at them, arranging them for exhibition, interacting with them and my memory of him.

This was the third year in a row where prolonged serious drought had dried out large parts of the river, said Ruth Mackay, a fisheries project officer from West Cumbria Rivers Trust. \u201cAlready our nature is under stress,\u201d she said. \u201cIf a drought impacts a river, there is usually chance to recover in the succeeding years, but when it happens year after year, it becomes catastrophic for the wildlife that depend on it.\u201d The wildlife habitats of the Derwent catchment are of national importance, designated as both a special area of conservation (SAC) and a site of special scientific interest (SSSI). Natural England\u2019s most recent assessments, conducted earlier this year, indicated the majority of these sensitive habitats were in an \u201cunfavourable condition\u201d even before the current prolonged dry weather. One lifelong Borrowdale resident, Billy Bland, 76, told the Guardian: \u201cThis dry spell is earlier and longer than I can remember. I don\u2019t remember the beck ever being as low.\u201d Warmer water carries less oxygen, while low water levels raise the concentration of river pollutants, such as sewage and agricultural runoff. These factors \u201caffect the whole of the ecosystem from the insects that live in the water to the fish, right through to the otters and the birds\u201d, said Mackay. Mackay singled out salmon for particular concern. She said water temperatures of 22-24C were potentially fatal for the fish, already in decline nationally. \u201cWe think climate change has a lot to answer for,\u201d said Mackay, pointing to an increased frequency of extreme weather events, including droughts. But in Borrowdale, she said, the negative effects of the climate crisis were compounded by modifications to the river system, made over centuries, mostly with the aim of draining farmland. Parts of the Derwent and its tributaries now run dead straight, with the river perched on the edge of the valley. Rather than occupying its natural flood plain, Mackay said, the river had been turned into a \u201crapid conveyor of water\u201d, making it less resilient to drought and flooding. In recent years, West Cumbria Rivers Trust has been partnering with the National Trust, a major landowner in Borrowdale, to enact solutions. . Stream restoration work has taken place at Stonethwaite, towards the south end of Borrowdale, while further downriver, at Dunthwaite, new ponds have been built and black poplars, an important wetland tree that has all but disappeared from Cumbria, have been successfully introduced. Interventions are also under way on the high fells. Restored peak bogs act as powerful sponges for water, improving water security in all seasons. \u201cThis [habitat restoration work] not only helps the river and all the plants and wildlife which rely on it, but it also provides sustainable drinking water for livestock. Storing water in the landscape in this way not only makes it more resilient to drought and wildfire, but to flooding also,\u201d said Rebecca Powell, the National Trust\u2019s Riverlands project manager. Low water levels have been reported elsewhere in the UK, including in the Scottish Highlands, and the UK Met Office recently warned of a 2.3 times increased risk of Britain experiencing a possible repeat of 2022\u2019s record-breaking heatwave. Another Borrowdale resident, Maurice Pankhurst, who recently retired after 24 years as the National Trust\u2019s woodland ranger for the north, told the Guardian: \u201cIf water is important to this country we have to change the way our uplands are currently being managed.\u201d At present, \u201cwater passes through [Borrowdale] like an express train\u201d, he said. \u201cThe whole process needs to be slowed down.\u201d"}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e70142", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/14/arsenal-chelsea-kai-havertz-nicolas-jackson-villarreal", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": [], "title": "Arsenal keen on signing Kai Havertz with Chelsea set to demand fee of \u00a370m", "lead": "Arsenal have emerged as strong contenders to sign Kai Havertz from Chelsea, who are looking for a fee of \u00a370m for the Germany international", "author": "Jacob Steinberg", "datePublished": "2023-06-14T13:30:35Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.294240", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/5aabb3280df28cbbc19e2eb23c0f04be0e65b867/0_65_2574_1544/500.jpg", "body": "Arsenal have emerged as strong contenders to sign Kai Havertz from Chelsea.

They are willing to sell Havertz, who moved to Stamford Bridge for \u00a362.5m three years ago, and are looking for a fee of \u00a370m. Chelsea need to recoup funds after spending close to \u00a3600m on players since last summer. They are set to sell Mateo Kovacic to Manchester City and Mason Mount to Manchester United, while N\u2019Golo Kante is moving to Al-Itihhad on a free transfer. Havertz has offered flashes of class but little consistency since joining Chelsea. The 23-year-old scored the winner in the Champions League final in 2021 and in the Club World Cup final last season.

Arsenal, who are close to bolstering their midfield with the signing of West Ham\u2019s Declan Rice, could give Havertz a chance to use his creativity and play in attacking midfield more. It remains to be seen whether Chelsea would sell to their London rivals. Their options may be limited if Madrid manage to sign either Harry Kane from Tottenham or Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 from Paris Saint-Germain. Much of the focus for Chelsea is on outgoings but they are targeting reinforcements in a few positions. They want a new goalkeeper and have looked at Internazionale\u2019s Andr\u00e9 Onana and Milan\u2019s Mike Maignan. Midfield targets include Brighton\u2019s Mois\u00e9s Caicedo and Celta Vigo\u2019s Gabri Veiga, while talks have been held over moving for Southampton\u2019s Rom\u00e9o Lavia. Arsenal are also interested in Lavia. Chelsea want to sign a striker and their ambitious targets include Napoli\u2019s Victor Osimhen and Inter\u2019s Lautaro Mart\u00ednez. They are also interested in Jackson, who scored 13 goals for Villarreal last season. Bayern and Aston Villa are also interested in the 21-year-old Senegal international, who failed a medical at Bournemouth in January.

The two companies are the UK\u2019s third- and fourth-biggest operators respectively. The newly combined company will, if the merger is completed, have more than 27 million subscribers, leapfrogging EE, owned by BT, and Virgin Media O2, owned by Spain\u2019s Telef\u00f3nica and the US-listed company Liberty Global. The deal is likely to face close scrutiny from competition regulators, although last year the UK telecoms regulator, Ofcom, changed its long-held stance, saying it was now more open to consolidation in the sector. It had previously argued that dropping to only three networks in a country could harm consumers. In 2016 the CMA and the European Commission blocked Three\u2019s attempted takeover of O2, arguing that it would have risked higher prices. The government is also likely to \u201ccall in\u201d the deal for scrutiny under the National Security and Investment Act 2021, which allow ministers to block transactions linked to important national assets if they are deemed to harm national security, as Vodafone UK has a number of government contracts. The union Unite said the deal should be blocked over concerns about foreign joint ownership of a key national asset \u2013 Three UK is owned by Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison \u2013 as well as the possibility of job cuts and higher prices. Vodafone, which has been heavily criticised for implementing above-inflation price rises for consumers, announced last month that the company planned to cut 11,000 jobs over the next three years. Gail Cartmail, the executive head of operations at Unite, said: \u201cThis deal will give a company with deep ties to the Chinese state an even more prominent place at the heart of the UK\u2019s telecommunications infrastructure. \u201cOn top of that, it will hike people\u2019s bills and mean job losses for Vodafone and Three workers. The government must step in and stop this reckless merger and Unite is building a cross-party coalition to demand they do so.\u201d The two companies may look to sweeten their position with regulators by emulating an offer made by Three and O2, as part of their ultimately failed deal to merge, to freeze prices for UK consumers for five years. Rivals are also likely to call for the new combined entity to give up some of its valuable 5G mobile spectrum, and to allow rivals such as Sky, TalkTalk and other brands that do not own their own infrastructure on to their network. Margherita Della Valle, Vodafone\u2019s group chief executive, described the merger of Vodafone UK and Three UK as being \u201cgreat for customers, great for the country and great for competition\u201d, in a stock market announcement published on Wednesday. Talks between Vodafone and Three have been running since autumn. Vodafone will have 51% and CK Hutchison will have 49% of the combined business. Under the plans, which include a pledge to invest \u00a311bn in the UK over 10 years, Vodafone has an option to buy up CK Hutchison\u2019s stake three years after completion, which is expected by the end of 2024. Kester Mann, the consumer and connectivity director at CCS Insight, said: \u201cThis long-awaited mega-merger represents the biggest shake-up in the UK mobile market for over a decade. \u201cThis deal will still face a major challenge to win approval. Blocking it could thwart the long-term development of the UK\u2019s telecoms infrastructure. At this stage, I believe it is too difficult to call either way.\u201d Completing the merger will be the first big task for Della Valle, who was appointed in April to replace Nick Read. Read had struggled to arrest a long decline in Vodafone\u2019s share price from above \u00a32.50 in 2015 to below 75p in June. Vodafone is a member of the FTSE 100, with a market value of about \u00a320bn. However, it has come under pressure from activist investors, including the French telecoms billionaire Xavier Niel, whose investment vehicle in September said it wanted Vodafone to \u201cpursue consolidation opportunities\u201d. The Emirati telecoms group e&amp; recently upped its stake to 14.6%. The Swedish investor Cevian had also bought shares in the company to push for change but had reportedly sold most of it by the time the Three talks were disclosed. CK Hutchison also owns interests in ports, retail and infrastructure, such as a UK train leasing company and Northumbrian Water."}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e70144", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/14/home-secretary-suella-braverman-faces-legal-action-anti-protest-police-powers-liberty", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": [], "title": "Suella Braverman faces legal action after forcing through anti-protest powers", "lead": "Liberty writes to home secretary saying she acted unlawfully because parliament had rejected measures", "author": "Damien Gayle", "datePublished": "2023-06-14T13:08:51Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.294259", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/cf30165e768a4916e0d0c8d8976377418da96f40/0_0_3500_2100/500.jpg", "body": "Human rights campaigners have begun legal action against the home secretary, Suella Braverman, after she forced draconian new police powers through parliament in a move described by the House of Lords as a \u201cconstitutional outrage\u201d. Liberty wrote to Braverman on Wednesday, saying her move to empower police to curtail or restrict protests that caused \u201cmore than minor\u201d disruption was unlawful. This week the government used secondary legislation, which is subject to less parliamentary scrutiny, to grant police the power. An attempt to include it as a late amendment to the recent Public Order Act 2023 failed to pass the Lords in January. Braverman told MPs on Wednesday the new powers would enable police to take quicker action against slow-walking protests and those that brought \u201cchaos to the law-abiding majority\u201d. But in its pre-action letter, the first step to a judicial review, Liberty said her move violated the constitutional principle of the separation of powers, because the measures had already been rejected by parliament. Katy Watts, a lawyer for the human rights organisation, said: \u201cThe home secretary has sidelined parliament to sneak in new legislation via the back door, despite not having the powers to do so. \u201cThis has been done deliberately in a way which enables the government to circumvent parliament \u2013 who voted these same proposals down just a few months ago \u2013 and is a flagrant breach of the separation of powers that exist in our constitution. \u201cWe\u2019ve launched this legal action to ensure this overreach is checked, and that the government is not allowed to put itself above the law to do whatever it wants. It\u2019s really important the government respects the law and that today\u2019s decision is reversed immediately.\u201d The Home Office confirmed it had received Liberty\u2019s letter. A spokesperson said: \u201cThe right to protest is a fundamental part of our democracy but we must also protect the law-abiding majority\u2019s right to go about their daily lives. That is why have introduced a new definition of serious disruption, to give police the confidence they need to clear roads quickly. The was voted on by both the House of Commons and House of Lords, following proper parliamentary procedure.\u201d The regulations, a response to daily roads protests by climate activists, lower the threshold for what constitutes \u201cserious disruption\u201d to the public from \u201csignificant\u201d and \u201cprolonged\u201d to \u201cmore than minor\u201d. One legal expert has suggested the change will give police \u201cnear total discretion\u201d over which protests to allow and which to curtail. Liberty says the regulations now give police \u201calmost unlimited powers\u201d to stop protests Braverman said on Monday that the public had \u201clost their patience\u201d with Just Stop Oil, the climate activist group that has staged 156 slow marches in London in the past six weeks. \u201cThe police must be able to stop this happening and it\u2019s our job in government to give them the powers to do so,\u201d she told the Commons as it passed the measure. But the use of secondary legislation to push through a rejected proposal has prompted accusations that the government is flouting democracy by playing fast and loose with constitutional laws. A cross-party committee of peers recently said it was the first time a government had tried such a move. Secondary legislation is law created by ministers under powers given to them by acts of parliament. It is used to fill in the details of acts, so they can be swiftly adapted to changing circumstances. But increasing use of secondary legislation to fill in so-called \u201cskeleton bills\u201d has led to concerns of a shift in power towards the executive. On Tuesday night, peers accused the Home Office of authoritarian and disreputable behaviour as they backed, by 177 votes to 141, a so-called regret motion proposed by Labour that criticised the process and urged the withdrawal of the provisions. Vernon Coaker, Labour\u2019s home affairs spokesperson in the Lords, said: \u201cIt is an absolute fundamental constitutional outrage, what has actually taken place. Primary legislation was defeated. So what does the government do? It doesn\u2019t bring forward new primary legislation; it tries to sneak through, in an underhand way, secondary legislation without proper public consultation. They undermine the workings of our parliamentary democracy and, as such, it is shocking.\u201d A rare fatal motion brought by Jenny Jones of the Green party that aimed to kill off the regulations was defeated by 154 to 68. Labour had refused to back it, despite calls from Lady Jones and a 64,000-strong petition. The crossbench peer David Pannick KC also called the government\u2019s move a constitutional outrage. The leading constitutional lawyer added: \u201cAll we can do \u2026 is express regret: we are very sorry about this. \u201cWell, I express regret that the Labour frontbench is not prepared to see through the implications of its own view that this is a constitutional outrage. It is something that we should stand up against and vote against.\u201d"}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e70145", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/14/itv-carolyn-mccall-denies-management-turned-blind-eye-phillip-schofield-affair", "primaryCategory": "business", "subCategories": [], "title": "ITV boss denies management turned \u2018blind eye\u2019 to Phillip Schofield affair ", "lead": "Carolyn McCall tells MPs there was no commercial motivation behind lack of formal investigation of claims", "author": "Mark Sweney Media business correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-06-14T13:05:19Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.294266", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/353fff6d49bac6dab1bf55a3ab91bab171311cc2/0_146_2336_1400/500.jpg", "body": "The chief executive of ITV has denied that management may have been motivated to cover up Phillip Schofield\u2019s affair with a younger member of staff to avoid potentially commercially harming its flagship This Morning programme. Schofield quit This Morning after admitting that he had lied about an \u201cunwise, but not illegal\u201d affair, prompting accusations from former presenters such as Piers Morgan and Eamonn Holmes that the relationship had been known about throughout the broadcaster but no action had been taken. Appearing before the Commons culture, media and sport committee, ITV\u2019s chief executive, Carolyn McCall, was asked by the committee chair, Caroline Dinenage, if management had turned a \u201cblind eye\u201d to pursuing an investigation when rumours first emerged to protect against the potential commercial fallout for ITV. \u201c[Not investigating] had nothing to do with This Morning being commercially successful,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were trying to ask and did ask questions, repeatedly and continuously, and we were repeatedly told there was nothing happening. No one here on the management board would ever turn a blind eye to something as serious as this. If we had known at the time we would have taken action swiftly.\u201d McCall repeatedly told the select committee of MPs that management had conducted an \u201congoing review\u201d whenever rumours emerged in the press or internally about Schofield, but there was never enough evidence to move to a formal investigation. \u201cPeople who have said they knew would only have heard rumours about it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is not in our interest in any way not to have investigated something if we had evidence. We didn\u2019t have any legal grounds to do that.\u201d McCall said that comments by former staff such as Holmes, who tweeted that ITV management was \u201cguilty\u201d for knowing about Schofield but not taking action, were \u201cactually defamatory, never mind anything else, but we would never say that as it would just inflame the situation\u201d. Kevin Lygo, the managing director of media and entertainment at ITV, said attacks by the likes of Holmes, Morgan and others were a case of sour grapes from disgruntled ex-presenters. \u201cPresenters of programmes have a slight feeling they have a divine right to stay there for ever. They have generally been loyal servants to ITV. It is not surprising, is it, that when they go it\u2019s: \u2018I hate ITV, it is awful,\u2019 when for a decade or more they were enjoying the job, reaping the rewards?\u201d McCall said that in the time since management became aware of the rumours about Schofield\u2019s relationship with \u201cPerson X\u201d, after a December 2019 newspaper article suggesting a \u201cclose friendship\u201d with a staff member on This Morning, the company had asked the young male runner 12 times formally and informally about the rumours. \u201cWe have logs of the conversations; in each stage he categorically denied it,\u201d said Kyla Mullins, the general counsel and company secretary at ITV. Schofield was also asked about it on numerous occasions, directly and via his agents at YMU, which has dropped the presenter. Schofield repeatedly denied a relationship until late last month. Lygo detailed a conversation minutes before Schofield went on air in February 2020 to reveal he was gay. \u201cIs there anything you want to tell me that we should know that has prompted this?\u201d he recalled asking the presenter. \u201cHe categorically said: \u2018No, there is nothing.\u2019 That was it really.\u201d McCall denied repeated accusations that there was a \u201ctoxic\u201d workplace culture at ITV, not helped by a flippant remark by the This Morning editor, Martin Frizell, last week that he found aubergines toxic. \u201cIt was ill-advised, Martin made a mistake,\u201d said McCall. \u201cI don\u2019t think what Martin said in the heat of the moment is reflective of our culture.\u201d ITV said its human resources team had dealt with 128 complaints in the past five years across the whole business.

The chief executive of TSB, which produced the forecast, has written to the US tech company calling on it to take urgent action to address the soaring levels of fraud on social media. An increasing number of banks and campaigners are calling on Meta to make urgent changes amid concerns about the company\u2019s efforts to police its platforms. TSB has set out five steps on Wednesday that it wants the company to take to protect consumers: Introducing a secure payment method on Facebook Marketplace. Stopping unregulated firms in the UK using Facebook and Instagram to advertise financial products and investments, including cryptocurrencies. Committing to investigating and removing fraudulent content within 24 hours. Filtering and blocking \u201cobviously fraudulent\u201d posts, for example those using terms such as \u201ccrypto offer\u201d. Flagging to WhatsApp users when they are contacted by new numbers and advising them to check the contact is genuine. The new projections from TSB, based on industry data and current fraud levels, predict scams originating on Meta platforms could account for up to \u00a3250m of losses to UK households in 2023 from push payments \u2013 when a person or business is tricked into sending money to a fraudster advertising goods or a service for sale. It estimates more than 70,000 purchase fraud cases took place on Facebook Marketplace last year, a classified ads site where individuals or small businesses offer goods for sale, amounting to almost 200 incidents a day. The bank has previously urged Meta to share the responsibility for compensating victims who have been scammed on Facebook, WhatsApp or Instagram. It wants Meta to introduce a secure payment mechanism. At present, Marketplace transactions do not go through a recognised payments system, and payments can take place directly from a victim to a fraudster. \u201cProviding such a platform could significantly reduce Marketplace fraud,\u201d TSB said. Paul Davis, the director of fraud prevention at TSB, said: \u201cMeta needs to face up to its responsibility: it has a duty of care to the millions of customers who use its platforms, which is all the more important when we see innocent people lose life-changing sums every day. \u201cWe have written to Meta demanding it puts in place the tech interventions urgently required to stem the tide of fraud and protect the many consumers who put faith in its services.\u201d Responding to the TSB projections, a Meta spokesperson said: \u201cThis is an industry-wide issue and scammers are using increasingly sophisticated methods to defraud people in a range of ways including email, SMS and offline. \u201cWe don\u2019t want anyone to fall victim to these criminals which is why our platforms already have systems to block scams, financial services advertisers now have to be FCA authorised to target UK users and we run consumer awareness campaigns on how to spot fraudulent behaviour. \u201cPeople can also report this content in a few simple clicks and we work with the police to support their investigations.\u201d Previous figures released by TSB, published last month, showed a large increase in the number of scams originating from Meta-owned sites and apps, which account for 80% of cases within the bank\u2019s three largest fraud categories: impersonation, purchase and investment. Meanwhile, separate research by Lloyds found that more than two-thirds of online shopping scams affecting UK consumers started on Facebook and Instagram. The bank described social media as a \u201cwild west\u201d for fraud. Research from Lloyds Banking Group estimates one person in the UK falls victim to a purchase scam originating on one of the two Meta-owned platforms every seven minutes \u2013 costing consumers more than \u00a3500,000 a week. Lloyds echoed TSB\u2019s call for Meta to take financial responsibility for scams perpetrated through its platforms, saying tech companies needed to contribute to refunds when their sites were used \u201cto defraud innocent victims\u201d. UK Finance, which represents the banking sector, has also said social media companies should reimburse victims of online fraud. The industry body\u2019s chief executive, David Postings, accused the tech firms of \u201cprofiting\u201d from scams on their platforms. Figures from the latest UK Finance fraud report show that 78% of authorised push-payment scams, where a victim is tricked into approving a transaction, started online in the second half of last year, with about three-quarters of those beginning on social media."}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e70147", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/14/us-gun-violence-student-children-deaths-high-school-graduation", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "subCategories": [], "title": "Empty seats at US graduations reveal toll of gun violence: \u2018We\u2019re losing our kids\u2019", "lead": "When students are struck down by firearms, some parents take the emotional walk to accept diplomas for their slain children", "author": "Aben\u00e9 Clayton", "datePublished": "2023-06-14T13:00:04Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.294282", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/2e8281910f539e0243a806dec6b596425f08054d/1003_680_3935_2360/500.jpg", "body": "Across the US, high school graduations are serving dual roles as rites of passage for teenagers entering adulthood and memorials for those who were killed \u2013 often with guns \u2013 before they could don their caps and gowns. Amid rows of optimistic graduates are empty seats adorned with regalia or grieving parents who are there to walk the stage and accept diplomas on their children\u2019s behalf. Some of the youths were killed before they reached their senior year, others in the days, weeks or months leading to their graduation. The unoccupied seats in auditoriums and photos of smiling young faces shown on large screens serve as a stark reminder of the growing risk of gun injury and death that teenagers face and the far-reaching impact that these losses have on their families and peers. \u201cWe\u2019re losing our kids too early, they\u2019re not even able to finish high school, and that has an impact on the student body as a whole,\u201d said Chalinda Hatcher, whose daughter Shamara Young was shot and killed in Oakland, California, in 2021. Hatcher already planned to order a cap and gown to place next to her daughter\u2019s urn, but when she went to buy them, school administrators at Fremont high school in east Oakland told her not to, because they already had something planned for her. \u201cI really was appreciative because they remembered,\u201d Hatcher said, but \u201cit brought everything back to the forefront \u2026 the fact that she\u2019s not here, that she was taken away so violently and not able to graduate, it\u2019s in your face.\u201d Hatcher sat among her daughter\u2019s classmates during the ceremony. When she stood to walk across the stage, she was so overcome with emotion that her 13-year-old son ran down from the audience to walk alongside her. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I was gonna be so emotional. I was just being so strong and putting up such a front that when I was there all of that went away.\u201d Hatcher\u2019s experience was mirrored across the nation this graduation season by people who also lost young family members to homicide. In Lansing, Michigan, two parents accepted their daughters\u2019 posthumously awarded diplomas. One of the students was Arianna DeLa Cruz, a 17-year-old who was shot and killed in 2021 while on her way to the store to pick up diapers for a friend\u2019s baby, according to the Lansing State Journal. The other student, 17-year-old Allayah Walker-Travis, was shot and killed in February 2022. Her 16-year-old boyfriend has been arrested and charged with the killing, Fox 47 reported. While some of the students, like Shamara, were killed years before they reached their senior year, others were killed in the days \u2013 or even hours \u2013 before their graduation ceremonies. In Fresno, California, 18-year-old Zoe Salinas was shot and killed the night before she was due to get her diploma. Her sister then accepted it in her honor. Salinas\u2019s 19-year-old boyfriend has been arrested for shooting the teen, ABC 30 reported. And on 31 May, less than 12 hours before his peers would wake up to get ready for their commencement, 18-year-old Billy Scott Jr died after being shot while sitting in a car in Sacramento, California. Scott\u2019s father donned his son\u2019s blue graduation gown and received a diploma on the teenager\u2019s behalf. \u201cI know that\u2019s what he wanted so bad, I was so proud to put on that cap and gown and represent him \u2026 because that\u2019s me.\u201d Billy Scott Sr told CBS Sacramento. \u201cIt was tragic and it\u2019s sad \u2026 He was at a place of completion and moving on,\u201d said Ezell Humphrey-Grant, the program manager and field coordinator for Movement 4 Life, a violence prevention nonprofit in Sacramento. Humphrey-Grant was one of several community members who helped Scott\u2019s family and friends get mental health support, grief services and even food in the days after the killing. He says it gives families \u201ca sense of belonging\u201d to participate in their children\u2019s graduation ceremonies. \u201cYou can let the family know that they\u2019re supported,\u201d he said. And for other teens, seeing a parent have to stand in for their deceased child could hopefully steer the young people who knew them or heard their story away from the cycle of gun violence. \u201cThey want change,\u201d Humphrey-Grant said of local teens. \u201cIt\u2019s sad that it\u2019s these situations that spark change but we have to be there for them because they\u2019re losing their friends and family, and the kids are getting tired of it.\u201d He pointed out that Billy had just won a state championship with Grant high school, and had a promising career ahead of him.

His books proclaimed themselves in the mind\u2019s ear, setting it thrumming and rumbling, piercing it with cries. He listened harder to prose, and thought more about its prosody, than anyone since Melville. He first outgrew, then radically exceeded, the dying falls of Faulkner\u2019s cadences. His phrasing could be great page-long peals of thunder (the attack of the Comanches in the fourth chapter of Blood Meridian, say), wire-bright flashes of lightning (\u201cThe stars burned with a lidless fixity\u201d), anaphoras that came to act as refrains across whole books (\u201cThey rode on\u201d; \u201cThey walked on\u201d), right down to the tender \u201cOK\u201d which is passed back and forth between father and son in The Road. The most important word in McCarthy\u2019s lexicon was perhaps the least conspicuous: \u201cand\u201d. That little conjunction paratactically strung together the atrocious and the mundane, the ultra-violent and the kind. Morally, it had a similar power to the desert light that McCarthy describes as falling with \u201cstrange equality\u201d upon \u201call phenomena\u201d. Historiographically, it enacted McCarthy\u2019s bleak view of human history: repetition, recursion, the illusion of progress, the endless beats of a death-drum sounded in the dark backward and abysm of time. *** Stephen King: \u2018There is no way to convey the loss I feel\u2019 American author of horror and fantasy novels Early this year, while Cormac McCarthy was still alive, I had an idea for a story called The Dreamers. I wrote it while reading Cormac McCarthy\u2019s penultimate book, The Passenger. The story that emerged was very much under the influence of McCarthy\u2019s prose. I was, in fact, almost hypnotised by The Passenger, as I was when reading such McCarthy novels as All the Pretty Horses and his masterpiece, Blood Meridian. Because my story was very much in McCarthy\u2019s style, I dedicated it to him. Every story is a locked door. Sometimes \u2013 not always, but sometimes \u2013 style is the key that opens it. That was the case with The Dreamers. At one point in it I wrote this: He looked like a bird colonel I knew over there in that other world watching through his binoculars as the F-100Ds and Super Sabres of the 352nd came in low over Bien Hoa, pregnant with the firejelly they would drop in an orange curtain, burning a miscarriage in the green, turning part of the overstory to ash and skeleton palms. The men and women too, them calling nahn tu, nahn tu to no one who could hear or care if they did. This is not McCarthy, I simply do not have his talent, but it would have been an impossible passage to write, or even think of, without him. It shows not just his influence but the spell he cast over both his readers and those writers of lesser abilities who admired his work. He was, simply put, the last great white male American novelist. Although his prose undoubtedly owes something to William Faulkner, he eventually became Faulkner\u2019s equal, if not his superior. From Blood Meridian (1985) on, his prose takes on an almost biblical quality, hallucinatory in its effect and evangelical in its power. If you have read him, you understand. If you have not, there is no way to convey the loss I feel even though he died at a good age, a patriarch\u2019s age, and did his work with a patriarch\u2019s unflinching strength. He is a loss to the American imagination, but as McCarthy himself might have said, \u201cI gave you the books and the books remain, undimmed and undaunted.\u201d *** Annie Proulx: \u2018He taught readers to face up to existence\u2019 American novelist and short story writer More than sorrow I feel gratitude for the works of this extraordinary writer who, in presenting the darker human impulses in his rich prose, showed readers the necessity of facing up to existence. *** Benjamin Myers: \u2018I was so moved by The Road that I unexpectedly proposed to my partner\u2019 British author of novels including Cuddy and The Perfect Golden Circle. An adaptation of his novel The Gallows Pole is now showing on BBC Two I was something of a latecomer to Cormac McCarthy. For reasons unknown, I didn\u2019t read him until I immersed myself in The Road over Christmas 2008 while snowbound in a cottage in a particularly remote corner of the Yorkshire Dales. Sometimes subject, writing style and environment all conspire to provide the perfect reading experience, something that changes your understanding of what literature can do and sends the imagination off in a whole new direction. This was it. I was so moved by the novel that I unexpectedly proposed to my partner upon its completion; no one was more surprised than I was to hear the words coming out of my mouth. But such is the power of this writer who only ever dealt in the two grand themes: life and death. From the gothic grotesque of his early novels such as Outer Dark and Child of God, in which Appalachian Tennessee is seen as a living hell far worse than any biblical depiction, through the sprawling, uncharacteristically funny and arguably underrated Suttree and on to the recent purple patch that produced The Passenger and Stella Maris, McCarthy wrote with an unprecedented power. His understanding of language suggested he knew full well that literature is a process of dark magic, each new novel necessitating a unique vocabulary from which to cast a spell: poetry as a dangerous weapon and a form of seduction. We can only guess that this is what he thought, as the other admirable trait beyond his creative abilities was McCarthy\u2019s complete disregard for the notion of \u201cbeing a writer\u201d. This meant no press interviews, no festival appearances, no humiliatingly attended in-store signings. To the outside world he was a hermit but to many of us he was living the dream. In an industry where the writer is expected to be a raconteur and entertainer, as readily available to please as a performing seal, his is an output that presents a strong argument against all that soul-draining distraction. Only a man who hid himself away from the world could have written Blood Meridian. A writer does not create immortal work by being doing what they are told. Cormac McCarthy did what he wanted. Such creative freedom and linguistic daring ensures that his contribution to the world is a body of work that will sing down the centuries. *** Ridley Scott: \u2018He reminded me of Joyce with his Ulysses\u2019 British film director and producer Cormac is sadly gone. One of the great American authors of the past century who wrote such visceral encounters with unforgettable imagery. A poet on every level, with even the most mundane \u201cuniverses\u201d reminding me of Joyce with his Ulysses. I worked with him twice. On a very good adaptation of Blood Meridian, but no one had the balls to go for it. The Counselor was also not for the fainthearted, but he wrote the best dialogue I have ever encountered. One of my proudest creations: how else would one attach such a formidable cast? He leaves great memories with all his work. *** Anne Enright: \u2018He worked close to some religious impulse\u2019 Irish author of The Gathering and Making Babies: Stumbling into Motherhood Cormac McCarthy was such a virtuoso, his language was so rich and new, it made his books almost bearable. To read his work was to suffer a slow accumulation of hurt and horror: it was, for me, an uncomfortable, almost masochistic experience, heightened by the scope and fury of his vision. McCarthy worked close to some religious impulse, his books were terrifying and absolute. His sentences were astonishing. *** Sebastian Junger: \u2018Not only does he have the language, he\u2019s got the soul\u2019 American journalist, author and film-maker I think he\u2019s completely by himself among contemporary authors, it\u2019s as if they put Mount Everest down in the Appalachians. Not only does he have the vision, he has the language. And not only does he have the language, he\u2019s got the soul. I\u2019m guessing he wrote The Passenger and Stella Maris knowing they would be his final communication; they\u2019re about these sorts of thresholds, experiences between life and death. They got a totally mixed reception, and I have the feeling he didn\u2019t really give a shit: he wrote what he felt he had to write, to complete the circle of his life and his work. *** Erica Wagner: \u2018He carried the fire of imagination\u2019 Author and critic Cormac McCarthy\u2019s poetic, menacing vision may not have completely defined the contemporary American literary landscape but it came close; and its sense of roiling anarchy, conveyed in prose that combined plain speaking with the biblically ornate, seems prescient now. \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as life without bloodshed,\u201d he told the New York Times magazine in a (very rare) interview. His crowning achievements - the violent, gorgeous Border Trilogy, The Road and No Country for Old Men - will endure. He carried the fire of imagination through his books, and as he would have wished, it will remain alight. *** Thomas Keneally: \u2018He was a very arresting writer\u2019 Australian novelist, playwright, essayist and actor McCarthy was a great apocalyptic writer but there was a sense of the old Celtic sagas in the way men, in particular, clashed in his books. He had a very fragile trust in the angelic nature of humanity and he was obsessed, like all good ruined Celts, with the tension between the angelic and brutal nature of humankind. No one wrote about this dichotomy better than him. He was a very arresting writer; very violent, perhaps too much so. He had this darkness to him but a sense of the human comedy as well, which comes through in No Country for Old Men, where the old sheriff, who doesn\u2019t get much of a run in the movie, says: \u201cYou know the good thing about old age? It doesn\u2019t last long.\u201d *** Travis Elborough: \u2018He wrote humanely about misfits and twisted outsiders\u2019 British writer and cultural historian McCarthy was an author who always wrestled with the big issues. His novels raised serious questions about life and death, the nature of evil, moral choice, the allure of violence, the passing of traditions and the future of the planet. He wrote humanely about misfits and twisted outsiders. His books were peopled by bootleggers, drug-runners, swindlers, incestuous siblings, child-killers, scalp-hunters, mass murderers and necrophiliacs, and examined some of the very darkest deeds of which human beings are capable. But he refused to paint the world in simple binaries. His novels were often blood-soaked with bad things happening to seemingly good people, and the bad, mad and dangerous to know appearing to come good in the end. He was always something of a literary outlaw, eschewing the trappings of fame and the book world. His exchange with Oprah Winfrey about The Road, the dystopian novel that earned him the Pulitzer prize, makes for rather painful viewing. For years he toiled in virtual obscurity, sustained by the faith in his abilities and the belief in the power of his stories to reach an audience. That faith and his continued commitment to his craft, even through periods of genuine financial hardship, paid off handsomely."}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e70149", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/14/las-vegas-wanted-the-nhl-and-now-the-city-has-the-stanley-cup", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": [], "title": "Las Vegas wanted the NHL.

The Black Knights, the Knights, and the Neon Knights were all among the early choices. But only the Knights made it past the second round of voting, proving less popular than Scorpions and the eventual winner, the Outlaws. The Knights name \u2013 and variations of it \u2013 wasn\u2019t a winner. It is now. The Vegas Golden Knights are Stanley Cup champions, taking home the coveted trophy with a commanding 9-3 win over the Florida Panthers Tuesday evening in Las Vegas. And while the speed with which the Golden Knights have climbed to the top of the NHL has been surprising, to many (this was the franchise\u2019s second visit to the Final in its first six years of existence) it\u2019s exactly what team owner Bill Foley promised in 2017. It was a bold prediction, given the only other team to ever do it were the Edmonton Oilers with some kid named Wayne Gretzky. But six years later, here we are. We were almost here sooner. Vegas made an improbable storybook run to the Finals against the Washington Capitals in their inaugural season in 2018, only to lose the Cup on home ice. And while Vegas has remained a contender since that time, only missing the playoffs once since they joined the league, the road the team traveled wasn\u2019t necessarily shining with glory. In their dogged pursuit of a championship, Vegas established a reputation in the NHL as a team willing to disrupt locker room cohesion, spend with almost wanton abandon, and ship off perfectly good players for what seemed at the time little potential gain \u2013 guys like Nate Schmidt or Marc-Andre Fleury. On Tuesday, the Knights could call on just five of the original 20 players they took on at their formation. It was evidence of relatively high turnover in an relentless pursuit of either a winning team or, viewed more cynically, cap space. Few will argue now that those many moves over the years weren\u2019t worth it. The Golden Knights stretched their wallets wide open, with eight starting players making more than $5m this season, including Jack Eichel, Mark Stone, and Alex Pietrangelo, who are signed at over $8m a year each over long stretches. But those moves also meant there were already nine Stanley Cup rings on the Vegas bench at the start of Tuesday\u2019s game \u2013 experience that did, in the end, pay dividends for the Golden Knights. Their win over Florida was nearly total, rampaging the Panthers in much the same way the latter had teams in the East down the stretch. Their approach was simple and effective, including physical play that frustrated a Panthers team that had, to this point, been able to run roughshod over opponents. Vegas also boasts perhaps the best defensive corps in the league, which protected goaltender Adin Hill and destroyed Florida\u2019s power play. The Panthers had been able to convert roughly a third of the time with the man advantage in their previous three rounds but they failed to score a single goal on the power play against Vegas. Tuesday night was a perfect example of Vegas\u2019 dominance. Florida looked as if they were playing short-handed the entire game, and to some extent they were. After exiting Game 4 with a mystery injury (and only returning briefly to the ice), Panthers star forward Matthew Tkachuk was a scratch for Game 5. Tkachuk had been a key factor for the Panthers through the first three rounds, leading his team in many core stat categories and, arguably, single-handedly giving Florida a semblance of depth. His absence was no doubt part of the reason Florida looked unlike the team that had dispensed so easily with Boston, Toronto, and Carolina. But in reality, Florida had had difficulty solving Vegas even with Tkachuk in the lineup. The somewhat chaotic style of offence Florida had used to great success for three rounds was suddenly ineffective against good defence and a goalie on as hot a streak as Bobrovsky (who Vegas had already chased from his net on their way to a 7-2 win in Game 2). Florida looked, well, a bit like the Panthers of the regular season. Back in the fall, the Panthers were inconsistent, winning occasionally by large margins, but losing more frequently \u2013 also by large margins. For a while, the Panthers were struggling to break the .500 mark, and, even though they improved down the stretch, they still relied partly on others\u2019 losses to guarantee their spot in the postseason. None of which takes anything away from what they accomplished once they got there. Florida were a force in the East, wreaking havoc from the moment they clawed their way back into Round 1 against Boston. But Vegas changed that, and once again \u2013 especially on Tuesday night \u2013 Florida morphed back into an uneven, undisciplined squad backed by unreliable goaltending. But perhaps it\u2019s only right that after spending so much time lately in Florida (though across the state in Tampa), the Cup should settle out West for a bit, moving on from Denver to explore somewhere new. Vegas is still somewhat uncharted territory for the NHL. The league\u2019s foray into Nevada wasn\u2019t necessarily the first by a professional league (Canadians will remember the CFL\u2019s ill-fated American adventure of the 1990s, which included the Las Vegas Posse), but it was the most significant. Since the Golden Knights arrived, Las Vegas has also gained an NFL team via relocation, and they could get an MLB franchise soon too. And although NBA commissioner Adam Silver has said the city is \u201cnot on the front burner\u201d for the league, he also admitted that it will \u201cmake a great location for a franchise one day.\u201d It should not go unnoticed that Vegas fans broke tradition and didn\u2019t boo NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman as he stood on the ice to present the Stanley Cup to Stone, the Vegas captain. It\u2019s possible that they were merely all being very polite, but more likely it\u2019s a testament to how new most of the fans in Vegas likely are. Many of them probably don\u2019t remember, nor would care about a lockout from 1994, let alone still harbour historical grudges from it. For Bettman, the silence is probably meaningful. Even if his expansion gambles, on Vegas and more broadly, haven\u2019t exactly all paid off, he\u2019s arguably now at least broken even. As it courted the NHL nearly a decade ago, the prospective ownership group in Las Vegas set up a website to outline its long-term plans and goals. It had a slogan: Vegas Wants Hockey. Vegas got hockey. Now hockey has officially taken Vegas."}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e7014a", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/14/keir-starmer-dares-rishi-sunak-call-immediate-general-election", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": [], "title": "Keir Starmer dares Rishi Sunak to call immediate general election ", "lead": "Labour leader says PM is more focused on Tory wrangling over honours than on economy and asylum", "author": "Peter Walker Deputy political editor", "datePublished": "2023-06-14T12:39:44Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.294310", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/665c1d6b83c58c5f860dedffd8f5084c9ec06d36/0_18_1597_958/500.jpg", "body": "Keir Starmer has challenged Rishi Sunak to hold an immediate general election and accused the prime minister of being more focused on internal Conservative wrangling over honours than on the economy and asylum. In a perhaps predictable line of attack at prime minister\u2019s questions, after days of negative headlines about peerages and other honours for supporters of Boris Johnson, Starmer said Sunak was \u201ctoo weak\u201d to stand up to the former prime minister. The Labour leader highlighted the way that Johnson\u2019s wider honours list included not just political supporters, but staff members who, Starmer said, had played their part in helping cover up the truth about lockdown-breaking Downing Street parties. \u201cThe Tory economic crash means that millions of mortgage holders will pay thousands of pounds more next year, and the blame lies squarely at the door of a government more focused on the internal wars of the Tory party than the needs of the country,\u201d Starmer said, seeking to tie the infighting to the cost of living crisis. \u201cDoes he not think that those responsible should hang their heads in shame?\u201d Sunak said he had simply \u201cfollowed due process and convention\u201d in agreeing to a departing prime minister\u2019s honours list, and accused Starmer of having nominated unsuitable people for peerages. Starmer\u2019s opening question referenced the continuing dispute between Johnson and Sunak over whether the prime minister reneged on an agreement to give peerages to two Johnson-supporting MPs \u2013 Nigel Adams and Nadine Dorries \u2013 who either quit the Commons with him or have said they will. \u201cAll across the country, people are worried about their bills, the price of the weekly shop and the spiralling mortgage rates,\u201d Starmer asked. \u201cSo why has the Tory party spent this last week arguing over which of them gets a peerage?\u201d Sunak said he had followed \u201ca long-established convention of previous prime ministers having the ability to submit honours\u201d, addng: \u201cI followed the process to the letter.\u201d Starmer replied: \u201cThe truth is, for all his tough talk after the event, the prime minister did sign off the honours list. And that means that those who threw a Downing Street party the night before the late queen sat alone at her husband\u2019s funeral will now receive awards from the king. If he\u2019s so tough, why didn\u2019t he block it?\u201d In response, Sunak stressed the precedent for such honours, saying Conservative prime ministers had agreed peerages for Shami Chakrabarti, who investigated antisemitism in Labour on behalf of Jeremy Corbyn, and Tom Watson, the party\u2019s former deputy leader, who has apologised for highlighting claims of historical abuse levelled by the serial fantasist Carl Beech while an MP. The prime minister was briefly rebuked by the Commons speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, for saying Watson had \u201cspread vicious conspiracy theories\u201d, being told he should not speak about a fellow parliamentarian in such a way. Going on the attack again, Starmer said: \u201cHonours should be for public service, not Tory cronies. He was too weak to block Johnson\u2019s list. And that also means that those who spent their time helping cover up Johnson\u2019s law-breaking are rewarded by becoming lawmakers for the rest of their lives.\u201d Starmer asked Sunak if he would block the resignation honours list from Liz Truss, which will reportedly include peerages for allies including Mark Littlewood, the head of the Institute of Economic Affairs thinktank, which backed her disastrous budget. Sunak dodged the question. Responding to Starmer, the prime minister attacked Labour\u2019s spending plans and policy of barring new North Sea oil and gas projects. Starmer ended: \u201cIf he spent as much time focused on the economy, the NHS and the asylum system as he does haggling with his predecessors about who gets honours, the country would be in a far better state. \u201cOnce again, he has lost control and once again, it is working people paying a price. If he disagrees with that, why not put it to the test, end the boasting, the excuses, the Tory chaos, see if he can finally find somebody, anybody anywhere to vote for him, and call a general election now?\u201d"}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e7014b", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/jun/14/f1-23-review-a-return-to-racing-form", "primaryCategory": "games", "subCategories": [], "title": "F1 23 review \u2013 a return to racing form", "lead": "One of the finest and longest-running racing sims has had a significant upgrade \u2013 and gives you the chance to try the new Las Vegas track before it opens", "author": "Steve Boxer", "datePublished": "2023-06-14T12:30:03Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.294318", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/58d6a2ac335dc421f7d7321b7f058fd9fd70bede/120_0_3600_2160/500.png", "body": "Formula One may be the pinnacle of motorsport, but it\u2019s also a soap opera, and with F1 23\u2019s single-player story mode Braking Point, developer Codemasters has run wild with that idea. It follows the ups and downs of the fictional rookie team Konnersport in the 2022 and 2023 seasons, a rollicking rollercoaster of bitchiness and tense relationships, and cleverly casts you as several characters, behind the wheel and in the paddock. It blends nostalgia with some great what-ifs and, running to 17 chapters, is pleasingly substantial. It also offers a great introduction to F1 23\u2019s main Career mode, since it takes in a representative selection of tracks. This year, Career mode and My Team (which casts you as owner of the team as well as a driver) are largely unchanged. Both already did a fine job of replicating the real experience of pursuing a Formula One career, and Codemasters has left well alone. If you\u2019re looking for more arcade-style racing, rather than simulation, look to F1 World - the replacement for last year\u2019s F1 Life, which was essentially an egregious excuse to shoehorn loot boxes into the game. F1 World puts you in a generic car, which can be upgraded as you level up, and its set of mini-races and custom race designer offer a gentler way of ease into competitive online racing \u2013 and makes a lot more sense than F1 Life did.. Of vastly more interest to Formula One game devotees, as opposed to those who have recently discovered the sport, are the underlying technical tweaks that Codemasters has made. Both handling and physics models have been improved, and the already impressively responsive cars now feel even more astonishingly fast and grippy. Codemasters has also fiddled with the tech underlying the controller, which is more of a gamechanger than it sounds, since it vastly improves the experience of playing F1 23 using a gamepad, rather than an expensive wheel-and-pedals setup; at last, you can get real throttle-blending from the right trigger, which makes negotiating tight, low-speed street circuits a pleasure rather than a chore. Followers of the sport will also be beguiled by the presence of the new Las Vegas track, which takes in a big chunk of the Strip and won\u2019t be built in real life until this November. Over and above the inevitable razzmatazz that the Formula One circus\u2019s arrival in Vegas will bring, the track is pretty good, with a few technical, typical street-circuit sequences and two long straights, one of which is particularly vast. Its closest existing equivalents on the calendar would be Baku and Saudi Arabia. F1 23 provides plenty of evidence that Codemasters has been spending Electronic Arts\u2019s cash wisely since it was bought up in 2021. There is plenty of novelty here to attract seasoned F1 game pros and newcomers, who may start off with F1 World. It\u2019s technically magnificent: it looks and feels incredible, and its off-track production values are sky-high. Sure, the continued presence of loot boxes \u2013 seemingly de rigueur in any EA Sports game these days \u2013 cheapens it slightly, but at least it doesn\u2019t force them upon you too brashly. And until November, it will provide your only means of discovering what driving around Las Vegas in a Formula One car feels like. F1 23 is out 16 June; \u00a359.99.

In fact, the denouement was still a bit deflating if you were a Bayern fan, following the team\u2019s tame exits from the Champions League and German Cup, and knowing that Borussia Dortmund\u2019s last-minute slip was the real reason your team was left holding the Bundesliga trophy for an 11th straight season. The final-day choke by Edin Terzic\u2019s team, only managing a draw at home to nothing-to-play-for Mainz when a win would have guaranteed a first championship since 2012 (and a first non-Bayern champion since then), will forever be 2022-23\u2019s punchline. It overshadowed the 46 points Dortmund collected in 2023 \u2013 not to mention Jamal Musiala\u2019s stylish 89th-minute winner at K\u00f6ln that finally brought the title back to Bavaria on goal difference. Yet this was, in many ways, a vintage campaign. On the final day of the season every one of the nine fixtures had something riding on it. It\u2019s not always been the case in recent years but, this time, the hope is that next term offers pretty much the same again. Here is a sprinkling of the teams, players and moments that made it special. Team of the season It\u2019s been a whirlwind. From promotion via the relegation playoff in 2019 (and when does the second-tier side ever manage that?) to signing Max Kruse and successive qualifications for Europe, Union Berlin have been extraordinary. And this year \u2013 despite losing the influential Taiwo Awoniyi, Grischa Pr\u00f6mel and Julian Ryerson \u2013 they made the Champions League, sealing it with Rani Khedira\u2019s late winner against Werder Bremen on the final day. The perfect storm of passion and brilliant organisation, Union\u2019s success is at once logical and amazing. \u201cMany of us have been working together here for 19 years,\u201d said the club president, Dirk Zingler, \u201cand we made it from the Oberliga to the Champions League. The path we\u2019re walking is unbelievable.\u201d Goal of the season In this every-goal-counts campaign, Joshua Kimmich\u2019s late thunderbolt from distance to save a point against K\u00f6ln in January seemed incidental at the time, even if it did rob Steffen Baumgart\u2019s men of a famous win in Munich. Eventually, though, this face-saver ended up meaning a lot. Player of the season Jude Bellingham was the huge driver of Dortmund\u2019s brush with glory as they went from sixth at Christmas to agonisingly falling short on the final day (and how they missed him as he sat out the final matches through injury). At 19 he earned the captain\u2019s armband not just with his tackles and irresistible surges into the penalty box, but for his palpable communion with the Signal Iduna Park crowd. BVB will miss Bellingham\u2019s heart and leadership as much as his ability. Early celebration of the season It could easily have been Uli Hoeness, as Bayern\u2019s honorary president recognised in an interview with Bild when he recalled his wild celebrations in his front room after Musiala struck late in K\u00f6ln. Had Dortmund conjured a winner afterwards, which would have given them the championship, it would have been \u201clike Schalke in 2001\u201d, he reflected, referencing Patrik Andersson\u2019s late, late goal that snatched the title for Bayern with Die K\u00f6nigsblauen and their fans already celebrating. Nearer the mark in that respect were poor old Hamburg, who thought their fifth season down in the 2.Bundesliga was going to end in promotion after winning 1-0 at Sandhausen on the final day, with thousands of joyous fans invading the pitch. Only it wasn\u2019t over. Their promotion rivals Heidenheim, who needed to match HSV\u2019s result, were 2-1 down at Jahn Regensburg in the 90th minute but scored twice in 11 added minutes, with Tim Kleindienst\u2019s 99th-minute winner taking them and their long-serving coach Frank Schmidt, who took over in 2007 when the club were in the fourth tier, into the top flight for the first time. Hamburg, meanwhile, were beaten 6-1 on aggregate by Stuttgart in the relegation playoff and must try again next season. Implosion of the season If Dortmund\u2019s failure to get it over the line against Mainz will linger in the mind, they wouldn\u2019t even have needed to win had they closed out either of the two other games which they astonishingly let slip at either end of the season: the home loss to Werder Bremen in September, which came after they had led 2-0 in the 89th minute, or April\u2019s 3-3 draw at Stuttgart, when they went 2-0 up, Stuttgart went down to 10 men, came back to 2-2, and BVB led again in the 92nd minute then conceded another equaliser with the game\u2019s final kick. \u201cWe thought we had already experienced the worst thing this season,\u201d said a gobsmacked Terzic after the latter, talking about the former. \u201cBut this tops it.\u201d Discreet criticism of the season After Bayern\u2019s loss against Leipzig in the penultimate game, Deniz Aytekin, the referee, reacted with some prejudice in the media area to word that his former colleague Manuel Gr\u00e4fe had questioned one of his decisions in his role as ZDF\u2019s TV analyst. \u201cGr\u00e4fe sits in Berlin with his 180kg [weight] and talks such shit,\u201d he bellowed. Aytekin was so loud that he drowned out Thomas M\u00fcller, being interviewed next to him, who had to pause his own interview and cocked an ear while attempting (largely unsuccessfully) to supress his laughter. \u201cI would like to apologise for my choice of words,\u201d a suitably humbled Aytekin said on Bild TV the following day. Accountants of the season After the profligacy of the Lars Windhorst era \u2013 \u20ac374m blown in three years of failed attempts to take Hertha to the next level \u2013 you might have assumed that the major shareholder\u2019s exit would bring an air of mature calm to the club. Sadly not, as the Berliners walked headlong into a string of financial crises under their new president, Kay Bernstein, sacking a sporting director and a coach en route to another relegation. \u201cNow we don\u2019t just have to deal with people who are only concerned about personal gain,\u201d said long-serving board member, Ingmar Pering after he quit, \u201cbut also with collective incompetence.\u201d Press conference of the season \u201cWe played with a lot of quality,\u201d Thomas Tuchel claimed after Bayern\u2019s 3-0 Champions League loss at Manchester City in April. \u201cI think there were no big weaknesses [in our game].\u201d After a catastrophic defensive display it was a brave line, which is probably why the coach\u2019s catchphrase, alarmingly, became \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d for much of the remainder of the campaign. PR win of the season Windhorst again excelled himself here, as he was busted by the Financial Times in September 2022 as having funded Israeli private intelligence firm Shibumi Strategy to work on a smear campaign against then-Hertha president, Werner Gegenbauer. Reinvention of the season They went down in the end, but they will be missed. After years of stumbling from one calamity to the next, Schalke had a mere nine points at the winter break but finally found some purpose under Thomas Reis, and they were only relegated after defeat to RB Leipzig on the final day. Having rediscovered the gutsy attitude that their fans always wanted, it feels as if they will be back sooner rather than later. Let\u2019s hope so."}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e7014d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/14/germany-coalition-staves-off-implosion-with-11th-hour-heating-law-amendment", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": [], "title": "Germany coalition staves off implosion with 11th-hour heating law amendment", "lead": "Environmental groups criticise revision of law that would have banned installation of gas and oil systems", "author": "Kate Connolly in Berlin", "datePublished": "2023-06-14T12:24:05Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.294335", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/d4a1e27f531193e72cd910c3981b8e2bc5942ec5/0_0_4398_2639/500.jpg", "body": "The German government has staved off a power battle that threatened to cause the ruling coalition to implode after finally agreeing an 11th-hour amendment to a controversial new heating law. Negotiations over the legislation have dominated the headlines for weeks, with the economy minister, Robert Habeck, of the Greens clashing with the pro-liberal Free Democratic party (FDP) over how much consumers should be burdened with the costs of replacing fossil fuel heating systems with cleaner, climate-neutral energy. Environmental groups have criticised the revision of the law, arguing it will delay Germany\u2019s ambitions to reach net zero targets by many years. Under the original proposals \u2013 to which all three members of the coalition signed up, but to which the FDP subsequently voiced its opposition \u2013 from January heating systems replaced in existing buildings had to be green, such as heat pumps or systems drawing at least 65% of their energy from clean sources such as wind or solar power, rather than gas or oil. Every new-build would have had to comply with the rule. Under the new proposals the onus is shifting from individual households to municipal authorities, which will be expected to scale up their goals for district heating planning, which often draws on geothermal energy, and to assess the needs of every household, including their suitability for connection to such a system. Pressure was on the coalition to reach agreement in time for the energy law to be put to the parliament, or Bundestag, before 7 July, its last sitting before the summer recess. The draft law will start its passage through parliament this week. Instead of stiff rules, Habeck said, the coalition now had a set of \u201cguidelines\u201d that would help households transition to renewable energy. \u201cIn this way we\u2019re giving people more time \u2026 I think this is the right thing to do and is completely in keeping with my interest,\u201d he said in Berlin. The chancellor, Olaf Scholz, of the Social Democrats (SPD), said the coalition had experienced \u201cjudders\u201d over the intense, often angry debate that had accompanied the creation of the draft, but that \u201cthis has now juddered to a conclusion\u201d. Under the new law, if it is passed, people will still be allowed to install gas heaters from 1 January if they can be converted to hydrogen, including in new buildings, a clause the FDP insisted on. However, in zones of new development heating systems will have to use 65% renewable energy or more. For all other homes and buildings, this requirement will only apply once municipal authorities have presented their heating plans, which they are required to do by 2028. With those plans in place, homeowners would then be in a position to decide which system to switch to, whether a heat pump \u2013 the preference of the Greens \u2013 district heating, or a gas heater able to be converted to run on hydrogen. A record number of heat pumps have been installed in Germany since the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which led to the dramatic stoppage of Russian pipeline gas to Germany. However, despite technical developments, they are still often deemed unsuitable for older homes and cost between \u20ac25,000 (\u00a321,400) and \u20ac40,000 (\u00a334,200) to install, which despite generous government subsidies is too expensive for many households. In addition, a shortage of technical parts and of engineers capable of installing them has made access to them a challenge. Systems using wood and pellets will continue to be allowed. The switch to cleaner energy systems, estimated to cost \u20ac9.2bn (\u00a37.8bn) a year until 2028, falling to \u20ac5bn (\u00a34.3bn) a year from then on, is to be subsidised from the government\u2019s climate and transformation fund, with levels of support tailored to individuals\u2019 needs."}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e7014e", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/14/liverpool-demands-level-playing-field-in-race-to-become-english-national-opera-new-home", "primaryCategory": "music", "subCategories": [], "title": "Liverpool demands \u2018level playing field\u2019 in race to become ENO\u2019s new home", "lead": "City writes to arts secretary amid reports ministers backing Manchester and Birmingham to host English National Opera", "author": "Nadia Khomami Arts and culture correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-06-14T12:20:51Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.294343", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/cfb637cb6b2eb625f36ed25f93600bbffefbca33/0_0_1600_960/500.jpg", "body": "Liverpool leaders have written to the arts minister, Stephen Parkinson, asking for assurances that the race for the English National Opera\u2019s next home is \u201ca level playing field\u201d. It comes after reports that ministers are backing bids by Manchester and Birmingham as part of their devolution deals. The ENO has narrowed down its search for a new home to five cities after being forced to leave London. The company\u2019s general public funding was slashed to zero by Arts Council England (ACE) last year as part of plans to divert culture money outside London. In a letter on Wednesday, copied to the Arts Council and the ENO, the Liverpool mayor, Steve Rotheram, and the city council leader, Liam Robinson, called for urgent clarity on the bidding process to ensure it was \u201cas fair and transparent as possible\u201d. \u201cWherever the ENO next calls home, it should be about choosing the place that offers the best fit for the opera to thrive with a sustainable future \u2013 and not simply the place that offers the biggest short-term financial incentives,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThe process so far has been something of a confusing one, with several interested parties taking part in discussions, including the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCSM), the Arts Council England and the ENO itself. It would be useful for us to understand exactly who will be making the final decision on a new site.\u201d Rotheram and Robinson added that while they did \u201cnot place too much truck in rumours\u201d, it would be remiss to not \u201cseek your assurances that there is no substance to the reports we have heard of government officials seeking to apply pressure for Manchester and Birmingham\u2019s bid to be successful as an addendum to their \u2018Trailblazer Devolutions\u2019 deals.\u201d The government, the leaders emphasised, had set up the Liverpool strategy futures advisory panel, and they were working with Michael Gove, the minister for levelling up, to identify areas of competitive advantage in the city, including music and its growing visitor economy. \u201cWe would appreciate if you were able to clear up some of the uncertainty surrounding the bidding process and give your assurance that the best bid will be successful. If the process is conducted on a truly level playing field, then we are confident that the ENO will soon be calling the Liverpool city region home.\u201d While the ENO will continue to stage performances at the London Coliseum, ACE has said its base must be outside the capital if it is to receive \u00a324m in public funding over three years from 2024. The forced move prompted a backlash from cultural figures including Melvyn Bragg, who decried it as \u201ccultural vandalism\u201d, while others called it a \u201chammer blow to the opera industry\u201d. Critics have questioned whether there is sufficient appetite for opera to sustain the ENO outside London \u2013 an assumption sharply rejected by figures such as the Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham, who described that as based on \u201cresidual, out of date attitudes\u201d. The final decision on the new location will be taken by the ENO and its board, but the shortlist will be put to ACE. Rotheram and Robinson said they believed the Liverpool city region had set out \u201cthe strongest case that it is viable and sustainable and will allow the company to flourish as it enters its next chapter\u201d. They pointed to the region\u2019s musical heritage, its cultural bodies, including the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra and Liverpool Institute of Performing Arts, and its recent hosting of Eurovision. But, they added, \u201cthere is no opera company serving this part of the north-west\u201d, making Liverpool the only shortlisted area lacking any opera provision.

Gordon Lish, senior editor at the New York publishers Alfred A Knopf, gave a copy of McCarthy\u2019s Blood Meridian (1985) to the critic Harold Bloom. Bloom loved it, declaring it a great book, right up there with William Faulkner and Toni Morrison. There are pages of prose in his work, remarked George Steiner, \u201cthat may be at the moment the most electric, the most violent, the most inventive prose being written\u201d. Saul Bellow bullied and cajoled the prize committee of the MacArthur Foundation in 1981 to acknowledge McCarthy\u2019s remarkable talent. McCarthy seemed to come from nowhere and for most of his career wrote in the hermit-like obscurity of a JD Salinger or Thomas Pynchon. Refusing all attempts to publicise his work, McCarthy politely declined to be interviewed, never signed copies of his own books, attended no literary conferences, did not teach, and was more interested in science and cosmology than fiction. He was an American original. Working at first in the southern gothic mode, he remade himself as a southwestern writer after settling in Texas in 1976. He carried the influence of Faulkner, Herman Melville (Moby Dick was reportedly his favourite novel) and Ernest Hemingway along with him, and remained true to the literary values that those richly complex writers had made their own. McCarthy had no time for Marcel Proust or Henry James; he had no interest in the psychological intricacies of motivation, sensibility or modernist thinking about consciousness. His novels, early and late, were grim, violent tales of life stripped down to the raw fundamentals of existence in a hostile world. Acclaim and a mass readership came late in his career. Until the runaway success of All the Pretty Horses in 1992 (his first New York Times bestseller), McCarthy had sold fewer than 5,000 copies of the hardback edition of any of his novels. By 2006, Blood Meridian, a blood-dripping tale of scalp-hunting and massacres in northern Mexico in the 1840s, was placed at No 3 in a Time magazine list of the 25 greatest American novels. McCarthy seemed the real deal to readers such as Bloom, Lish and Bellow. He reached an even wider audience via film adaptations of books including No Country for Old Men (2005) and the Pulitzer prize-winner The Road (2006). Not since Faulkner had an American author been so extravagantly talented and, by choice, so distant from the literary culture. McCarthy was born in Providence, Rhode Island, the eldest son and third of six children of Gladys (nee McGrail) and Charles McCarthy. The family moved to Knoxville, Tennessee, in 1937 when his father, a Yale law school graduate, was appointed legal counsel for the Tennessee Valley Authority. Growing up in a large Roman Catholic family in the fiercely Protestant environment of Tennessee, McCarthy was sent to exclusively Catholic schools in Knoxville. Neither the family\u2019s religion, nor their comfortable upper-middle-class life (maids, a large family house), was much to his liking. He did not want to be respectable, and this was not popular in the McCarthy household. McCarthy attended the University of Tennessee in 1951-52, studying physics and engineering, but dropped out. He had no career ambitions, hated \u201cprogress\u201d and rejected most of the expectations that shaped the lives of his siblings and fellow students. He had been named after his father, and the decision legally to change his name from Charles to the Gaelic Cormac suggests some of the family tensions that shaped McCarthy\u2019s relations to his family. In 1953 McCarthy enlisted in the US air force, and was sent to Alaska, where he had much time to catch up on his reading. He also hosted a programme on a local radio station. After his military service ended in 1956, McCarthy re-enrolled at the University of Tennessee where, as \u201cCJ McCarthy, Jr\u201d, he published two short stories in a campus literary magazine. They attracted some attention, and he received the university\u2019s Ingram-Merrill award for creative writing in 1959. He promptly left the university without taking a degree, and went to Chicago, where he worked in an auto-parts warehouse. In 1961 he married Lee Holleman, a fellow student from the University of Tennessee. They had a son, Cullen, moved back south to Asheville, North Carolina, and were divorced soon after. When asked years later about whether he paid alimony, he responded: \u201cWith what?\u201d He was, for the next 25 years, poor, rootless and happy. In Chicago, Asheville, and then in New Orleans, he worked on the manuscript of his first novel, The Orchard Keeper. Knowing little of the literary scene, and less of the publishing industry, he sent the novel unsolicited to Random House, where it was plucked from the slush pile of doubtful self-submitted manuscripts and reached the desk of Albert R Erskine, vice-president and editorial director. Erskine was a legendary figure in the world of literary publishing, but even with his support, The Orchard Keeper (1965) \u2013 a Faulkneresque tale set in rural Tennessee in the inter-war years, portraying the relationship of a young boy to an outlaw and bootlegger who has murdered the boy\u2019s father \u2013 attracted little attention. Nonetheless, McCarthy received the William Faulkner Foundation award for the best first novel by an American writer. Erskine\u2019s enthusiasm for McCarthy\u2019s talent was undiminished, despite the commercial failures that followed. McCarthy remained a Random House author until his editor\u2019s retirement in 1987. The Orchard Keeper also won McCarthy a travelling fellowship from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. On his sea voyage to Europe for a planned visit to Ireland, he met Anne DeLisle, a young British singer and dancer, who was working as an entertainer on the ship. They married in 1966, and lived in a rented finca in Ibiza in a boozy community of expatriate American artists and writers. In that happy milieu McCarthy wrote Outer Dark, a tale of incest and violence, in a note-perfect recreation of the Tennessee poor-white vernacular. It was published in 1968, and sank without trace. A grant from the Rockefeller Foundation enabled the couple to return to the US in some style for DeLisle\u2019s first visit to McCarthy\u2019s parents. When they reached Tennessee, they rented a cottage adjacent to a pig farm south of Knoxville, where they lived for 10 years. McCarthy poured the memory of his life in Knoxville into a long autobiographical novel, Suttree, which appeared in 1979, telling the story of a young man who turned away from a privileged family background and chose to live on a houseboat boozing with a colourful assortment of locals. With Suttree in mid-draft, he walked out on DeLisle, and moved to El Paso, Texas. Although they divorced, he continued to send drafts of Suttree to DeLisle in Knoxville for typing, and they remained close friends. \u201cI lived waiting for him to come home for years and years,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI never would have stayed there unless I thought he was coming back to me.\u201d McCarthy received a phone call from the MacArthur Foundation in late December 1981 informing him that he had been awarded a \u201cgenius grant\u201d of $500,000, which enabled him to buy a small stucco house behind a shopping mall in El Paso. The Nobel-prize winning physicist Murray Gell-Mann was the director of the MacArthur Foundation, and he and McCarthy became close friends. Invited by Gell-Mann to affiliate with the Santa Fe Institute, a freewheeling thinktank for scientists, McCarthy at last found an intellectual home. In 1999, with his third wife, Jennifer Winkley, and their son, John, he settled down in Tesuque, New Mexico, and worked on his later novels in his office at the institute, pecking away on a small portable Olivetti Lettera 32. \u201cI like being around smart, interesting people, and the people who come here are among the smartest, most interesting people on the planet.\u201d The move to El Paso began a new phase for McCarthy. His books up to Suttree were \u201csouthern\u201d novels, written strongly under the influence of Faulkner. With Blood Meridian, he wrote about southwest Texas and the Mexican border territory, which he explored in an old pickup truck. His descriptions of the cauterised border territory were stunningly vivid. Bloom claimed that the landscape in Blood Meridian was better than anything except Shakespeare. The novel\u2019s violence was also spectacular, though oddly affectless. Death comes helter-skelter for the killers and innocent villagers alike in northern Mexico in the 1840s \u2013 scalpings, evisceration, beheadings, presented in detail. The motives for this gory mayhem, conducted by contract killers selling Apache scalps to the governor of Sonora, are unfathomable. The figure of Judge Holden takes motiveless malignity to sickening heights. Philip Roth, a novelist whose interests never involved skinning knives, rifles or clubs, found nothing of interest in Blood Meridian; it was described as an ambitious and sophisticated failure in the New York Times, and sold fewer than 1,500 copies in the first printing. A film adaptation was talked about, but the consensus seems to have been that it was unfilmable: too dark, too violent. Asked about this, McCarthy robustly dismissed these objections as \u201call crap\u201d. In the early 1990s, McCarthy acquired a new publisher (Knopf), a new editor (Gary Fisketjon) and, for the first time in his career, an agent (Amanda Urban). In 1992 Fisketjon and Urban persuaded the reluctant author to give an interview to the New York Times. All the Pretty Horses appeared that spring, and was a runaway success, winning the National Book award for fiction and the National Book Critics Circle award. In 2000, it was made into a film directed by Billy Bob Thornton. Matt Damon played John Grady Cole and Pen\u00e9lope Cruz played Alejandra, both rather miscast playing adolescents. McCarthy thought the movie \u201ccould\u2019ve been better\u201d and bought a new pickup truck with the income from the book. It was the first volume in the Border trilogy, and was followed in 1994 by The Crossing, and in 1998 by Cities of the Plain. Most of the elements of his earlier books are here: virtuoso descriptive powers, laconic dialogue, a set of engaging younger characters and his signature violence. Occasional flights of inflated rhetoric accompanied McCarthy\u2019s search for deep meaning. His account of the doomed relationship between John Grady Cole and the beautiful Alejandra is suggested by: \u201cAs she walked toward him her beauty seemed to him a thing altogether improbable\u201d \u2013 which was hard to disagree with. No Country for Old Men, published in 2005, was dismissed by the critic James Wood as \u201can unimportant, stripped-down thriller\u201d. The Coen brothers movie of 2007 revealed the perfect geometry of this violent tale of pursuit and revenge. Tommy Lee Jones led the cast superbly as craggy Sheriff Bell, Javier Bardem was Chigurh, the remorseless killer with the bad haircut, and Josh Brolin was the outgunned man who found the drug money. McCarthy attended the Academy Awards with the Coens. \u201cThey had a table full of awards before the evening was over, sitting there like beer cans,\u201d he recalled. \u201cOne of the first awards they got was for best screenplay, and Ethan came back with the Oscar trophy and said to me, \u2018Well, I didn\u2019t do anything, but I\u2019m keeping it.\u2019\u201d The Road appeared in 2006, a spare, powerful novel portraying the struggle of a father and his young son to survive in a world in which civilisation, and the ecosystem, has collapsed after an (unspecified) cataclysm. It received the best reviews of his career. The experience of fatherhood is seen powerfully in this novel, as are the doom-laden seminars at the Santa Fe Institute discussing entropy, climate change and Carl Sagan\u2019s widely-read scenario on nuclear winter. Together they offered McCarthy a subject that was perfectly matched to his late prose, muscular and taut. For a writer never much known for his concern for intense emotional attachment, the feelings of the (unnamed) father for his son was something new in McCarthy; it gave The Road an emotional depth. There are hints of a consoling, redemptive ending, unknown in his earlier books, but the stronger note is a sense of the inevitability of death, of a father\u2019s bitter knowledge that he will leave his young son to make his own way in the blasted world. The Road was filmed by the Australian director John Hillcoat in 2008. Joe Penhall\u2019s screenplay stayed close to the book\u2019s dialogue (McCarthy explained it had been basically transcribed from conversations with his son John). Filmed mainly in Pittsburgh in midwinter, the film embodied McCarthy\u2019s sense of a world dying. The relationship between father and son, played by Viggo Mortensen and Kodi Smit-McPhee, preserved much of the novel\u2019s intensity of affection. McCarthy received the PEN/Saul Bellow award in 2009, given to an American fiction writer whose work \u201cpossesses qualities of excellence, ambition, and scale of achievement over a sustained career which place him or her in the highest rank of American literature\u201d. Two late novels, The Passenger and Stella Maris, appeared in 2022, capstones to an intense and remarkable career. McCarthy\u2019s third marriage ended in divorce in 2006. He is survived by his sons, two grandchildren, and two sisters and a brother. \u2022 Cormac McCarthy (Charles Joseph McCarthy), novelist, born 20 July 1933; died 13 June 2023"}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e70150", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/14/british-homes-aircon-coal-fired-power-station-extravagance", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "subCategories": [], "title": "It may be hot, but most British homes don't need aircon.

They became symbolic of a certain affluence that allows a privileged few to live in optimum comfort at all times. Now there\u2019s a new kid on the block: the portable air-conditioning unit. As we adjust to a changing climate, with mid-summer temperatures regularly exceeding 25C and occasionally reaching 35C or even higher, this is the new \u201cmust have\u201d. Sales of air-conditioning units were up more than 500% during last year\u2019s heatwave and, according to property website Rightmove, searches for homes with air-conditioning tripled over the same period. At between \u00a3300 and \u00a31,000 a pop, they\u2019re not cheap \u2013 but they certainly make three or four weeks of good UK weather each year easier to handle. At what cost? This week National Grid readied another coal-fired power station to cope with the extra demand placed on the energy networks by offices and homes switching on air-conditioning units. Greenpeace UK shared its outrage at this request: \u201cWe\u2019re using MORE coal to cool down the effects of the coal we\u2019re using. It makes no sense.\u201d And I agree. Many climate-controlled buildings with artificial ventilation systems, such as hospitals or laboratories or large office and retail complexes, rely on air-conditioning to keep them at a stable temperature all year round. This is essential to ensure staff are protected from high temperatures in the workplace, and for those who are vulnerable in a heatwave, such as people with certain medical conditions or disabilities. But given these are always running, keeping temperatures at a consistent pace through hot weather and \u2013 more often in the UK \u2013 cold too, it\u2019s unlikely they are responsible for this sudden spike in demand. The more likely culprit is increasing numbers of small units inside homes that are suddenly cranked up in warm weather. In other words, the completely unnecessary ones. Just as wood burners are being phased out by law as we start to fully understand the damage they do to climate and also lung health, we now need to consider a ban on some air-conditioning units \u2013 particularly when used at the mildest of warm temperatures. And until then it\u2019s up to us not to buy them. When it\u2019s 26C outside, the average British home simply doesn\u2019t need air-conditioning. It might feel nicer, but making you a little more comfortable isn\u2019t the government\u2019s job. Preventing further damaging climate change most certainly is. For healthy people, let\u2019s not pretend this new trend is anything other than extravagance. Air conditioner sets you back at least \u00a380 a month to run every night in a single bedroom. Compare that with just under \u00a35 a month to run a classic fan by the bed. Our neighbours in Europe have always been smarter when it comes to managing the heat. Take a wander on a hot day through residential neighbourhoods in France, Germany, Spain and Italy and you will see blinds or shutters closed against the glare of the midday sun. At dusk, windows are thrown wide open to let in the cool of the night. Modern homes with good insulation (which we are still building far too few of in the UK) keep heat out just as well as they protect from the cold. If the government wants to keep the coal-fired power stations mothballed \u2013 as it must \u2013 then it should invest in speeding up its thrice-failed retrofitting programme to improve the thermal performance of all our homes. But crucially, we also need to adapt our behaviour. Southern Europeans have long accommodated extreme temperatures by dressing appropriately, and respecting their bodies by taking a break from work during the hottest part of the day. High temperatures affect our \u201ccognitive performance\u201d, one social media user told me when I lamented our increased use of air-conditioning on Twitter. I cannot think of anything bleaker than burning coal to keep us more economically productive for a few extra weeks at the expense of our bodies and the planet. A time will come \u2013 under another government, of course \u2013 when good solar panel coverage across the country might mean we are able to justify a personal AC unit in every home, powered by our own clean energy source. But we are not there now. Until then, there is no argument for the able-bodied to be using air-conditioning at home, just so that they are more comfortable during our short-lived warm spells. If you\u2019re cranking it up during the short British summer, you\u2019re part of the problem.

The sound of young working-class Liverpudlians recasting their love of American R&amp;B, rock\u2019n\u2019roll and doo-wop in their own image, it was the scene that birthed the Beatles \u2013 whose debut album recently turned 60 \u2013 alongside other stars like Gerry and the Pacemakers, Cilla Black and the Searchers, becoming the UK\u2019s first significant contribution to pop music history. It inspired similar scenes across the UK and beyond, and was sold back to Americans in the British Invasion. \u201cIt felt like something was about to happen,\u201d remembers Billy J Kramer, who had two No 1 hits with his backing band the Dakotas. \u201cBut it was just an explosion. Liverpool was at the centre of things out of nowhere.\u201d Merseybeat had its roots in the late 1950s. Always a musical city, jazz and skiffle were the popular sounds of the day until an influx of the latest, hard-to-find American rock\u2019n\u2019roll records and instruments were imported into Liverpool from the US via its docks, changing the pulse of the city. \u201cThe place was buzzing with it,\u201d says Nick Crouch of Faron\u2019s Flamingos and the Mojos (two of the bands included on a new Merseybeat compilation, Let\u2019s Stomp! Merseybeat and Beyond 1962-1969). \u201cVirtually every street you walked down, you\u2019d hear guitar music.\u201d For postwar youth, these sounds were thrillingly edgy. \u201cIt was also a way to get out of being poor,\u201d says singer Beryl Marsden. Indeed, gigging was a means to earn money amid Liverpool\u2019s backdrop of high unemployment, decaying infrastructure, closing factories and industrial action. As ever, Liverpool\u2019s socioeconomic climate hadn\u2019t gone unnoticed by the national press: the Daily Worker dismissed the burgeoning Merseybeat scene as \u201cthe voice of 80,000 crumbling houses and 30,000 people on the dole\u201d. \u201cLiverpool has always been regarded as the bad boys,\u201d says Crouch. Yet the scene\u2019s self-containment was its core strength. Influential DJ Bob Wooler, the compere at the Cavern, the scene\u2019s legendary spiritual heart, once estimated there were around 350 working groups in the Merseyside area. Irked by a lack of coverage from the London-based media, former art student Bill Harry launched a newspaper, Mersey Beat, in 1961 to promote the scene. He\u2019d been encouraged by his friend and record shop owner Brian Epstein, who became something of a figurehead and kingmaker, managing the Beatles, Gerry and the Pacemakers and Cilla Black. With venues also sensing the change and accommodating the new sound \u2013 not just the Cavern, which ditched its jazz-only policy, but other ballrooms and dancehalls such as Orrell Park Ballroom, Tower Ballroom, the Sink and the Iron Door \u2013 it all added to a sense of everyone being in it together. \u201cIt was like a little city on its own,\u201d says Ray Ennis of the Swinging Blue Jeans. \u201cBetween the bands there was no jealousy. We all got on, jammed together, shared songs. There was real camaraderie.\u201d Most of the time, anyway. Of John Lennon, Crouch says: \u201cOh, he\u2019d fight about anything. Stupid things. He could be quite violent, John. But if you stood up to him, you were a friend for life.\u201d Being a Merseybeat band was demanding work. Gigs around Merseyside, at lunchtime and evenings, were lengthy, strict and disciplined affairs \u2013 no alcohol was permitted at the venues. Bands tore through their favourite rock\u2019n\u2019roll, R&amp;B, rockabilly, Tamla and blues numbers \u2013 very few sang their own material at first \u2013 in sweaty, high-energy shows. But that was nothing compared with the experience of those who went to Hamburg to play residencies at the famous Star Club: Merseybeat\u2019s second home acted as a boot camp. \u201cWe\u2019d play from 4pm Saturday till 6am Sunday,\u201d says Charlie Flynn of Ian and the Zodiacs. \u201cOur bed was a cellar under the stage.\u201d Yet bands were invigorated by the reception and Hamburg\u2019s cosmopolitan allure. The Beatles came back transformed; some went down so well they didn\u2019t go home. Ian and the Zodiacs never had a hit in the UK, but became massively popular in Germany. \u201cWe\u2019ve still got a tribute band over there today,\u201d Flynn says; the city will host a new Beatles and Merseybeat-related music festival, Come Together Experience, later this month. The Liverbirds became such a live draw they too stayed in Hamburg, and in a scene of few women, are now recognised as the UK\u2019s first ever all-female rock band. \u201cWe wanted to be the female Beatles, and we wanted to do it first,\u201d says Mary Dostal, nee McGlory. \u201cEverybody was really curious at first; people were like, \u2018I don\u2019t know what to think about this\u2019.\u201d That included John Lennon, who told them \u201cgirls don\u2019t play guitars\u201d. \u201cWe thought: let\u2019s prove to him that we can. It gave us more enthusiasm rather than putting us off.\u201d The scene the Liverbirds left behind was in full swing, with an unprecedented cultural dominance. In 1963, helped by the Epstein-organised Mersey Beat Showcase UK tour, four Merseybeat acts reached No 1 \u2013 the Beatles, Gerry &amp; the Pacemakers, Billy J Kramer &amp; the Dakotas, and the Searchers \u2013 holding the top spot for a combined 36 weeks. Suddenly, everybody wanted to be from Liverpool. \u201cWe played in Scotland\u201d says Flynn, \u201cand the promoter said \u2018we had so and so from Liverpool here last week\u2019. I said, \u2018I think you\u2019ll find they\u2019re from Birmingham!\u2019 Bands were all saying they were from Liverpool to get a gig.\u201d In 1964, nearly 20% of all songs to reach the Top 10 were by Merseybeat acts, including the Fourmost and the Merseybeats. Of the six artists to feature on the first ever broadcast of Top of the Pops on 1 January, two were from Liverpool: the Beatles and the Swinging Blue Jeans, performing their hit Hippy Hippy Shake. The latter got into a fistfight with the Rolling Stones in the BBC canteen after Mick Jagger refused to lend his ballpoint pen. \u201cOur claim to fame is that we gave Mick Jagger his big lips,\u201d Ennis says. But as the Beatles went supernova \u2013 \u201ca lot of the bands were resentful that they sort of deserted everybody,\u201d says Crouch \u2013 combinations of misfortune, mismanagement and poor decisions denied many acts who deserved better. Scene favourites Faron\u2019s Flamingos, who boasted an eccentric, explosive performer in frontman William \u201cFaron\u201d Ruffley, thought they had a hit in the bag with a Merseybeat makeover of the Contours\u2019 Do You Love Me \u2013 until a fateful gig in St Helens with Brian Poole and the Tremeloes. \u201cI saw their lead guitarist talking to Faron, writing on a paper napkin,\u201d Crouch says. \u201cFaron told him the lyrics and chords to Do You Love Me, and they literally went home to London, recorded our version and rushed it out the week before ours.\u201d The Tremeloes went to No 1; Faron\u2019s single sank without trace. He must have been annoyed with the Tremeloes? \u201cOh yeah, of course,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I was more annoyed with Faron!\u201d The Cryin\u2019 Shames\u2019 debut hit Please Stay, the last single produced by Joe Meek, led to interest from Epstein; they not only turned him down, but told him to \u201cfuck off\u201d. A second single flopped and they soon split up. \u201cLet\u2019s just say it didn\u2019t help,\u201d says Derek Cleary, who joined just after the doomed meeting. \u201cYou have to be crazy not to sign with Brian Epstein. And to swear at the guy, too? It was mad.\u201d Beryl Marsden also turned down Epstein \u2013 \u201cBrian would have tried to pop me in frocks like Cilla\u201d \u2013 but her lack of success is more curious. Marsden was hugely popular on the scene: featured on the moment-capturing At the Cavern live LP aged just 16, she supported the Beatles on their last UK tour in 1965. Yet she recorded only a handful of singles \u2013 excellent Dusty Springfield-like soul-pop rather than the Merseybeat sound she loved \u2013 and never charted. \u201cI wanted to be more rock\u2019n\u2019roll,\u201d Marsden says. \u201cBut every time I went to the studio there\u2019d be a flipping orchestra. I never felt comfortable. I thought, \u2018why am I being taken away from the band?\u2019 But that\u2019s just what they did with the girls back then.\u201d By 1965, Merseybeat was fizzling out. Even those who had success were struggling to maintain it. Billy J Kramer rues what he calls a \u201cdisastrous, shitty performance\u201d at the prestigious ITV variety show Tonight at the London Palladium. \u201cI really didn\u2019t want to do it. In a very short space of time, I\u2019d gone from being an engineer on the railroad to doing the London Palladium. I was overwhelmed.\u201d He thinks it damaged his career. \u201cBecause people look at things like that, and maybe think \u2018he\u2019s not that good\u2019.\u201d Several factors brought about Merseybeat\u2019s end. The scene hollowed out as acts moved away, often to try their luck in London or Hamburg. But culture also shifted: just as Merseybeat had usurped jazz and skiffle, the bands now sounded out of date themselves as psychedelia and singer-songwriters flourished. \u201cI think music was starting to change,\u201d Marsden says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t as naive and pure as Merseybeat.\u201d As bands became more experimental with instruments and sounds \u2013 led, ironically, by the Beatles\u2019 retreat into the studio \u2013 a repertoire of covers wasn\u2019t enough: writing your own material became expected. \u201cPublishers stopped offering songs for bands to record,\u201d Ennis says. \u201cIf your contract was up, nine times out of 10 it wasn\u2019t getting renewed.\u201d Exhaustion was also common, as years of gruelling schedules took its toll. \u201cI was tired of driving up and down motorways,\u201d Marsden says. Crouch joined the Mojos, whose 1964 hit Everything\u2019s Alright was later covered by David Bowie. But excessive touring \u2013 including months in Ivory Coast, one of many \u201cpeculiar\u201d gigs they did after signing up with Frank Sinatra\u2019s agent \u2013 meant he wasn\u2019t concerned when the Mojos split. \u201cI just wanted a rest. I hadn\u2019t seen my family for years.\u201d And so after its big bang, Merseybeat ended with a whimper. But 60 years on, its legacy is a treasured one, especially to those that were there. \u201cIt didn\u2019t seem as wonderful then as it does now,\u201d Ennis says. \u201cIt was just normal. But when you look back you think \u2013 wow, what a fantastic time that was.\u201d \u2022 Let\u2019s Stomp! Merseybeat and Beyond 1962-1969 is out now on Cherry Red.

The competition commission said it had taken issue \u201cwith Google favouring its own online display advertising technology services to the detriment of competing providers of advertising technology services, advertisers and online publishers\u201d. Its view was therefore that \u201conly the mandatory divestment by Google of part of its services would address its competition concerns\u201d. After a two-year investigation into the company\u2019s ad-tech business, the regulator concluded that Google had abused its monopoly in online advertising by favouring its own ad exchange, AdX, in the auctions held by its own ad server, DFP, and in the way its ad-buying tools, branded as Google Ads and DV360, place bids on such exchanges. Speaking shortly before the ruling, Margrethe Vestager, the competition commissioner, told reporters of the complexity of the investigation. \u201cThis market is a highly technical market. It is very dynamic. The detection of these behaviours can be very challenging. \u201cEach time a practice was detected \u2026 Google simply modified its behaviour so as to make it more difficult to detect but with the same objectives [and] with the same effects.\u201d She added that Google would be given a chance to respond to the EU\u2019s concerns. Dan Taylor, the vice-president of global ads at Google, responded to the ruling: \u201cOur advertising technology tools help websites and apps fund their content, and enable businesses of all sizes to effectively reach new customers. Google remains committed to creating value for our publisher and advertiser partners in this highly competitive sector. The commission\u2019s investigation focuses on a narrow aspect of our advertising business and is not new. We disagree with the EC\u2019s view and we will respond accordingly.\u201d In a statement alongside the ruling, Vestager said: \u201cGoogle is present at almost all levels of the so-called ad tech supply chain. Our preliminary concern is that Google may have used its market position to favour its own intermediation services. \u201cNot only did this possibly harm Google\u2019s competitors but also publishers\u2019 interests, while also increasing advertisers\u2019 costs.\u201d The commission said \u201cbehavioural remedies\u201d, which would allow Google to commit to a pro-competition course of action, were unlikely to be sufficient. \u201cIt\u2019s a reflection of how pervasive Google is in the value chain that we perceive that a divestiture is the only way to solve this,\u201d Vestager said. \u201cGoogle is in every part of this value chain. As we see it, they hold the dominant position both in the sell side and the buy side. \u201cWe don\u2019t see that this enhanced conflict of interest can be solved in other way [but] by not having ownership of the entire value chain.\u201d With a 28% share of all global ad revenue, according to insider intelligence, Google is the dominant digital advertising platform. Almost four-fifths of the company\u2019s revenues come from advertising, across properties including YouTube, Google Maps, AdSense, and AdMob. According to Reuters, Google had attempted to settle the case almost two years ago but regulators grew frustrated with the slow pace and lack of substantial concessions. The UK\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has also been investigating Google\u2019s ad-tech platform, with an investigation launched in May last year still ongoing. Andrea Coscelli, the then chief executive of the CMA, said at the time the investigation was launched: \u201cWe\u2019re worried that Google may be using its position in ad tech to favour its own services to the detriment of its rivals, of its customers and ultimately of consumers.\u201d"}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e70153", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/14/uk-has-no-choice-but-to-raise-interest-rates-to-curb-inflation-says-jeremy-hunt", "primaryCategory": "business", "subCategories": [], "title": "UK has no choice but to raise interest rates to curb inflation, says Jeremy Hunt", "lead": "Chancellor gives unstinting support to Bank of England as households brace for borrowing costs to rise again", "author": "Richard Partington and Rupert Jones", "datePublished": "2023-06-14T11:53:27Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.294388", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/257a7cfc60a34be69f8b56a9f181b7770c51ae4a/0_187_5616_3370/500.jpg", "body": "Jeremy Hunt has said the UK has \u201cno alternative\u201d but to raise interest rates to bring down inflation , as households brace for the Bank of England to increase borrowing costs further next week. The chancellor said the government would be \u201cunstinting in its support\u201d for the central bank to \u201cdo what it takes\u201d to squeeze high inflation out of the system amid the cost of living crisis. In its most aggressive round of interest rate rises in decades, the Bank has already increased borrowing costs from 0.1% in December 2021 to 4.5%, and financial markets expect another rise of at least a quarter-point at its next policy meeting on 22 June. Predictions suggest rates could peak above 5.5% before Christmas. Growing numbers of households are coming under pressure from the higher cost of mortgages and loans, adding to the burden on their finances while inflation is at its highest rate since the early 1980s. The Resolution Foundation thinktank forecasts that 1.6 million mortgage holders will come to the end of cheaper fixed-rate deals this year, adding about \u00a32,300 to a typical borrower\u2019s annual repayments. Banks and building societies are continuing to pull home loans off the shelves and raise the cost of their fixed-rate mortgages, in a scramble by lenders to reprice their deals to take account of Britain\u2019s higher interest rate prospects. On Wednesday, days after it temporarily pulled down the shutters due to a surge in demand, HSBC announced that it would be raising the pricing on a swath of its residential and buy-to-let fixed deals with effect from Thursday. Other lenders increasing rates included Coventry Building Society\u2019s broker arm, which said it would be launching new, more expensive deals on Friday. On Monday, Santander became the latest big bank to temporarily pull its mortgage deals for new borrowers from sale, and the following day, NatWest put up the rates on some of its deals by as much as 1.57 percentage points. Hunt was asked on the BBC if he was following John Major\u2019s dictum on tackling inflation from 1989 \u2013 \u201cIf it isn\u2019t hurting, it isn\u2019t working\u201d. The chancellor said: \u201cIn the end, there is no alternative to bringing down inflation, if we want to see consumers spending, if we want to see businesses investing, if we want to see long-term growth and prosperity. \u201cWe have to do everything we can as a government, as a country, to support the Bank of England in their mission to squeeze inflation out of the system.\u201d Major made his comment at a time when the Treasury was in charge of setting interest rates to manage inflation. Tony Blair\u2019s administration handed that responsibility to the Bank in 1997 when it granted the central bank independence. Rishi Sunak\u2019s government is under mounting pressure over the blow to millions of households from higher borrowing costs. Almost a third of voters blamed the government for soaring mortgage costs after Liz Truss\u2019 mini-budget last autumn, which triggered turmoil in financial markets, according to a YouGov poll from October. The prime minister pledged in January to halve the UK\u2019s annual inflation rate by the end of this year, but economists say his target is increasingly at risk because inflation remains persistently high. UK government borrowing costs rose above the levels hit during Truss\u2019s premiership on Tuesday, after stronger than expected jobs and pay figures reinforced expectations that the Bank would take action to curtail stubborn inflation. Fresh figures on Wednesday showed that the UK economy managed a return to growth in April as rising car sales and customers spending in pubs and bars helped fuel a modest rise in national output. The Office for National Statistics said gross domestic product rose by a slender 0.2% month on month, matching the forecasts of City economists for a recovery from March, when output declined by 0.3%. A spokesperson for the Treasury said a stable economy was the best way to help reduce mortgage rates, \u201cwhich is why we are dedicated to halving inflation, growing our economy and reducing debt\u201d. \u201cWe understand mortgage holders are worried about repayments, and the chancellor has been clear he expects banks to live up to their responsibilities and support any mortgage borrowers who are finding it tough right now \u2013 as set out in FCA guidance.\u201d"}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e70154", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/14/privileges-committee-signs-off-boris-johnson-partygate-report", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": [], "title": "Privileges committee signs off Boris Johnson Partygate report", "lead": "Exclusive: MPs\u2019 verdict that former prime minister misled parliament on course to be published on Thursday morning", "author": "Aubrey Allegretti", "datePublished": "2023-06-14T11:49:57Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.294400", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/1af856926c4c4758a4c5f13a2bef1897c5923ca6/0_31_3550_2131/500.jpg", "body": "A long-awaited report that will find Boris Johnson misled parliament over Partygate has been signed off by the privileges committee, marking the end of a year-long inquiry that saw him quit the Commons in fury at its findings. Seven MPs on the cross-party group, which has a Tory majority and Labour chair, held multiple meetings on Tuesday and endorsed the report at around 7pm, the Guardian has been told. A damning assessment of Johnson\u2019s promise that no Covid rules were broken and claims he was repeatedly assured the gatherings were within the rules is on course to be published on Thursday morning. Johnson cannot be suspended from parliament \u2013 a punishment he was likely to face \u2013 because he announced he was stepping down last Friday and formally left the Commons on Monday. However, the privileges committee is keen to ensure he does not get away scot-free. It is likely to recommend that he be blocked from being given the pass offered to most former MPs granting him privileged access to the Westminster estate. Such a decision would be up to the Commons speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, but there is precedent. An independent expert panel made the same recommendation about John Bercow in its report about his bullying that was published after he quit as an MP. The Commons declined to comment, but in a statement on Tuesday said Johnson had submitted a letter making fresh representations at 11.57pm the previous night which it was working through promptly. Once a select committee report is signed off, a large logistical operation gets under way to print copies and plan for its release. Government insiders and committee sources said they wanted to ensure the report was published by about 10:30am on Thursday, when the Commons leader, Penny Mordaunt, will make a statement about business for the week. It is up to her to announce the timing of a vote on the report, given MPs have to accept a report in order for it to formally come into effect. The vote is likely to be held next Monday as Downing Street hopes to get the issue over with as quickly as possible, given the row over Partygate has dragged on for 18 months. All MPs voted to set up the inquiry by the privileges committee last April, after an investigation by Scotland Yard issued more than 120 fines and a separate investigation into the culture of rule-breaking by the then senior civil servant Sue Gray. Johnson\u2019s spokesperson was contacted for comment. On Tuesday evening, the former prime minister said: \u201cThe privileges committee should publish their report and let the world judge their nonsense. They have no excuse for delay. \u201cTheir absurdly unfair rules do not even allow any criticism of their findings. I have made my views clear to the committee in writing \u2013 and will do so more widely when they finally publish.\u201d"}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e70155", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jun/14/when-winston-went-to-war-with-the-wireless-review-bbc-crisis-jack-thorne-donmar-warehouse", "primaryCategory": "stage", "subCategories": [], "title": "When Winston Went to War With the Wireless review \u2013 radio is the star of BBC crisis drama", "lead": "Jack Thorne\u2019s dramatisation of the power play between the UK government and the broadcaster in 1920s Britain is pacy and evocative", "author": "Arifa Akbar", "datePublished": "2023-06-14T11:47:20Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.294408", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/d80d8c60173fc2ad724384bdd9e359b1e22086da/396_270_2003_1202/500.jpg", "body": "If Reithian principles represent the ideal of truth-telling and impartiality in public service broadcasting today, Jack Thorne\u2019s play looks back at the man who established them at a delicate moment in the history of the BBC, and dramatises his inner tussle with truth. We find John Reith at the helm of the British Broadcasting Company \u2013 not yet a corporation but on its way to becoming so. That outcome is threatened in 1926, during the general strike, which extends the reach of Reith\u2019s wireless service in the absence of newspapers (the presses went on strike too). It brings him into conflict with Stanley Baldwin\u2019s government which seeks to co-opt the service as a state broadcaster. Reith strikes a win by featuring trade union views but loses to the government\u2019s edict not to air a conciliatory speech by the archbishop of Canterbury. The BBC\u2019s future as a corporation stands in the balance if he does not bend to their will. The story comes in fast, evocative scenes with dialogue delivering lots of information, entertainingly, but not with enough probing. Stephen Campbell Moore\u2019s Reith is God-fearing, self-important, and spends much of his time on his knees praying. He is neither hero nor villain, not problematic in itself, but we do not feel we know him by the end. Ultimately, we are not sure what the play is saying: that impartiality is impossible to achieve? That men with great ideals can never live up to them? That there is no such thing as the greater good, only the good, as the archbishop quizzically says? While the play\u2019s issues resonate today \u2013 from the way the Israel-Palestine conflict is reported to the Gary Lineker controversy \u2013 it never stops seeming like a period piece. In a subplot, we see how Reith is quietly tormented by the memory of his homosexual lover, Charlie (Luke Newberry). There is connective tissue between Reith\u2019s central battle for truth and his marriage to Muriel (Mariam Haque), built on lies. But the nature of the lie is entirely different and the subplot threatens to take over: Muriel is sketchily drawn but Reith\u2019s flashbacks to Charlie bring the play alive and we want more of their story. Haydn Gwynne is especially charming as Baldwin and Adrian Scarborough is, as always, engaging as Winston Churchill, then chancellor of the exchequer, who takes charge of Baldwin\u2019s battle. This is not, as the title suggests, a play about Churchill who is a flat character, petulant with overweaning ambition, never played entirely seriously, it seems. Under the direction of Katy Rudd, the stagecraft dazzles, most ingeniously through Ben and Max Ringham\u2019s foley effects. Items such as a typewriter, a fish bowl and a teapot stand exposed at the back of the stage. Actors use them to create noises, often playfully, at a mic and this is as central to the drama as the story itself. Sound is married to visuals in arresting ways too on Laura Hopkins\u2019 clever set and flashes of light (design by Howard Hudson with video projection by Andrzej Goulding) reveal the strike itself. It is this delight in and celebration of sound, so apt for a play about the power of radio, that makes the play worth seeing.

In order to protect the fish populations of poorer African nations from rapacious overfishing by richer countries, EU tuna vessels are bound by agreements centred on the sustainability and \u201csocial empowerment\u201d of third countries. Last week, however, in an unprecedented action involving 64 vessels and roughly 2,000 crew from Senegal and Ivory Coast, 80% of the EU fleet in the Gulf of Guinea and the Indian Ocean went on strike. Not only were they protesting over poor pay and working conditions in one of the world\u2019s most dangerous jobs, they also said the agreements from the EU aren\u2019t worth the paper they\u2019re printed on. They accused the EU fleet of unsustainable practices, and urged the EU commission to listen to NGOs and investigate. Some fishers from Senegal and Ivory Coast employed on French and Spanish-owned vessels are paid as little as $219 (\u00a3174) a month, or $54 (\u00a342) a week, according to the International Transport Workers\u2019 Federation (ITF), which backed the strike. Their wages, far less than the monthly minimum of $658 (\u00a3522) set by the International Labour Organisation (ILO), contravene longstanding agreements between the EU commission and African countries to promote sustainable fishing and employment, unions said. These agreements, which represent up to \u20ac5m (\u00a34.2m) a year, are \u201cmassively lucrative\u201d for the French and Spanish firms whose vessels are licensed to fish tuna in African waters, according to the federation. Johnny Hansen, the chair of the ITF\u2019s fisheries sector, said: \u201cIt beggars belief that superprofitable companies and the government authorities, benefiting from highly advantageous fishing agreements negotiated for them by the EU commission, think it is acceptable to disregard the clear provision for the ILO seafarers\u2019 basic minimum wage.\u201d Yoro Kane, the general secretary of the fishers\u2019 union UDTS, Senegal, said the agreements between the EU commission and African countries are \u201cmassively lucrative for the French and Spanish firms whose vessels are licensed to fish for tuna\u201d, but the ILO minimum salary of $658 is not being observed, with some paid a third of that figure. Opagac, a Spanish organisation representing producers of frozen tuna, denied claims crew are paid less than the ILO minimum or that any breach of fisheries agreements, known as sustainable fisheries partnership agreements (SFPA), had taken place. The fishers have told unions that the EU vessels are under-reporting catch in order to reduce crew\u2019s catch bonuses, and that fishing observers, the \u201ceyes and ears\u201d of vessels responsible for checking catch data, are absent. These requirements also form part of the SFPAs. Stocks of the tropical tuna species yellowfin and bigeye are overfished in the Indian Ocean, where the EU fleet harvests a third of tropical tuna. The four-day strike has been suspended pending a proposal brokered by the Senegalese and Ivory Coast authorities. A letter to Ivory Coast\u2019s director general for maritime affairs, sent by a lawyer for the fishers and UMPCI and SYMAPECI unions for the Ivory Coast fishers, said the strike was lifted after a proposal to pay intermediate monthly salaries equivalent to \u00a3390 to the crew, plus bonuses. Dated 8 June, the letter said that some fishers had been arrested and imprisoned, and called for their release. A settlement needed to be agreed within 15 days, to \u201ccalm tensions\u201d, it said. The interim payment was agreed on the understanding that substantive negotiations on payment of the ILO minimum would begin with employers within three weeks. Alfonso Daniels, the author of a report by the Financial Transparency Coalition that named the huge Spanish tuna company Albacora SA as among the world\u2019s top 10 companies involved in alleged IUU (illegal, unreported and unregulated) fishing, said: \u201cThere are grounds to believe these companies are not acting sustainably, and now there are concerns over labour rights. The EU, having signed these agreements, should investigate these companies.\u201d An EU Commission official said fishers are entitled to the ILO minimum wage but the definition of basic salary differs from country to country, in particular in relation to bonuses. ILO guidance refers to national laws to rule the matter, the official said, adding that the commission is \u201cfollowing closely the strike affecting some EU vessels\u201d, and will \u201cstrongly push\u201d for working groups to address issues concerning fishers\u2019 pay and conditions. Julio Mor\u00f3n, managing director of Opagac, which represents Albacora, Nicra and Petusa, three Spanish companies owning vessels operating under SFPA sustainable agreements, said the EU tuna fleet \u201cstrictly complies with national and international legislation, and all sailors earn more than the ILO minimum wage.\u201d He denied accusations of non-compliance with fisheries agreements. He added: \u201cA period of six months of negotiation has been opened between African employers and unions that we hope can be resolved in a positive way for all.\u201d The ITF union has submitted the fishers\u2019 wider concerns to a body responsible for a review of the SFPA between the EU and Ivory Coast in 2024, with the hope they can be addressed by French and Spanish vessels before the signing of any agreement."}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e70157", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/global/2023/jun/14/tell-us-how-has-the-housing-crisis-affected-your-dating-life-or-relationship", "primaryCategory": "lifeandstyle", "subCategories": [], "title": "Tell us: how has the housing crisis affected your dating life or relationship?", "lead": "We would like to hear from people in the UK about the relationship pressures they have experienced due to housing costs", "author": "Guardian community team", "datePublished": "2023-06-14T11:33:20Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.294427", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/2c9f9fcdf67e90a37fcb332900e40c32188b5b42/0_503_8255_4954/500.jpg", "body": "UK house prices are rising, mortgage rates are climbing and rents are at an all-rime high, and we want to know if that\u2019s affected your relationship or dating life.

Thorpe made the initial claims under parliamentary privilege during an interjection in the Senate on Wednesday afternoon as Van was speaking about respect in parliament. At 7.30pm on Wednesday, Thorpe returned to the chamber to withdraw the remarks, in a brief statement directed to Senate president Sue Lines. \u201cEarlier today I made some comments in relation to another senator.

I can\u2019t [withdraw], because this person harassed me, sexually assaulted me,\u201d Thorpe alleged. \u201cThe prime minister had to remove him from his office.

It is just a lie. And I reject it ... it\u2019s just not true.\u201d Following the Senate\u2019s question time on Wednesday afternoon, during the chamber\u2019s time allotted to \u201ctake note of answers\u201d from the question time session, several senators reflected on responses provided by the finance minister, Katy Gallagher, about her knowledge of Brittany Higgins\u2019s allegations of rape. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Van was critical of Labor\u2019s prior questioning of Coalition members about the Higgins matter, and spoke about parliamentarians \u201csetting the standard\u201d for Australia. Thorpe can be heard interjecting on taped video of Van\u2019s speech, although parliamentary microphones in the chamber did not pick up the detail of her words. The acting senate president, Andrew McLachlan, who was speaking to another senator at the time, asked Thorpe to stop interjecting and called for a \u201crespectful debate\u201d.

Van called for a better \u201cdiscourse\u201d in the chamber, and as Thorpe\u2019s interjections continued, McLachlan asked her multiple times to withdraw those comments before she stood to make her claim. After Thorpe referred to Van as a \u201cperpetrator\u201d, McLachlan immediately asked her to withdraw the claim, which he said was \u201cinappropriate\u201d. Thorpe said \u201cI can\u2019t\u201d before making further claims. McLachlan said he would refer the matter to the Senate president, Sue Lines, who was not in the chamber at the time.

Van then withdrew the word \u201clie\u201d, adding \u201cit is just not true\u201d. Thorpe and Lines have been contacted for comment. In a statement, Van called the claims \u201coutrageous and reprehensible\u201d and said they were \u201cunfounded and completely untrue allegations against me that I immediately and unequivocally denied and continue to deny\u201d. \u201cMy lawyers have written to her already making my position clear in the strongest possible terms,\u201d he said.

Not so much SZA. The hordes that await the opening night of the American singer\u2019s UK SOS tour are overwhelmingly female, but their subcultural uniform is an incongruous mix: cargo pants and cowboy boots, headscarves and high-contrast mesh, designer slogan T-shirts and grungy babydoll slips. It\u2019s a glorious sight, showing that music really does bring people together. Seemingly, this is exactly the way that SZA wants it. If Drake, the Weeknd and Kanye West defined the 2010s with their dark, sad-boy reinventions of gangsta rap, then SZA offered up a feminine side of the narrative, espousing her sass but still succumbing to hunger for social approval and ill-advised intimacy. The first female signee to Top Dawg Entertainment (Kendrick Lamar, ScHoolboy Q, Isaiah Rashad), her debut album Ctrl was a seismic breakthrough \u2013 nominated for four Grammys, its bad-bitch anthems still confessed to an insecurity that lay beneath. 2022\u2019s follow-up SOS had the same lyrical brief but an even greater sonic palette, establishing SZA as someone who shares listeners\u2019 ever-diversifying tastes, tapping into anything and everything that moves her. Transforming through various nautical-themed sets, SZA\u2019s show enacts this versatility. She is poised on the tip of a diving board for opener PSA (as she is on the cover of SOS, replicating a Princess Diana image); with a gasp, she falls and emerges on an LED-stacked shipwreck, moving through Seek &amp; Destroy\u2019s fluid choreography. No matter how loud her live band wails or how energetically her dancers flock, her voice always rises above, daring the audience to outdo her clambering ad-libs. She soon gets her wish on Love Galore: when collaborator Travis Scott pops out of the ship\u2019s parapet, the screams amplify to fingers-in-your-ears-decibels, enthusiastic arms moving as if swatting off invisible birds. Introducing an A-list guest star so early could be a reckless move, but in a 30-song set, SZA never wastes a minute. Ghost In the Machine and Blind are a smart shift of intellectual-indie pace, while the cheeky, tropical Kiss Me More reminds the crowd that she can also do straight chart pop. For the opening of her third act, we\u2019re transported inside a submarine control room that feeds live footage from backstage, cameras trained on her face as stagehands buzz around her next sartorial change. Before you can take in the Truman Show elegance of it, she\u2019s already floating out on the Sufjan Stevens-style seas of Blind, head-banging her way through the pop-punk of F2F, and belting out fan-favourite Drew Barrymore cross-legged on the floor, trading lines with the teary crowd upfront (\u201cI get so lonely I forget what I\u2019m worth,\u201d she confides; \u201cWe get so lonely we pretend that this works,\u201d they echo back). Not long after, she ditches the main stage entirely in favour of an orange lifeboat that sails above the crowd, dispatching handfuls of confetti and sharing more beautifully heartfelt ballads about an ex-partner of 11 years who cruelly \u201cblocked her on everything\u201d. It\u2019s this elastic, seamless back-and-forth between intimate personability and big-production polish that makes SZA\u2019s live show a marvel. For her closer, she slow-writhes through breakthrough single The Weekend, before ultimately ending on the dreamy Good Days, back on the diving board and bathed in sunset gold. It\u2019s an understated finish, but one befitting an artist who trusts the message of their own catalogue, knowing that to end on straightforward R&amp;B optimism does not undo the rich variety that has been showcased before. The ultimate message is clear: wherever R&amp;B is headed next, you can rely on SZA to steer the ship."}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e7015a", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/14/nottingham-third-victim-of-attacks-named-ian-coates", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "subCategories": [], "title": "Nottingham: third victim of attacks named as Ian Coates", "lead": "Tributes paid to \u2018much-loved\u2019 primary school caretaker who \u2018always went the extra mile\u2019", "author": "Robyn Vinter North of England correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-06-14T11:18:48Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.294452", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/fb650255f028379064d8afa8661beba8bc9413f5/0_0_434_260/master/434.jpg", "body": "The third victim of the Nottingham attacks has been named locally as Ian Coates, a \u201cbeloved\u201d primary school caretaker.

Its release has garnered the spotlight with conversation returning to the importance of having equipment for women designed around them and whether major corporations are doing enough. Until relatively recently, this seemingly common-sense concept has largely been ignored by manufacturers. Women\u2019s bodies are built differently but female athletes at all levels have been expected to perform in kit built for men. This has, at best, caused mild discomfort and, at worse, increased susceptibility to injury. The need for something specific for women has never been more prevalent. At one point this season, 25% of the 2022 Ballon d\u2019Or nominees were sidelined with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries, which are so serious they can take away at least 10 months of a player\u2019s career. Marie-Antoinette Katoto, Beth Mead, Vivianne Miedema were among the high-profile players who were struck by the curse. Research released by Dr Katrine Okholm Kryger of St Mary\u2019s University, Twickenham, last year revealed how the use of unsuitable football kit could increase instances of injury. In terms of a boot, a woman\u2019s foot differs in shape and size to men\u2019s, while a lighter bodyweight affects the length of studs required. In the past, boots have tended to be marketed towards women without being truly designed for them. One of the first companies to tackle this was Ida Sports. Its co-founder Laura Youngson had experienced pain while wearing children\u2019s boots in order to play, and came up with the idea in the process of helping to break a Guinness World Record: playing a match with Equal Playing Field on Kilimanjaro in 2017 \u2013 the game played at the altitude \u2013 and realising other women were in the same boat. Ida decided to fill the gap, testing its prototype and releasing its first boot in 2020. \u201cI think what really struck me was the running shoes experience,\u201d Youngson says. \u201cYou go into a sports store and there are loads of running shoes for women. I was like: \u2018Why isn\u2019t it happening for football?\u2019 For me, the driving factor is: can we reduce pain for our customers? \u201cIt\u2019s even more important looking at this group of girls coming up. Not only from the functional aspect of girls going through puberty and having stuff that\u2019s made for them \u2026 I think it\u2019s also about the emotional experience. Can I walk into a sports store and see myself there?\u201d More brands have followed, albeit slightly tentatively. In July 2021, Puma produced its first women\u2019s fit boot as part of the Ultra range, with the latest edition launched in April. A women\u2019s fit is now also available as part of its Future and King ranges. Last week came Nike\u2019s Phantom Luna, a boot two years in the making and according to the manufacturer \u201cbacked by Nike\u2019s most meaningful investment in women yet\u201d and \u201cwith [the female athlete] at the centre of the process\u201d. Nike says it is made up of \u201cthree key elements: traction, fit and feel \u2013 all of which were designed with female-specific feedback, needs and anatomy in mind\u201d. The boot features a tighter fit around the ankle and contains a new circular stud pattern near the toes to help with traction and mobility and is supposed to have to \u201cbigger touch zones\u201d because of the smaller size of women\u2019s feet. The Phantom Luna is offered to both male and female players and this is a sticking point: it is not exclusively a women\u2019s boot. More needs to be done to truly understand the science and the European Club Association has announced just that \u2013 a \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d study commissioned to highlight the benefits of well-designed footwear. Around 350 players have taken part to date, with 3D imagery captured of their feet. Their goal is for the results \u2013 to be revealed at their summit towards the end of this month \u2013 to \u201cact as a global reference point for brands and consumers\u201d. This progress is welcomed by Youngson. \u201cI want to keep pushing the bigger brands to really develop this and invest in women \u2026 [they] are accepting it and that\u2019s cool because then it\u2019s just about making awesome shoes and building a brand that resonates with women and finding that space. Women are never going to be an afterthought for us whereas I feel like that\u2019s how I felt and why I set Ida up.\u201d Have a question for our writers \u2013 or want to suggest a topic to cover?

The festival\u2019s high-profile opening gala slot has been handed to Silent Roar, the debut feature from director Johnny Barrington, produced by The Inbetweeners Movie\u2019s Christopher Young. Described by the festival as \u201ca teenage tale of surfing, sex and hellfire\u201d, Silent Roar was filmed on the remote community of Uig, on Lewis in Scotland\u2019s Western Isles and stars Louis McCartney and Ella Lily Hyland. The announcement marks a remarkable turnaround for the festival, which appeared doomed after CMI\u2019s collapse, which simultaneously forced the closure of the Filmhouse cinemas in Edinburgh and Aberdeen. However, with the help of the wider Edinburgh international festival, the film festival was able to re-organise itself on a smaller scale with a \u201ccompact selection of films\u201d. The film festival will also take place in August at the same time as Edinburgh\u2019s theatre, comedy and music festivals, having shifted to June in 2008. However, the fate of the celebrated Filmhouse cinema in Edinburgh, which for decades had acted as the festival\u2019s HQ, is still far from clear. Reports emerged in April that the site, a former church in the city\u2019s Lothian Road, had been sold for \u00a32.65m, with the buyers rumoured to be pub operators Caledonian Heritable. A campaign is now under way to try to ensure the building remains a cinema, with discussions involving interested parties including Edinburgh Council and Creative Scotland. \u2022 The Edinburgh film festival is due to announce its full programme on 6 July and runs from 18 to 23 August."}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e7015d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/jun/14/10-ways-more-confident-work-colleagues-positive", "primaryCategory": "money", "subCategories": [], "title": "\u2018Hoard evidence of your greatness\u2019: 10 ways to be much more confident at work", "lead": "Make people laugh, keep a praise file, deal with your inner critic \u2013 and avoid comparison-itis.

Or is it normal to feel disillusioned and fed up at least some of the time? I mean, it is work. It is not your life. Amid all the noise and drama about quiet quitting, generational differences, hybrid working patterns, flexible hours, \u201cthe Great Resignation\u201d and whatever latest workplace trend is in the headlines, there\u2019s a temptation to believe that you need to love your work and feel very confident in it to be a fully functioning member of society. We tend to forget that most people neither love their work nor hate it. They just do it reasonably uneventfully, get paid and then go home. Sometimes that is the definition of professional confidence: getting the job done. But what if that\u2019s not enough? According to the UK\u2019s Jobs Confidence Index, \u201cjob search and progression confidence\u201d rose slightly towards the end of last year, indicating that workers are broadly optimistic about (a) being able to get a job somewhere else if they want to, and (b) being promoted or achieving progression where they are. But the picture is mixed: we may supposedly have relative job stability but earnings are stagnant. In the last quarter of 2022, the UK saw the worst contraction in real earnings since the first quarter of 2009. No wonder a lot of people are not confident in their, er, confidence. How, then, to be just confident enough at work, without getting caught up in unrealistic expectations? 1. Listen more, talk less and rethink your attitude towards silence We often think that being confident at work means being loud and demonstrative and talking all the time. Shelley Purchon is founding director of English Unlocked, an organisation that encourages companies to remember that about one in 10 of the UK population is using English as a second language. \u201cIf you begin to see silence as something you are \u2018gifting\u2019 to other listeners, it helps you to slow down. It\u2019s easy to forget that a speaker who really takes their time can actually appear more confident that one who speaks at a mile a minute.\u201d 2. Let other people own their bad behaviour If you work with someone who knocks your confidence, remember that this is probably because of some deficiency in them, not you. \u201cWhen you are attacked or targeted in the workplace, it is easy to accept blame and assume the problem lies with you,\u201d says psychotherapist Naomi Shragai, author of Work Therapy (Or, the Man Who Mistook His Job for His Life). \u201cIt is more likely the \u2018attacker\u2019 is attempting to rid themselves of unwanted feelings by making you feel bad. You might need to enlist the help of a trusted ally or professional in order to shift the \u2018bad\u2019 feelings away from yourself and back where they belong.\u201d 3. Be honest about your negativity If you really are hating your day-to-day, be clear with yourself about it, says Sarah Taylor, mental fitness and leadership coach at Magnify, which supports founders and startups. \u201cThe evidence from neuroscience reveals that the act of labelling an emotion plays a significant role in reducing its emotional punch. Just saying, \u2018I feel dread\u2019 will reduce the activation of the amygdala, the fear-centre of the brain.\u201d Once you have named what you feel, you can make a plan, whether it\u2019s confiding in a trusted former colleague, getting professional help or taking a holiday. (See also 10 below.) 4. Hoard evidence of your greatness Many business thinkers, including the award-winning author Margaret Heffernan and the entrepreneur Abadesi Osunsade, advocate keeping a list of your \u201cwork receipts\u201d. Just as you might keep track of expenses and invoices, keep track of all your achievements, positive feedback, invisible wins and high points. Shragai explains: \u201cIf you\u2019ve lost your mojo, bring to mind times when you performed at your peak. Consider the following: who has witnessed your achievements and praised them? What convinced them of your talents? What would they say to encourage you now?\u201d Keep a praise file on your desktop with emails, screenshots and notes. Singing Fatboy Slim\u2019s \u201cI have to celebrate you, baby\u201d to yourself as you update it weekly is optional. 5. Make people (and yourself) laugh Humour at work is underrated. It can be tricky to judge whether certain kinds of humour are going to land favourably and are risk-free, but work is often profoundly stupid and this can be very funny. Concentrate on being warm and friendly rather than \u201ctelling jokes\u201d. If you can make people laugh at work \u2013 and you\u2019re certain that everyone is laughing and no one is feeling extremely uncomfortable \u2013 then you are doing OK. \u201cCan you make someone laugh? Can you make a friend? These capabilities are what really count,\u201d says Purchon. 6. Deal with your inner critic Many of our fears and anxieties about how we are perceived at work are entirely imaginary. \u201cRemote work is both a blessing and a curse,\u201d says Taylor. \u201cThe greater isolation means our inner chatter is louder and less diluted. We need to work a lot harder to actively manage that chatter in order to avoid stress, burnout and anxiety.\u201d Ethan Kross\u2019s Chatter: The Voice in Our Head, Why It Matters, and How to Harness It offers great practical tips, from accepting the voice but turning down the volume, to \u201ctalking to yourself\u201d kindly in the third person. (\u201cWhat does Viv need today?\u201d \u201cShe needs a double espresso.\u201d) 7. Beware comparison-itis Comparison is the thief of joy in all aspects of life. But with regards to work in particular, we all have different wants and needs, operate at different speeds and have different priorities. If you sense resentment creeping in about a colleague\u2019s achievements or arrangements, ask yourself whether you really know the full picture about them. Speaker coach Elizabeth Van Den Bergh says: \u201cWe do a lot of scrolling on social media, which leads to way too much comparing. But what you compare is your messy backside with someone else\u2019s shiny front. Comparison kills joy, confidence and personality. Carefully pick people around you with whom you can honestly discuss your work or your business.\u201d 8. Think about connection in advance The past three years have been confusing for many workers, who find themselves juggling the pros and cons of hybrid working: wanting the freedom of working from home, but also missing colleagues and structure. Vanessa Sanyauke is the founder of The Hill, a jobs app connecting female talent with opportunities. \u201cI see this kind of tension with the community that we work with. The pandemic helped introverts: you can control the dynamic, read off your notes, type in the chat box \u2026 But after a while you miss that community feel. And you don\u2019t feel like you belong to something.\u201d If you work from home a lot, the telephone is your friend: make old-school phone calls to maintain connections. Schedule regular days alongside colleagues when you all agree to be in the office or around for lunch or drinks at the same time. 9. Guard against being petty The idea of being \u201chappy high status\u201d at work is a way to rephrase confidence as magnanimity. It can be summed up as an \u201cego-free\u201d reaction, you at your least self-conscious or, essentially, you at your least petty. If you feel undermined or lacking in self-assurance as a reaction to a specific incident, ask yourself: \u201cHow can I rise above this?\u201d If you can find another reaction that moves you away from pettiness, that\u2019s happy high status. If your reaction is justified and not petty, talk to a colleague or manager about how the situation can be resolved. 10. Drink your pina colada (or metaphorical equivalent) \u201cTake your holiday leave in full\u201d might seem like a very basic instruction. But a 2022 Censuswide survey found that more than 60% of UK workers do not take all of their holiday entitlement. That is 18 million people not taking the days off that are their right. That is a lot of un-drunk pina coladas. Many studies show that there is a direct link between confidence and tiredness. When you are given time off, take it. \u2022 Happy High Status: How to Be Effortlessly Confident by Viv Groskop is out on 29 June (Torva, \u00a316.99).

What would be a safer place to stash them: your bathroom or your garage? According to the House speaker, Kevin McCarthy, who on Monday defended Donald Trump after photos released by federal investigators showed boxes of classified documents piled high next to a shower in the ex-president\u2019s Florida resort home, the answer is the bathroom. \u201cA bathroom door locks,\u201d the California Republican said. That would be more secure, McCarthy argued, than the location where classified documents were found stored in Joe Biden\u2019s residence: in his garage \u201cthat opens up all the time\u201d. Biden disclosed in January that his attorneys had discovered a small number of files in his house\u2019s garage, commenting: \u201cMy Corvette is in a locked garage, so it\u2019s not like they\u2019re sitting out on the street.\u201d The president said he returned all the materials as soon as they were discovered, which is why he hasn\u2019t been charged like Trump, who federal prosecutors say made repeated false statements and conspired to obstruct them from retrieving the files. At this point there\u2019s no telling how Trump\u2019s unprecedented prosecution will pan out. That said, we can certainly spare a quick moment to settle the question about which part of the house would be best to keep one\u2019s improperly retained state secrets. Multiple construction and home improvement professionals who spoke to the Guardian agreed: a bathroom would be one of the worst possible places in your home to store important files. Zach Barnes-Corby, the head of construction at Block Renovation, said that surfaces in bathrooms are treated with water-resistant materials to endure the high level of humidity. \u201cAnything that is stored in the bathroom that isn\u2019t moisture-resistant is going to deteriorate very quickly,\u201d he says. \u201cYou have mold and mildew that can quickly spread through any materials. You also have exposure to cleaning products, which can deteriorate lightweight materials like documents easily.\u201d Joshua Bartlett, who runs the home improvement website I\u2019ll Just Fix it Myself, agrees: \u201cThere\u2019s too much risk of destroying any document in a place where there is always water usage, especially in a place like Mar-a-Lago, where I\u2019m pretty sure bathrooms get cleaned daily,\u201d he said. Could a bathroom lock offer some protection? The experts agree: no. \u201cIt would be very unusual for a bathroom door to lock from the outside as they are almost always set up to only lock from the inside,\u201d says Bartlett, explaining the obvious flaw in McCarthy\u2019s thinking. Bathroom door locks have another weakness: almost every one has a small hole that allows it to be opened from the outside with a small object like a pin, \u201cin case one of the kids gets locked in\u201d, says Eric Marie, a Chicago-based contractor. \u201cWhen it comes to safety, a bathroom door will be a two out of 10.\u201d If a bathroom door is a two, then a garage door would be \u201cmore like an eight or nine\u201d, says Marie. The panels may be made of steel, aluminum, or solid wood, and some even have additional locking latches on the inside. \u201cIt\u2019s much harder to go through a garage door than any door in your house,\u201d the contractor says. Unlike what McCarthy implied, \u201cabsolutely every garage door has a locking mechanism,\u201d says Barnes-Corby. Typically garage doors are designed so that \u201cwithout the specific controller of the door, you can\u2019t open it. There\u2019s no way to pry it open. \u201cI would say a garage door is more secure for sure than a bathroom door,\u201d he adds. While Trump and Biden\u2019s storage choices may be concerning, they wouldn\u2019t be the first officials to leave classified documents in questionable places. In April, sensitive documents about the inner workings of a UK Royal Navy nuclear submarine were reportedly found on the bathroom floor in a packed Wetherspoons pub. In 2018, a New Zealand intelligence agency staffer left a bag of unidentified classified documents in a cafe bathroom. And in 2016, a US navy veteran, Harold T Martin, was arrested after investigators discovered he was hoarding at his home thousands of physical documents and hard drives containing 50 terabytes of national security data, with some materials strewn across his garage and the backseat of his car. Martin\u2019s federal defender said he was a \u201ccompulsive hoarder\u201d and \u201cnot Edward Snowden\u201d. He was sentenced in 2019 to nine years in prison. Something for McCarthy to think about."}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e7015f", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/14/top-10-books-about-missing-persons-una-mannion", "primaryCategory": "books", "subCategories": [], "title": "Top 10 books about missing persons", "lead": "These interrupted stories, in fiction and real life, are powerfully moving and key into a universal anxiety", "author": "Una Mannion", "datePublished": "2023-06-14T11:00:02Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.294486", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/1b2f58fdecda1a4bc97e05f51b35ba3d18ce2d30/0_138_6016_3611/500.jpg", "body": "A missing person is a story that doesn\u2019t end. We grapple to make sense, to decipher, to make meaning out of something so unfathomable. Jon Billman refers to the \u201cpurgatorial underworld of the vanished\u201d, a description that makes great sense to me. The missing are caught in an in-between place, not here but not gone. Stories about missing persons respond to this cultural anxiety, their narratives plotting explanations or recovering and remembering the absent souls, refusing their oblivion. In my novel Tell Me What I Am a woman goes missing, leaving behind her sister and her four-year-old daughter. They alternately narrate the story of what happened and, I like to think, together engage in act of recovery. 1. On Chapel Sands: My Mother and Other Missing Persons by Laura Cumming This memoir about the mystery of Cumming\u2019s mother\u2019s identity and her abduction when she was three years old is beautifully descriptive yet reads almost like a thriller as the past unspools. With her mother, Cumming sifts through objects, photographs, police reports, and shadows of memories as they piece together the story of the missing persons in her mother\u2019s life and her missing past. She quotes St Augustine: \u201cThe dead may be invisible, but they are not absent.\u201d A stunning reflection on how we forget, remember and love, even those who have been missing all our lives. 2. Songs for the Missing by Stewart O\u2019Nan In the summer of 2005, 18-year-old Kim Larsen vanishes on her way to work. Her Chevette is found several days later in a nearby town. O\u2019Nan resists generic expectations, sidelining the thriller elements to offer a compassionate portrait of a family afraid to give up in the face of tragedy. Narrated alternately by Kim\u2019s mother, father and 15-year-old sister, O\u2019Nan shows us a different kind of procedural: endless waiting, spending nights on websites as her sister does, or taking pills to fall into unconsciousness like her mother. Perhaps the most devastating character is the father, desperately driving up and down highways distributing flyers, trying to keep his daughter in the public mind. 3. Nox by Anne Carson Carson\u2019s brother Michael disappeared in 1978 to escape imprisonment and for two decades wandered, making minimal contact with his family before his death in 2000. Nox is an elegy, an experimental poem narrating his story through ephemera \u2013 scribbled notes, photographs, sketches, fragments of phone conversations all stapled in, glued on, copied. This handmade, tactile book felled me, showing how words can resist oblivion and forgetting. \u201cA brother never ends,\u201d she writes. 4. Falling Animals by Sheila Armstrong Armstrong\u2019s debut novel draws on the real case of an unidentified person in the north-west of Ireland. In 2009, \u201cPeter Bergmann\u201d was found washed up on the shore after spending several days in Sligo town cutting labels from his clothes and discarding his belongings in various bins. The mystery of this person who tried to disappear has not been solved but Armstrong distils the event into a meditation on loss and community through a chorus of voices. Elegiac and profoundly beautiful. 5. Then She Was Gone by Lisa Jewell Jewell\u2019s psychological thriller moves between timelines and narrators to create a complex and disturbing story about a missing girl. Ellie Mack disappears just weeks before her GSCEs. Her mother Laurel can\u2019t get past her \u201craw need to keep the search going\u201d and, a decade later, finds herself completely alone, her husband and other children living their own lives elsewhere. Then Laurel meets a man whose nine-year-old daughter bears an uncanny resemblance to Ellie. The tension is intensified by Jewell\u2019s use of multiple narrators, two of whom narrate in the first person and know something about Ellie\u2019s disappearance. 6. I Was Amelia Earhart by Jane Mendelsohn Amelia Earhart\u2019s disappearance in 1937 during her attempt to circumnavigate the world is deeply fixed in the public imagination. In this fictive autobiography, Mendelsohn imagines the fate of America\u2019s most famous missing person. Stranded on an island with her navigator, Earhart reflects on her life, her marriage to George Palmer Putnam and the pressures surrounding the final flights. The prose is sensuous and lyrical: they flew \u201clike fugitive angels\u201d, she writes, and \u201cspent our days feverish from the flaming sun or lost in the artillery of monsoon rains and almost always astonished by the unearthly architecture of the sky\u201d. 7. Ant\u00edgona by Jos\u00e9 Watanabe Sophocles\u2019 story about a sister who buries her brother against a state decree has an enduring legacy, particularly in Latin America where the unburied body of a brother and a sister sent out of the world still living seems an apt metaphor for the disappeared in the wake of state violence. Ant\u00edgona is a verse play written by the Peruvian poet Watanabe in collaboration with Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani and Teresa Ralli in the aftermath of two decades of civil conflict. Ralli interviewed families of the disappeared and was the first to perform the play. The narrator remains unnamed until the end when she symbolically tries to bury her brother: \u201cAnd these late libations are from my little spirit full with remorse.\u201d It is Ismene, sister of Antigone and Polynices, who has survived. Ant\u00edgona powerfully resists the efforts of the state narrative to efface Peru\u2019s disappeared and serves as a vehicle for those left behind to forgive themselves. 8. Highway of Tears: A True Story of Racism, Indifference and the Pursuit of Justice for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls by Jessica McDiarmid The \u201cHighway of Tears\u201d, Canada\u2019s Highway 16 in British Columbia, is a 725km stretch of road known for the number of missing and murdered Indigenous women. Journalist Jessica McDiarmid \u2013 who grew up near the highway, spent several years interviewing families of victims and researching the cases, the investigations and media coverage \u2013 highlights the differing responses when victims were white rather than Indigenous. Focusing on the lives of the girls and women before they disappeared, and the experiences of their families in the aftermath of their disappearances or deaths, McDiarmid points up a larger problem of systemic racism, indifference and victim blaming. 9. The Last Stone by Mark Bowden In 1975 Bowden, author of Black Hawk Down, was a cub reporter for a paper in Baltimore Maryland when two sisters Katherine (10) and Sheila (12) Lyons disappeared from a shopping mall outside Washington DC. He reported on it for two weeks but there were no answers and for almost 40 years the case was cold. In 2013 an investigator came across a statement given by Lloyd Welch (18 years old). Welch had gone to police to say he\u2019d seen the girls being forced into a car by a middle-aged man in a suit but failed a polygraph. The investigator noted that a mugshot of Welch from 1977 resembled the police sketch of a suspect at the mall. The Last Stone focuses on the extended interrogation sessions with detectives in which Welch fabricates and lies but ultimately confesses. Gripping, and a tribute to the tenacity of the detectives who really did turn every last stone. 10. The Cold Vanish: Seeking the Missing in North America\u2019s Wildlands by Jon Billman Early one spring morning, Jacob Gray stepped off his bike in the northern district of Olympic National Park in Washington state. It is not clear why. Four arrows are found stuck in the ground between his bike and the road. The details become ciphers, like secret communications from the missing. The Cold Vanish focuses not so much on those who have disappeared in the North American wilderness but those who go looking for them. \u2022 Tell Me What I Am by Una Mannion is published by Faber.

The idea of adding crab to rarebit has been around since at least the 1930s, when it was described as an American creation, but the dish has had a resurgence in recent years as chefs look for new ways with old favourites (see also truffle macaroni cheese and panko-clad fish finger sandwiches). Happily, it\u2019s as easy as you might imagine to recreate at home \u2013 \u201cso quick and simple that I often whip it up after work to eat in front of the telly\u201d, as chef Bryn Williams explains \u2013 and a gratifying way to make an often pricey seasonal ingredient go a little bit further. The crab Rarely is the contrast between white and brown meat so pronounced as in the brown crab, where the sweet, pearlescent flakes are so completely at odds with the richly savoury, brick-coloured paste underneath that they could come from two completely different creatures. Both have their merits \u2013 the brown meat (which is generally much cheaper, should you be buying it separately) gives the cheese a run for its money in the flavour stakes, while the white provides that distinctively crab-like mouthfeel. You could use one or the other, as Jane Lovett does in her new book Deliciously Simple (white alone makes for a lighter result), but I think you need both for perfection. The version from Cornwall\u2019s The Hidden Hut, whose chef Simon Stallard published a book of his recipes a few years ago, spreads the brown meat on the toast like pat\u00e9 and folds the white meat into the topping. Williams, Salcombe\u2019s Crab Shed and food writers Tamasin Day-Lewis and Sue Lawrence all use both in the topping, while chef Galton Blackiston includes just the brown meat, sprinkling the white on top as a garnish at the end. It\u2019s hard to go wrong here; keeping the brown meat separate, as in Stallard\u2019s version, means you get a burst of pure, unadulterated crab with every bite, but the stuff combines so well with the cheese that I\u2019m going to incorporate it into the topping, too, along with most of the white meat for texture. The rest will go on top, so it doesn\u2019t get lost amid more aggressive flavours. Williams uses a 50:50 ratio of white and brown meat, Stallard four times as much white as brown, and the others (if they specify amounts, that is) somewhere in between. I like mine with a slight bias towards the more delicate white meat, but with enough brown for it to be obvious; you may wish to tweak to suit your own tastes, or what you have available. The cheese Fairly simple, because almost everyone uses cheddar (if you want to nod to the Welsh origins of the rarebit, I\u2019d recommend going for a Welsh variety rather than Caerphilly, whose lactic tang is a bit too restrained for this dish), though Day-Lewis and Blackiston both suggest gruyere, whose sweet, nutty flavour, to my mind, pairs beautifully with similar notes in the seafood. Just about any hard cheese will work, though. Day-Lewis finishes her \u201ccheesy crabby toasts\u201d with a grating of parmesan, which I\u2019m going to eschew, because I don\u2019t want to smother the white meat. If you\u2019re not a fan of crab and cheese together, but you\u2019ve read this far all the same, you\u2019ll be relieved to know that Williams\u2019 recipe doesn\u2019t feature cheese at all; you can find it in his book Bryn\u2019s Kitchen. The sauce The recipes I try are fairly evenly split between those that make a white sauce base for the dish (Stallard, Blackiston and Crab Shed), and those that rely on the crab alone, enriched with egg yolk (Lawrence and Williams) or butter (Day-Lewis in her book All You Can Eat). The first approach produces a more comforting, creamy result, and has the virtue of allowing the cook to add other ingredients to suit their own tastes, replacing some of the usual milk with ale (Blackiston) or cider and double cream (Crab Shed, and particularly good with gruyere). The second yields a punchier, more intense, crustacean flavour that I\u2019m drawn to (after all, if you\u2019re going to pay for a crab, you may as well let it take centre stage). I\u2019ve included an egg yolk as a binder to give the topping a smoother consistency, though if you leave it out, the flavour won\u2019t suffer. (Interestingly, Lovett uses mayonnaise and double cream which also works very well, yielding a slightly milder flavour that\u2019s perfect with white meat alone, but without the extra washing-up a white sauce creates.) Flavour enhancers The classic rarebit seasonings of Worcestershire sauce and chilli, whether in the form of Tabasco or a pinch of cayenne pepper, are justly popular here, too, the former combining particularly happily with the sweetness of the crab. Mustard is a common addition, dijon for Lawrence, Lovett and Day-Lewis, English for Stallard and Blackiston, wholegrain for Crab Shed. I\u2019m going to use the sweetly fiery English mustard powder I favour for ordinary cheese on toast, not least because it also helpfully acts as a binding starch. I also love Lovett\u2019s spring onions, which cut through the richness of the crab and cheese to add a note of freshness to proceedings. You can stop there, or make it even fancier with a slug of booze \u2013 Day-Lewis\u2019s \u201clittle toasts\u201d are, one suspects, intended to be consumed with drinks such as the dry, nutty sherry they contain, while Lawrence, who credits the recipe in A Taste of Scotland\u2019s Islands to Ron Goudie of Islay, includes local whisky. As she says, \u201ceven though there only is a tiny amount of Islay whisky in this dish, the smoky peat flavour sings through the fabulous concoction\u201d, bringing out the crab\u2019s salty-sweet, maritime notes. Any herbs are, I think, largely there for the dash of colour they contribute, rather than their flavour; given the cheese element here, I\u2019ve gone for Stallard\u2019s chives, but Day-Lewis\u2019s anise-heavy chervil might well work better with crab alone and would be especially nice with Williams\u2019 lemon zest. The bread No surprise that, as with the cheese, you should use whatever bread you generally choose for cheese on toast, though, like Stallard, I\u2019d advise something sturdy such as sourdough for reasons of structural integrity. Lawrence\u2019s dense, cakey soda loaf, which toasts brilliantly, is also worthy of consideration, and, though I\u2019m sceptical of Crab Shed\u2019s rye bread, I really enjoy the sour flavour and incredible crispness that the 100% rye sort delivers, which more than stands up to the cheese and crab, rather than being a mere vehicle for the topping. (I suspect a crumpet to be a fine idea, but I can never get past the fact that they\u2019re so good just as they are with vast amounts of butter that anything else feels like gilding the lily.) Whatever you go for, I would recommend toasting it lightly first, to crisp both sides, before adding the topping (spread it right to the edges to avoid burning the crusts) and grilling until golden and bubbling. Toasting just one side will, obviously, bring a softer, fluffier element to the dish, which you may prefer, but which will be dangerous if you plan to serve this as finger food. No one wants hot crab down their front. Perfect crab rarebit Prep 5 min Cook 10 min Serves 2 2 tsp English mustard powder 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce A few shakes of Tabasco, or a pinch of cayenne pepper or paprika 1 egg yolk 50g gruyere, or cheddar, grated 1 spring onion, sliced (optional) 30g brown crab meat 45g white crab meat Black pepper 2 slices of bread \u2013 I favour rye, soda bread or sourdough A few chives, finely chopped (optional) Mix the mustard powder, Worcestershire sauce and Tabasco to a paste, then add the egg yolk, cheese, spring onion if using, brown crab meat and 20g of the white meat. Stir and season with black pepper. Heat the grill to medium, toast the bread until lightly crisp, then turn over and repeat. Turn up the heat. Divide the topping between the slices of toast, spreading it right to the edges to prevent the crusts burning, then return to the grill for three or four minutes, until golden and bubbling. Top with the remaining white crab meat and chopped chives, if using, and serve hot. Crab rarebit \u2013 does the idea of seafood and cheese make you throw your hands up in horror, or does it seem a marriage made in heaven? And what else do you like to do with crab while it\u2019s in season? (A large slab of cold, unsalted butter and a stack of soft brown bread are my favourite accompaniments.)

Neil Forsyth brought the trilogy to an end in a superb way. There are great performances by Mark Bonnar, Jamie Sives and Emun Elliot as the main characters Max, Jake and Kenny. Their gallows humour ensures there are a lot of laughs in this \u201cthriller\u201d and when you take into account the superb soundtrack, it is top quality viewing. It\u2019s been a good year for Forsyth, as The Gold was also an excellent watch. Colin Armstrong, 50, Falkirk Colin from Accounts (BBC Two) In dire need of cheering-up but with a rather niche sense of humour, I badgered friends for laugh-along telly. I should have listened when Colin from Accounts kept coming up, but assumed it was like The Office, which doesn\u2019t float my boat, and ignored them. What a fool I felt when I gave it a whirl: it\u2019s funny, smart, feelgood TV featuring so many well-drawn, relatable characters with great chemistry and wit. Demelza, Wiltshire I Think You Should Leave With Tim Robinson (Netflix) My favourite TV of 2023 so far is the long-awaited season three of I Think You Should Leave With Tim Robinson. The six episodes are short, but so packed full of belly laughs. It\u2019s easily the funniest show out there. Robinson is such a keen observer of human nature, that though many of the sketches are patently absurd, we can all recognise ourselves in these situations. This is probably why it has a fantastic online community of fans. It\u2019s a show I keep coming back to time and time again. Mark Hawksley, 44, Wisconsin, US Happy Valley, series three (BBC One) It has to be Happy Valley. I had not watched previous series \u2013 just didn\u2019t fancy it \u2013 but I was hooked by the trailers for the new one. I watched series one and two before three started, and wow! I became completely absorbed by this fantastic programme all about family, loyalty, human kindness, frailty, vileness, deprivation, the effects of drugs and the benefits of community policing \u2013 all portrayed honestly and with humour. Congratulations to Sarah Lancashire and the whole cast, as well as to Sally Wainwright. Barbara, 69, Stockport Shape Island (Apple TV+) Shape Island, AppleTV+\u2019s adaptation of the Shape series of books by Mac Barnett and Jon Klassen, has been a family favourite this year with many repeat viewings. It\u2019s full of beautifully crafted stop-motion, pitch-perfect voice acting and stories as weird and profound as you could ever hope. It\u2019s always a marker of quality when lines of dialogue are lifted out and slotted into your everyday discourse. It\u2019s Triangle Day! Chris Smith, 43, Finland Succession, season four (Sky Atlantic and Now) Succession is the best TV of the year, without a doubt. It\u2019s the only show since the Sopranos where you sometimes sympathise with loathsome characters. You also have to work hard to keep up with the machiavellian strategising. The main appeal is the writing: the dialogue is mordant, funny and incredibly imaginative. There wasn\u2019t a single episode where anything felt wasted or baggy. Every scene was rich in meaning. The show is already legendary. Anne Guest, Cumbria The Big Door Prize (Apple TV+) I read the Guardian article about The Big Door Prize and then didn\u2019t miss a single show. It is better than the novel, which I\u2019ve read too. I like how all the characters are so complex and credible, and I find the story timely and fascinating. Susanne, 57, Nuremberg, Germany Blue Lights (BBC One) Blue Lights is a great ensemble drama where each character is finely developed. It has just the right number of twists and turns to keep you watching without stretching credulity \u2013 and it has genuinely moving moments. Martin, 55, Bristol The Last of Us (Sky Atlantic and Now) The Last of Us was a refreshing spin on the post-apocalyptic genre. It was also a faithful adaptation; I\u2019ve played both of the original games on PS4. There has been a glut of post-apocalyptic shows since the pandemic, but this series stood out because of its unusual focus on love and survival \u2013 rather than a shoot \u2018em up. The now-iconic third episode had some fantastic performances, as indeed did the show as a whole. Michael Hogg, 60, Edinburgh Ted Lasso, season three (Apple TV+) It\u2019s better to go out on top than flog a dead horse for diminishing ratings returns. I can\u2019t think of a TV show that\u2019s been so affecting for me, and I was delighted that they stuck the landing and walked away. I loved how they chose not to portray key moments on-screen, and brought us in afterward. The combination of using heightened characters to portray real emotional situations is something I can\u2019t remember ever seeing on telly before. Paddy, 55, Piha, New Zealand Race Across the World, season three (BBC One) Race Across the World is an amazing blend of travel show, reality show, drama and competition. Its third season was the best yet, and the best show I\u2019ve watched so far this year.

A 31-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder. Counter-terrorism police were helping officers with their investigation but Nottinghamshire police insisted they were keeping an \u201copen mind\u201d about the motive. The two students at Nottingham University were found unresponsive on Ilkeston Road, north-west of the city\u2019s centre, at 4am on Tuesday. One of them was named locally as Barnaby Webber. Detectives believe the suspect then stole a white van, whose driver was later found stabbed to death on Magdala Road, two miles from where the teenagers were found. The van was then driven into people standing at a bus stop near Nottingham\u2019s Theatre Royal at approximately 5.30am, leaving one man in critical condition and two others suffering minor injuries, police said. Officers said they were not looking for anyone else in connection with the attacks and, during the hours afterwards, armed police staged a series of raids across the east Midlands city. The second student was named in media reports as Grace Kumar, a hockey player with England U18s. Nottingham University said the two teenagers were its students: \u201cIt is with great sadness that we confirm the sudden and unexpected death of two of our students following a major incident in Nottingham city centre overnight.\u201d The Student Union\u2019s graduation ball \u2013 due to take place on Tuesday evening \u2013 was abandoned. Counter-terrorism police are assisting the investigation as detectives tried to understand what triggered the horrifying events, but with Nottinghamshire police still leading the investigation. Police are trying to locate any phones or computers the suspect used in the hope they can shed some light on what happened. A man who did not give his name told the BBC he had witnessed the two students being attacked with a knife on Ilkeston Road, at about 4am. He reported hearing screams and saw a man \u201cdressed all in black with a hood and rucksack grappling with some people\u201d. He told the broadcaster: \u201cShe was screaming: \u2018Help!\u2019 I just wish I\u2019d shouted something out of the window to unnerve the assailant. I saw him stab the lad first and then the woman. The lad collapsed in the middle of the road. \u201cThe girl stumbled towards a house and didn\u2019t move. The next minute she had disappeared down the side of a house, and that\u2019s where they found her. I\u2019d say it all happened within five or six minutes.\u201d David Mellen, leader of the local council, told BBC Radio Nottingham that those struck by the van were \u201cwaiting at a bus stop early in the morning\u201d. Around one mile from the scene of collision, a white van was later visible with dents to the bonnet and damage to its window, and under police guard. Lynn Haggitt, a witness, told Channel 4 News she saw a van hitting two people in Nottingham. \u201cAt half past five I saw a van pull up at the side of me,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was white, all white. There was a police car behind it coming up slowly, no flashing lights. The man in the driver\u2019s seat looked in his mirror and saw the police car behind him.\u201d She said the white van then drove up to \u201cthe corner of the street and went into two people\u201d. \u201cThe lady ended up on the kerb, and then he backed up the white van and speeded up Parliament Street with the police cars following him,\u201d she added. Petra Gyuricska and her husband, Miklos Toldi, said they were among the first to discover the body of the man on Magdala Road at 5.30am. They were headed to Gyuricska\u2019s workplace when they saw the man lying on his side outside Magdala tennis club. She said: \u201cI was just leaving for work \u2026 my husband gave me a lift, and then we were leaving and we saw the body lying \u2026 on the floor, and then we saw the blood and I just told my husband to stop. I tried to call 999 but I couldn\u2019t get connection. Someone else came as well \u2013 [in] another car \u2013 and he called.\u201d Gyuricska said she believed the man was dead by the time they found him. She said: \u201cWe stayed \u2026 first a police car came, and then another two police cars came, and then an ambulance came. The police, they started CPR but it was too late. I mean, you could just see.\u201d Police say the van was stopped on Maples Street where a man was Tasered and arrested by officers on suspicion of murder. Dimitrious Lawani, a witness to the arrest, said two officers were pulling a man with Tasers pointed at him, and said he heard shouts of: \u201cGet down, get out, stop fighting.\u201d Nottinghamshire\u2019s chief constable, Kate Meynell, said the attacks were \u201cshocking and tragic\u201d and said the city centre was safe to visit: \u201cWe are still in the early stages of the investigation and need to determine the motives behind these attacks. \u201cWe are keeping an \u2018open mind\u2019 and are working alongside Counter Terrorism Policing to establish the facts.\u201d Bishops Hull cricket club paid tribute to Webber, describing him as a \u201cdear friend\u201d who was a \u201ckey part\u201d of the club. Rishi Sunak, the prime minister, said: \u201cI am being kept updated on developments. The police must be given the time to undertake their work. My thoughts are with those injured, and the family and loved ones of those who have lost their lives.\u201d Nottingham\u2019s three Labour MPs, Nadia Whittome, Lilian Greenwood and Alex Norris, said they were \u201cshaken\u201d by the events in the city. French president Emmanuel Macron said his country \u201cshares the grief\u201d with Britain and \u201cstands by their side\u201d.

Some choked, drowning in their own body fluids, while others died in the stampedes through narrow alleyways as residents panicked and fled from the creeping white cloud of gas. Years later, the deaths continue with survivors dying from cancer. Testing of groundwater and well-water near the site of the plant reveals mercury levels up to 6m times greater than what is considered safe by the US Environmental Protection Agency. \u201cThe lucky ones are those who died on that night,\u201d said Rashida Bi, a survivor who has seen five members of her family die from a variety of cancers over the past three decades. Climate check: a \u2018death sentence\u2019 for the world\u2019s poor Greta Thunberg warned yesterday that by not phasing out fossil fuels, wealthy countries were signing a \u201cdeath sentence\u201d for millions of poor people around the world. \u201cThe coming months and years \u2013 right now \u2013 will be crucial to what the future looks like. It is what we decide now that will define the rest of humanity\u2019s future,\u201d she told a press conference at UN talks in Bonn, where governments are meeting to discuss the climate crisis.

Am I even capable of getting excited about video game announcements any more? Isn\u2019t this just an endless series of adverts? Of course, the E3 press conferences of yore were ultimately adverts, too, but they were at least adverts for video games, without commercials for delivery apps or fast food shoehorned in. And if a game was shown during a Nintendo, Xbox or PlayStation presentation, it was because they thought it might encourage people to buy their console, not because the developer paid a fee to have their trailer held up in front of monetisable eyeballs. That\u2019s how most of these showcases and livestreams work now: pay your money, get your slot. The organisers of Gamescom\u2019s Opening Night Live, being German, published the rates for these appearances \u2013 they start at \u20ac85,000 for a 30-second spot. This probably works better for developers, who paid far more for actual booths at events like E3, and for the people organising the livestreams, who can coin it in. But for us? Boooooring. But then! For a couple of hours on Sunday, Xbox showed up and finally brought a little gravitas to proceedings. It was well-curated \u2013 27 games, rather than 40 \u2013 and encouragingly diverse, rather than US-centric. There were all-new games from the studios that Microsoft has acquired in the last few years: the RPG specialists at Obsidian are making their own fantasy RPG to fill the gap that Elder Scrolls has left in the 12 years since Skyrim; inXile\u2019s Clockwork Revolution gave such strong Bioshock Infinite vibes that it was almost plagiarism. Older games showed interesting developments, such as Rare\u2019s long-running Sea of Thieves getting a Monkey Island crossover. Playground Games\u2019 new Fable wasn\u2019t shown at length, but a new trailer gave us the gift of giant Richard Ayoade. There was a new JRPG from some of Persona\u2019s original creators, named, with the eccentricity typical of that series, Metaphor: ReFantazio. And naturally there were some critic-pleasing independent games: Jusant, a climbing puzzle game with echoes of Ico, and Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, the only trailer the whole week that made me laugh. Finally, we got more than 40 minutes of Starfield, Bethesda\u2019s decades-in-the-making space exploration game (pictured below), which looks just superb. This is the kind of lineup that Xbox has been sorely lacking for years. And the kind that PlayStation might rightly be envious of. Sony has had an extremely strong start to the current generation of consoles. Since the PlayStation 5 was released in 2020, it has been home to several proper five-star classics, from God of War to Ratchet and Clank to Returnal, alongside plenty of other big-budget games to make you feel good about spending so much on a space-age piece of hi-tech plastic to sit under your TV. Microsoft, meanwhile, brought out a Halo game that bore obvious scars of a troubled development, its Forza racing series, and Flight Simulator, which is nowhere near as sexy a lineup. Xbox has mostly made headlines in the past few years for throwing stunningly huge amounts of money at other games companies, rather than for any hit games. But games take a long time to make, and Xbox was coming into this generation at a disadvantage after the Xbox One failed to compete with the PlayStation 4 on any level. Now we\u2019re seeing the fruits of years\u2019 worth of efforts from Xbox\u2019s leadership and its studios to fix things, and make its subscription service \u2013 Game Pass \u2013 look irresistible. They\u2019ve done a very good job at this, and there\u2019s a clear vision for the creative future of games as well as their future as a business. When I interviewed Xbox\u2019s head of developer relations Sarah Bond recently, she made the case for diversifying the games that Xbox publishes as \u201can opportunity and an imperative \u2026 The full [diversity] of the world is not represented by the creators in gaming today. Therefore the stories don\u2019t fully represent the cultures and the peoples in gaming today \u2026 Consistent and unwavering support for smaller developers is core to the health of our industry, and it\u2019s core to ensuring that new creative things can thrive and have an audience.\u201d Sony has understood this for a long time. Having two of gaming\u2019s most powerful platform-holders forging ahead with this attitude is great news for those of us who want interesting things to play in the next five years, rather than endless unimaginative live-service games that are all working from the same set of tried-and-tested profitable design principles and look almost identical. I\u2019ve made no secret in this newsletter of my opinion on Microsoft\u2019s attempted Activision merger \u2013 I believe that companies attempting to buy market dominance is rarely good for a creative industry. Corporatism and creativity are natural enemies. But companies with money that don\u2019t overstep, and that have a genuine stake in the games industry and what it means beyond financial rewards, can also help developers to make the things they dream of. After watching that showcase on Sunday, it really doesn\u2019t look to me that Microsoft needs Activision, at least not for Xbox (naturally mobile-game makers King and PC gaming stalwarts Blizzard, which are also under the Activision umbrella, would give Microsoft a solid foothold in different markets). It has spent a lot of money, nurtured a lot of studios and partnerships, and become a publisher with an extremely strong lineup that shows players why they should be excited about its games. This will translate to success, with or without Call of Duty on Game Pass. As PlayStation enters its little fallow period after releasing a series of huge games in a row in the PS5\u2019s early years, it should keep an eye on the competition. What to play I\u2019ve been looking forward to Dordogne, a nostalgic, pretty-looking narrative game about spending childhood summers in France. You play as Mimi, a young adult who has a troubled relationship with her dad, a recently deceased grandmother, and an inability to remember much of her childhood. Returning to Dordogne to clear out your grandma\u2019s house, you pick up and play around with her possessions, some of which catapult you backwards in time to your lost summers. I\u2019m playing it in French, because I\u2019m that guy, though it\u2019s a shame the voice-acting is only in American English. It\u2019s a little clunky, but I always enjoy a game with a sense of place. Available on: PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4/5, Xbox Series/One Estimated playtime: 4 hours What to read For its 40th anniversary, Capcom has made this cute little browser-based town (pictured above) full of tributes to all of its series and characters. Well worth a lunch-hour explore. Embracer Group, which bought up Tomb Raider and look lots of investment money from the Saudi government, has announced that it has overreached, having failed to close another $2bn deal. It will now be \u201crestructuring\u201d the studios and projects it has spent the past couple of years buying up. My thoughts are with the devs who will be affected by this, many of whom are operating at the whim of a parent company\u2019s parent company. While we\u2019re talking browser fun, try doing a Google search for \u201ckatamari\u201d or \u201cSplatoon\u201d and see what happens. Not so fast \u2026 a US judge has blocked Microsoft\u2019s Activision Blizzard takeover until further hearings can be held. As mentioned in my letter, you\u2019ll recall what I think about it. There\u2019s been a lot of news and game announcements this week, but none of it has been particularly exciting by itself. Keep an eye out at the end of the week though, as our games correspondent Keith Stuart and I will be rounding up the most interesting games from Summer Game Fest.

Here\u2019s one to inspire you from Emily: What is your best obscure video game fact? Here\u2019s one that always blows my mind anew whenever I\u2019m reminded of it: the PlayStation started life as a Nintendo console. Sony and Nintendo used to work together in the 1980s and early 90s; Sony made the SNES\u2019s sound chip, and the two companies were collaborating on a CD-Rom add-on for the Super Nintendo. In 1991, a prototype of this product was shown at the Consumer Electronics Show \u2013 and one day later, Nintendo screwed Sony over on it, breaking their contract to partner with Philips instead. Sony\u2019s then-president Norio Ohga was sufficiently mad about this to green-light development of the SNES-CD into a rival console: the PlayStation. As a result, Nintendo got the Philips CD-i, home to some of the worst games of all time, and Sony got a 100m-selling console that would change gaming\u2019s future. In 2015, one of these prototype SNES-PlayStation consoles was discovered in someone\u2019s dad\u2019s attic; seeing that Sony PlayStation branding on a yellowing SNES controller does something very weird to my brain."}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e70165", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jun/14/ai-discrimination-is-a-bigger-risk-than-human-extinction-eu-chief", "primaryCategory": "technology", "subCategories": [], "title": "Discrimination is a bigger AI risk than human extinction \u2013 EU commissioner", "lead": "Commissioner says existential threat unlikely, but \u2018guardrails\u2019 needed for decisions affecting livelihoods", "author": "Dan Milmo and Alex Hern", "datePublished": "2023-06-14T10:19:21Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.294523", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/ed7d6122dae2ae5743e39dcebd623cd20d0a633a/0_595_5315_3189/500.jpg", "body": "Discrimination is a bigger threat posed by artificial intelligence than possible extinction of the human race, according to the EU\u2019s competition commissioner. Margrethe Vestager said although the existential risk from advances in AI may be a concern, it was unlikely, whereas discrimination from the technology was a real problem. She told the BBC \u201cguardrails\u201d were needed for AI, including for situations where it was being used for decisions that could affect livelihoods, such as mortgage applications or access to social services. \u201cProbably [the risk of extinction] may exist, but I think the likelihood is quite small. I think the AI risks are more that people will be discriminated [against], they will not be seen as who they are,\u201d she said. \u201cIf it\u2019s a bank using it to decide whether I can get a mortgage or not, or if it\u2019s social services on your municipality, then you want to make sure that you\u2019re not being discriminated [against] because of your gender or your colour or your postal code.\u201d In the UK, the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office is investigating whether AI systems are showing racial bias when dealing with job applications. Regulators are concerned that AI tools will could produce outcomes that disadvantage certain groups if they are not represented accurately or fairly in the datasets that they are trained and tested on. Vestager\u2019s concerns echo some tech experts who argue that fears over existential-level risk related to AI are overshadowing more immediate risks such as AI-powered disinformation. The competition chief said calls for a moratorium on AI development, supported by Elon Musk and other senior figures, was unenforceable. AI regulation needed to be \u201cglobal affair\u201d, Vestager said, but she warned that a UN-style approach would be difficult to implement. Rishi Sunak, the UK prime minister, has convened a global AI safety summit for \u201clike-minded countries\u201d this autumn and tech executives such as the Google chief executive, Sundar Pichai, and Elon Musk have called for global frameworks to regulate the technology. \u201cLet\u2019s start working on a UN approach. But we shouldn\u2019t hold our breath,\u201d Vestager said. \u201cWe should do what we can here and now.\u201d The EU is working on legislation to oversee development and implementation of AI systems, which groups AI technology into four risk groups: unacceptable risk; high risk; limited risk; and minimal risk. AI systems overseeing credit scores and essential public services come into the high-risk category, meaning \u201cclear requirements\u201d will be set for those systems. Vestager\u2019s interjection came as the Irish Data Protection Commission blocked Google from launching its Bard chatbot in the EU over privacy concerns. The DPC, which is the chief European regulator for the California company, said it had not received sufficient information about how the tools would comply with the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation. Google had intended to launch Bard in Europe this week, months after the chatbot\u2019s global release. Now, the regulator says, that will not happen. The DPC \u201chad not had any detailed briefing nor sight of a data protection impact assessment or any supporting documentation at this point\u201d, the deputy commissioner Graham Doyle told Politico in an interview. A similar conflict happened in April, when the Italian regulator ordered the ChatGPT developer, OpenAI, to pause operations in the country over data protection concerns. The Italian data protection authority said that there appeared to be \u201cno legal basis underpinning the massive collection and processing of personal data in order to \u2018train\u2019 the algorithms on which the platform relies\u201d. OpenAI was eventually able to convince the regulator that it was in compliance and relaunched services with limited changes."}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e70166", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/14/real-madrid-confirm-signing-of-jude-bellingham-from-borussia-dortmund", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": [], "title": "Real Madrid complete signing of Jude Bellingham from Borussia Dortmund", "lead": "Real Madrid have announced the signing of the England midfielder Jude Bellingham from Borussia Dortmund on a six-year contract", "author": "David Tindall", "datePublished": "2023-06-14T10:16:08Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.294528", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/6b108bb44774c03a7e7355b3fbc80b20e5583af1/0_106_4925_2956/500.jpg", "body": "Real Madrid have completed the signing of Jude Bellingham from Borussia Dortmund. The England midfielder has agreed a six-year contract at the Bernab\u00e9u. Dortmund confirmed in a statement last week that Madrid had agreed to pay an initial \u20ac103m (\u00a388.5m) for the 19-year-old. Real confirmed on Wednesday morning that the deal was complete. \u201cReal Madrid and Borussia Dortmund have agreed on the transfer of the player Jude Bellingham, who will remain linked to our club for the next six seasons,\u201d said a statement from the 14-times European champions. \u201cTomorrow, Thursday, 15 June, at 12pm at Real Madrid City, the presentation ceremony for Jude Bellingham as a new Real Madrid player will take place. After, Jude Bellingham will appear before the media.\u201d Dortmund revealed that the transfer fee consisted of a \u201chigh fixed sum\u201d and \u201cperformance-related variables\u201d spread over a period of six years. \u201cWe thank Jude for three passion-filled years at Borussia Dortmund. It was a fantastic time together,\u201d said their chief executive, Hans-Joachim Watzke. \u201cOur thanks also go to Real Madrid for the always fair and constructive discussions.\u201d The sporting director Sebastian Kehl added: \u201cJude developed very positively with us at a young age. He has decided that he now wants to make the move to Real Madrid. We thank Jude for everything he gave us and our play, and we wish him all the best for the future.\u201d Bellingham, who made 132 appearances for Dortmund after moving from Birmingham City in 2020 shortly after his 17th birthday, told the German club\u2019s official website: \u201cThank you everyone associated with BVB and the fans for everything over the last three years. It was an honour to wear your jersey so many times whether it was in the high or low moments. Whilst I\u2019m happy about my next destination I will never forget the journey I went on to get there. Einmal Borusse, immer Borusse. Best of luck for the future. Heja BVB!\u201d During his time with Dortmund, Bellingham scored 24 goals and provided 25 assists, and was recently named the Bundesliga\u2019s player of the season. They missed out on the title in agonising fashion on the final day of the campaign, with Bellingham having to watch from the sidelines due to a knee injury. That injury will also cause him to miss England\u2019s upcoming Euro 2024 qualifiers against Malta and North Macedonia. The teenager\u2019s stock had risen during the recent World Cup, when he scored his first England goal in their group stage win over Iran. Bellingham also shared a passionate celebration with Jordan Henderson after setting up the Liverpool captain\u2019s goal in the last-16 victory over Senegal. That fuelled speculation that he was heading to Anfield, but Liverpool revealed in April that they would not pursue a move for the midfielder and focus their transfer funds on an overhaul of the squad. Liverpool missed out on Champions League qualification, a tournament Bellingham said he saw as \u201cthe biggest stage\u201d. \u201cThe goal has always been winning,\u201d he said last month. \u201cWhen you ask me what my biggest ambitions are in the game, it\u2019s to win everything. And I\u2019m not afraid to say that. Everyone should have that goal I feel like as professional footballers.\u201d Bellingham becomes just the seventh British player to sign for Real Madrid after Laurie Cunningham, Steve McManaman, David Beckham, Michael Owen, Jonathan Woodgate and Gareth Bale. Meanwhile, Bellingham\u2019s 17-year-old younger brother, Jobe, an attacking midfielder, is close to switching clubs this summer. The England Under-18 international is set to join Sunderland from Championship rivals Birmingham, for whom he made 22 appearances last season. Like his brother, Jobe made his Birmingham debut aged 16. Sunderland\u2019s sporting director, Kristjaan Speakman, and academy coaches, Mike Dodds and Stuart England, were influential in the Bellingham brothers\u2019 development at Birmingham."}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e70167", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/14/pyrex-and-instant-pot-maker-files-for-bankruptcy-protection-in-us", "primaryCategory": "business", "subCategories": [], "title": "Pyrex and Instant Pot maker files for bankruptcy protection in US", "lead": "Instant Brands, which blames rising interest rates for financial problems, will continue to serve retailers", "author": "Jasper Jolly", "datePublished": "2023-06-14T10:06:06Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.294533", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/40279ff29850ca72b2595a6fc4c9e5cb40215525/13_5_2993_1797/500.jpg", "body": "The maker of Pyrex kitchenware and the Instant Pot pressure cooker has filed for bankruptcy protection, blaming rising interest rates for its financial difficulties. Instant Brands, controlled by the private equity investor Cornell Capital, said late on Tuesday it had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the Southern District of Texas, as it tries to restructure liabilities of as much as $1bn (\u00a3790m). The company said it would continue to serve retailers \u201cwithout interruption\u201d and continue to pay its 2,400 employees while seeking to shore up its finances and prevent the sale of some of the best-known brands in kitchenware. Instant Brands says its products are in approximately 90% of homes in the US, as well as in other countries. However, despite that reach, rapidly rising interest rates across the world have exposed the vulnerabilities of many businesses with large debt loads. Instant is not the only US kitchenware company to struggle in recent months. Tupperware, whose plastic containers are similarly common in kitchens around the world, warned in April it would go bust without new funds. The history of Pyrex dates to 1915, when the wife of an engineer at the Corning glassware company asked her husband to try out tougher borosilicate glass for cooking meals, according to the company\u2019s website. The glass expanded less when heated or cooled, making it much less likely to shatter when heated or cooled rapidly. The Pyrex brand was later used for dishes and jugs using other types of temperature-resistant glass. The rise of the Instant Pot was a more recent phenomenon driven by social media, after it was invented in 2010 by a Canadian telecoms engineer who was reportedly made redundant during the financial crisis. Sales of the device grew rapidly. Self-described \u201cpotheads\u201d shared recipes online that boosted the pressure cooker\u2019s popularity to the point that Slate magazine in 2017 described the Instant Pot as \u201can entire economy and a religion\u201d and a \u201ccult\u201d. Ben Gadbois, Instant Brands\u2019 chief executive, said the business had been working with investors to \u201cposition the company for its next phase of success\u201d despite falling into bankruptcy. He blamed higher borrowing costs for its financial problems. \u201cAfter successfully navigating the Covid-19 pandemic and the global supply chain crisis, we continue to face additional global macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges that have affected our business. In particular, tightening of credit terms and higher interest rates impacted our liquidity levels and made our capital structure unsustainable.\u201d Under the US Chapter 11 bankruptcy process, companies can stay in business while agreeing new terms with lenders who would probably lose out if it went bust. The company said it had received a commitment for $133m in financing from its existing lenders to see it through the bankruptcy process. The company said the move \u201cprovides us time and flexibility to continue ongoing discussions with our sponsor, lenders and other financial stakeholders\u201d."}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e70168", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/14/ashes-england-australia-cricket-the-spin", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": [], "title": "The Spin | Test cricket\u2019s bigger picture means there is more to Ashes than who wins", "lead": "There\u2019s an existential question hanging over this Ashes series.

This time last week they projected pictures of England\u2019s two captains, Ben Stokes and Heather Knight, on to Tower Bridge, 65m high. Bandit is teaching Bluey the meaning of cricket. The Met Office has forecast a heatwave. They\u2019ve had a million requests for tickets to the fifth Test at the Oval. Glenn McGrath is, of course, predicting it will be 5-0 to Australia. And the talk, everywhere, is about 2005, and that series. Stuart Broad has already mentioned it. So has Ben Stokes. And Ollie Pope. If you look with the right kind of eyes, you can see, underneath all the excitement, a certain anxious yearning for this to work. Everyone who cares about this format of the sport wants this series to be a spectacular, and for 2023 to become one of those runaway summers when the public is captivated by the Ashes. The truth is Test cricket needs it. Because the big picture, beyond all the questions about which bowlers England will pick and whether David Warner can still cut it, isn\u2019t pretty to look at. People have been worrying about the state of cricket almost as long as they have been playing it, but just because you\u2019re paranoid and all that. The game really is changing, and the only reason to disagree is that you haven\u2019t been paying attention. International cricket is scheduled in four-year blocks. The next one, between 2023 and 2027, includes 173 Test matches, which is actually 21 more than were played in the previous window, between 2019 and 2023. Look a little closer though, and you\u2019ll see that the large part of the increase is because Zimbabwe, Afghanistan and Ireland (the latter two are new playing nations) have all scheduled so many more games. Five of the nine older teams have cut back on the amount of Test cricket they\u2019ve arranged, and some, like South Africa, are committed to the bare minimum they can get away with. Outside of England, Australia, and India, almost no one is playing three, four, or five Test series any more. And fans in those three countries are going to get awfully familiar with each other. England play 43 games in these four years, and almost half of them are against Australia and India. In the four-year stretch ahead, the teams have an average of 14 Tests each scheduled. In the equivalent years of the 2010s the number was 17, in the 2000s it was 19, and in the 1990s it was 16. From here on out, there are only going to be fewer Tests, divided into shorter series, between players who have less exposure to, and experience of, and expertise in the format. Which means there will be fewer competitive teams, which will lead to waning interest in the game in some of the countries who have been playing it longest, like South Africa, West Indies, and New Zealand. The space opened up in the overflowing schedule will be filled with, yes, you guessed, more T20 cricket. It is, after all, where most of the money is made. Recent estimates suggest that the Board of Control for Cricket in India make as much from a single game of T20 as they do from all five days of a Test. Most of it, though, will be between franchise teams. Most of the leagues now have dedicated windows in the schedule; the Ashes, remember, has been squeezed into seven weeks of early summer to make sure that August is entirely free for the Hundred. There is already talk that the IPL teams are looking to sign players up to year-round contracts. Soon enough it won\u2019t be franchise competitions that are boxed off in particular bits of the calendar, but international cricket, and it won\u2019t be the franchise side who require permission to select the best players, but the national teams. Everything England are doing under Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum has to be understood as an attempt to fix this, something the administrators have singularly failed to do. When Stokes talks about trying to save Test cricket, he wants to make it more entertaining to watch, so it brings in an audience more used to T20, and more enjoyable to play, so it appeals to a generation of cricketers who have easier, and more lucrative, career paths available to them. His England have cut down on the amount of training required, and he encourages his team to play the very same sort of way they usually do, which is going to make it much easier to hop between the formats. Cricket is full of people who talk about how great the Test game is, but too few who actually act like it. If the version of it Stokes and McCullum have cooked up is a little different to what you\u2019re used to, if, in fact, you\u2019re going to rail about how reckless their batting is when they have an inevitable collapse, or wail about the sorry state of modern batting techniques when they fall in a heap, or grumble that Australia wouldn\u2019t have won that match if Stokes had only batted on a little longer before declaration, you need to remember there\u2019s an existential question hanging over these Ashes. What matters isn\u2019t just whether or not England can win, but how many people they can persuade to tune in and watch them.

Dame mit F\u00e4cher (Lady with Fan) is the last portrait Klimt completed. The work was standing on an easel in his studio when the Austrian painter died unexpectedly of a stroke and pneumonia in 1918 at the age of 55. It is one of the finest and most valuable works of art to be offered in Europe, said Sotheby\u2019s, which is selling the painting nearly 30 years after it was acquired by its present owners. \u201cDame mit F\u00e4cher is the last portrait Gustav Klimt completed before his untimely death, when he was still in his artistic prime and producing some of his most accomplished and experimental works,\u201d said Helena Newman, Sotheby\u2019s worldwide head of impressionist and modern art. \u201cMany of those works, certainly the portraits for which he is best known, were commissions. This, though, is something completely different \u2013 a technical tour de force, full of boundary-pushing experimentation, as well as a heartfelt ode to absolute beauty.\u201d The portrait is of an unnamed woman whose loose robe reveals a bared shoulder against a vivid background of flowers and birds. It reflects Klimt\u2019s fascination with Chinese and Japanese art and culture; he filled his home with Chinese ceramics and Japanese woodblock prints, and often dressed in silk kimonos or Chinese robes. The portrait is painted in a square format, sized roughly 1 sq metre, which Klimt reserved for his most avant-garde works. \u201cThe beauty and sensuality of the portrait lies in the detail: the flecks of blue and pink which enliven the sitter\u2019s skin, the feathery lines of her eyelashes and the pursed lips that give her face character,\u201d said Thomas Boyd-Bowman, head of impressionist and modern art evening sales at Sotheby\u2019s. \u201cKlimt here gave himself full freedom to capture on canvas a devastatingly beautiful woman. Her provocatively bared shoulder, poise and quiet self-assurance combine to stunning effect.\u201d Dame mit F\u00e4cher was acquired soon after Klimt\u2019s death by Erwin B\u00f6hler, a Viennese industrialist and close friend of the artist. It is one of only a small number of portraits by Klimt remaining in private hands. Klimt\u2019s landscape painting Birch Forest was sold last year for $104.6m (\u00a383m). His Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer II, from 1912, fetched $87.9m (\u00a370m) in 2008."}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e7016a", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/14/greatest-days-review-take-that-musical-offers-blast-of-feelgood-reunion-excitement", "primaryCategory": "film", "subCategories": [], "title": "Greatest Days review \u2013 Take That musical offers blast of feelgood reunion excitement", "lead": "Aisling Bea rounds up old school friends to watch the reunited boyband in Athens and, amid the laughs, confront what happened when they last saw them 25 years ago", "author": "Peter Bradshaw", "datePublished": "2023-06-14T10:00:01Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.294551", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/faa10f9b854bc2f4744bdb552fc1a4a8f30201fd/0_121_1922_1153/500.jpg", "body": "A jukebox musical featuring the works of Take That might not ever be one for the cool kids; undoubtedly this is a bit broad, but it\u2019s a splurge of feelgood from director Coky Giedroyc and screenwriter Tim Firth, adapting his own stage show, and it\u2019s at least as enjoyable as the much-hyped Mamma Mia! movies. Aisling Bea gives it loads as Rachel, a hardworking NHS nurse who in her teen years was a massive Take That stan (as no one used to say in 1993) along with her four best mates from school. She is astonished one day to be phoned up by the local radio station and told she\u2019s won a luxury all-inclusive deal for her and some guests to fly to Athens and see Take That on a reunion tour.

And she has to confront a painful memory connected to the last time they saw the band live in Manchester. There are laughs here: young Rachel turns on the TV in the 90s to see something on Ceefax about Britain\u2019s bright future in the EU, the girls talk about how Take That\u2019s \u201cbeach\u201d video for Pray looks weirdly like a version of Lord of the Flies, and they bunk off school to see their mate take part in a high-diving competition holding up a massive inspirational banner in the spectators\u2019 gallery, reading: \u201cDON\u2019T F*CK IT UP\u201d.

The unreliable narrator trope is in full force here. Kit lives with Crevan in a castle on an abandoned island. It\u2019s clear that they rely on one another for survival, and that they are sheltering from unrest in the wider world. The island is, fortunately, stocked with supplies, including food and clothes. There\u2019s also a vast cedar cupboard; Kit must never open Crevan\u2019s side, which contains a secret. Kit and Crevan have an intense, symbiotic relationship, which at times seems romantic, at others parental. A woman washes ashore, unconscious, puncturing their private existence. Crevan wants to save the woman; Kit sees her as a threat. Without spoiling anything, the course of action Kit settles on is startling. This first section of the novel is gripping and persuasive \u2013 genuinely unsettling. Slowly, the wider context becomes apparent. The world has been shaken by a human-made apocalypse. Bacteria have become resistant to antibiotics, leading to the evolution of \u201cplastiphages\u201d that consume artificial materials. \u201cI saw it happen once, you know, and see it still sometimes in my dreams: a bright red T-shirt running to ruin, the fabric suppurating and dissolving; withering before my eyes like a petal in a flame.\u201d Without plastic or antibiotics, the world has devolved into chaos. \u201cBackbiters\u201d, a form of post-apocalyptic doctor, roam the landscape. Both medicine and people have turned on themselves. The function of the backbiters in Whether Violent or Natural is ambiguous \u2013 are they a force for good or ill? We learn that Crevan was once captured and fitted with a \u201cpatch\u201d. \u201cImagine a square of something that\u2019s thin and clear and so flexible that it could be folded up without breaking, even rolled up \u2026 laid down on the inside of your arm.\u201d The patch contains \u201cmedicine to protect, to defend against the specific bacteria the backbiters are a-hunting\u201d. Thematically, Whether Violent or Natural draws on a wide range of references, from Shakespeare\u2019s The Tempest to Iain Banks\u2019s The Wasp Factory to Emily St John Mandel\u2019s Station Eleven. But for me it is the intimate aspects of the book that work best. Kit\u2019s complex psychology, her ambiguous love and sometimes seemingly sexual desire for Crevan are the most fascinating aspects. \u201cHe is nearly a head taller than me and has to crook his neck to speak directly into my ear, his lips barely only just brushing against the soft vellus hairs that fur the lobe. It\u2019s delicious. With every whispered syllable comes shivering delight.\u201d Kit ran naked on the island until Crevan\u2019s arrival. Only his embarrassment encourages her to put on clothes. Calder has created here a strange, toxic Eden \u2013 Crevan and Kit alternate between being parent and child to one another. As Kit says: \u201cIt\u2019s my turn now. I have to be daddy, I have to be mummy. I have to take care of baby. I croon forward, press my lips to Crevan\u2019s cheek, inhale the deep, sweat-musk odour of him.\u201d Kit\u2019s narrative voice is an odd combination, both naive and erudite; she rarely uses one metaphor when three will do. At times this is evocative, at others less so. In general the clarity and propulsion of the first half of the book is diluted in the second, and the pacing is uneven at times. Then a final act twist reframes everything we have read, including Kit and Crevan\u2019s relationship. The reveals are packed so tightly together that absorbing them is a challenge. Whether it all hangs together perfectly or not, I appreciated the scope and ambition of this unusual debut, and its undeniable strange power. \u2022 Whether Violent or Natural by Natasha Calder is published by Bloomsbury (\u00a316.99).

The American singer is reminiscing about her previous UK tour, and setting the scene for Sabrina 2.0, a pop star reborn. Last year\u2019s Emails I Can\u2019t Send is her fifth album, but you wouldn\u2019t know it from the setlist. After being cast in a Disney Channel series in 2013, Carpenter released four albums in five years. Tonight the 24-year-old plays 16 songs from Emails \u2013 her post-Disney debut \u2013 and scarcely touches her earlier material. Her new songs aren\u2019t a wild departure in style \u2013 Carpenter\u2019s pop remains an easy blend of R&amp;B, acoustic and country \u2013 but you get the sense that she feels far greater ownership over them. Fast Times, a stylish soft-rock track about running a relationship on fast-forward, is easily the highlight. Her four-piece touring band maximise its propulsive snare-drum snap, and as Carpenter spins under violet lights she lets out a shriek of joy that feels straight from the gut. Donning a feather-lined cowboy hat, she leans all the way into Dolly Parton kitsch on the stomping live version of Bad for Business (\u201cHe\u2019s good for my heart, but he\u2019s bad for business!\u201d) and pulls it off, charmingly tongue-in-cheek. Paris, a rare older song, also sounds completely revitalised: Carpenter and band transform it from a bland single into something sultry, freeing and muscular. But Carpenter\u2019s whispered, careful ballads don\u2019t yet meet her vision for them. Using Taylor Swift\u2019s beloved All Too Well as a pre-show crowd-warmer is a bold gambit, and Carpenter\u2019s similarly hyper-specific heartbreak songs are clunky in comparison: \u201cYou used a fork once / turns out forks are fucking everywhere.\u201d After gossip around Carpenter\u2019s love life threatened to eclipse her (it was dramatised in Olivia Rodrigo\u2019s song Drivers License), it\u2019s clear why Swift\u2019s method of using intricate lyrics to reframe a media narrative would feel tempting. Yet it\u2019s when Carpenter ditches her defence mechanisms and really lets loose that her fresh start feels most exciting."}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e7016d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/14/sale-how-russia-wealthy-profited-from-exit-of-western-brands-starbucks-operations", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": [], "title": "Bean counters: how Russia\u2019s wealthy profited from exit of western brands", "lead": "Buyers of Starbucks operations say they paid \u00a34.7m for assets, despite 2021 revenues ten times that figure", "author": "Jonathan Yerushalmy", "datePublished": "2023-06-14T09:40:44Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.294565", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/8c6f5606fb713a25c7b304ca7a5c30ece765e2f8/0_127_3500_2100/500.jpg", "body": "In the weeks after the invasion of Ukraine began, western companies in Russia were faced with a costly conundrum. Facing pressure from their customers and western governments to end all operations in Russia, brands from Coca-Cola to Levi\u2019s to Ikea all announced they would pull out. So as ordinary Russians found their access to Apple services limited and their Netflix cut off, many western brands with a significant physical presence in the country found themselves taking huge financial hits for their decision to \u201cself-sanction\u201d. In the aftermath of the western retreat, some Russians have found unique opportunities to obtain hugely valuable assets at knockdown prices. In early 2022, Starbucks had 130 stores in Russia, mostly operated through franchises. After initially pausing operations in March 2022, the company announced that May it would sell up and leave entirely, with a promise to support its 2,000 employees for a few months. Just a few months later Stars Coffee was unveiled \u2013 a new brand operating from most of Starbucks\u2019 old sites that bears more than a passing resemblance to its predecessor. The business is co-owned by the Russian rapper Timati and the restaurateur Anton Pinskiy, who told the state media agency Tass in an interview published on Tuesday that they acquired all of Starbucks\u2019 assets in Russia for just 500m roubles (\u00a34.7m). Pinskiy told Tass that the acquisition of those assets was a chance that \u201ccould not be missed\u201d. In 2021, Starbucks\u2019 Russian parent company reported revenue of more than $60m (\u00a347m), according to the news agency Interfax. Asked whether the sale price constituted a discount, Pinskiy told Tass: \u201cIt depends on what you mean with this word. We bought a closed business that was not bringing in profit.\u201d Timati has been a vocal supporter of Vladimir Putin and described himself as a friend of the Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov. In 2015, the rapper released a song entitled My Best Friend is Vladimir Putin and he was also behind a pro-government song called Moscow, in which he boasted the Russian capital \u201cdoesn\u2019t hold gay parades\u201d. Timati and Pinskiy are just two of a number of high net worth individuals who have benefited from the exit of western brands from Russia by snapping up US and European businesses at potentially discounted prices. In May 2022, just two months after McDonald\u2019s said it was temporarily closing its outlets across Russia, the company reached a deal to sell all its restaurants. It said staying in the country was not \u201cconsistent with McDonald\u2019s values\u201d. The buyer was Alexander Govor, a businessperson who immediately went from running a franchise operation of 25 McDonald\u2019s in Siberia, to owning more than 800 restaurants with 62,000 staff. Overnight, McDonald\u2019s disappeared, to be replaced by Govor\u2019s new brand, Vkusno &amp; tochka, or \u201cTasty &amp; that\u2019s it\u201d. Big Macs were now Big Hits, Happy Meals were Kids Combos and fries briefly disappeared from the menu during national potato shortages. At the time of the sale, Govor said he had paid \u201cfar lower than market price\u201d, describing the final amount as a \u201csymbolic\u201d figure. McDonald\u2019s has not commented, but said the write-off from exiting Russia would be in the region of $1.2bn to $1.4bn. The company has retained an option to buy back its restaurants within 15 years, according to Russian officials. Govor\u2019s interests stretch far beyond fast food. He is the co-owner of Neftekhimservis, a construction investor that owns an oil refinery in Siberia. He also holds a 50% stake in a forestry company and 25% of a fishing and hunting business, according to Russian media. Since acquiring the Russian operations of McDonald\u2019s, he has also bought a Finnish company that produces food and drink packaging after it announced it was leaving Russia. Krunchy Dream and World of Cubes, which replace Krispy Kreme and Lego, are among the other brands to have emerged on the sites of former western brands. Arkady Novikov, a Russian businessperson who operates a number of luxury restaurants around the world, was reported to have taken over the 30 Krispy Kreme restaurants in Russia. The chief executive of McDonald\u2019s, Chris Kempczinski, has said it is \u201cimpossible to predict\u201d when the company will return to Russia, but that its exit carried not just economic consequences, but a profound symbolic weight as well. When the first Golden Arches opened in Moscow in 1990, thousands waited in line to taste what was then a slice of history. If the temperature of relations between Moscow and the west can be traced in the fortunes of brands like McDonald\u2019s and Starbucks, that opening represented a warming in relations, a sign that the Soviet economy was opening up and a symbol of US capitalism. More than 32 years later, Vkusno &amp; tochka unveiled its first outlet at the site of that first McDonald\u2019s in Pushkin Square, this time to vastly diminished crowds.

The document, leaked to the Guardian, calls for the world\u2019s leading economies to \u201cpressure countries who fail to act decisively\u201d, without naming Beijing directly, as well as a plea to further tighten export controls. Russia, Kyiv says, \u201chas adapted to sanctions\u201d and will produce 1,061 missiles this year, more than double the 512 that the country\u2019s arms manufacturers made in 2022, the first year of its full invasion of Ukraine. The document argues that with the help of China and others, western components have been found in Kh-101 and Kalibr cruise missiles as well as Iskander and the Kinzhal hypersonic ballistic missiles. On Tuesday, at least 11 were killed in a Russian missile attack that struck an apartment block in the southern city of Kryvyi Rih, while on Wednesday at least three were killed in the port city of Odesa in what local authorities said was a cruise missile strike. Ukraine estimates that 1,734 civilian casualties - dead and wounded - have been caused by missile strikes alone since the start of the full-scale Russian invasion in February 2022, with the aggressors launching 6,000 missiles that struck 3,387 civilian targets. Ukraine continues to press for tighter coordinated sanctions to target Russia and in this case is lobbying for G7 members to implement tighter restrictions aimed at the country\u2019s missile manufacturers. Diplomatic sources said the latest paper was circulating earlier this week. An analysis of the missile fragments reveals that Russia is making use of a range of microprocessors, principally from US firms, which are supplied for civilian purposes but then re-exported through third countries to Moscow. Chips from Integrated Device Technology and Altera have been found in a Kh-101 cruise missile, while processors from Texas Instruments and Cypress Semiconductor appear in the sea-launched Kalibr. Iskander and Kinzhal both feature microchips from Xilinx, the document adds. Ukraine\u2019s research estimates that 80% of Russian missile components by value came from China in January and February, though it is unclear how this calculation is obtained. Thailand is the next largest exporter, on 5.5%, while other significant countries include Turkey, Maldives and the UAE. Kyiv says it wants to \u201cstop missile terror\u201d and urges that western governments impose sanctions on all Russian missile production companies and tighten end-user controls, to preventing components exported for civilian purposes ending up in missiles or other military kit. It also says some western materials, such as adhesives, are used in Russian missile production."}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e7016f", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/14/they-did-not-let-up-rare-video-of-platypuses-fighting-captured-by-tasmanian-farmer", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "subCategories": [], "title": "\u2018They did not let up\u2019: rare video of platypuses fighting captured by Tasmanian farmer", "lead": "Two male platypuses engaged in a ferocious battle for dominance, which expert says is normal in the build up to breeding season", "author": "Jordyn Beazley", "datePublished": "2023-06-14T09:35:06Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.294574", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/ed5c375e9f2b78747c7d80cac1b51699c0ba6922/61_0_1799_1080/500.jpg", "body": "Normally Australians would be lucky to catch just a glimpse of a platypus\u2019s broad beak and webbed feet as it gracefully paddles through the water.

For 20 minutes Esme Atkinson stood near the bank of a dam at the farm where she works watching the two platypuses spinning each other around in circles, similar to a \u201ccrocodile roll\u201d, and lift their bodies upright using their back tail in order to tussle with their feet. \u201cI\u2019m still pinching myself.

Although it is rare for humans to spot this sparring behaviour. \u201cIt\u2019s great that more people get to learn about how cool platypuses are,\u201d he said. \u201cIt means more people can see how important it is to protect their habitat. According to research released in 2020 by the University of New South Wales, platypus habitat has shrunk by almost a quarter in 30 years. This is being compounded by modern day threats such as water extraction from rivers and creeks and the building of dams and weirs. Atkinson said she often spots the two platypuses in the dam, but they normally each stick to one end. The day after the scuffle, Atkinson did spot one again. \u201cHe was on the dam spending a lot of time on his back scratching,\u201d she said. \u201cHe must have been itchy from his war wounds.\u201d"}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e70170", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/14/woking-council-to-cut-ties-with-firm-behind-debt-ridden-skyscraper", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "subCategories": [], "title": "Bust Woking council to cut ties with firm behind debt-ridden skyscraper", "lead": "Northern Irish developer Moyallen owns 52% of Victoria Square development at centre of local authority\u2019s financial meltdown", "author": "Richard Partington Economics correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-06-14T09:30:44Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.294581", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/d784984f1ba4c47ee50743337af481b7f63050de/0_440_8256_4954/500.jpg", "body": "Woking council plans to sever ties with the Northern Irish developer behind a skyscraper venture that helped tip the tiny Surrey local authority into effective bankruptcy. Amid ballooning costs and delays, a dramatic plunge in the value of the council\u2019s Victoria Square development \u2013 which is 52% owned by Moyallen, a business from Dungannon, County Tyrone \u2013 is at the centre of the local authority\u2019s financial meltdown. Built as the tallest towers outside a major city in England \u2013 with the ambition they could be seen from the top of the Shard in central London 30 miles away \u2013 the scheme was first planned in 2013 as a \u00a3150m taxpayer-funded regeneration project, before costs more than quadrupled to \u00a3700m. Involving a shopping centre, public plazas and a four-star Hilton hotel, the council warned last week that Victoria Square was among the main reasons for the failure of a risky investment spree overseen by its former Conservative administration, leaving the council facing a \u00a31.2bn deficit. Woking\u2019s crisis comes amid intense pressure for the owners of physical retail after a collapse in footfall in the Covid pandemic and dramatic growth in online shopping, made worse in recent months by the cost of living crisis. Ann-Marie Barker, Woking\u2019s Liberal Democrat leader, told the Guardian that plans were being made to sever relations with Moyallen. \u201cThe intention, always, with the relationship with Moyallen was that it was there for the development period [at Victoria Square], and that the relationship would come to a natural end at some point,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is something we would anticipate happening.\u201d The details come as documents filed in the past month at Companies House show Moyallen had amassed debts worth \u00a3188m to Bank of Ireland in connection with its ownership of three other shopping centres, including another site in Woking. Bank of Ireland placed four of Moyallen\u2019s other operating units into administration \u2013 including two entities used to control the Peacocks Centre, a separate 1990s shopping centre adjacent to Victoria Square. Moyallen is run by the brothers Peter and John Robinson. The company did not respond to repeated requests for comment. Those four entities are separate from Moyallen\u2019s Victoria Square joint venture with Woking council, which continues to operate as a going concern. However, the details pose fresh questions over the suitability of the firm as the majority partner in a taxpayer-funded project costing more than the 2012 Olympic Stadium. Documents filed at Companies House show the council was forced in the administration process to chase repayment of a \u00a36m loan it made to Moyallen for running the Peacocks Centre, which was settled in full earlier this year. While the company operated the lease on the Peacocks shopping centre, Woking remained the freehold owner. \u201cWe have been watching it [the administration] with some interest. There was work that had to be done by the council [to recover the \u00a36m loan],\u201d Barker said. Woking\u2019s former Conservative council leader had been warned about Moyallen\u2019s financial position in 2018 by John Bond, an independent councillor at the time, who raised concerns that its Bank of Ireland debts posed risks to the company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. Bond, who has since retired as a councillor, said: \u201cEverything I thought was wrong has since happened.\u201d \u201cI was shouted down, literally shouted down by the Conservatives. I was very concerned [about Moyallen], but they had the backing of the senior officers.\u201d The council\u2019s former Tory leadership dismissed Bond\u2019s concerns at the time, arguing that Bank of Ireland had indicated it was supportive of the company. Bank of Ireland declined to comment. The latest available accounts for Victoria Square Woking Ltd, the joint venture company behind the project, show the council loaned it \u00a3700m. However, the value of its assets plunged by more than \u00a3360m in 2021 to stand at just \u00a3116m \u2013 leaving the joint venture with a financial shortfall worth more than half a billion pounds. Moyallen, which does not have a website or publicly available phone number, was paid \u00a31.1m in development manager fees for the year. The fresh details come as commissioners installed by Michael Gove\u2019s levelling up department investigate Woking\u2019s financial dealings to establish how the projects were approved and structured, with the aim of extracting the council from costly schemes and recovering money by selling assets. Most of the council\u2019s spending had been financed by an obscure arm of the Treasury \u2013 the Public Works Loan Board \u2013 with \u00a31.3bn worth of borrowing that Woking could now struggle to repay. Documents show the administration of Moyallen\u2019s shopping centre assets is not expected to recover the full \u00a3188m owed to Bank of Ireland, after efforts to sell them were hit by the economic turmoil triggered by Liz Truss\u2019s mini budget. The business was forced to sell its three shopping centres as part of the Bank of Ireland administration process \u2013 including the Peacocks Centre, alongside the Magowan West and Rushmere shopping centres in Northern Ireland. The two businesses behind the Peacocks Centre, which Moyallen had acquired in 2008 for \u00a3116m, owed the bank \u00a388m out of its \u00a3188m debt at the time it was placed into administration by its creditors in April 2022. Documents from the administrator Grant Thornton show a prospective buyer pulled out of a deal for the Peacocks Centre \u201cwith the specific reasons being linked to the UK\u2019s economic instability and wider macro-economic factors \u2026 the Liz Truss mini budget occurred on 23 September 2022, followed by her resignation on 20 October \u2013 these factors most definitely had an adverse impact on our sale.\u201d After slashing the asking price and finding a new buyer, documents show the Peacocks Centre was sold for \u00a315m, out of about \u00a365m recovered overall from the Moyallen fire sale \u2013 less than half the value of the Bank of Ireland debt."}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e70171", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/14/london-trees-battle-save-development-chainsaws", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "subCategories": [], "title": "We love our urban trees and thought we\u2019d won the battle to save them.

They are much loved, all covered by tree protection orders, and provided as a gift in perpetuity to the community in the 1980s as a planning condition for the creation of a business park. Forty years on, none of this seems to matter. Where bricks and mortar and making money are concerned, trees have no voice: they die silently, even amid a climate emergency that now brings extreme temperatures to London and the south-east of England with alarming regularity. After years reporting on the battles of ordinary people to protect trees from bulldozers and chainsaws, I find myself in the midst of one. It is an emotionally sapping, frustrating fight against developers who want to destroy the trees and build luxury homes. It does not seem to matter that the council in question, Richmond upon Thames, a Liberal Democrat-run borough with a strong collection of Green councillors, declared a climate emergency in 2019. Nor that it launched its biodiversity action plan with much fanfare at a May 2019 event where the star speaker was David Attenborough, a local resident. The mantra at the time was \u201cthink globally, act locally, make a home for nature\u201d. Alongside the launch, the council printed thousands of leaflets headlined \u201cLocal wildlife needs your help\u201d, advising residents how they could support wildlife habitats in the urban environment. So we did. Our mature trees are a focal point: they draw passersby who stop to sit near the fairy tree created by schoolchildren, its surrounding soil lovingly planted out as a pocket community garden by a resident. When a developer submitted plans to tear down the 11 trees, and build four luxury houses \u2013 which would be worth around \u00a31.3m each \u2013 residents mounted a grassroots campaign to stop them. We paid for an arboricultural survey, asked a local charity to monitor the foraging bats and tied yellow ribbons around the branches in an age-old sign of nature in danger. And it worked. The plans were rejected, and when the developer submitted an appeal, this, too, was seen off. The planning inspector\u2019s findings in 2021 that the trees should be saved was so powerful we thought we could relax. In his dismissal, he said: \u201cThe collective value of the trees as a group is substantial and they comprise an attractive cluster of trees, making a positive contribution to the appearance of the street. The loss of the trees, notwithstanding the proposals for replacement planting elsewhere, would substantially degrade the quality of the street scene at this location.\u201d But as other communities facing similar battles know from experience, there is always another fight. Developers will come back, year after year, wearing down even the most tenacious of local activists, who have to turn their minds to their jobs, their children, illness, a family tragedy. Across the country ordinary people, such as the residents of Lewes and Wellingborough, are fighting to save their trees. Like us, they are often kept in the dark as tweaks to proposals are made during private discussions with officials, finding a more palatable way to rip apart a green corridor, a wildlife hub in an urban environment. This time round the developer wants to build three large homes, and tear down four of our 11 trees, while severely pruning and pollarding others, and enclosing two in the gardens of the new homes. There is no guarantee in the mountains of documents provided that the destruction will remain at only four; many more could be felled if they are damaged as the diggers move in. There is a crucial sweetener, however. The developer will pay the council \u00a3299,000 for affordable housing elsewhere in the borough and \u00a382,850 for the loss of trees. The community has not been involved in any of the discussions about this financial gain for the loss of our trees. Whatever behind-the-scenes discussions have taken place, enough has changed for the council, whose planning officer is recommending councillors approve the housing on Wednesday. He believes despite the majority of the trees being felled, enclosed in private gardens or heavily pruned back, the \u201crelationship between the buildings and the trees can now be successfully managed\u201d. Ironically, he says the survival of the few remaining trees from our group of 11 can be ensured with the imposition of a planning condition, even as he tears down the 40-year-old condition that gave the community the trees in the first place. This wilful, shortsighted destruction robs not just us, but future generations, of one of our ultimate weapons to fight the climate crisis: capturing and storing carbon, preventing flooding, cooling cities, not to mention providing a home to many of our threatened wildlife. Without the trees, we will have lost much, much more than a nice, shady place to sit and chat.

What does it matter whether that lizard can outrun those snakes? It\u2019s all part of nature. It\u2019s nothing to do with us. Well, not any more. The scene that sticks in the mind from Our Planet II, Netflix\u2019s new Attenborough-voiced opus, is of an albatross chick on the tiny Pacific island of Laysan, fighting for life without any predators nearby. The little thing\u2019s opening its beak wide and dry-heaving towards the sand. \u201cThere is now so much plastic in our oceans that it reaches the most remote islands on Earth,\u201d says Sir David, as we see the beach strewn with incongruously colourful detritus. The peril the chick is trying to survive is whether or not it can sick up a gobbet of indestructible crud its mother mistook for food. The four new hour-long episodes have plenty more sequences to make you think: heck, what have we done? In the Arctic, a walrus perches on the only floating glacier shard within view, unsure where to go next. A polar bear, knackered by the need to swim much more and walk much less, fails to hunt a bearded seal that\u2019s better at sliding on and off the melting, fractured ice. The theme is migration, as prompted by the changing seasons \u2013 but humans have changed how extreme those seasonal shifts are. It is not all doom \u2013 in fact, the environmental warnings are slightly less strident than they were in the first run of Our Planet. We have plenty of wonders still to enjoy. The show\u2019s recurring motif is an unbelievable shot of animals on the move together in staggering numbers. A megaherd of cape buffalo in the Kalahari, filmed from the air and looking like swarming ants; actual swarming army ants, carrying \u201csupersized larvae\u201d to their new forest home; locusts turning the ground yellow as they walk, then undergoing a bristling metamorphosis that makes them even more disquietingly alien, whereupon they turn the sky pink. The locusts\u2019 trip from Sudan to Tibet is illustrated by figures moving on a 3D relief map, a clever visual aid to underline the vastness of the distances that migrating creatures cover. We have extreme cuteness, too, in the form of a murrelet chick on Vancouver Island who has to trek alone towards the shore, so small it keeps smacking face-first into twigs lying on the ground. That Laysan albatross chick is adorable once it\u2019s recovered from its human-induced choking fit, standing on the beach all ragged and fluffy, gazing out to sea and wondering when to attempt its first flight. It\u2019s seen a young black-footed albatross set off, lose momentum and land on the water, bobbing for a second before being eaten by a tiger shark that has travelled 1,000km for this specific feast. Another black-footed bird is more or less in flight a few inches above the surf, but isn\u2019t going to get far: a tiger shark is chewing on its foot. Whether our friend will suffer the same fate is the subject of the episode one cliffhanger, a device used throughout the season to persuade us to let the Netflix machine roll on to the next instalment. This seems unnecessarily needy for a prestige wildlife documentary, and it\u2019s awkwardly executed: presumably for the benefit of viewers who might watch episodes in isolation, the next one starts with a recap that repeats the information binge-watchers have just been given. Elsewhere, there is the odd moment where the footage doesn\u2019t feel new enough: everyone\u2019s familiar by now with lions working to isolate a weak buffalo/wildebeest, but we see that old drama play out twice, alongside similar sequences of orca v whale, arctic fox v snow goose and crocodile v zebra. But these are quibbles, brought on by how spoiled we\u2019ve been by previous landmark natural history shows. Take a step back and so much of Our Planet II is astonishing: a drone camera mimicking a homeless bee swarm\u2019s hunt for a new nesting place, checking out the holes in various trees, is one of many times we\u2019re reminded what a precious honour it is to see such sights. These creatures are precious indeed, and Our Planet II tries to see hope in places where humans have shown some awareness of their responsibilities as tenants-in-common of Earth. The antelope whose ancestral migration routes have been blocked by barbed-wire fences protecting US oil and gas fields, for example, have at least had bridges built for them so they can cross our lethal four-lane highways.

Part of the reason AI has generated more widespread excitement than other recent tech advances, such as blockchain technology or the metaverse, is its sheer game-changing usefulness. AI has the potential to revolutionise a range of tasks, from planning and research to idea generation and content creation. One real-world use that has already proven invaluable is the deployment of AI and machine learning to generate mapping \u2013 a sweet spot that combines the efficiency and utility of AI with the kind of geolocation technology that has already improved lives in countless ways, from satnavs and delivery apps to real-time transport updates. Maps are essential for planning and managing infrastructure, transportation systems, land use, and efforts to mitigate environmental damage. But keeping a master map of a country up to date can be an expensive and laborious process. Even with modern tools, such as satellite photos or images taken by drones, the work to digitally trace vast urban and rural areas manually can be hugely time-consuming and expensive. \u201cImagine the amount of buildings there are in one square kilometre in a dense urban environment \u2013 it can take even an experienced operator up to a week to manually capture all of those buildings,\u201d explains Mark Tabor, a principal consultant at Ordnance Survey (OS), Britain\u2019s national mapping service. Indeed, in Britain, OS has a team of 250 surveyors tasked with this job and with keeping the national mapping database up to date. But this is a luxury that not every country can afford. Enter AI, which OS is employing in pioneering techniques for building detailed digital maps quickly and accurately, and at low cost. The technique, which OS is using in Britain to improve efficiency, essentially involves teaching computers what to look for in images, using training data so that maps can automatically be created. One striking example of how its cutting-edge techniques have been put to use is in Lusaka. The capital of Zambia has undergone rapid urbanisation in recent years \u2013 its population has more than tripled from a million at the turn of the millennium to an estimated 3.2 million people today. That transformation has been a huge challenge for the Zambian officials tasked with running public services and managing the city \u2013 a challenge compounded by the lack of an accurate, up-to-date map, which is one of the crucial building blocks of any modern city. Without a map, officials couldn\u2019t be certain where and how people were living, or the services they required. And this was particularly important in a city where many citizens live in informal settlements that haven\u2019t gone through any kind of planning processes. \u201cWhen the local government thinks about how it\u2019s going to organise public transport, it needs to know not only where the informal settlements are, but how [residents] actually get to their place of work,\u201d says Tabor, who has been working with the Zambian government. \u201cThe mapping the government had was out of date.\u201d This meant that before its new map was created, it was having to rely on other sources, such as Google Maps and OpenStreetMap \u2013 a geographic database maintained by volunteers. But these are not accurate enough for mission-critical government work. \u201cThey\u2019re not always up to date, they don\u2019t have a consistent specification, and it means that when there are some really crucial pieces of information that the government needs to derive from mapping, it doesn\u2019t have the latest data,\u201d says Tabor. \u201cThese other sources might be great for navigation and understanding where the shops are, but, if you want every single property to not only be on your map, and also to have additional attribution, not so much.\u201d He gives the example of how a detailed map of every dwelling can be essential in disaster situations such as flooding. If the government has reliable location data, it can match homes to residents, so that emergency services can figure out how many people may require help, and where they are likely to be located. To ensure the accuracy of OS\u2019s AI-powered base map, the starting point was up-to-date aerial photographs of Lusaka. \u201cWe began classifying all of the pixels into buildings and roads, and other different types of features that were asked for by the end user.\u201d says Tabor. What the surveyors were doing was training the system to recognise things. Each time a box was drawn around a home, or a line was traced over a street, it taught the computer how to spot these sorts of features on its own, without human help. And the more training data that was fed in, the better the automated end results. \u201cIt\u2019s a balance between having a fully automatic process where you don\u2019t need any training, which might get to, say, 85% completion, or by investing in more training data for even greater accuracy,\u201d says Tabor. Using this technique, Tabor\u2019s team was able to automatically map the entire 420 sq km of Lusaka far more rapidly than if it had been done by humans. They also carried out checks on the work of the system, as there will always be some unusual buildings that the AI might classify incorrectly. The AI-generated maps are also highly versatile. They\u2019re able to keep up with rapidly growing urban areas or changing landscapes. They also allow for the integration of other sources of data, such as census data. Indeed, last year, Zambia completed its most recent census using the new maps. Early in his research into this technique, Tabor discovered that the AI model was also more than capable of working across borders. It\u2019s now a critical tool for OS as it helps other nations plan and manage their growth and development. The organisation is already applying its knowhow to projects that range from identifying parcels of land for tax authorities, to using AI to classify different wildlife habitats. Tabor points to how accurate mapping data can also underpin public health policy: \u201cIf you\u2019ve got to think about where you are going to have an inoculation centre, do you actually understand where the majority of the population is? How many inoculations are you likely to need?\u201d AI-powered mapping has also helped OS to automate the production of climate-related location data. OS has worked with Deimos Space UK and the Mohammed Bin Rashid Space Centre in Dubai to use AI and satellite data to identify and monitor palm trees and mangroves \u2013 types of vegetation that can help mitigate the impact of climate change by storing a large amount of carbon, and which are being planted in swathes. Robust and reliable location data is also important when trying out new and innovative approaches to urban planning \u2013 for instance, the development of smart-city initiatives that seek to use data and digital technology to manage cities better. OS is working with Dubai on its smart city strategy, having previously worked with Singapore in a similar capacity. For instance, Dubai required an up-to-date approach to capturing location data in order to create a so-called happiness meter, a system for gathering feedback from people across the city on everything from geographic areas to their experience as a customer. The happiness meter forms part of Dubai\u2019s broader smart-city initiatives, and it turned to OS to undertake a geospatial readiness assessment to help understand the city\u2019s needs and capabilities, and to identify the next steps that Dubai municipality needed to take. Smart-city initiatives can allow authorities to go beyond service and infrastructure provision in their efforts to improve the lives of residents. Another example is Singapore, where OS helped smart-city initiatives by working with the National University of Singapore and the government by improving data interoperability and 3D data modelling to help the country plan its future more effectively. Digital models, sometimes referred to as digital twins, can help cities plan and evaluate interventions more effectively. \u201cThere are also a lot of countries that are highly developed and have their own version of a digital twin, if you like,\u201d says Tabor. \u201cSingapore is a very good example.\u201d It\u2019s just another way that innovative mapping techniques have become vital for innovative approaches to development, urban planning, and countless other challenges faced by public authorities.

This isn\u2019t a riddle or trick question, but a key to better understanding how today\u2019s world functions. You may instantly associate connectivity with the digital world \u2013 enabling people to work together remotely or share things on social media. But digital technology also enables physical connections, such as transport links, delivery apps, public services and the pipes and cables that deliver energy and utilities. These types of connectivity have become fundamental to our everyday lives \u2013 and they are all underpinned by accurate location data. \u201cIn a typical day, there are 42 occasions when individuals use a service or a piece of infrastructure that relies on Ordnance Survey data,\u201d says Ash Wheeler, who works with location data in his role as director of propositions and markets for Ordnance Survey (OS), Britain\u2019s national mapping service. \u201cInfrastructure underpins how any nation is able to function, and improves the quality of life for the people who live there. And we underpin infrastructure: OS location data and data services both map and enable the operation of the many infrastructure networks that support the way Great Britain operates.\u201d The location data that OS produces and maintains has become so pervasive that it underpins everyday services such as waste collection, water provision, deliveries and insurance premiums. And it feeds into essential emergency services, such as the dispatch systems used by ambulances. It can also help organisations monitor damage to the physical landscape as part of wider global efforts to tackle environmental emergencies. Wheeler and his team at OS are continually working on innovative new uses for location data. One such application is OS\u2019s work with the engineering and design group Atkins. The UK government appointed Atkins to deliver a new data platform: the National Underground Asset Register (NUAR) \u2013 a single, secure data-sharing service to record the location and characteristics of underground assets. Atkins is working with Ordnance Survey, 1Spatial, GeoPlace and the Greater London Authority. In April 2023, the first phase of NUAR launched, which covers the north-east of England, Wales and London. Prior to NUAR, location data was siloed across different industries and stored in different formats. NUAR provides workers with an interactive, standardised digital view of the underground assets in a given location, reducing the risk of accidental strikes and resultant delays, costs and traffic disruption. Also, improving access to datasets such as gas, water, and electricity supply lines in a secure way provides a significant advantage in surveying and risk assessment, thus reducing risks and helping to improve safety onsite. The project follows on from OS\u2019s creation of a combined underground infrastructure map for Northumbrian Water \u2013 which details water, wastewater, gas, electricity, telecoms and other underground services. Thanks to this, planners and excavation teams know exactly what lies where. Northumbrian Water estimates that the map will save it \u00a31m a year, from a combination of reduced back-office effort to produce safe working maps and plans, lower costs associated with utility strikes, and fewer jobs being abandoned due to lack of information. As with the interdependence between digital and physical connectivity, the worlds above and below ground are increasingly interdependent: you can\u2019t fully maintain and monitor one without maintaining and monitoring the other \u2013 which makes sophisticated subterranean mapping ever more essential for both public and private sector organisations. Going beyond NUAR, OS is exploring its role in the design and delivery of other secure digital services on a national scale that require a neutral, trusted operator to aggregate and share geospatial information from multiple sources. Location data can provide valuable insights for organisations looking to streamline processes and deliver services to customers more efficiently. Knowing exactly where your customers are, the types of spaces they occupy and how best to deliver services to them are critical elements for both government and businesses. The blending of location data and data-analysis can help provide all-important information about places, and identify solutions, enabling better decisions and greater efficiencies. OS identifies places by the way it captures the natural and built environment and how it creates identifiers for buildings (UPRNs) and streets (USRNs) which allows multiple information sets about these places to be brought together. For example, OS AddressBase matches 46 million addresses to unique property reference numbers, identifying the exact location of each place. OS AddressBase accurately directs delivery drivers, for example, to specific addresses; they no longer waste time looking for a property in a street where the numbers are not in sequence or searching for places in complex urban environments. Using technology underpinned by OS AddressBase, McQueens Dairies, based in St Andrews, has optimised its milk deliveries to thousands of homes in Britain, cutting 100,000 miles a year from its rounds and significantly reducing fuel consumption. Admin has also been reduced as staff no longer spend hours manually planning routes. \u201cOther initiatives deploy technology, data and connectivity to the way roads are designed, built, managed and used. These initiatives are often referred to as Digital Roads, and the case for them is growing because of the transport challenges posed by the climate emergency, the ever present need to improve safety, the rise of internet-connected and automated transport services, increasing congestion and budgetary pressures on local authorities,\u201d says Wheeler. Again, authoritative, trusted location data can be brought to bear on these challenges. \u201cFor example, designing or modifying roads to better balance the needs of different road users \u2013 cars, freight, emergency services, cyclists and other active travellers \u2013 requires detailed location data and insights to enable local authorities to optimise how our roads support connectivity between places. Improving transport networks is one element of broader efforts by urban planners and businesses to meet the infrastructure needs of the future \u2013 from building affordable homes and upgrading broadband coverage to installing electric vehicle charging points. Authoritative location data can therefore help the development of smart green cities of the future. \u201cCities can\u2019t just get bigger and bigger without intelligent planning,\u201d says Wheeler. \u201cNot only do you need to be able to make sure that core services in cities can cope as cities grow but, more importantly, [planners] need to be able to understand the proximity of services [to where people live], the time it takes them to get to work, the quality of the natural environment around them, and how long it takes them to get to green spaces. These are all important measures for a healthy urban environment and you can only answer those questions when you understand where everything is.\u201d As OS puts it: when you know a place better than anyone, you can make it better for everyone.

The dispute comes as a rightwing backlash against many American businesses sweeps across the US, with conservative activists and consumers attacking expressions of support for LGBTQ+ Americans. Some of the biggest corporate names in the US \u2013 such as retailer Target and beer giant Anheuser-Busch \u2013 have been hit by boycotts. It also comes as a wave of legislation has been passed in many Republican-run states eroding the rights of the LGBTQ+ community, especially around the teaching of gay or trans rights issues in schools. According to the Human Rights Campaign, over 520 anti-LGBTQ+ bills have been introduced in state legislatures in the US so far in 2023, a record high, including a record passage of 74 of the bills. The Starbucks dispute erupted after a petition on Coworker.org, a labor organizing website, was launched in the beginning of June that claimed Starbucks managers have told workers they cannot put up Pride decorations this year. A Starbucks worker in Virginia at a non-unionized store who started the petition, but requested to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation, said they came into work in the beginning of June and noticed all of their store\u2019s Pride and other decorations had been taken down. The petition is directed at their regional manager. \u201cI was told that they had just implemented a new no-decorations policy. And I was like, \u2018Right before Pride?\u2019 That\u2019s really suspicious and kind of weird. I was pretty sure it wasn\u2019t just our store, because our store managers are very supportive of LGBT stuff, most of our employees are LGBT community members, and I was told that it was the regional manager\u2019s decision,\u201d the worker said. \u201cThis is so ridiculous, because it\u2019s just a little quality of life thing that we can do, it doesn\u2019t have any impact on corporate, it doesn\u2019t reduce their profits \u2013 even the customers like it. We get a lot of compliments on decorations and lots of our customers are also LGBT community members, and I found that really frustrating and, honestly, pointless.\u201d The worker criticized Starbucks\u2019s initial denial that Pride decorations were being removed in stores and claimed the company was circumventing the claims by citing the decoration removals weren\u2019t part of any corporate policy change because it was a regional management decision that affected their store. Starbucks Workers United, the union representing Starbucks workers at more than 300 locations in the US, also posted a thread on Twitter on 13 June claiming that workers in at least 21 states, including at unionized stores, have reported their store management banning Pride decorations. The union has also pushed back on Starbucks\u2019s denials, citing numerous reports on social media and TikTok videos from workers of the removal of Pride decorations at their stores. Starbucks has denied any corporate policy changes, claiming it is not aware of any corporate store that has banned decorations related to Pride month. It said it is waiting to hear back from the regional manager mentioned in the petition on what disconnect exists between workers and management on decoration policies. \u201cWe unwaveringly support the LGBTQIA2+ community. There has been no change to any policy on this matter and we continue to encourage our store leaders to celebrate with their communities including for US Pride month in June,\u201d said Starbucks spokesperson Andrew Trumbull. He added: \u201cWe\u2019re deeply concerned by false information that is being spread especially as it relates to our inclusive store environments, our company culture and the benefits we offer our partners. Starbucks has a history that includes more than four decades of recognizing and celebrating our diverse partners and customers \u2013 including year-round support for the LGBTQIA2+ community.\u201d The company did not comment directly on the Coworker.org petition. The worker claimed the decision to remove Pride decorations, especially in light of the recent surge in anti-LGBTQ+ legislation, is detrimental to communities that need public support to counter that. \u201cIt feels like they\u2019re unnecessarily kind of falling in line with that, when they don\u2019t have to. I don\u2019t think it would cost them anything. We\u2019re supposed to be a community environment,\u201d they said. \u201cI\u2019m frustrated that they\u2019re just flat out denying that it\u2019s even happening anywhere. Instead of looking into it and realizing that while they didn\u2019t institute a corporate policy, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not happening. A regional manager has control over a huge number of stores and if they say \u2018no decorations\u2019, and they decide to implement that right before Pride, there\u2019s going to be a response to that and saying that it\u2019s false information is just not true.\u201d Another Starbucks worker said their store in Maryland also removed all decorations just as Pride month began. \u201cThey took down most of what we had up at the beginning of June and said we can\u2019t decorate for Pride this year or anything else. The store has to look JLP \u2013 \u2018just like the picture\u2019,\u201d the worker said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been asked not make a big deal of it. Many LGBTQIA+ folks work at Starbucks, including myself. The company offers insurance benefits that cover trans-related healthcare, talks a great game about inclusion and community, but now is stopping us from celebrating Pride in at least some stores.\u201d Starbucks Workers United claimed the new policy differs from previous Pride months when decorations were permitted and aligns with recent policy changes at Target which removed Pride merchandise in response to threats and criticism from far-right anti-LGBTQ+ groups."}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e70176", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/jun/14/armpit-confidential-why-men-are-now-shaving-and-women-are-doing-whatever-they-like", "primaryCategory": "fashion", "subCategories": [], "title": "Armpit confidential: why men are now shaving \u2013 and women are doing whatever they like", "lead": "On Saturday, the bare underarms of footballer John Stones prompted a huge reaction online.

Manchester City midfielder John Stones, crouched down on the pitch, in a torn shirt revealing his bare chest and \u2026 a freshly shaved armpit? The ripped shirt was not intentional. It tore during the 80th minute of the Champions League final in Istanbul last Saturday, following an altercation with Inter Milan\u2019s Robin Gosens. Stones\u2019 Puma Ultraweave shirt was obviously not up to the strain. But as the camera lingered on his underarm stubble, Twitter lit up. Discussions crept across chat forums. Are men \u2013 some men asked \u2013 now shaving their armpits? Yes, and no. \u201cMen in sports have always shaved their bodies \u2013 particularly in swimming and cycling and even athletics. It helps with friction, helps them move faster and is probably slightly more hygienic,\u201d says Rachael Gibson, a hair historian. Even in football, we know Cristiano Ronaldo waxes his body, and we can see from Mo Salah\u2019s polished trunk on Instagram that he does, too, \u201cIt\u2019s almost strange that it\u2019s still a talking point\u201d, says Gibson. But for some reason underarm hair has always seemed like the last bastion of \u201cmasculinity\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s like, everything else can go, but don\u2019t touch the armpits!\u201d According to the research firm Mintel\u2019s 2023 UK Shaving and Hair Removal Market report, 55% of UK consumers \u2013 so women and men \u2013 have removed body hair from their underarms in the previous 12 months. Women tend to bring the average up, with statistics that have barely changed in the past 50 years. An op-ed in the New York Times in 1974 reported that 98% of US women shaved their armpits and legs. Conservative estimates suggest that figure is largely unchanged. But the rate of male hair removal is creeping up. According to Rebecca M Herzig in her 2015 book, Plucked: A History of Hair Removal, about 60% of men remove their body hair. That is quite a loose figure \u2013 \u201chair removal\u201d refers to anything below the neck \u2013 but if we fast forward to 2019, a poll of Men\u2019s Health readers found that 68% of men trimmed their armpit hair, 52% for aesthetic reasons and 16% because of sport. Friction, sweating, smell, therapeutic massages, not to mention opponents tugging your hair, all factor here. To those we can add the use of performance wear in professional sports, which includes those natty little crop tops worn by Lionel Messi that measure heart and acceleration rates, and which work better without body hair. Gibson thinks habits shifted with David Beckham and his so-called metrosexuality. Mintel has a name for how this has evolved \u2013 the \u201cskinification\u201d of grooming products \u2013 that is, nice-smelling creams and fancy gadgets (the Mangroomer and the Razorba both have extendable handles for body trimming) to rival most beauty products. Some men \u2013 not Stones, who had most likely shaved \u2013 are even getting lasered. Lisa Mason-Poyner, the group director at E\u0301lan Laser Clinics, has seen an \u201cexplosion in popularity\u201d comparable to that of women\u2019s hair removal in the 90s, with no body part off-limits \u2013 though she says areas such as the buttocks and pubic areas might need a little building up to in terms of pain. Women\u2019s armpits, however, are a different matter. Gibson thinks that while we\u2019re more relaxed about body image (something she puts down to the pandemic), not-shaving has become even more loaded. Today, it\u2019s sometimes as much about demonstrating you have a carefree mindset as it is about being carefree. \u201cSome women just don\u2019t shave and that\u2019s that,\u201d she says. \u201cThe most important thing is choice.\u201d But fashion marketing, for one, has taken note. In 2021, Adidas used photos of the dancer Leila Davis with hairy armpits; last year, Asos used a woman with visible armpit hair to model a tank top. Another shift has seen beauty brands, such as Billie, showing the very body hair they want you to remove using their products. During the 1960s, along with blue jeans and a little light drug use, women\u2019s hairy underarms were markers of political consciousness and female liberation. They still make a statement. In 1985, Madonna posed for Playboy with hairy armpits. In 1999, Julia Roberts didn\u2019t shave for the premiere of Notting Hill (she later said she \u201cforgot\u201d). On her Instagram account, Girls actor Jemima Kirke often shows an unshaved armpit. But this will always be a thorny subject, says Gibson. \u201cWe have this idea that body hair removal is a new concept but it\u2019s far older than we can imagine,\u201d she says. Native Americans used a pinch, or a tweezer-like instrument, made from shells, to remove body hair. Other cultures used rocks. Equally unchanged is the culture around suffering for your hair removal. \u201cEgyptians used a quicklime mixture which burned and probably really hurt,\u201d she says. There are myriad factors as to why each culture removed their hair, but many were motivated by practicality. \u201cEgyptians shaved their heads and wore wigs. Why? Lice, mainly. It was just cleaner.\u201d Stones was not wearing a performance crop top, and judging by the likely use of a shaver, it was probably a last-minute changing-room decision. But with temperatures creeping above 30C in Istanbul, he probably did it because of the heat. \u201cIn fact, it\u2019s likely the whole team did,\u201d says Gibson. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t see their armpits.\u201d"}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e70177", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/jun/14/abc-job-cuts-corporation-to-make-as-many-as-100-roles-redundant-amid-major-restructure", "primaryCategory": "media", "subCategories": [], "title": "ABC job cuts: corporation to make as many as 100 roles redundant amid major restructure", "lead": "<strong>Exclusive:</strong> redundancies are the first mass job losses at the corporation since 2020", "author": "Amanda Meade", "datePublished": "2023-06-14T08:58:09Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.294621", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/2b8c1460727983a13c2afb767c0b1f47f5a47a06/0_212_3088_1854/500.jpg", "body": "The ABC is expected to announce as many as 100 job cuts on Thursday, before a major restructure of the corporation kicking in on 1 July.

The ABC is diverting resources away from traditional broadcasting towards improving its digital platforms \u2013 ABC iview, ABC Listen and ABC News \u2013 and promoting their use as part of its five-year plan, released on Friday. The ABC declined to comment. Anderson foreshadowed last month the restructure would lead to redundancies in both management and staff ranks. \u201cChange is never easy,\u201d Anderson said in May. \u201cClearly this restructure impacts some of our leaders. Where this occurs, we will seek to redeploy as many affected employees as possible. But we expect there will be some redundancies and consultation with those leaders who are impacted is under way.\u201d\u2019 The biggest restructure since 2017 will see regional journalists moved into the news division, while radio networks, including Radio National and Triple J, will move into a single content division alongside television. The powerful new content division under the recently appointed Chris Oliver-Taylor will be responsible for all screen, audio and digital content while news programming will be managed by the news director, Justin Stevens.

Another 4% will be delivered in October. The five-year plan will involve major changes to work practices with redundancies expected across all divisions as the corporation moves into a digital-first model, sources say. Technology, audience behaviour and demographic changes mean the ABC has to undergo a \u201csignificant transition\u201d from maintaining both traditional broadcast and digital processes towards becoming an integrated digital operation, Anderson said last week. \u201cBy 2028, the ABC will serve more Australians on the platform of their choice with made-for-digital content and journalism on ABC News, ABC iview, ABC listen and on major third-party platforms,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cAustralians trust and value the ABC and this will not change. As we move through this period of digital evolution, Australians can continue to rely on us for the content and services that inform, educate and entertain.\u201d The cuts are the first mass job losses at the corporation since 2020 when the ABC cut 250 staff across news, entertainment and regional divisions to meet a $41m annual budget shortfall.

The four women, in their late 20s and early 30s, are pursuing civil proceedings against the social media influencer and former kickboxer over alleged offences between 2013 and 2016 while he was still living in the UK. A Crowdjustice campaign to support legal action against Tate has raised more than \u00a318,500. Lawyers from McCue Jury &amp; Partners, who are representing the claimants, said they had delivered the letter to Tate in person on Wednesday at his address in Bucharest, where he is under house arrest pending charges of human trafficking in Romania. According to the law firm, the aim of the lawsuit is to seek \u201cjustice, accountability and compensation for Tate\u2019s victims\u201d, as well as to encourage \u201ca UK criminal investigation into Tate\u2019s crimes in the hope of his prosecution and conviction in the UK, in addition to the charges he is facing in Romania\u201d. The legal letter details the allegations made by the four women, including violent rapes, serious physical assaults, and controlling and coercive behaviour. They have put Tate on notice that, depending on his response, legal proceedings will be initiated against him at the high court in London in the coming weeks. One of the women claimed that after meeting Tate in 2014, he assaulted her. She said: \u201cWhile having sex, he began to choke me and choked me so hard that I lost consciousness. I thought I was going to die. When I woke up, he was continuing to rape me. It is difficult to say that because it is so upsetting, but that is what it was.\u201d Tate, 36, a British-US citizen with more than 6.5 million Twitter followers, was placed under house arrest in Romania in April after a court overturned a request by prosecutors to extend his detention. Alongside his brother and two Romanian women, Tate faces charges of rape, people trafficking and organised crime. They have denied all the accusations. One of the claimants who is taking part in the proceedings said: \u201cAfter such a long fight for justice, it feels good to finally be taking a positive step forward. While this experience has been extremely traumatic for us, we have taken strength in the fact that we have decided to take a stand, and are not alone. We hope that bringing this claim will encourage other people to speak out against their abusers, no matter how powerful they are.\u201d Matthew Jury, a managing partner of McCue Jury &amp; Partners, said: \u201cThis is a major step in UK survivors of Tate\u2019s alleged crimes campaign for justice by taking their fight straight to Tate\u2019s door. The legal papers delivered to Tate today lay bare the gravity and full weight of the accusations against him. \u201cDespite Tate\u2019s outrageous claims that these women aren\u2019t even real, on reading the papers, he should now recall how real they are. Talk of the \u2018Matrix\u2019 and \u2018false flags\u2019 hold no weight in court. The survivors look forward to seeing him there.\u201d A spokesperson for Tate said previously: \u201cWe understand there is a lot of interest surrounding Andrew at the moment; however, he vehemently denies these accusations and does not condone violence of any kind towards women. All sexual acts that Andrew has partaken in have been consensual and agreed upon before by both parties.\u201d Tate\u2019s representatives have been approached for comment.

The FTSE 100 oil company on Wednesday announced that production would remain stable until 2030, after previously saying it would cut output by about 1-2% each year. Shell will invest $40bn in oil and gas production between 2023 and 2035, compared with between $10bn and $15bn in \u201clow-carbon\u201d products. Sawan was appointed as Shell\u2019s chief executive in September, replacing Ben van Beurden who had surprised some activists and investors by putting in place a target of achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050, albeit with only gradual reductions in fossil fuel output planned. Since taking over, Sawan has emphasised financial returns for investors. He told investors at the New York stock exchange that he wanted to \u201creward our shareholders today and far into the future\u201d. While saying he wanted to lower emissions, he also repeatedly emphasised his belief that oil and gas would be required for the long term. In its strategy in 2021, Shell said it would aim for \u201can expected gradual reduction in oil production of around 1-2% each year, including divestments and natural decline\u201d. However, Shell argued on Wednesday that the previous strategy did not constitute a commitment to cutting oil production steadily. It said it had in fact hit the target within seven months of announcing it because of the $9.5bn sale later in 2021 of its interest in al project in the Permian Basin, Texas. Shell\u2019s output was 1.9m barrels of oil a day in 2019, and dropped to 1.5mls a day \u2013 a 21% decline. A Shell spokesperson: \u201cOur target of a reduction in oil production by 2030 has not changed. We\u2019ve just met it eight years early.\u201d Shell\u2019s announcement came on the same day that the International Energy Agency, a respected global energy watchdog, said the peak for global demand for oil would come before the end of the decade. In 2021, the agency said development of new oil and gas fields had to stop immediately to meet the goal of global net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and avoid climate breakdown. Climate campaigners criticised Shell\u2019s renewed commitment to fossil fuels. Carla Denyer, the co-leader of the UK Green party, said: \u201cFor Shell to target more fossil fuel production and to increase payouts to shareholders is pure climate vandalism, and a sign that fossil fuel companies will not steer us to the greener future we all crave without political leadership from national governments.\u201d Sawan announced a strategy update in New York in which Shell would focus on cutting costs and targeting its most profitable areas. Shell said it would grow its gas production business while keeping oil production steady, stabilising liquids production to 2030. It also announced a 15% planned dividend increase and a promise to return $5bn to investors through a share buyback. Sawan reaffirmed the company\u2019s previous commitment to producing net zero emissions by 2050, although the company warned this was unlikely to be achieved \u201cif society is not net zero in 2050\u201d. As part of those plans, Shell said it would invest between $10bn and $15bn across 2023 to 2025 on \u201clow-carbon\u201d products including biofuels, hydrogen, electric vehicle charging and carbon capture and storage."}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e7017a", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2023/jun/14/auastralia-politics-live-nsw-indigenous-voice-referendum-linda-burney-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-question-time-brittany-higgins-katy-gallagher-linda-reynolds-tanya-plibersek", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "subCategories": [], "title": "Former PM has \u2018no recollection\u2019 of senator\u2019s claim \u2013 as it happened", "lead": "This blog is now closed.", "author": "Elias Visontay and Amy Remeikis (earlier)", "datePublished": "2023-06-14T08:34:38Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.294635", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/5ea334dc75237dcb202b08cb58a1c8d0041fa3d1/0_0_5185_3111/500.jpg", "body": "With that, we\u2019ll wrap up our live coverage of the day\u2019s news. Here\u2019s a summary of the key developments: Lidia Thorpe has accused Senate colleague David Van of harassment and sexual assault during a heated exchange in parliament, an allegation the Liberal politician vehemently denied. The New South Wales premier, Chris Minns, visited the town of Singleton to pledge $100,000 in support to victims of the bus crash that killed 10 locals on Sunday night. Decommissioned gas wells from a Santos project off the coast of Western Australia have been leaking from the seabed for a decade, according to documents published by the national petroleum regulator. The leader of the opposition, Peter Dutton, has claimed it is \u201cabsolutely reasonable\u201d for the Coalition to question whether Labor \u201cconspired to seek political advantage out of an alleged sexual assault\u201d after the release of Brittany Higgins\u2019s text messages. The Australian government is expected to move all remaining refugees and asylum seekers off Nauru by the end of the month, more than a decade after offshore processing restarted on the Pacific Island nation. A former Coles executive has admitted stealing $1.9m from the national supermarket giant but a judge said his offending was so inexplicable and unsophisticated he must undergo psychiatric testing. Sydney\u2019s patchwork toll road network could be split into geographic zones under one idea being explored by the state government\u2019s toll road review that could see it pay compensation to a corporate tollway giant. Thanks for following along, we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Have a pleasant evening. \u2018This is about respect\u2019: Queensland parliament holds tense debate on gender Back to Queensland politics. There has been tense debate in state parliament today over laws that would allow Queenslanders to change the sex on their identification documents without having to undergo sex reassignment surgery. The legislation is expected to pass on Wednesday night, supported by Labor and the Greens, and opposed by the Liberal National party and Katter\u2019s Australian party. During the Labor MP Chris Whiting\u2019s speech, the deputy leader of the LNP, Jarrod Bleijie, interjected, saying: \u201cFeminine identity? It\u2019s blokes in a dress.\u201d Bleijie later contributed to the debate, labelling the bill \u201can attack on women\u201d. The LNP MP Amanda Camm, also opposed the laws, claiming \u201ca transwoman is \u2026 not a woman\u201d and that \u201ca female, by definition, is an adult female human being\u201d. The minister for women, Shannon Fentiman, said the Queensland government defines a woman as \u201csomeone who identifies as a woman\u201d. The youth justice minister, Di Farmer, apologised to the LGBTIQ+ people sitting in the gallery for the nature of the debate. \u201cI am sorry you had to hear that \u2026 This is about respect,\u201d she said. The Greens MP for Maiwar, Michael Berkman, spoke in support of the bill. He said a lack of accurate documentation \u201cprevents people from enrolling in school, getting a driver\u2019s licence, getting a job, opening a bank account, and applying for housing\u201d. Senator David Van issues statement on Thorpe claims David Van has just released a statement. He said: \u201cIn the Chamber today Senator Thorpe made unfounded and completely untrue allegations against me that I immediately and unequivocally denied and continue to deny.\u201d Van noted Lidia Thorpe delivered what he said were \u201coutrageous and reprehensible comments\u201d in the Senate chamber using parliamentary privilege. \u201cMy lawyers have written to her already making my position clear in the strongest possible terms,\u201d Van\u2019s statement said. In a statement, the former prime minister Scott Morrison\u2019s office says he doesn\u2019t remember any such allegation from Lidia Thorpe nor being involved in David Van moving offices. Morrison provided the statement after Thorpe\u2019s claim in the Senate that he removed Van from his office. In making her allegation of sexual assault against Van, which he vehemently denied and called a \u201clie\u201d, Thorpe claimed \u201cthe prime minister had to remove him from his office\u201d. In a response to Guardian Australia, a spokesperson for Morrison said: \u201cMr Morrison has no recollection of Lidia Thorpe ever making such an allegation to him personally or of any involvement in Senator Van moving offices.\u201d Queensland to pass laws to make it easier to change sex on identification documents Queenslanders will be able to change the sex on their identification documents without having to undergo sex reassignment surgery under new laws expected to pass in the state parliament on Wednesday. The bill will also allow two parents to register as either \u2018mother\u2019 or \u2018father\u2019 on a child\u2019s birth certificate. The attorney general, Yvette D\u2019Ath, said the laws were a win for the LGBTIQ+ community and would strengthen the legal recognition of transgender and gender-diverse people. \u201cThis bill will help reduce the distress, fear, discrimination and privacy violations that many people in our communities face on an all too frequent basis,\u201d she told parliament on Tuesday. The Liberal National party opposition along with Katter\u2019s Australian party and the independent MP Sandy Bolton will vote against the bill while Labor and the Greens will support it. The One Nation MP, Stephen Andrew, will be absent from parliament during the vote. Back to Lidia Thorpe\u2019s explosive claims in the Senate, we\u2019ve reached out to Thorpe, the Liberal senator David Van, former prime minister Scott Morrison and the Senate president, Sue Lines, for comment. Thorpe\u2019s office would not provide further detail on her claims, including when or where the alleged incident occurred; Van\u2019s office has said there will be a further statement imminently; we are waiting for a statement from Lines; and Morrison\u2019s office did not immediately reply. Van flatly and vehemently denied Thorpe\u2019s claims, which were made under parliamentary privilege. Lidia Thorpe\u2019s claims came during a Senate debate after question time, in a section called \u201cMotions to take note of answers\u201d \u2013 basically where senators discuss what happened in QT. That section, of course, saw the Coalition focus questions on Katy Gallagher about the Brittany Higgins matter. Several senators, including Anne Urquhart, Jana Stewart and David Van spoke afterward. Van was critical of Labor\u2019s prior questioning of Coalition members about the Higgins matter, critical of \u201cmuck\u201d he claimed Labor had \u201cthrown\u201d against Michaelia Cash and Linda Reynolds. Van spoke about parliamentarians \u201csetting the standard\u201d for Australia. Parliamentary microphones in the chamber did not pick up the detail of her words, but Thorpe can be heard interjecting on taped video of Van\u2019s speech. The acting Senate president, Andrew McLachlan, who was speaking to another senator at the time, asked Thorpe to stop interjecting and called for a \u201crespectful debate\u201d. Van then said \u201cdisgraceful, when I\u2019m trying to say these things\u201d, before going on to talk about sex discrimination commissioner Kate Jenkins\u2019 report. Thorpe continued interjecting, but her comments could not be heard clearly. Van called for a better \u201cdiscourse\u201d in the chamber \u2013 before Thorpe stood to make the explosive claims. McLachlan said he would refer the matter to the Senate president, Sue Lines, who was not in the chamber at the time. Van continued his contribution, saying he would \u201cutterly reject that disgusting statement outright. It is just a lie.\u201d McLachlan appeared to begin to ask Van to withdraw the term \u201clie\u201d, which is usually not accepted as parliamentary language. Van then withdrew the word \u201clie\u201d, adding \u201cit is just not true\u201d. Senator Lidia Thorpe has accused the Liberal senator David Van of sexual assault in the Senate. Van was speaking about the setting the standard report, when Thorpe made repeated interjections. Thorpe said: I\u2019m feeling really uncomfortable when a perpetrator is speaking about violence. I can\u2019t [withdraw], because this person harassed me, sexually assaulted me. And the prime minister had to remove him from his office. To have him talk about this today is an absolute disgrace. Van then stood to say: I utterly reject that statement, that disgusting statement outright. It is just a lie. And I reject it \u2026 it\u2019s just not true. The matter was referred to the Senate president. New Zealand and Fiji strike defence deal amid rising Pacific tensions New Zealand and Fiji have signed a defence agreement to strengthen military training and maritime security, that comes amid rising tensions over security in the region. The agreement, signed by New Zealand\u2019s defence minister, Andrew Little, and Fijian minister for home affairs and immigration, Pio Tikoduadua, in Suva on Wednesday, sets a legal framework for military cooperation between the two countries in each other\u2019s territories. The agreement will also address disaster and humanitarian response coordination, and the challenges of climate change. Little said the deal \u201creflects the value New Zealand places on our relationship with Fiji\u201d adding it was important for the two militaries to work together more effectively. It comes as the US, New Zealand and Australia push to build stronger security ties with Pacific nations, as they attempt to offer an alternative to China\u2019s growing influence in the region. Last month the US and Papua New Guinea signed a defence and maritime cooperation agreement.

The county court judge Duncan Allen expressed shock that Aaron Baslangic never tried to cover his tracks, had no grand plans about what to do with the funds and most of it was left languishing in a bank account until he was caught. As a finance executive at Coles Online, Baslangic could authorise payments up to $75,000 and in early 2019 orchestrated 14 illegal payments. Read more: Childcares forced to cap enrolments as staff shortages continue More than half of childcare centres across Australia have been forced to cap enrolments, new research shows, as severe workforce shortages continue to hit the sector. That\u2019s according to a new Australian Childcare Alliance national survey released on Tuesday, which found the majority of providers were being forced to cap enrolments this year as they didn\u2019t have enough staff to meet the legal ratio of educators to children. Across a single week in February 2023, more than two-thirds of the 627 centres surveyed confirmed enrolments that week had been capped, equating to 16,300 places. A second survey of 442 centres in May found more than half capped enrolments for the same reasons. The ACA president, Paul Mondo, said staff shortages were the single most pressing issue facing Australia\u2019s early learning sector. Right now, we urgently need at least 10,000 well-trained, competent early childhood educators and teachers to fill vacancies. We simply do not have enough people to meet the demand for early learning and care, whilst also remaining compliant with the educator-ratios put in place to ensure the safety and wellbeing of children and staff alike. Mondo called on the federal government to increase wages in the sector in order to attract workers, which Labor did for aged care in the latest budget. The move has been backed by unions, who are calling for a 25% pay jump. Elias Visontay is going to take you through the rest of the afternoon while I work on a couple of other projects. Thank you to everyone who joined in another rough day. We have one more day of the full sitting (the Senate is sitting on Friday) and then another week before the winter break, so let\u2019s hope that things improve a little. For all our sakes. Stay tuned for the news that comes through the afternoon and I will be back tomorrow morning for day three. As always \u2013 please, take care of you. Young Australians join crossbench MPs in renewed push to lower voting age to 16 Young Australians have joined crossbench MPs in calling for the voting age to be lowered to 16. On Tuesday, members of the Make It 16 group met with Greens MP Stephen Bates, Independent MP for Kooyong Dr Monique Ryan and Independent MP for Clark Andrew Wilkie at Parliament House to launch the first youth-led national campaign to lower the voting age. Co-founder and year 11 student Archie Coppola said 16 and 17-year-olds could already drive, move out of home and work, and wanted a say in \u201cgovernment decisions that affect our lives and futures\u201d. We want politicians to stop ignoring us simply because we are excluded from voting in federal elections. Lowering the voting age and including more engaged, young voices in elections will only strengthen our democracy, and help our elected representatives to make better decisions. The ABS estimates there are about 610,000 16 and 17-year-olds living in Australia. Countries including Austria, Argentina, Brazil, Malta, Scotland and Wales have already lowered the voting age to 16, with New Zealand, Canada and Germany poised follow. The Make It 16 campaign, led by 16 young people across Australia aged between 14 and 19, follows a commitment from Ryan and the Greens to renew a push for the age to be lowered. A little earlier in the senate, Labor senator Anne Urquhart gave a short statement about the \u201clong term\u201d impacts of the political attacks from the opposition. She becomes emotional as she says that women are telling advocates they are less likely to come forward because of the on-going treatment of Brittany Higgins. Urquhart says Higgins has the right to not have her name \u201cdrawn through the mud here, every single day\u201d. She knew that when she came forward that she would become a political target, but she did it in any way because she was determined to change the culture in this building. And Senator Gallagher, as the Minister for Women has done more than any other Minister for Women in the last 10 years to make sure that people are protected in this building and to make it a healthier and a safer place for women. So let\u2019s think about that. And we we should be concerned about the long term impacts that these actions your actions are taking. Senator Gallagher \u2013 over and over and over has said she has been contacted by women\u2019s organisations about the effect on those women to now have the courage to stand up and to speak out. That is not what this country is about. This is not what this government is about. We want those women to stand up. We want them to speak out, and we want them to get help. What this says is how they will be treated in this country if they do. So I would say be responsible and consider your actions. Because those bare huge responsibilities. And we don\u2019t want women to hide in the corner and not speak out about these issues. For too many years, that has happened And it\u2019s time it\u2019s stopped. And the actions of what is happening from that side every single day is not going to help that. We want those women to stand up and feel safe. Senator Gallagher is one of the best minister for Women and is helping women to stand up and speak out. And what you\u2019re doing is continually putting a lid on them and telling them to shut up. Negotiations on the housing fund seem to be going really, really well. If you are looking for a distraction from the news of the day, while wanting to understand what\u2019s going on with inflation, this piece from John Quiggin can help: Question time ends Anthony Albanese ends question time and Milton Dick acknowledges some more mayors and councillors in the gallery. He adds in that LNP MP Phil Thompson\u2019s mother is in the gallery too, and there is a cheer. The house moves on to the matter of public importance, which Angus Taylor is leading. \u201cGo get them, chicken wing,\u201d his colleague Andrew Hastie says as he steps up to the dispatch box. MPs. They are just like you. Government continuing to work on whistleblower reforms, says Dreyfus Helen Haines asks Mark Dreyfus: The national anti-corruption commission will commence in less than three weeks\u2019 time. In November you said that the Public Interest Disclosure Act would ensure stronger whistleblower protections are in place, before the Nacc opens its doors. [It has not been put in place.] Why not? The attorney general: I thank the Member for Indi for her question and her longstanding interest in whistleblower and integrity reforms. The Albanese government is committed to strengthening Australia\u2019s whistleblower framework and that is why we introduced, last year, the Public Interest Disclosure Act review bill 2022 into the parliament. This bill will improve protections for public sector whistleblowers, and will enhance the oversight of the scheme by the ombudsman and inspector general of intelligence and security. Regrettably, the Greens party delayed these vital whistleblower reforms in previous sittings, ensuring that the bill did not become law a month ago [and was] stranded in the Senate as a result of days of filibustering [by] the Greens part. Despite this, the government is continuing to work on delivering long overdue reforms to the Public Interest Disclosure Act to improve Australia\u2019s framework for the public sector which is the member\u2019s question indicates, will of the national anti-corruption commission. Dreyfus adds that the anti-corruption commission will start work soon, and then says: I will just add this: that following passage for these amendments, the government will commence consultations on a second stage of whistleblower reforms, and this will involve drafting the Public Interest Disclosure Act [to show] the underlying complicity of the scheme and give accessible teachings to public sector whistleblowers. PM accuses opposition of \u2018lack of transparency\u2019 Anthony Albanese continues: I am asked about transparency. Senator [Linda] Reynolds said this that evening: \u2018Senators [Penny] Wong, [Katy] Gallagher and I had a respectful discussion during dinner break, and assured me that they were not [involved] in that matter becoming public. I accept their assurance, thank you.\u2019 \u2026 Clearly, at the time \u2026 Senator Gallagher had a clear discussion, a clear discussion with Senator Reynolds and told Senator Reynolds exactly what she knew \u2026 and you can\u2019t be clearer. And compare that with the lack of transparency opposite. With the former PM, he could have asked his staff at any time. Instead he asked his former chief of staff and then secretary, the review was suspended twice on the 25 May 2021, they told estimates this report will be completed as soon as possible, I think it will be weeks not days but not months. It was three months passed. Until then, the [Gaetjens] review was suspended. He runs out of time. Paul Karp hears Sussan Ley say: So has the senator been transparent or not? Put your [cheat] sheet to one side, has she been transparent or not? (Because Albanese was reading from a piece of paper.) Sussan Ley presses PM on Katy Gallagher Sussan Ley, (wearing white, the colour associated with suffragettes and the colour Brittany Higgins wore when she addressed the Women\u2019s March for Justice) asks Anthony Albanese: On Saturday, Senator Katy Gallagher stated to serious allegations that she was not aware of the following allegations that were made public when the interviews went to air. This is not true. She had in fact received a copy of the interview four days before it went to air. How is this consistent with the prime minister\u2019s statement yesterday that Katy Gallagher has been transparent in relation this matter? Albanese: On cue. What is suggested by those opposite is that Labor is to blame for what is a serious sexual assault allegation. By a Liberal staffer. About another Liberal staffer, in a Liberal minister\u2019s office, metres away from the Liberal prime minister\u2019s office. \u2026 Mr Speaker, Senator [Linda] Reynolds said on the night referred to in 2021, said this. \u2018I was told by one of your senators two weeks before about what you are intending to do with the story in my office\u2019. Two weeks before. [The] senator was accused of having information weeks in advance and setting up the story. They did not. That is how they responded. Ley has gotten to her feet to make a point of order on relevance. Milton Dick says the prime minister is being relevant. Chris Bowen is taking a dixer and someone \u2013 I think it is Ted O\u2019Brien, his shadow minister \u2013 is yelling SO LOUD it is coming up on the TV broadcast. Bowen makes reference to \u201cinterjections from the peanut gallery\u201d, which he is made to withdraw as unparliamentary. O\u2019Brien is warned. Milton Dick rules this question from Sussan Ley out of order: My question is to the minister for the environment and I refer to the minister\u2019s answers yesterday in question time when she said \u201cI 100% stand by what I said on Monday and 100% stand by what I have done at every stage with respect to allegations aired on The Project.\u201d When did the minister first become aware of these allegations? There was a long back and forth about that and what was allowed and what wasn\u2019t. The end of the question is not in order because it relates to a previous parliament is the general gist. Paul Karp hears the opposition heckling: Garth Hamilton, the LNP MP for Groom, says \u201cwhat are you hiding\u201d, while the Liberal MP Tony Pasin yells \u201cI reckon Sharri [presumably he means Markson] might know\u201d. In the Senate, the Coalition is now asking about Katy Gallagher\u2019s links to Brittany Higgins\u2019s partner, David Sharaz. Labor senators are shaking their heads, clearly upset and angry at this line of questioning. Penny Wong is asking the opposition to reflect on whether this is an \u201cethical\u201d line of questioning. The Liberal senator Sarah Henderson refers to some of the leaked texts between Higgins and Sharaz, where he described Gallagher as a \u201cfriend\u201d. She asks several questions about the texts, and reports that Gallagher was invited to Sharaz\u2019s first wedding. Gallagher says she was invited to a lot of events, and in this case, she did not recall being invited until it was reported \u2013 but said that, after checking, she had declined that invitation. She also says: I\u2019m not responsible for how people describe their relationship with me. The government and opposition Senate leaders, Wong and Simon Birmingham, debate about whether the questions should even be allowed. Wong refers to the fact the texts were private, from \u201can alleged survivor\u201d, and asks the opposition to reflect on if this is an ethical line of questioning. Labor senator Murray Watt could be heard asking: Do you think this is a good idea? Gallagher goes on to answer that she hadn\u2019t ever invited Sharaz to a personal event or celebration. Clare O\u2019Neil takes a swipe at Peter Dutton in her answer: I can understand why those opposite don\u2019t want to have their record questioned. I can particularly say, for the opposition leader, he has represented himself as a tough guy. We have had no cybersecurity minister under the previous government. The opposition leader was home affairs minister for much of the time in government. This national security matter is in a mess and there is nobody more responsible for that mess than the opposition leader. This has had consequences for our country. Peter Dutton then says the parliament is in agreement on the importance of cybersecurity and needs a grown-up response. Once he sits down he calls out to O\u2019Neil \u201cyou\u2019re an amateur\u201d (Paul Karp is in the chamber and hears him). Milton Dick is over it. The leader of the opposition just cannot be slamming people across the chamber. He says question time is meant to be a time of decorum. No one says \u2018since when\u2019 but you know they are thinking it. More precious minutes of our lives are wasted as Paul Fletcher objects to a government dixer question. Not because dixers are a time waster (which they are) but because the question includes: How is the Albanese Labor government fixing the patchwork of policies and poorly implemented cybersecurity measures left behind by the previous government? Fletcher thinks that goes against Milton Dick\u2019s ruling that questions can only be about current government issues from yesterday. Tony Burke fails to hold back his exasperation as he points out that the question is what the government is doing now, and that some reflection on why it has to do that is allowed and normal. Fletcher disagrees. Burke disagrees with Fletcher\u2019s disagreement. Dick says he will listen to the answer, but some reflection is fine. Clare O\u2019Neil is allowed to answer the question. Peter Dutton asks Anthony Albanese: Yesterday the minister for finance stated that she did not communicate to the member for Grayndler or anyone his office any aspect of information she had received concerning an alleged sexual assault prior to 15 February 2021. Prime minister, did the minister for finance mislead the Senate? There are some immediate interjections and heckles from the opposition benches as Albanese gets to his feet, and Speaker Milton Dick shuts it down. Albanese then answers: No. (That is the whole answer.) Barnaby Joyce makes what Tony Burke says is an unparliamentary comment during an answer Tanya Plibersek is delivering, and asks him to withdraw it. Joyce does, although it seems reluctantly. We did not hear the comment. Mark Butler takes another question on the dispensing changes to 300 medicines, which will see pharmacists lose handling and dispensing fees (the government has promised to reinvest the money into community pharmacies but will not back away from the cost-saving measure for patients), and David Littleproud gets so worked up he gets booted from the chamber. Liberal Marise Payne is next, asking about Gallagher\u2019s statements yesterday that she wouldn\u2019t talk about the information she may have received from Brittany Higgins and partner David Sharaz because it was received with the understanding it would remain confidential. Gallagher says: It wasn\u2019t my story. It was Ms Higgins\u2019s story. I don\u2019t intend to breach that confidence now, and I didn\u2019t then. Gallagher says she has been contacted by multiple women in the last day who are \u201cextremely concerned with how this discussion is occurring\u201d. Gallagher goes on to say that she only received information from Higgins and Sharaz, denying she ever heard anything from The Project or representatives. The Senate president, Labor\u2019s Sue Lines, has at several points called for order and demanded senators stop interrupting. Several Coalition senators could be heard calling out across the chamber to Gallagher, yelling \u201chypocrite\u201d. \u201cWhat about the consideration you had for Senator Reynolds. None,\u201d yells one Coalition senator we couldn\u2019t identify. Coalition scrutiny on Katy Gallagher continues in Senate The Coalition\u2019s scrutiny on Katy Gallagher continues in the Senate, as several opposition senators yell \u201chypocrite\u201d across the chamber. The chamber is quite unruly and tense. Before her time runs out in one answer, Gallagher says: This chamber should think about how this debate and the ongoing coverage of it is impacting on all the women out there, who we are with one mouth saying \u2018stand up and we will support you\u2019, and with the other tongue, if you dare to do it ... The shadow attorney general, Michaelia Cash, begins by asking Gallagher about the settlement payment given to Brittany Higgins (she has long said she had no involvement in the process, which was commenced under the former Coalition government). Gallagher responds that \u201cit never came to me ... it never crossed my desk, I never got a brief\u201d, saying she would have listed a conflict of interest if it had. Gallagher then takes a dixer from a Labor colleague on the budget and the government\u2019s economic management. Anthony Albanese speaks on Labor\u2019s housing fund and then, as it so often has in this debate, turns personal with Max Chandler-Mather. The member has never seen a housing development that he wants to support, that he wants to support. If you look at the member\u2019s website, it currently hosts at least three separate petitions against housing! Against housing supply! He opposes 855 new homes including apartments, townhouses and detached townhouses on a 20-hectare site for over 2,000 extra residents. This is what he has to say. \u2018I also have significant concerns over what 2,000 extra residents will do for traffic.\u2019 He opposes new homes for another 960 residents. In another petition, he is opposing turning a vacant block of land into a retirement village \u2026 So do not come in here and say you support housing when you will not support any in your own electorate and when you are opposing 30,000 new, additional, social and audible housing units including 4,000 designated for women and children escaping domestic violence. No rent freeze, PM tells Greens MP Max Chandler-Mather has the first of the crossbench questions and it looks like the gloves are off when it comes to the Greens as well. Chandler-Mather makes note of Anthony Albanese\u2019s comments that rent freezes would be \u2018absurd\u2019 and asks the prime minister was it absurd when he coordinated with the states to lower energy prices \u2013 as well as when the ACT Labor-Greens government put in rent controls. When will he finally act on rent increases and freeze rent increases in the states? Albanese jumps right in on this: I say to the member for Griffith that he is a member of the House of Representatives and in our federated structure, there is commonwealth government, state government and local government, and state governments have controls over housing issues. The matter that he refers to once again is disingenuous. There is no rent freeze in the ACT, none. There is no rent freeze in the ACT. There is no rent freeze in the ACT. There is not a jurisdiction in the ACT that has done that. Chandler-Mather yells out: \u201cI said rent controls.\u201d PM: There is no rent freeze in the ACT. Chandler-Mather: \u201cI said rent controls!\u201d Ahhh yes \u2013 Scott Morrison is very likely in the UK or on his way to the UK. He announced he was headed to the UK to \u2018promote Aukus bipartisanship\u2019. How lovely that it coincides with Boris Johnson\u2019s latest woes \u2013 always nice to have friends around when you\u2019re feeling low. Morrison announced: The trip to the UK is privately funded with flights and accommodation provided by the International Democratic Union. Mr Morrison is an honorary member of the IDU strategic advisory board. Declarations regarding these arrangements will be made, as usual, on Mr Morrison\u2019s Register of Interest in due course, as required by the Parliament. Due to these commitments in the UK, Mr Morrison will be absent from the Parliament from June 15-22. Following his formal visit to the UK, Mr Morrison will be taking some time to spend with his family, who will accompany him to the UK, on a private vacation overseas, during the parliamentary break and school holiday period. Anthony Albanese continues: He went on to say, maybe Angus does not go shopping much because we know inflation is bad and grocery prices are up but he should have seen that question prepared by his staff. He went on about the figures. And questioned it. We know before, what he said about his staff. Remember the Clover Moore incident? Always the staff. And so, clearly, the thing is after speaking to the shadow cabinet, bringing out the shadow treasurer. The thing is, this is one of a number of gaffes, Mr Speaker. How can you tell there is a gaffe coming? Because he opens his mouth. This answer is a little bit of a surprise because in the last parliament sitting, Labor had decided not to go there with Angus Taylor, and not just because he was on leave because of a family issue, but because of the attempt at a \u2018gentler parliament\u2019. But given the opposition\u2019s attacks it seems like that has now gone out the window. And it is once again open slather. Taylor slings interest rate question at PM Angus Taylor and his sling asks Anthony Albanese: The budget highlighted the expectation that interest rates would stay at 3.8% until early 2024 and then fall. Following an 11th rate rise under this government, rates are now at 4.1%. Prime minister, why did the budget fail within a month? Jim Chalmers and Taylor then start debating each other across the chamber: Chalmers: \u201cIt was the average of the market\u201d (expectations of interest rates). Taylor: \u201cBut why did you highlight it? You knew it was in the budget\u201d (references page number). Albanese: You can\u2019t trust anything [the member says]. When you look at what the budget papers actually say, the budget papers actually say that in the question that is reflected by the shadow treasurer it refers to what expectations are by economists. It is not a Treasury document \u2026 Because we know that this is something that just doesn\u2019t exist. It just doesn\u2019t exist. But the last time I got a question, of course, from the shadow treasurer, he stood up here and he said: I question the prime minister. UBS data shows in the last month alone the price of Vegemite has increased by 8%. Peanut butter by 9%. And yoghurt has increased by 12%. He went on about all this. And then he went on; Australians love Vegemite, it is up 8%. Not in a year, in a month. He doubled down. Of course, Andrew Clennell of Sky News, and I always watch Sky News \u2013 those opposite would have seen this for sure. For sure. He went on to say that I have got a shadow cabinet leak. And that is Angus Taylor yesterday was castigating his shadow cabinet ministers. (There are so many interjections there is a general warning for the house.) Taylor tries to bring a point of order on relevance, but Speaker Milton Dick says Albanese is being relevant, so Albanese continues: I am certainly speaking about \u2013 they are not happy little Vegemites over there, Mr Speaker. They are not happy little Vegemites. I can\u2019t see Scott Morrison in the chamber, so it seems like the former prime minister is missing this question time. Angus Taylor is back though, with his arm in a sling. We are straight into question time today and Queenslanders are once again the flavour of the day with the Herbert MP, Phil Thompson, getting the first question. It\u2019s almost like there is a byelection in Queensland coming up? Thompson wants to know: Despite the promise to cut power bills, the Albanese government has had 12 months and two budgets to fulfil this promise but has failed to do so. With small businesses struggling and Australian families having to find an extra $22,000 each year to service their mortgage let alone pay electricity bills, when will the prime minister take responsibility for the growing cost-of-living crisis? (Insert line about the promise being for 2025.) Anthony Albanese switches up his answer (after including the line that Thompson voted against the energy price relief) to include a little Queensland flavour: I can imagine people in Queensland today, giving a big shoutout to the Palaszczuk government. He goes on to talk about the energy rebates the Queensland government announced which will see some pensioners\u2019 electricity bills reduced to zero (there is a $550 rebate \u2013 Queensland still owns the poles and wires). Albanese: I am sure that when the member for Herbert returns to Townsville on the weekend, what he will see, he will be able to talk about it. He will be able to say, sorry constituents that I voted against energy price relief. Albanese then goes on about surpluses. Moving to the chamber and the Labor MP Graham Perrett is using his 90-second statement to pay tribute to one of his favourite authors \u2013 Cormac McCarthy. He recommends those who have not yet read him to find a sunny spot and wait until they are feeling ready \u2013 and then dive in. We are now in the downhill slide into question time. Don\u2019t expect the opposition to stray too much from what we saw yesterday. The Reserve Bank hasn\u2019t had the best couple of years \u2013 not least because of mistakes like forecasting in late 2021 that the official interest rate wouldn\u2019t rise until 2024. And, of course, there was the fairly critical RBA Review which recommended splitting its roles, plus an unnerving habit of regularly surprising most pundits and investors by hiking those rates. Now there\u2019s another straw to add to that overloaded dromedary. After a review of its \u201cmore complex remuneration arrangements\u201d by PwC (a firm not in Governor Philip Lowe\u2019s \u2013 or anyone\u2019s \u2013 good books), the RBA has concluded 1,173 current and former impacted employees were short-changed \u201caround $1.15m\u201d. \u201cMost of the payments relate to the calculation of termination benefits payable to former employees,\u201d the bank said, adding all affected people had been notified and monies were flowing. On the scale of recent underpayment announcements \u2013 eg BHP\u2019s $430m \u2013 the amount is not huge. It\u2019s also only a tad more than Lowe\u2019s annual compensation of about $1.04m (at least in 2022). Still, with many mortgage holders slashing spending to meet soaring debt repayments, penny-pinching (literally) by the central bank is not a great look. The environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, says the Coalition\u2019s position on the nature repair bills is at odds with groups like the National Farmers Federation, the Northern Land Council, Farmers for Climate Action and Landcare. She says the bill has broad support from land owners and she hopes common ground can be found once the Senate committee concludes its review: The Nationals claim to support people who live on the land. By changing their mind and withdrawing support, they\u2019re preventing farmers from getting rewarded for looking after their land. The legislation is also opposed by the Greens who want the government to focus on improving environmental protections, ending habitat clearing and boosting government funding for the environment. Environment groups who have made submissions to the inquiry have raised their concerns about the government\u2019s plan to allow certificates in the proposed market to be traded as offsets for other habitat destruction. Tim Beshara of the Wilderness Society says the legislation appears to have \u201chit a brick wall\u201d. Given this, the Albanese government should return their focus to what we know works \u2026 Repairing nature is primarily the responsibility of the government. It should not, and cannot, ever be effectively outsourced to the private sector. Coalition backs away from supporting Labor\u2019s nature repair market The Albanese government\u2019s legislation to establish a nature repair market appears to be facing hurdles, with the Coalition signalling it has reversed its earlier support for the bills. The government wants to establish a market that would allow for the trade of certificates attached to projects that protect and restore nature. A similar scheme was proposed by the previous government but focused on rewarding farmers who undertook improvements for biodiversity on their properties. It has previously been reported the Coalition would back Labor\u2019s scheme, which is broader and would apply to all land tenure types, as well as to coastal and marine areas. But Liberal and National party MPs told a debate in the lower house on Tuesday night they have concerns about the legislation. The National party leader, David Littleproud, said the Nationals were \u201cunable to support the Nature Repair Market Bill 2023 and the associated legislation\u201d. He said while the party still believed there was a place for a biodiversity market, the bill had \u201cdiverged far too far\u201d from the earlier Coalition proposal: Disappointingly, this government has let their ideology take away the practical reality and the safeguards that are required for Australian agriculture and farming families in regional communities. The Liberal MP and opposition climate and energy spokesman, Ted O\u2019Brien, told the parliament the Coalition would reserve its position until a Senate inquiry examining the bills had concluded. In principle, at this point, and in keeping with all the work we have previously done in this area, the Coalition cannot support the passage of either of these bills. There are too many gaps. There is too much missing detail. What needs to be done to attract more GPs to the job? The AMA president says it needs to be a holistic approach: We have to say we value it and I think one of the messages that successive governments have delivered to GPs is: \u2018We don\u2019t value you.\u2019 I think people want to be part of a team that\u2019s valued. That includes a funding model that isn\u2019t about churn \u2013 but one where people can make a living while also spending time with patients. AMA chief recalls his worries about bringing Covid home Is there a trauma element to what healthcare workers have been through, particularly from before there were Covid vaccines and they were worried about bringing the virus to their homes and families? Prof Steve Robson says: Many people in healthcare experienced this moral injury from the peak of the pandemic and I had exactly the same thing. I have young children here, and I probably remember we had discussions at home. If I came home from working should I actually stay downstairs? We\u2019ve got bit of a granny flat area, dump my clothes at the door, stay there, and keep away from the family before vaccines when we were seeing images \u2013 I\u2019m sure the kids were happy not snooping around, so it was not all downside for them, but it was a big thing for the family. I think that\u2019s a thing that people \u2013 at nursing school, medical school or whatever \u2013 never envisioned having to deal with and I think it affects how you see your profession, what you want to do and whether you want to work part-time. It\u2019s really big issues and it\u2019s great to hear someone acknowledge that from the workforce perspective. Dutton says Higgins questions only seek to hold government to account The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, has been grilled about the Coalition\u2019s handling of Brittany Higgins\u2019s allegation in parliament this week at a Local Government Association conference. Dutton said: I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a view you expressed last year when the government asked something like 45 questions in parliament in relation to the same issue. We have a system of legal practice in our country, that is a very important principle in relation to the way in which courts operate. I share the view in relation to leaking of the information published in the papers, the matter, as the attorney general pointed out yesterday, has been referred to AFP for investigation. Dutton said he takes sexual assault \u201cvery seriously\u201d and that someone accused of the crime should be tried by judge and jury with \u201cguilt found according to our system of law\u201d which \u201cshouldn\u2019t be subverted by any process\u201d. He said: In terms of our questioning of the government, a key democratic element of our system of government in a Westminster system is to hold the government to account. The questions we\u2019re asking at the moment in relation to whether the government conspired to seek political advantage out of an alleged sexual assault is absolutely reasonable for us to ask in QT. It doesn\u2019t demean the allegation of sexual assault, doesn\u2019t seek to second-guess the court process that has taken place in ACT. It doesn\u2019t seek [to prove] innocence or guilt of any party in this matter, it seeks to hold the government to account for their [handling]. Bruce Lehrmann was charged with the alleged sexual assault of Higgins but vehemently denied the allegations and maintained his innocence. An initial trial was aborted last year due to jury misconduct and prosecutors dropped the charges against Lehrmann amid concerns about the impact a second trial could have on Higgins\u2019s mental health. Covid has led to burnout and stress in health workforce, AMA chief says What is the state of Australia\u2019s hospital wards, given what healthcare workers have gone through during the pandemic? Prof Steve Robson talks about hearing a piece on ABC Classic that a composer created, about health workers going home after a shift on a Covid ward during the pandemic. And he says it made him very emotional: It was a beautiful guitar piece and it actually made me emotional because I remember what things were like at the peak of the pandemic. Now, I\u2019m a pretty resilient person. I can only imagine what all of my colleagues, whether they are nurses, whether they\u2019re doctors, whoever it is working in our public hospitals, the fact that you cannot have been through that and not have both had a sense of exhaustion, that to me makes me emotional, down the track listening to a piece of guitar music because that\u2019s what it\u2019s about. But it made many, many of my colleagues question, \u201cIs this really the right thing for me?\u201d I don\u2019t think anyone when they trained really knew they\u2019d be training into a pandemic and what that would mean. In many cases the resource sacrifices that they\u2019d need to make and I think we have seen this reflected in the health workforce. A lot of people have moved out of health. We have seen high levels of burnout and stress in the health workforce, so I think it has ongoing implications moving forward. Surge in private health insurance a \u2018mirage\u2019, says AMA president The AMA president said private health insurance is not the answer to the country\u2019s health funding woes: A couple of years ago we were very fearful that the uptake of health insurance was in a death spiral, but as our public hospitals have continued to struggle with an unprecedented backlog, many Australians have begun to take out private health insurance again as they face years of waiting for care in our public hospitals. I believe the apparent surge in private health insurance uptake is going to prove to be a mirage. I think many, many people will fulfil their waiting times, have their procedures and then relinquish their private insurance again. If you look at the drivers of uptake, many young Australians take up private health insurance for two main reasons. Mental health and maternity care. But we are seeing private psychiatric and maternity hospitals closing around the country, so for people who took out health insurance for these reasons it is going to look like fool\u2019s gold. AMA president spruiks benefits of health investment Back to the press club for a moment, AMA president Prof Stephen Robson says health investment has wider impacts than just looking after people\u2019s health \u2013 it looks after societies\u201d. The impact that health has on people\u2019s lives is the essence of what I\u2019m talking about here today with you. That investing in health is not only good economic policy but investments in health can make a huge difference to the wellbeing of Australians. We\u2019re now in the fourth year of a global pandemic, Covid-19 is the third most common reason that Australians die. 20,000 more Australians died in 2022 than we\u2019d expect to have died had there not been a pandemic. And the pandemic has also shown us just how important health is to our economy, both here and overseas. Covid has had an extraordinary impact on our communities and our healthcare system and particularly our healthcare workforce. And the pandemic has also demonstrated something quite remarkable. That with the collective will of government, the community and healthcare professions, quick and innovative solutions backed by investment, are actually possible. The home affairs minister, Clare O\u2019Neil, has responded to the high court quashing her decision to refuse a convicted people smuggler a visa. O\u2019Neil said: I am aware of today\u2019s decision by the High Court and I am considering its implications. I can confirm I refused an application for a Safe Haven Enterprise visa on national interest grounds. The visa applicant has previously been convicted of a people smuggling offence. I will not be commenting further on the circumstances of the matter.\u201d The national press club address today will be given by AMA president, Prof Steve Robson. You\u2019ll be hearing a lot about Medicare. And also what needs to be done given a health system in crisis, including GPs. We\u2019ll bring you bits and pieces from the speech and the Q&amp;A. South Australian budget goes into the red For those wondering how the South Australian budget is going, AAP has an update: The South Australian government has rolled out more budget spending on health despite a significant deterioration in the state\u2019s finances during the past six months. Thursday\u2019s financial blueprint will reveal a plunge into the red of $249 million for 2022-23 after the government predicted a $203m surplus in the December mid-year budget review. The reversal of fortune follows increased spending on health, the impact of summer\u2019s flooding down the Murray and lower-than-expected GST returns. Treasurer Stephen Mullighan says he still expects a budget surplus in 2023-24 with the details to be outlined with the release of the budget papers. He says the government will continue to focus on health spending as well as helping combat the housing crisis and relieve cost-of-living pressures. The treasurer has also pledged to honour Labor\u2019s promise of no new or increased taxes: The last thing we want to see is what Victoria has done and that is embark on really significant increases in expenditure and then eight years later realise they\u2019ve got to start rapidly increasing the tax burden on their community. The Local Government Association is in town, which means there are a lot of mayors and councillors in Canberra. Peter Dutton addressed the conference today, and was asked this question by a member of the crowd: Economic conditions worsening, index finds Following on the heels of yesterday\u2019s surveys showing consumer and business confidence was falling, here is another index showing much the same thing. As AAP reports: Consumer confidence has sunk to another post-pandemic low following the 12th interest rate rise in 13 months. Morale has been low for several months in response to cost of living pressures and interest rate hikes and has now fallen to its lowest level since the Covid-19 lockdowns sent confidence levels plummeting in April 2020. The ANZ and Roy Morgan\u2019s weekly index fell 3.1 points over the week, led by solid falls in current and future economic conditions. The \u201ccurrent economic conditions\u201d indicator fell 3.5 points and \u201cfuture economic conditions\u201d sunk 3.1 points. ANZ senior economist Adelaide Timbrell said: Confidence fell among renters, outright owners and those paying off their homes, though those paying off their homes fell to a record low The poor result follows another interest rate rise in June and posturing from the Reserve Bank suggesting there is more tightening to come. The 25 basis point hike in June brought the official cash rate to 4.1%. Also in the high court this morning, the commonwealth lost a case defending the home affairs minister, Clare O\u2019Neil\u2019s, decision to refuse a convicted people smuggler a protection visa. The plaintiff is an Iranian Christian man to whom Australia owes protection obligations due to his fear of religious persecution but both Peter Dutton and O\u2019Neil denied him a visa on the grounds that granting one would be against the national interest. The man arrived by boat without a visa in December 2013. He was charged and pleaded guilty to aggravated people smuggling, and was sentenced to eight years in prison (four without parole) in October 2017. The New South Wales district court judge had found the man was motivated by desperation to be reunited with his family, who had arrived in Australia in 2012 and received protection visas, not by a financial motive, and was unlikely to reoffend. In June, O\u2019Neil rejected his application for a safe haven enterprise visa, finding \u201cthe importance of protecting and safeguarding Australia\u2019s territorial and border integrity\u201d meant it was not in the national interest. All other criteria for the visa were satisfied. On Wednesday a majority of four justices of the high court quashed the decision to refuse the man\u2019s visa application. Their reasoning was that \u201cnational interest\u201d considerations are \u201cnot intended to be a trump card for the minister\u201d where the applicant otherwise meets requirements. They said the government\u2019s interpretation would \u201cleave the assessment of whether it is in the national interest for a person who is found to be a refugee to be refused a protection visa to the subjective evaluation of the minister or a delegate on a case\u2011by-case basis, unconstrained by any of the other provisions that govern the decision to grant or refuse a protection visa\u201d. O\u2019Neil now has 14 days to determine the application in accordance with the law. Dutton to give speech at IPA The IPA has announced that Peter Dutton will deliver a keynote address to members at the Institute of Public Affairs on 7 July. IPA deputy executive director Daniel Wild said Dutton was providing the nation leadership: Over recent months, Peter Dutton has drawn a sharper distinction between the opposition and the government on key policy issues facing mainstream Australia, such as the Voice, energy, education, and migration, which has kickstarted debates Australia needs to have. Inquiry into unpaid care work announced The house has set up an inquiry into the recognition of unpaid care work. Labor MP Peta Murphyis chairing the committee and said: This inquiry will examine the effectiveness of the Act in acknowledging and raising awareness of the important role of unpaid carers in Australian society, and will consider if legislative reform is needed. The committee wants to hear from individual unpaid carers, carers\u2019 representatives and advocacy organisations so it can make meaningful recommendations to government. The committee is seeking written submissions, ideally of no more than 10 pages, on the inquiry terms of reference by Friday, 11 August 2023. The inquiry is not considering the adequacy of payments for carers. Paul Karp has reported that Bridget Archer has joined Andrew Bragg\u2019s call for an inquiry into how Brittany Higgins\u2019 text messages were leaked: Liberals Andrew Bragg and Bridget Archer have broken ranks to call for an inquiry into how Brittany Higgins\u2019 text messages were leaked, with Bragg labelling debate in the Senate where the Coalition is pursuing Katy Gallagher \u201cvery ugly\u201d. The pair made the call after the finance minister denied misleading the Senate about her knowledge of Higgins\u2019 allegation before it aired and Network Ten asked the Australian federal police to investigate how Higgins\u2019 texts became public. Gallagher told Senate estimates in June 2021 that \u201cno one had any knowledge\u201d of Higgins\u2019 allegation before it was aired. That comment has been called into question by text exchanges between Higgins and her partner, David Sharaz, published by the Australian newspaper. Albanese, Nathan, Nat and Shaun at the Lodge Anthony Albanese has spoken to Perth radio Nova Breakfast hosts Nathan, Nat and Shaun this morning \u2013 because he invited the trio over to the Lodge for dinner, and then carried out the stunt. Apparently they found some \u201creal humanity\u201d at the Lodge, but there is a \u201creal uncomfortable\u201d couch in the sitting room that has been there since the 1950s. That\u2019s pretty much the whole point of the interview \u2013 talking about their dinner at the Lodge. Just another day in Australian politics where FM radio hosts get to invite themselves over for dinner at the prime minister\u2019s taxpayer funded Canberra residence and then have a good laugh about it the next day on radio. (This is on the back of Albanese also attending FM radio host Kyle Sandilands\u2019 wedding because he had told him he would. On his FM radio show) Crossbench wants citizens\u2019 assembly on housing Crossbench MPs are coming together to ask for \u201ca new way of dealing with housing\u201d, proposing a citizens\u2019 assembly of housing affordability. The joint statement explains: The Citizens\u2019 Assembly of Housing Affordability would bring together 100 randomly selected but carefully balanced ordinary Australians including renters, buyers, owners, mortgage holders, investors, rural, urban, regional, young, old, men and women, to examine the evidence, question experts, and develop a consensus for future policy that reflects the needs of everyone. Housing affordability has proved to be an intractable problem for our party-political system but it\u2019s exactly the sort of impasse that the deliberative democracy process of Citizens\u2019 Assembly can break through. The Citizens\u2019 Assembly model has been used around the world on difficult issues. It was used by the French government on climate policy, and in Ireland to provide a path to law reform on marriage equality and abortion. In Australia it been used constructively at state and local government levels, but, it has never been applied at the federal government level. The crossbench has written to the treasurer and housing minister with the proposal, which they believe can be established \u201cfor less than the price of two average houses\u201d. GetUp unhappy with Labor over Middle Arm gas development You may have seen this in the blog late yesterday \u2013 the government blocked an attempt to establish an inquiry into the Middle Arm gas development hub in Darwin. As Anne Davies reported yesterday: The Labor government has blocked a Senate inquiry into the proposed Middle Arm development in the Northern Territory, despite an earlier Senate inquiry into development of the Beetaloo basin recommending a follow up inquiry. Although Labor had indicated it would support the recommendations from the earlier Beetaloo inquiry, Labor joined the Coalition to vote down a Greens motion to set up the further inquiry. The Federal government has committed $1.5bn toward the maritime infrastructure for the huge Middle Arm development in Darwin Harbour, which is being promoted by the NT government as a \u201csustainable precinct\u201d that will run on renewables and be a hub for new decarbonising industries such as green hydrogen and mineral processing for batteries. But environmentalists fear that the huge investment in Middle Arm will inevitably lead to an expansion of gas in the Northern Territory and make Beetaloo a foregone conclusion and result in \u201ca carbon bomb\u201d that will make it impossible for Australia to reach its pledge to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. Labor said it was opposing a review by the senate as the project was at an early stage and would go through other reviews including a strategic environmental assessment. There are a lot of people angry at that development \u2013 including GetUp chief executive and Widjabul Wia-bal woman Larissa Baldwin-Roberts. Yesterday, the Albanese government broke a massive promise. They continue to let down traditional owners. It seems Labor has forgotten the mandate on which they were elected just over a year ago. They supported the Beetaloo inquiry and the recommendation that the Middle Arm gas hub undergo additional scrutiny just two months ago. High court sides with commonwealth in GST council case In January, Guardian Australia revealed that Hornsby Shire Council, of which former Howard government minister Philip Ruddock is mayor, was spearheading a high court case arguing that GST levied on local councils is unconstitutional. The council argued that local governments are in effect forced to pay GST through an agreement between the commonwealth, states and territories in 1999 that councils either account for and pay \u201cnotional GST\u201d or equivalent amounts will be withheld from their grants if they refuse. On Wednesday the high court unanimously ruled that the inclusion by the council of notional GST in its business activity statement was a voluntary act made in accordance with an intergovernmental agreement entered into by the commonwealth and each state and territory, initially in 1999 and again in 2009. No federal law legally or practically compelled the council to include that notional GST in its BAS, so there was no unlawful imposition of a tax in breach of the constitution. Given Hornsby paid $144,479 notional GST in just the last year of the two decades of the tax\u2019s operation, the claim could have been worth several million to the council and tens or hundreds of millions across the 537 councils that make up the third tier of government in Australia. As expected, the motion to suspend standing orders was not carried and the house moves on. But as we saw there, Tony Burke essentially said to the crossbench \u2018watch this space\u2019. And they will. CLOSELY. Solar energy gathering momentum With the Albanese government anointing Greg Combet to chair the Net Zero Economy Agency (as had been expected for months), it\u2019s worth a quick look at what the prospects are for reaching such a goal. Overnight, the Climate Energy Finance group has released an interesting report about the gathering momentum in the solar energy field. And frankly, the revolution looks like it\u2019s only just getting started: The scale of some of the solar panel production that is coming, particularly from China, is remarkable, and a cause for optimism, says Renate Egan, who heads the Australian Centre for Advanced Photovoltaics at UNSW. The world installed a record 268 gigawatts of solar panels last year and that tally is heading to 1000GW by 2030. \u201cThis would have profound implications for electricity and energy markets globally,\u201d the report said. A couple of interesting facts include tiny Netherlands vies with Australia as among the top 10 for annual installations at 3.9GW of solar. (The Dutch occupy 1/186 our land area, so one of us is exceptional). Another is that Australia has about 30GW of solar PV all up, which sounds a lot. However, one single Chinese company, JinkoSolar, last month announced plans for a US$7.9bn (A$11.7bn) wafer-to-module solar factory in the coal-rich Chinese province of Shanxi that alone will churn out as much as 56GW solar energy capacity a year. The biggest US plant - now being built with support from the Biden administration - by contrast is only about 3GW a year. Anyway, the race is on, and we should encourage even more speed and ambition if net zero is to be a realistic possibility. The leader of the house, Tony Burke, has explained although the government won\u2019t allow Zoe Daniel\u2019s private member\u2019s bill to ban gambling ads to be debated, this is not to be taken as opposing the principle behind the bill. Burke said: I assure the house, the government is committed to ensuring online gambling takes place within a robust framework with strong consumer protections. Like many Australians we too as the government are concerned about gambling ads and their impact.\u201d Burke noted there is an inquiry into gambling advertising reporting within weeks. He said the government wants a \u201ccomprehensive\u201d response, considering ads across multiple channels including TV, radio, outdoor, branding, and social media. So the government will await the report. Tony Burke says the government is not in support of the suspension of standing orders, but says that is not to be taken as not being in support of the principle of the suspension. Burke says the government will await the house of reps inquiry into online gambling before moving forward. But the government is allowing more speakers on it \u2013 so supporting the debate, but won\u2019t support the suspension, if that makes sense. Monique Ryan lends support to gambling ad bill The Greens and independent MP Dr Monique Ryan are also in support of the suspension for standing orders to debate Zoe Daniel\u2019s bill. Ryan: Independents have a strong proud history of taking new ideas to the table and debating them in a sensible and responsible way. This is politics done differently and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing today. I really urge the major parties to join with this important proposition developed by my colleague the member for Goldstein. This is an important idea which is already gaining a lot of traction with Australian people. It should gain traction with Australian parties. Fellow independent MP Allegra Spender is seconding Zoe Daniel\u2019s motion to suspend standing orders. One of my community members told me that their seven year old daughter had asked them what a same day multi was. A seven year old should be discovering the joys of playing team sports, of watching sports with their friends and family not being educated about the odds and the payoffs. But this is what is happening with our current advertising regime. Zali Steggall is also supporting the motion. I think as a parent, it\u2019s incredibly distressing to see the prevalence of gambling advertising. But it\u2019s incredibly urgent that we debate this bill today because we owe the Australian people leadership that is what the purpose of this place is. We must step in the government must step in and enact regulation and ensure there are protections in place when we have rampant, rampant harm occurring. And that is what the gambling industry is. let\u2019s call it out for what it actually is. Steggall says \u201cgambling is the modern day drug of sport\u201d and needs to be addressed. Coalition\u2019s gambling ads plan does not go far enough, says Daniel Peter Dutton mentioned banning gambling ads in his budget reply speech, and said the opposition was planning on putting in its own legislation on the issue. Zoe Daniel said: I welcome the recent steps taken by the opposition to recognise the extent of the problems created by gambling, advertising and public concern about its ubiquity. But the evidence indicates that further ring fencing of gambling advertising and merely banning it during and before and after sports broadcasts will not work. The opposition\u2019s intent is to present its own bill in the other place [the Senate]. Diluting much needed action with very limited bans is another reason debating the bill I have presented is urgent. The last time further restrictions were introduced by the previous government back in 2017. Australians want gambling ads banned: Zoe Daniel Zoe Daniel says gambling ads are \u201cgrooming\u201d children to think that watching sport and gambling are intrinsically linked. That instead of sport being fun, health, participation and people, you\u2019re not one of the game unless you know as much about the intricacies of [gambling] as you do about the finer points of the game you\u2019re watching. Daniel says people want gambling advertised banned: Polling last year showed that 71% of those polled want gambling advertising banned. Recent research commissioned by the Victorian Responsible Gambling Foundation found that 78% of respondents believe they should be able to watch sports free of gambling ads. The need for this legislation is urgent because the social costs of gambling and gambling addiction are significant and growing. In 2017, the VRGF estimated that the total social cost of gambling in Victoria was no less than $7 billion and the figure is certainly higher now. $2.2 billion of that cost emerged from family and relationship problems $1.6 billion from emotional and psychological issues, including suicide and violence. $1.3 billion from financial losses. What could be more urgent than acting to curtail these costs, especially amid a national cost of living crisis that worst effects are most vulnerable, who are also the target of gambling ads. Zoe Daniel is now moving to suspend standing orders in the house to bring on debate for her private members bill to ban gambling advertising. Mark Dreyfus has introduced the counter-terrorism legislation amendment (prohibited hate symbols and other measures) bill 2023 and yes, it does have more in it than just banning Nazi hate symbols. It also creates new offences for accessing and sharing violent extremist material online. As Dreyfus says: These symbols \u2013 the Nazi hakenkreuz (or hooked cross), the Nazi double sig rune (or \u2018SS\u2019 bolts) and the Islamic State flag \u2013 are widely recognised as symbols of hatred, violence and racism which are incompatible with Australia\u2019s multicultural and democratic society. There is no place in Australia for symbols that glorify the horrors of the Holocaust or human rights atrocities. This ban will not apply to the display and use of the sacred swastika which is of spiritual significance to religions such as Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. The bill also creates new offences for accessing and sharing violent extremist material online. These new offences will allow law enforcement to intervene earlier and disrupt violent extremists before their actions place the community in danger and inspire others to follow this dangerous path of radicalisation. The bill also amends the terrorist organisation listing framework. The Bill provides that the listing of a terrorist organisation will apply indefinitely unless revoked. The current sunsetting date of three years is unnecessarily short and does not reflect the longevity of terrorist organisations. Ley quizzed on Gaetjens review Sussan Ley was then asked why the Phil Gaetjens review (which was looking into who knew what, when in Scott Morrison\u2019s office) was never completed. Ley: Because the Australian federal police asked for it to be paused while they conducted their investigations. Q: Should it be revisited now and completed? Ley: It was paused on advice from the Australian federal police, there is still the Sofronoff Inquiry. So there are still investigations that are happening at that legal level. Ley non-committal on call for inquiry into leaked messages Sussan Ley then held a doorstop on that issue, where she did not address her colleague Andrew Bragg\u2019s call for an inquiry into how Brittany Higgins\u2019 text messages were leaked, while simultaneously calling for Labor to answer questions. Q: Do you think there should be an inquiry into how Brittany Higgins\u2019 text messages were leaked to the media? Ley: There\u2019s been a lot of inquiries, there\u2019s been a lot of conjecture. There have been questions asked, we need answers to those questions. That\u2019s the number one thing that we need at the moment. Q: On this issue of text messages, on the issue of the text messages an inquiry into that? Ley: The prime minister\u2019s office should be conducting the investigations and inquiries they need to reassure the prime minister, that ministers did not mislead the Senate\u2026[interrupted] \u2026This started with an apparent and clearly now an obvious misleading of the Senate now, to the extent that you\u2019re talking about an investigation, where is the prime minister\u2019s investigation that would demonstrate an understanding that his own ministers have not misled the parliament, unless he was aware of these issues all along. Q: One of your own senators this morning did call for an inquiry into this matter. What message is it sending to people around this country who may be victim survivors of alleged sexual assault? What message is that sending to them that private text messages admitted into a judicial system can wind up in the media? Ley: I understand it\u2019s a sensitive issue and for those who are experiencing sexual assault, they should get help and help is available. We\u2019ve had extensive commentary this morning from the people who are there to provide that support and help both within and associated with the legal system. So that\u2019s the most important point to make. But if you are in this position, the help that you need both legal and around the legal system is there for you. The questions that we want answered, are simple questions that relate to recent information that has come to light. Now I\u2019m standing here answering questions, but where are senior ministers of this Labor government who are running a mile from the questions that the Australian people have a right to get answers to? Ley: \u2018I stand by\u2019 statements from Cash, Reynolds That questioning continued: Host: Just one more on Michaelia Cash\u2019s Office, they insist the first she ever heard the word rape was used in a media inquiry on February 2021. Have you got any reason to think that that\u2019s not true? Sussan Ley: I stand by the statements and all of the explanations that have been given by both minister Cash and minister Reynolds and this has been an awful experience for those involved, including those who offered support, like my colleagues. Now what we want to know now, and what we are calling into question is the credibility of senior Labor members. And it\u2019s very simple for them to answer these very simple questions, and they\u2019re not, they\u2019re not going anywhere near them. Now, if they knew about all of this before the Project went to air, days before, Tanya Plibersek asked 16 questions in Question Time on it, and I asked her did she have any engagement with anyone else about the content of those questions? That\u2019s a simple question to Pete that remains unanswered. Higgins tweets, Ley defends Cash Brittany Higgins has not commented on what has been happening in parliament. Overnight, Higgins published several tweets on Tuesday night to again claim that the office of Michaelia Cash, her one-time employer and now shadow attorney general, knew about her allegations well before they became public. Responding to a tweet about Cash\u2019s knowledge of the allegations, Higgins wrote: \u201cOctober 2019.\u201d Liberal deputy leader Sussan Ley defended Cash and her office on Sky News this morning, saying it was about what Labor, who was then in opposition, knew and when. Our former ministers have given extensive and detailed accounts of their actions. The questions that need to be answered are for Labor ministers. Now I haven\u2019t seen the tweets and I don\u2019t want to comment directly on the individuals involved, and I do hope that they\u2019re getting the support that they need, that everyone involved in this case is getting the support that they need. But I come back to our central premise, something we\u2019ve been saying now for some days. We need Labor to demonstrate the answer to our main question. Were they aware of these allegations before they went to air and did they use them to profit politically? If they did, that\u2019s morally bankrupt, to politically profit from a rape allegation. These are the questions that need to be answered. Anyone who sat through Senate, or the House of Reps Question Time yesterday would probably have thought, why aren\u2019t they just answering these simple questions? Questions like how long before The Project went to air were you aware of the allegations? That was a question I asked Tanya Plibersek yesterday, and I didn\u2019t get an answer. Simple questions were asked, a simple question was asked of the prime minister, who gave a very tricky answer that completely ignored the question. We need the answers, the Australian people need the answers. What is on the government agenda today? Mark Dreyfus will introduce the Nazi Hate Symbols bill sometime this morning. It\u2019s not just about Nazi symbols, so we will look through that bill when it is tabled. The whistleblower bill (public interest disclosure bill) will make its way through the senate (although there remains calls for Dreyfus to drop whistleblower prosecutions currently in front of the court). And the referendum legislation bill will be on the Senate agenda but not until this evening. The Senate will be sitting on Friday to get through its workload, but will also sit late tonight. So far, only five of the 52 listed speakers have given their speech on it. Where are the opposition planning on going with the attacks on Katy Gallagher? There isn\u2019t a straight answer to that one, because no one can really figure out what the upside is here. Gallagher made the comments that the Coalition are using as the basis for the \u201cmisled parliament\u201d attacks while in opposition, in a different parliament. She was not a minister at the time. So she didn\u2019t make the comments as a minister and therefore did not breach the ministerial code. Anthony Albanese has backed Gallagher in, so there is no movement there. And the Greens have already denounced the tactics and said they will not facilitate it in the Senate. Which means if the Coalition attempted to refer Gallagher to the privileges committee, they would not have enough support in the Senate. So there is no movement there. Which means that this is being played out for the cameras with no real goal in sight. And at the moment, no end in sight either. The bells are ringing \u2013 the parliament session is about to begin. It looks like being another messy day \u2013 so take care of you. Daniel targets gambling ads Parliament will sit from 9am and Zoe Daniel is hoping to start the house session with a policy debate on gambling ads. The independent MP will attempt to suspend standing orders to bring on debate on her private member\u2019s bill to ban gambling ads. Daniel notes: The evidence is that extensions to restrictions on gambling advertising around sports broadcasts are not effective. Enhanced restrictions on gambling advertising introduced in 2017 have proved counter-productive, with promotion shifting from sports broadcasts to general programming. Research commissioned by the Australian Communications and Media Authority found that the total volume of gambling advertisements on radio and television increased by 50% after the new restrictions were introduced. A survey for the Victorian Responsible Gambling Foundation found that 78% of respondents believe they should be able to watch sport free of gambling advertising. The government is unlikely to support this \u2013 so far it has pointed to its inquiry looking at online gambling (mostly) and says it will wait for the recommendations from that. The New South Wales government will donate $100,000 to support the victims of the Hunter Valley bus crash. The money will go into a fund co-managed by the government and Rotary Australia to provide relief and support to survivors, victims and their immediate families. Premier Chris Minns announced the donation would come from his discretionary fund before heading back to the region later this morning: This is understandably a tragedy that has been felt right across the state. When tragic events like this occur, it\u2019s the Australian way to reach out and support one another. Singleton mayor Sue Moore said: This accident has rocked our close-knit community \u2013 the ripples are being felt across Singleton as people come to terms with the scale of the loss and impact. I know the people of Singleton are big-hearted and generous, and this fund is a straightforward way that people can show their support and know that the help will go directly to those that need it. \u2018A sackable offence\u2019 Here is how that \u201cconversation\u201d played out. Jane Hume: What we want understand now is whether this Labor minister was in fact complicit in politicising this event. That is unforgivable. Not only that, misleading parliament is a serious offence, a sackable offence and standing by this minister, if she has misled parliament, has consequences. Clare O\u2019Neil: You were in the Senate yesterday when Katy went through what happened and what I\u2019d like to understand from you is how is it the two years after this event you are trying to make this somehow the problem of the current government when we were not even in government, not four years after this event occurred. The real issue is the fact that a woman was allegedly sexually assaulted in our workplace and I would really like to focus on that is the main issue here because that is the main issue here, because that is the subject that matters. Hume and O\u2019Neil clash over Coalition\u2019s continued attacks on Gallagher Over on the Seven network, Liberal senator Jane Hume and Labor senator Clare O\u2019Neil clashed over the Coalition\u2019s continued attacks on Katy Gallagher and what they claim was her \u201cpoliticising\u201d Brittany Higgins\u2019 allegations. Hume started by trying to walk both sides of the issue: What we are finding out now is what the minister knew and why her testimony to the Senate as different from that. There\u2019s a lot of considerations here, I know people are talking about how this information came into the media and certainly the media has a lot of considerations to make. There has to be respect for the parliament and the court and the law but that information is now out there and journalists need to make decisions about whether it is in the public interest. Now that that is out there, the onus is on us to make sure the evidence the minister gave the parliament is consistent with the new evidence out there. Gallagher gave a statement to the Senate yesterday outlining the timeline as she knew it \u2013 she found out about the allegations four days before they were made public, but says she kept them confidential and did not act on them, or have anything to do with the stories themselves. Liberal senator Andrew Bragg says watching what unfolded in the Senate yesterday was \u201cvery ugly\u201d. He is referring to the Coalition questioning Labor senator Katy Gallagher over what she knew about Brittany Higgins\u2019 allegations before they were made public. That emerged because Higgins\u2019 phone messages with her fiance David Sharaz were leaked to News Corp, Network Seven and the Daily Mail. You can read more about that here: But Bragg seems to have no time for what he saw in the Senate yesterday \u2013 which was led by his side of politics. Host: You were in the Senate yesterday, finance minister Katy Gallagher made her statement in relation to what she\u2019d said previously. I note your colleague Jane Hume has also said that Brittany Higgins\u2019 private messages should never have been made public. Do you agree with Jane Hume? Bragg: Look, I think his whole thing has been a tawdry affair and it is hugely regrettable how it\u2019s played out publicly. I don\u2019t know how these messages have been put into the public domain. I expect that there will be a proper investigation into that. Because I mean, why would anyone come forward with allegations of assault if this is the result? Host: So you believe there should be a formal police investigation? Bragg: Well, there needs to be an inquiry to how this has happened. I mean, this can\u2019t happen again. This is supposed to be a country which values the rule of law and proper process. Host: And watching this all unfold in the Senate. What\u2019s it what\u2019s it like, briefly? Bragg: Very ugly, very ugly. Questions surround Higgins investigation Liberal senator Andrew Bragg believes there needs to be an inquiry into how things like Brittany Higgins\u2019 phone messages from two years ago, which were downloaded as part of the police investigation into her allegations, have made their way to the media. Labor senator Jenny McAllister tells ABC radio RN she doesn\u2019t believe there needs to be an inquiry into that but she is worried about the \u201ctone\u201d of the debate. McAllister also believes it is for the former government to answer questions about the Gaetjens review \u2013 which was looking into who knew what, and when in Scott Morrison\u2019s office (the review was dropped so as not to interfere with the AFP investigation, and reports like that under previous governments are not privy to FOI laws): I think it is appropriate that the former government answer questions about the way that that review was conducted and why its findings were never released. Greg Combet to chair Net Zero Agency The Albanese government has announced the chair and advisory board for the Net Zero Agency. Former Labor minister and trade unionist Greg Combet has the big job. Members appointed to the advisory board: Prof Ross Garnaut AC \u2013 professor emeritus in economics at the University of Melbourne and professor emeritus, college of Asia &amp; the Pacific at ANU Prof Paul Simshauser AM \u2013 chief executive of Powerlink Queensland and professor of economics at Griffith University Anthea Harris \u2013 chief executive of the Australian Energy Regulator Nicole Lockwood \u2013 chair of Infrastructure WA, board member of NBN and former shire president of Roebourne Kellie Parker \u2013 chief executive of Rio Tinto Australia Michele O\u2019Neil \u2013 president of the Australian Council of Trade Unions Prof Robynne Quiggin \u2013 pro-vice chancellor of UTS and part of steering committee for the First Nations Clean Energy Network Anna Skarbek \u2013 chief executive of ClimateWorks, director of the Green Building Council of Australia, the Centre for New Energy Technologies, the Sustainable Australia Fund, Impact Investment Group, and Sentient Impact Group Tony Maher \u2013 general president of the Mining and Energy Union Laura Tyler \u2013 chief technical officer, BHP Expect to see this enter the debate again \u2013 especially given the pushback against the minimum wage increase. Welcome to day two of the parliamentary sitting. Thank you to Martin for kicking us off \u2013 you have Amy Remeikis with you for most of the day now as we navigate parliament. The Senate will keep itself busy with the referendum legislation, while negotiations over the housing fund continue in the background. In the house, Tony Burke will continue to press the case for the same-job, same-pay legislation. Outside of policy, the Coalition will continue to pursue Katy Gallagher in a pretty similar vein as what we saw yesterday. The Liberal party national conference is being held this weekend in Canberra and it\u2019s hoping to end the week on a high. We\u2019ll keep you up to date. Push to improve gender equality in workplace Skills minister Brendan O\u2019Connor says the government is keenly focused on getting more women into male-dominated industries, telling an International Labour Organisation meeting in Switzerland that Australia wants to improve gender equality in the workplace. Giving a plenary address to the ILO overnight, O\u2019Connor also said the Indigenous voice would play a role in workforce participation: We want to increase the representation of women in historically male-dominated industries, while strengthening wages and conditions for workers in professions dominated by women. These industries are historically some of the lowest paid, yet their place in our communities are among the most important. O\u2019Connor reeled off a list of the government\u2019s achievements in this area, from a payr ise for aged care workers and boosts to government-funded paid parental leave to childcare cost reductions and increases to domestic violence leave. He also talked of leading a \u201ctripartite group\u201d, including workers and businesses, to move forward in key areas in skills and training: The Australian government is prioritising a labour market that is fair for all. It\u2019s vital that everyone can participate on an equal footing, in safe, secure and well-paid work \u2013 while being given the opportunity to access the right skills and training to adapt to a changing economy. Introducing tolls to landmark Sydney motorways including the Anzac Bridge and Warringah Freeway were among options being investigated by the previous Coalition government, the new Labor administration reveals today. Before releasing a discussion paper of its review into Sydney\u2019s toll road network, the Minns Labor government has released information about tolling options investigated by the previous government. An excerpt of the review of previous tolling options said: A new motorway network pricing structure could apply to the existing tolled network, or to all motorways (the continuous motorway network (CMN)). A CMN option could involve tolling some previously untolled roads, but could create a more efficient continuous motorway network. The excerpt listed the following untolled roads as potential motorways that could have tolls introduced: Anzac Bridge, General Holmes Drive, Gore Hill Freeway, M4 West (M7 to WestConnex M4), Southern Cross Drive, Warringah Freeway and the Western Distributor. Introducing a CBD congestion charge \u2013 an idea that has been around for a while in Sydney \u2013 was another option prepared by the transport department to be considered by the previous Coalition government, according to information released by the Labor government on Wednesday. The excerpt said: The creation of a CBD zone was considered, charging an access fee on entry \u2013 by motorway and/or arterial road \u2013 into the CBD. This option was considered to have the potential to deliver a multitude of benefits, including: potentially reducing the numbers of cars entering the CBD (for example, during the morning peak by up to 40%); potentially increasing average speed on CBD; supporting mode shift to public transport; a more pedestrian friendly CBD. Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of all the Australian news that\u2019s fit to read about. I\u2019m Martin Farrer bringing you the best overnight lines before Amy Remeikis takes charge. New South Wales premier Chris Minns will travel to the site of Sunday\u2019s bus tragedy today amid questions about whether the law needs to change to make wearing seatbelts compulsory for such transport. He told the ABC yesterday: [If] there\u2019s a recommendation made to us about law changes in relation to safety on buses or coaches or in cars and vans in NSW, we\u2019ll of course take action. We\u2019ll be following his visit and he is expected to give a media conference later. The Australian defence force cannot continue to help with natural disasters and defend Australia at the same time, a senior defence chief has told MPs. Air Vice Marshal Stephen Chappell said the \u201cunrelenting tempo\u201d of bushfires, floods, and the pandemic had strained resources, damaged morale and interrupted training, making such duties \u201cunsustainable\u201d. Debate will continue on the voice referendum. Yesterday the Indigenous Australians minister, Linda Burney, accused the no campaign of importing \u201cAmerican-style Trump politics\u201d into the debate. But prominent yes campaigners say their job is to \u201ckeep the faith\u201d. There may also be reaction today to the news last night that the Liberal senator Linda Reynolds is planning to sue Labor\u2019s Tanya Plibersek over a television interview regarding Brittany Higgins\u2019 rape allegation. Plibersek, the environment minister, confirmed she had received a concerns notice from Reynolds \u2013 but also appeared to hint she was considering legal action of her own. A concerns notice is the first step in beginning defamation proceedings."}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e7017b", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/14/pga-boss-jay-monahan-recuperating-medical-situation-golf", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": [], "title": "Under-fire PGA chief Jay Monahan \u2018recuperating from a medical situation\u2019", "lead": "The news comes after a tumultuous week in the sport with the PGA Tour announcing a shock merger with the rival Saudi-backed LIV Golf", "author": "Reuters", "datePublished": "2023-06-14T08:33:21Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.294640", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/166605ce3e3c40bd5b1fbe5b36975340c4d46b16/0_394_5955_3573/500.jpg", "body": "The PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan is recovering from a \u201cmedical situation\u201d, it was announced on Tuesday.

Warnock, who turns 75 on 1 December, said: \u201cOnce I knew that [my wife] Sharon was OK with me continuing, I\u2019ve been fully concentrating on knuckling down to do the best we can in trying to get this great club up the league.\u201d This week Huddersfield announced the appointment of Jake Edwards as chief executive and the departures of Leigh Bromby as head of football operations and Paul Clements as goalkeeping coach."}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e7017d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/14/football-transfer-rumours-harry-kane-on-psgs-radar", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": [], "title": "Football transfer rumours: Harry Kane on PSG\u2019s radar?", "lead": "Jadon Sancho to Aston Villa? | Manu Kon\u00e9 to Wolves or Villa? | Jordi Alba to Inter Miami?", "author": "Daniel Harris", "datePublished": "2023-06-14T08:17:31Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.294651", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/f315fd20a02fdb748d7516301aedd4d41f80672f/266_69_2338_1402/500.jpg", "body": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 has informed Paris Saint-Germain that the incomparable thrill of besting Brest, trouncing Troyes and angering Angers no longer appeals to him \u2013 nor the fun of predicting how Champions League embarrassment will come. As such, a number of clubs are jockeying to secure the services of a player the Mill would like to believe is known as \u201cJack\u201d by his teammates. Real Madrid, already spending in the region of \u00a388.5m on Jude Bellingham, are keen to lash even more money if they possibly can, because what is money for if not lashing. And they also need a centre-forward to replace Karim Benzema, who\u2019s finally fulfilling his fantasy of playing in the Saudi Pro League. Should Mbapp\u00e9 move to the Bernab\u00e9u, Harry Kane would be more likely to remain at Spurs, but PSG also want him and could anyone begrudge their style captain a move to the style capital? However, Chelsea would also like to buy him, and who would not be seduced by the opportunity to be patronised by a football maven of Todd Boehly\u2019s renown? In the event that Sheikh Jassim buys Manchester United, a wholesome prospect if ever there was one, his reported links to the owners of PSG could yet make a move by Mbapp\u00e9 to Old Trafford possible. This would delight the children of the internet for whom the world offers no joy whatsoever save their bestest-ever team featuring multitudes of shiny goods whose names are then attached to the suffix \u201cSZN\u201d and who respond with the Mbapp\u00e9 crying meme every time an adult challenges the integrity of proceedings. United are also looking to shift players and it seems Aston Villa are in the market for a winger with little pace, even less strength and entirely absent intensity. Whether or not Jadon Sancho fancies the unique buzz and unrivalled passport stamps of the Conference League remains to be seen, but in the meantime the reported \u00a360m price tag is also thought to be a stumbling block. Otherwise, Villa \u2013 and Wolves \u2013 are also keen on Manu Kon\u00e9. The 22-year-old M\u00f6nchengladbach midfielder has also been linked with Liverpool, but his rumoured penchant for solitary perambulation might put the kibosh on things. Talking of Liverpool, Steven Gerrard looks set to take his next step en route to the big chair at Anfield by accepting the prestigious post at Al-Ettifaq. All he\u2019ll need to do then is hope the rival managers who are better than him find jobs elsewhere, and he\u2019ll be in prime position to repeat his Rangers success. Also a target for the investment fund of the Saudi royal family is Romelu Lukaku. Their Al-Hilal iteration have offered him a deal worth up to \u00a320m a season, which actually makes some kind of sense given the absence of decent defenders and big competitions against whom and in which he usually struggles. Elsewhere, Tottenham are close to agreeing personal terms with David Raya, who they\u2019d like to replace Hugo Lloris. Brentford, though, are asking \u00a340m for their man, so chances are Daniel Levy spends the remainder of the summer posturing before spending double as much on someone half as good in the final seconds of the transfer window. And finally, Jordi Alba is talking to Inter Miami about joining them from Barcelona. He is not thought to have been dissuaded by the sacking of Phil Neville."}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e7017e", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/14/uk-economy-returns-to-growth-as-spending-in-pubs-lifts-output-gdp", "primaryCategory": "business", "subCategories": [], "title": "UK economy returns to slender growth as spending in pubs lifts output", "lead": "GDP rose by 0.2% in April, with rising car sales and reduced impact of strikes also playing a part", "author": "Richard Partington Economics correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-06-14T08:16:50Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.294655", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/2bf0fd620cd176ec03235952535b0402e116327d/39_284_5821_3493/500.jpg", "body": "The UK economy eked out a return to growth in April as rising car sales and customers spending in pubs and bars helped output to recover from a wave of public sector strikes in the previous month. The Office for National Statistics said on Wednesday that gross domestic product rose by a slender 0.2% month on month, matching the forecasts of City economists for a recovery from March when output declined by 0.3%. Fuelled by an increase in consumer spending in the country\u2019s dominant services sector, the rise in activity was partly offset by a dip in health sector output, which was affected by junior doctors\u2019 strikes. Activity also fell in computer manufacturing and the pharmaceuticals industry. The ONS warned there were signs of stress emerging amid a sharp monthly fall in construction activity. Under pressure from rising interest rates and falling property values, it said housebuilders and estate agents had a poor month. The latest snapshot comes amid growing expectations the Bank of England will raise interest rates for a 13th time in succession next week from its current level of 4.5% in response to stubbornly high inflation, adding to the pressure on households and businesses already reeling from the sharpest rise in borrowing costs for decades. Economists said the return to growth in April could be interpreted by the Bank\u2019s policymakers as a sign that higher interest rates have not yet dampened demand enough to reduce inflationary pressure. Kitty Ussher, the chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said: \u201cHouseholds responded to the improving weather in April by raising their levels of discretionary spending \u2013 even in the face of rising costs.\u201d Figures on Tuesday showed activity in the UK jobs market was stronger than expected in April, with wage growth hitting the highest level on record outside the Covid pandemic. Inflation fell by less than expected in April to 8.7% \u2013 the highest level in the G7 \u2013 fuelling expectations for a rate rise. \u201cThe facts remain that families are feeling worse off, facing a soaring Tory mortgage penalty and we\u2019re lagging behind on the global stage,\u201d said Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor. \u201cDespite our country\u2019s huge potential and promise, today is another day in the dismal low growth record book of this Conservative government.\u201d More broadly, GDP grew by 0.1% over the three months to April, lifting Britain\u2019s economy marginally above pre-pandemic levels. However, analysts warned that the resurgence in activity was unlikely to last, thanks to higher interest rates hitting the spending power of mortgage holders. Ruth Gregory, the deputy chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said the consultancy estimated that more than 60% of the drag on the economy from higher borrowing costs was yet to be felt. Financial markets also anticipate the Bank will increase rates by more than one percentage point from the current level of 4.5%. \u201cThat\u2019s why we still think a recession is on its way in the second half of this year,\u201d she added. Late last year, economists feared the UK would be in recession by now. However, falling global energy prices and rising consumer confidence have helped to bolster activity. The economy grew by 0.1% over the first quarter, matching the performance in the final three months of 2022. Revised figures last week showed the eurozone sank into a mild recession around the turn of the year, after two consecutive quarters of shrinking GDP. The US economy grew by 0.3% in the first quarter, after 0.6% growth in the fourth quarter of 2022. Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, said the International Monetary Fund forecast the UK economy would be growing faster than Germany, France and Italy from 2025. \u201cBut high growth needs low inflation, so we must stick relentlessly to our plan to halve the rate this year to protect family budgets.\u201d However, business leaders warned there was little to celebrate, with a growth rate close to zero. \u201cThe economy continues to skirt recession,\u201d said David Bharier, the head of research at the British Chambers of Commerce. \u201cFurther upcoming changes on trade with the EU, such as new reporting requirements and import charges, will also add more pressure to exporters, many of whom have seen diminished activity due to mounting trade barriers.\u201d"}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e7017f", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/14/retired-santos-gas-wells-off-western-australia-coast-leaking-for-a-decade-regulator-says", "primaryCategory": "environment", "subCategories": [], "title": "Retired Santos gas wells off Western Australia coast leaking for a decade, regulator says", "lead": "Energy giant proposes monitoring wells for five years, as government says seepage volumes are factored into emissions reduction targets", "author": "Lisa Cox", "datePublished": "2023-06-14T08:11:33Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.294660", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/cecedab1f39245a583202b77dd22ecdc6dec7e2c/0_385_5000_3000/500.jpg", "body": "Decommissioned gas wells from a Santos project off the coast of Western Australia have been leaking from the seabed for a decade, according to documents published by the national petroleum regulator. The leaks, first reported by WA Today, are located at the Legendre gas field north of the Pilbara port of Dampier, and were detected by an underwater vehicle in 2013. In a report to the petroleum regulator, Nopsema, Santos wrote it was \u201cnot feasible\u201d to stop the leaks, which are described on the regulator\u2019s website as \u201congoing gas seepage in the form of small bubbles\u201d. The company has proposed monitoring the wells for five years under an environment plan. A Santos spokesperson said the company had engaged the national science agency, the CSIRO, to \u201cundertake an in-depth monitoring program\u201d. \u201cFindings to date show that the gas is nontoxic and unlikely to present an environmental hazard,\u201d they said. \u201cSantos is currently implementing a management plan that includes a regular monitoring program.\u201d Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup A Nopsema spokesperson said the regulator had asked Santos to \u201cundertake activity to show the cause of the reported seepage and required that Santos submit an environment plan to demonstrate the appropriate management of any works undertaken\u201d. The spokesperson said the regulator could not comment on the specifics of the environment plan while it was under assessment. Jeff Waters, an offshore fossil gas campaigner at the environment group Friends of the Earth, disagreed with Santos\u2019s assessment the leaks were nontoxic. \u201cCertainly it\u2019s toxic to the environment in the sense that it\u2019s adding to the greenhouse gas emissions of Australia,\u201d he said. \u201cMy question to [climate and energy minister] Chris Bowen is \u2018how many greenhouse gas initiatives are being cancelled out by rogue emissions from leaking wells and what\u2019s the government going to do about it?\u2019\u201d A spokesperson for Bowen said estimates of greenhouse gas emissions from abandoned gas wells were reported in Australia\u2019s national greenhouse gas inventory and were taken into account against Australia\u2019s emissions reduction targets. Nopsema has regulatory oversight of 873 wells. Of these, 457 are operational wells, while 326 are shut-in, suspended or temporarily abandoned wells. The remaining 90 have been plugged and abandoned and are awaiting final signoff from Nopsema that it is satisfied those works are complete. The Legendre project ceased production in 2011 and wells were decommissioned by the then-operator, Apache. Santos took over management of Legendre in 2018 and continued with this program and subsequent surveys, including the most recent surveys in 2022."}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e70180", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/14/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-476-of-the-invasion", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": [], "title": "Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 476 of the invasion", "lead": "At least three killed in Russian strike on port city of Odesa; visit of UN nuclear chief to Zaporizhzhia plant reportedly delayed", "author": "Royce Kurmelovs and Martin Belam", "datePublished": "2023-06-14T08:07:01Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.294666", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/fb0e71609e34feb3d797eeb0fe5b1b8d25d4f82a/0_122_6421_3853/500.jpg", "body": "Three people have been killed and at least 13 injured in a Russian missile attack on the southern Ukrainian city of Odesa, Ukrainian forces have said.

Moscow has also flagged again that it may withdraw from the Black Sea grain deal, after Putin says he has been cheated by the west who have failed to deliver on a promise to help bring Russian agricultural goods to world markets.

Rashford reflected on a bruising moment for the red half of the city. \u201cTo be honest, it\u2019s not nice [to see City\u2019s success] but at the same time it\u2019s football,\u201d Rashford said. \u201cThe best team that\u2019s consistently playing the best football is going to win the most trophies and they\u2019ve managed to win three this year. \u201cWell done to them and we just move on now and it\u2019s up to them to keep it up, and it\u2019s up to the rest of us to try and catch them up.\u201d Asked if City\u2019s achievements provide extra motivation, United\u2019s homegrown forward said: \u201cYeah, 100%.\u201d Rashford also said he is fully committed to England and does not care if onlookers question his dedication to the national team. The 25-year-old is preparing for the Euro 2024 qualifiers against Malta and North Macedonia having withdrawn from March\u2019s meet-up through injury. The forward has had to pull out of numerous camps over the years but his decision to head to New York while England were winning their Group C opener 2-1 in Italy sparked debate. The national team coach, Gareth Southgate, defended the 51-cap forward\u2019s decision to fly to the US at the time and the forward says he was unmoved by critical voices. \u201cI didn\u2019t see it, to be honest with you,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t see it until I got home. I needed time to switch off and recover, so I took a short trip, four days, then went back to do rehab and just try and get ready as soon as possible. With injuries, you can\u2019t predict when they\u2019re going to happen. \u201cThankfully I have very few muscle strains and those type of injuries, but occasionally you do get impact injuries.

And then there\u2019s the small matter of Lionel Messi joining Inter Miami CF of MLS. The 2022 World Cup winner will join his new teammates within weeks and locally there\u2019s disbelief to accompany incredible excitement. It probably won\u2019t feel real until Messi is pictured with the club\u2019s co-owner, David Beckham, holding aloft a pink and black team scarf. The announcements thus far have been strangely understated. Messi says he has \u201cdecided to continue the path in Miami\u201d and the club confirmed his pending arrival via a cryptic Instagram post that went out to around a million followers. The account has since amassed another 7m followers. To put that number into context, the NFL\u2019s most valuable franchise, the Dallas Cowboys, has 4.5m. Then again, Messi himself has half a billion. The opportunities this presents for the team and league are gigantic. \u201cIt\u2019s surreal, but it\u2019s real. He is coming, even though they\u2019re not saying much,\u201d says Franco Panizo, of the Miami Total Futbol podcast. \u201cIt\u2019ll feel more real when he gets here and when he plays his first game it\u2019s going to be spectacular. \u201cBesides the cameras and the glitz and glamour, just seeing him on the field and the atmosphere in the stadium is going to be incredible. This is going to be transformative for Inter Miami.\u201d Local excitement even permeated the hyper-focused environment of the NBA finals. The Heat\u2019s own global star Jimmy Butler, an enormous soccer fan, said: \u201cI\u2019m so excited for the city to have a player of that caliber here. Fans from all over the world are going to come here to watch him compete.\u201d Heat head coach Erik Spoelstra told the Guardian before Game 4: \u201cIt\u2019s exciting. My two sons are just starting to get into soccer \u2026 football. I hope I can get a ticket for some games.\u201d Spoelstra and Butler will be OK for a seat, but good luck to everyone else. The secondary ticket market for Messi\u2019s potential home debut on 21 July starts at more than $800. Or you could drop $20,000 for a front-row seat on the halfway line. The striking part is that Inter Miami are wretched and these halcyon south Florida sports days aren\u2019t without suffering. The Heat were convincingly beaten by the Denver Nuggets in the NBA finals and Inter lost 3-1 at New England on Saturday. Life\u2019s tough at the top and, in Inter\u2019s case, the very bottom. Messi is joining a team dead last in the Eastern Conference after six straight league defeats and without a permanent manager. Phil Neville, who many believe was appointed because he\u2019s Beckham\u2019s pal and was granted extended grace for the same reason, was finally sacked on 2 June. Neville\u2019s assistant, former Real Salt Lake City midfielder Javier Morales, is filling in. A year ago, Morales was coaching Inter\u2019s Under-17s. Now he\u2019s weeks away from coaching the game\u2019s biggest star. But it\u2019s unlikely Morales, who is Argentinian, will be appointed full-time. Messi\u2019s former boss at Barcelona and Argentina, Gerardo Martino, has reportedly been lined-up. Many high profile, more experienced coaches will now covet the opportunity to work with the seven-time Ballon d\u2019Or winner. And the same goes for players. Miami\u2019s front office must get creative given the MLS salary cap rules and the restrictions they\u2019re operating under for breaking them, but former Barcelona teammates Sergio Busquets and Luis Su\u00e1rez are among the rumoured targets. Indeed, given the friendly MLS playoff structure, the season is far from lost. Inter are seven points from playoff contention at the midway point and have a US Open Cup semi-final to contest. It could yet be a successful season depending on how involved (and motivated) Messi is upon arrival. \u201cIt\u2019s MLS, man,\u201d Panizo says. \u201cThe ninth-placed team makes the playoffs. You can make that up in the second-half of the season when you sign a designated player. There\u2019s been examples of that throughout the history of the league.\u201d Besides joining a last-placed team, the glamour of the move is somewhat undercut by Inter\u2019s playing arrangements. When Bleacher Report channeled LeBron James\u2019 famous decision to \u201ctake my talents to South Beach\u201d, a Twitter user with an eye for accuracy responded: \u201cHe\u2019s technically taking his talents to Commercial Blvd in Fort Lauderdale near a bunch of auto body shops and a seafood restaurant named Catfish Dewey\u2019s.\u201d Indeed, Inter\u2019s temporary DRV PNK stadium is 35 miles from the glamour of South Beach and its 18,000 capacity is joint-lowest in MLS. The bare bones arena is nice enough, but has four very open corners and you can see the pitch from the parking lot. It\u2019s a little unbecoming for one of the greatest players of all time. Back-up goalkeeper Nick Marsman has already expressed concerns. \u201cPersonally, I think that the club is not ready for the arrival of Messi,\u201d he told ESPN. \u201cWe have a temporary stadium, people can enter the field and we go to the stadium without security.\u201d Panizo added: \u201cIf the games are at DRV PNK stadium they\u2019ll need much more security than there is now, they\u2019ll probably need to find a creative way to get Messi in and out. It\u2019ll be trial and error.\u201d New England, Charlotte, Seattle, Chicago, New York City and Atlanta play at stadiums built for the NFL or MLB. Those teams can max out huge capacities when the Messi roadshow visits. Inter Miami can\u2019t. Unless they move the games to a venue like the Miami Dolphins\u2019 Hard Rock Stadium, which houses 65,000. \u201cThey\u2019re going to have to find a different place to play,\u201d says Will Manso, WPLG Local 10\u2019s lead sports anchor. \u201cWith an 18,000 stadium, you\u2019re going to have two or three times the people wanting to see Messi play, if not more. \u201cWhen you get those stars, every game becomes like a rock concert and Inter Miami has to look at it that way. Logistically, how are they going to do it? It\u2019s never going to be a case of: \u2018Oh well, it\u2019s another game for Lionel Messi\u2019. Everyone will want to go and see him.\u201d Talk to any soccer-playing kid in south Florida and they\u2019ll name Messi as their favorite player, so it\u2019s imperative Inter make the experience accessible. In just one or two years, the club can lock in an entire generation of fans. The length of the contract is yet to be disclosed, but it\u2019s possible Messi won\u2019t play at Miami\u2019s proposed permanent home either. The 25,000-seat arena in Miami\u2019s Freedom Park is yet to break ground amid seemingly endless wrangling and won\u2019t open until at least 2025. Manso adds: \u201cMaybe getting Messi is the big push that allows them to push this through and build that world class, state-of-the-art facility\u201d. On and off the field, it has been a fractured start to life for Inter Miami, now in their fourth season, but there\u2019s a feeling this signing could be a catalyst. The Miami Heat organization can empathize with its soccer sibling. It was established as an expansion franchise in 1988, competing for local relevance against Dan Marino\u2019s Dolphins. Amassing star players was a critical part of that journey. Legendary coach Pat Riley arrived in 1995 to offer legitimacy. Shaquille O\u2019Neal and Dwyane Wade brought the team a title in 2006. The LeBron James Big Three era \u2013 which brought another two championships \u2013 truly made Miami a basketball town. Tony Fiorentino was an assistant coach to Riley and has been with the organization for every one of its 35 seasons. He sees the parallels and opportunities, but also the challenges for Inter Miami, a club still early in its development. He says: \u201cIt all started when Coach Riley got here. That was the big event. It was exciting. We were looking forward to bigger and better things. But with an internationally renowned guy like Messi, Inter Miami\u2019s security and such will have to spike.\u201d Eric Reid, his longtime broadcast colleague, added: \u201cThis reminds me a lot of Heat as an expansion team. Professional soccer is somewhat new here, but this elevates it to a global level. He\u2019s going to bring a lot of positive energy and light to it. \u201cLeBron was a superstar, and it was electrifying to have him in our presence. We became the epicenter of the basketball universe, and then everything evolved through Miami.\u201d With Messi on board, Inter Miami have the incredible opportunity to follow the Heat\u2019s blueprint in MLS. Now we will see if the club can pull it off."}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e70183", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jun/14/we-had-both-grown-up-but-we-didnt-know-each-other-real-life-mother-and-son-on-dancing-together-shubakk-fesitval-battersea-arts-centre-london", "primaryCategory": "stage", "subCategories": [], "title": "\u2018We had both grown up but didn\u2019t know each other\u2019: a mother and son\u2019s dance reunion", "lead": "Latifa Khamessi\u2019s parents prohibited her from dancing.

Her parents didn\u2019t approve. One time they punished her by shaving her hair off, but Khamessi went to her hairdresser and got a wig. Then they hid her dresses, so she wore one of her brother\u2019s shirts instead. She had a rebellious spirit, but mostly Khamessi just loved to dance, releasing her energy and frustrations on the dancefloor. \u201cIt was a moment of transformation,\u201d she says. Even when she was pregnant with her first son, her husband would take her out dancing. She dreamed of being a dancer, but it wasn\u2019t a viable or respectable career. Now, 65-year-old Khamessi has finally made it to the stage with her son Mohamed Toukabri \u2013 the one who went to discos in utero and became a professional dancer. He tells people he got the bug after watching breakers dance to hip-hop outside Tunis\u2019s railway station, but now he realises \u201cit was all there all along, transmitted to me somehow\u201d. Toukabri studied in Brussels then danced with Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui and Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker. His first solo work, The Upside Down Man, examined his personal experience as an immigrant, and his new show, The Power (of) the Fragile, is a second chapter of that story in the shape of a duet for him and his mum. On video call, the pair sit side by side, she in baseball cap, smoking (like a real old-school dancer), he with warm smile and gentle presence, long hair tied back, translating for her. The idea came from Toukabri wanting to pay tribute to his own mother, and all the parents who have sacrificed their \u201ctime, energy, youth and dreams\u201d for the younger generation. Troubled by the world\u2019s complexity and violence, and its demands for him to define his identity, Toukabri was also looking for a safe space, which led him back to his mother (although he recognises that\u2019s not everybody\u2019s experience with their parents). \u201cI refer to my mother as my first country,\u201d he says, \u201cas a way to reject the idea of nationalism. The womb as a first country, the mother as a land and the act of giving birth as an act of immigration. So you can say we are all immigrants.\u201d When they started work in the studio, Toukabri, now 32, had been in Europe for 15 years, with only brief visits home. Suddenly mother and son were spending three months living and working together. \u201cIt was intense,\u201d says Toukabri. \u201cWe also realised that we had both grown up, but we didn\u2019t know each other.\u201d There were natural hierarchies to navigate, between parent and child, and professional and non-professional dancer. \u201cIt was physically very demanding for me,\u201d says Khamessi of the rehearsal process. \u201cThere was fear that I would not be on the level to deliver. I was always questioning myself.\u201d \u201cBut she managed to transform that fear, the fragility of someone her age, into a strength,\u201d says Toukabri, admiringly. \u201cTo throw herself into it, and that\u2019s because of the love and the passion for dance that was still inside her.\u201d In The Power (of) the Fragile the pair dance, they talk, hold and carry each other, there is physical and emotional intimacy. Toukabri is interested in the personal and the universal; they are being their authentic selves, but \u201csomehow we become a mirror to whoever comes to see us\u201d. He\u2019s found that every person sees something different, probably depending on their own family relationships. When it came to the first performance, Khamessi was gripped with shyness and nerves. \u201cBut now I look forward to going on stage. I can look at people comfortably and make jokes with them, it\u2019s like I\u2019m dancing at home,\u201d she says. She has been surprised how well the audiences have responded to her. \u201cI have a sense of happiness and of pride as well.\u201d Mother and son are obviously very close. Does Khamessi have any parenting advice? \u201cBecome the child\u2019s friend,\u201d Toukabri translates for her. \u201cThat way he can feel close and you can build trust, be transparent with each other. The child will not be afraid to come to you and tell you their secrets, otherwise they will do things behind your back.\u201d Like run off to banned discos, presumably. But she also advises to \u201clook from afar, not invade their personal space\u201d or they will push to escape. It seems to have worked for this family. When Toukabri first became interested in dance, his parents feared it wasn\u2019t something he could make a career from. \u201cBut when they saw that I was really committed, they gave me the space to do what I wanted to do, not project their own fears on their child,\u201d says Toukabri. And in letting Toukabri follow his dreams, Khamessi fulfilled hers, too.

On the eve of a vote on the nature restoration law (NRL) package, the chairman of the centre-right European People\u2019s party (EPP) said the vote was \u201c50-50\u201d with potential for others to join their opposition ranks on Thursday. On Wednesday evening the chair of the environment committee, Pascal Canfin, urged members to vote for the act accusing the EPP of \u201cfake news\u201d over food production. \u201cOur food security depends on protecting nature from collapsing. Yet, the right and the far right are joining forces against the nature restoration law that we\u2019re voting on Thursday. My answers to their fake news,\u201d he said. The proposals are aimed at protecting all endangered ecosystems ranging from rivers and seas to peat bogs and indigenous forests by 2050 through legally binding targets. The UN environment chief Inger Andersen urged MEPs to show leadership for future generations ahead of the vote and deliver on the promises the union made at Cop15 just 6 months ago. She condemned those that had turned restoring biodiversity into a culture war issue. EPP chairman Manfred Weber said his group of MPs supported goals on climate change but said the NRL was \u201ca bad proposal\u201d, which would reduce food production on the continent. \u201cThe overwhelming majority of farmers don\u2019t need any lesson about sustainability, they got their farms from previous generations so they know what sustainability means,\u201d he said. Irish Green party MEP Ciar\u00e1n Cuffe, who is stewarding parallel proposals on renovation of energy inefficient buildings through parliament, said he worried about a potential deeper EPP resistance on climate emergency measures. \u201cI\u2019m concerned that the EPP\u2019s commitment to climate and biodiversity is lukewarm. We have been told they have a kill list of laws they don\u2019t want to see passed. The climate and biodiversity crises have not gone away and if anything we need to step up efforts in the face of foreseen newspaper headlines about extreme temperatures and warming,\u201d he said. While Weber claimed the proposals would harm Europe\u2019s food production by sequestering land for rewilding and other projects, Cuffe said the 12-volume, 5,689-page impact assessment put the economic benefits of restoring nature at \u20ac180bn (\u00a3154bn) compared with the cost of the measures which have been put at \u20ac154bn. The World Wildlife Fund has also argued, along with the Greens, that increasing biodiversity including bees and other pollinators actually improves food production. German MEP Peter Liese, the environment spokesperson for the EPP, said on Wednesday the votes were now split 42:42 of the 84 strong committee with EPP representing 22 of those. \u201cWe have four undecided votes, it will be very tight,\u201d he said. He said one of the main concerns is that the European commission has not set in stone of definition of \u201cdegraded\u201d land or rivers. Under its present guise, it could require 25,000 kilometres of European rivers to be restored to wilderness, he said, impacting the development and existing hydro-electric plants. \u201cThe problem with the impact assessment report is that it was written before the outbreak of war,\u201d said Liese. On Monday, CEOs from 50 companies including Ikea, Nestle and H&amp;M published an open letter voicing their support for the law, warning protecting nature was key to a well-functioning economy. Andersen, the executive director of the UN environment programme, told the Guardian it was critical that the EU delivered on the promises it had made to the world on nature. \u201cTalk is easy. You have to follow through. I think if if the EU does not follow through with the targets that it has in the nature restoration law, it sends a detrimental signal to the global commitment to protect biodiversity and to the tears that we shared that night at 4am in Montreal. It would negate it all. \u201cThere\u2019s a real to do item here: for those folks that sit in the EU parliament to do the right thing by the next generation,\u201d she said. \u201cHow can nature become a culture wars issue? To me, it is absurd. Nature is what feeds us and sustains us. It\u2019s everything.\u201d Last month, EU environment commissioner Virginijus Sinkevi\u010dius warned abandoning the law would send \u201ca dangerous, negative signal to the world\u201d. Alongside separate proposals to reduce pesticide use and climate laws, the NRL is part of the European Green Deal. Weber told reporters in Strasbourg: \u201cWe will not achieve our climate change goals, our goals on biodiversity [if we go] against the rural areas,\u201d he said. Under the proposals, 88 MEPs on the committee leading the passage of the act, will be asked to vote on a version of the European Commission\u2019s proposed laws which has been slightly watered down to try to secure the agreement of the European parliament. They will be asked to support measures to \u201cput in place, without delay, effective and area-based restoration measures which shall collectively cover, by 2030, at least 30% of the union\u2019s land, freshwater and sea areas in need of restoration\u201d. But Weber indicated his group would not be budging. \u201cWe have a lot of concerns which cannot be fixed with this concrete proposal. That\u2019s why we asked for a restart, for a new proposal from the European Commission.\u201d The EPP has already walked out of negotiations on the NRL and is hoping others will join them in opposition to the legislation during the vote on Thursday."}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e70185", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2023/jun/14/after-the-deluge-inside-the-16-june-guardian-weekly", "primaryCategory": "news", "subCategories": [], "title": "After the deluge: inside the 16 June Guardian Weekly", "lead": "Ukraine and the Kakhovka dam burst.

A film about this community of ballsy women in the male world of trucking, dealing with the seedy truck stops and misogyny, might have gone the distance. Instead the movie shifts to Sally and her brother Dennis (Frank Grillo), who is about to be released from prison. It turns out that Sally is being blackmailed by a crime gang, forced to smuggle drugs in her lorry, or Dennis gets it. Her latest package is human \u2013 a 12-year-old girl called Leila (Hala Finley) \u2013 and the delivery is across the state lines into the hands of a paedophile ring. When things go seriously wrong at the drop-off Sally and Leila hit the road. Fair play to the script, which delays the inevitable bonding between Sally and Leila until later on. Sally is no bleeding heart; her first thought is to return the girl to the gang. Enter retired FBI agent Gerick (Morgan Freeman), now working as a consultant for the Bureau.

I\u2019m also chair of the Writers\u2019 Guild of Great Britain (WGGB), a union that represents about 3,000 writers across TV, film, theatre, books, video games and radio. Today, we\u2019re joining colleagues from over 20 countries in a Global Day of Solidarity, organised by the International Affiliation of Writers Guilds and Federation of Screenwriters in Europe. Screenwriters in the US have warned that their profession is increasingly being reduced to a gig economy. Despite the streaming boom producing hundreds of new TV shows, media conglomerates and streamers seem only too willing to sacrifice workers\u2019 rights for their bottom line, using the transition to streaming as an excuse to cut writer pay and erode working conditions. Recent analysis carried out by the Writers Guild of America (WGA), representing 11,500 writers, whose members have been on strike since 2 May, found that the number of TV writers on the lowest levels of pay had grown from 33% to 50% over the last decade. Film writers\u2019 pay had declined by 14% in the last five years. This unsustainable situation does not just threaten to erode the livelihoods and working conditions of writers in the US. It also affects writers across the globe. While the famous faces on the WGA picket lines have made the headlines, it is the jobbing writers who produce episode after episode of our favourite shows that are most in need of a better deal. Lisa Takeuchi Cullen, the vice president of WGA East, recently spoke of a \u201cbroken system\u201d, with writers getting by on 10 weeks of work a year and royalties cheques amounting to pennies. Writers\u2019 stories \u201care resonating with the public\u201d, she said. \u201cWe are not the elite. We are just like them. We are them.\u201d The Writers\u2019 Guild of Great Britain has a history of activism. We negotiated our very first agreement in 1961, laying down basic fees for TV drama writers. We have also staged numerous campaigns: supporting the Public Lending Right for authors in the 1970s; supporting a publicly funded BBC; protesting against homophobic local government legislation in the 1980s; and protesting against bullying and harassment in the creative industries. The circumstances that face writers today are different but no less challenging. AI is threatening to replace writers with chatbots that can generate scripts, which in turn threatens to plunder our intellectual property rights by combing content from the web. Meanwhile, tech companies are turning into commissioners and producers; for them, creators are simply business assets that can be exploited. Trade union solidarity and resistance has never been more relevant, refashioned for a generation where globalisation, technology and corporate greed are diminishing workers\u2019 rights. That\u2019s why writers around the world are taking to the streets today, and will continue refusing to take work in the WGA\u2019s jurisdiction for the duration of their strike. Here in the UK we face obstacles of our own. Trade unions and the right to strike \u2013 even the right to protest \u2013 have faced sustained attacks by successive governments, who have incrementally eroded collective bargaining rights to allow companies to engage non-union workers or refuse to recognise unions at all. Unsurprisingly, this has contributed to lower rates of pay and the worsening of terms and conditions. Most UK writers work on freelance contracts and many are navigating a cost-of-living crisis. It was already hard to break into the industry, or sustain a writing career. Now, it\u2019s even harder. Despite these hurdles, the Writers\u2019 Guild of Great Britain has succeeded in negotiating agreements with a number of broadcasters and producers. We win pay rises for our members annually, and have secured digital agreements compensating writers for the secondary use and sale of their work. Our strong public broadcasting tradition in the UK is a precious foil to the conglomerates that show little regard for the value of creative labour, and we continue to campaign to maintain these important but increasingly fragile services. These wins are the result of hard fought, lengthy and gruelling negotiations and campaigns. And this is exactly what the Writers Guild of America is doing now. Collective action is not a thing of the past, or a fleeting hashtag on your Twitter feed. If writers are good at one thing, it is anticipating how the story turns out. We have the power to face down a Doomsday-style ending where robots, big tech and billionaire business leaders triumph. We can write a happier one \u2013 and we will. \u2022 Lisa Holdsworth is a TV and theatre writer and chair of the Writers\u2019 Guild of Great Britain"}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e70188", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/14/at-91-don-king-still-longs-for-the-spotlight-but-it-is-shining-elsewhere", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": [], "title": "At 91, Don King still longs for the spotlight.

Don King will turn 92 on 20 August. Bob Arum will be 92 on 8 December. Muhammad Ali\u2019s longtime physician Ferdie Pacheco once suggested: \u201cThink of Don King as a sledgehammer and Bob Arum as a stiletto.\u201d British promoter Mickey Duff remarked: \u201cOne\u2019s Black and one\u2019s white. That\u2019s the only difference.\u201d But King and Arum are too complex for simple caricature. During their sojourns through boxing, they\u2019ve shown themselves to be brilliant, imaginative, focused and driven. They\u2019re admired by some and disliked by others. Arum is still a force in boxing, although the calendar suggests that he\u2019s nearing the end of his long impressive run. King\u2019s carriage turned into a pumpkin years ago. That contrast was on display this past weekend when King and Arum promoted back-to-back fight cards on 9 and 10 June. On 9 June, King promoted a show at Casino Miami Jai Alai headlined by a past-his-prime Adrien Broner. Several thousand fans watched it on DonKing.com and Fite.tv pay-per-view streams at a cost of $24.99. Twenty-four hours later at Madison Square Garden, Top Rank (Arum\u2019s promotional company) promoted a major fight card headlined by Josh Taylor v Te\u00f3fimo L\u00f3pez that was viewed by more than a million people on ESPN. King\u2019s impact on American life extended far beyond boxing. He was Black and from the streets. Rather than hide his background, he forced America to accept him as he was. He was the first Black man to dominate a major industry in the United States. We\u2019re not talking about an athlete, singer or movie star who made his mark by entertaining people. We\u2019re talking about commerce and economic control. King was larger than boxing. Over the years, he met with Nelson Mandela, Mikhail Gorbachev, Vladimir Putin, Leonid Brezhnev, two Popes (John Paul II and Benedict XVI), Tony Blair, Fidel Castro, Ferdinand Marcos and eight US Presidents. Also, as he once recited: \u201cmost of the people who have been president of a country in Africa, some Chinese heads of state, every president of Mexico for 30 years, and more senators, governors, and mayors than you can count.\u201d Seth Abraham, the architect of HBO\u2019s boxing program, once observed that \u201cDon was incredibly creative in making his fights bigger than just a boxing match and infusing them with sociological importance. Look at how he turned Ali-Foreman into one of the major cultural events of the 1970s by taking the fight to Zaire.\u201d Even today, long removed from his glory years, King is one of the most recognizable people on the planet for those who remember his time in the spotlight. But now, for the first time since the mid 1970s, he doesn\u2019t have promotional rights to a world champion. And the occasional fight cards that he does promote are small events. Arum, like King, made big fights at the right time. And like a good fighter, he made adjustments as time went by. As the world changed, Top Rank thrived by staying ahead of the curve. Abraham, who worked with Arum for years, declared that \u201cBob is the most advanced thinker ever in the marriage of television and boxing. Don operated largely in the present. Bob was always thinking down the road.\u201d Arum didn\u2019t invent pay-per-view, the internet and social media. But he used them well. He was the first major player in boxing to understand and exploit the power of the Hispanic market in the United States. And unlike King, Arum was willing to delegate authority and rely on the judgment of people he trusted. As he aged, that became increasingly important. King\u2019s fight card in Miami last Friday was evocative of a carnival sideshow. Broner was once a star but self-destructed in and out of the ring. Now 33, he had scored one win in the previous six years \u2013 a decision over Jovanie Santiago in a fight that most observers thought Broner lost. Bill Hutchinson, Broner\u2019s 34-year-old opponent, had 20 wins in 26 fights with no recognizable names on his resume. Hutchinson says that he is a licensed attorney who graduated from the University of Pittsburgh law school and that he works as in-house counsel in Pennsylvania and Florida in addition to consulting with multiple businesses. On the fistic side, Hutchinson had scored one win in the preceding 42 months \u2013 a six-round decision over a fighter named Rondale Hubbert who has won twice in his last 21 outings. An April press conference in Las Vegas to formally announce the fight was called off when Broner failed to appear. King and Broner finally sat together in the promoter\u2019s Deerfield Beach, Florida, office for an internet stream on 9 May. King was wearing black slacks and a conservative gray sport jacket festooned with ribbons and pins. His famed \u201cOnly in America\u201d jacket was nowhere in sight. There was a time when King had a nobility about him. Watching him at the May press conference was sad. He looked old (which he is) and rambled (which was not uncommon during his years in the spotlight). But King\u2019s monologues are less entertaining now than they were in the past. This one was a disjointed sermon about Donald Trump, Joe Biden, Putin and Ukraine. Broner seemed almost disdainful of him during the proceedings. More to the point, the Broner fight didn\u2019t seem to make economic sense for King. Broner was reported to be getting a $1m purse. Most likely, that number was exponentially exaggerated for publicity purposes. But there appeared to be no logical way that King could recoup the fighters\u2019 purses and other expenses out of the live gate, pay-per-view buys and auxiliary income that the bout was expected to generate. The final pre-fight press conference for Broner-Hutchinson had been announced for 6 June at 3pm. But there was no press conference; only a short musical loop that repeated again and again until 3.52pm when the festivities began. Eight minutes later, the stream cut off. Twenty minutes after that, it came back on but a reverberating echo made it unintelligible for another five minutes. By then, Broner and Hutchinson had already spoken and King was holding an Israeli flag, talking about being a world peace ambassador to moderate the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and castigating Biden. \u201cThis is great,\u201d King proclaimed when it was over. \u201cWhat a press conference.\u201d Fight night was a dreary occasion. Less than five miles away, the Miami Heat were hosting the Denver Nuggets in Game 4 of the NBA finals. King\u2019s 10-bout card was not well attended. The pay-per-view stream dragged on for six hours. Fans had been told that Hutchinson was tough, confident and determined. He might have been all of those things. But he wasn\u2019t a good fighter. \u201cHe can\u2019t hurt Broner,\u201d commentator Nate Campbell told viewers as the bout progressed. \u201cHe ain\u2019t no puncher. He doesn\u2019t have an idea how to fight this fight.\u201d Broner cruised to a 100-90, 99-91, 99-91 decision and, in an interview with Ray Mancini afterward, proclaimed, \u201cRight now, I need some pussy.\u201d King seemed happy. Fight night energized him. He can\u2019t take his money with him, so why not spend it and have a good time? One night later, Arum and Top Rank took center stage at Madison Square Garden. In contrast to King\u2019s promotion in Miami, Taylor-L\u00f3pez was the most intriguing fight shown on television in the United States so far this year that didn\u2019t require viewers to pay a pay-per-view charge or subscription fee. Both men are skilled athletes in their prime, and were fighting for Taylor\u2019s WBO junior welterweight title. Adding to the drama, in late May, L\u00f3pez had declared: \u201cThis is a kill-or-be-killed sport. I want to kill Josh Taylor. When I fought [Vasiliy] Lomachenko, I took his heart. With Taylor, he don\u2019t got no heart. So what can I really take from this man? His life.\u201d The next day, Taylor responded: \u201cHe can come try and take my life. Let\u2019s see who is the one who ends up in the back of an ambulance.\u201d In a well-run sport, the threat of killing by a participant would result in punitive measures by that sport\u2019s governing body. In boxing, these threats are viewed as a marketing opportunity. A sold-out crowd of 5,151 packed the Garden\u2019s Hulu Theater. Top Rank had six prospects on the undercard. Five of them won and the sixth would have but for an accidental clash of heads that led to a no-decision. The main event was fought at a high skill level. But Taylor was playing checkers and Lopez was playing chess. The 117-111, 115-113, 115-113 decision in Teofimo\u2019s favor was far closer than warranted. \u201cI\u2019ve got no excuses,\u201d Taylor said afterward. \u201cI fought to the best of my ability. He was better than me tonight. Congratulations to Te\u00f3fimo.\u201d The evening showed that Arum is still a significant force in boxing. King is not. But in considering both men, there\u2019s another factor to keep in mind. Arum could walk down any street in the world unnoticed. Even today, wherever King goes, he commands attention. People in boxing are asked all the time: \u201cDo you know Don King?\u201d One is rarely asked: \u201cDo you know Bob Arum?\u201d Thomas Hauser\u2019s most recent book \u2013 In the Inner Sanctum: Behind the Scenes at Big Fights \u2013 was published by the University of Arkansas Press.

Dutton offered that defence of his tactics on Wednesday at a conference ahead of the second question time this week where the Coalition targeted the finance minister, Katy Gallagher, over her knowledge of Higgins\u2019 allegation before it was aired publicly. In parliament, Labor senators urged the Coalition to consider whether probing Gallagher\u2019s relationship with Higgins\u2019 partner, David Sharaz, was \u201cethical\u201d and warned that release of Higgins\u2019 text messages could prevent alleged victims and survivors of sexual assault speaking out. Dutton was challenged by an attender of the Local Government Association conference in Canberra that the Coalition\u2019s tactics \u201care doing more harm than good for those impacted\u201d. He responded by noting that Labor had \u201casked something like 45 questions in parliament in relation to the same issue\u201d last year. After a minor breakout with two Liberals backing an inquiry into how Higgins\u2019 texts became public, Dutton clarified that he shares the attorney general\u2019s view that the Australian Federal Police should investigate the leak. Lawyers for Network Ten have confirmed they asked the AFP to investigate \u201ca suspected contempt of court in relation to material produced under an AFP warrant and a subpoena issued in the ACT supreme court which appears to have been disclosed to the media\u201d. \u201cWe have a system of legal practice in our country, that is a very important principle in relation to the way in which courts operate,\u201d Dutton said. \u201cI share the view in relation to the leaking of the information that\u2019s been published in the papers. The matter, as the attorney general pointed out yesterday, has been referred to the AFP for investigation.\u201d Dutton said he takes sexual assault \u201cvery seriously\u201d and that someone accused of the crime should be tried by judge and jury with \u201cguilt found according to our system of law\u201d which \u201cshouldn\u2019t be subverted by any process\u201d. \u201cIn terms of our questioning of the government, a key democratic element of our system of government in a Westminster system is to hold the government to account. \u201cThe questions we\u2019re asking at the moment in relation to whether the government conspired to seek political advantage out of an alleged sexual assault are absolutely reasonable for us to ask in question time. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t demean the allegation of sexual assault, it doesn\u2019t seek to second guess the court process that has taken place in ACT. It doesn\u2019t seek [to prove] innocence or guilt of any party in this matter, it seeks to hold the government to account for their [handling].\u201d Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Bruce Lehrmann was charged with the alleged sexual assault of Higgins but vehemently denied the allegations and maintained his innocence. An initial trial was aborted last year due to jury misconduct and prosecutors dropped the charges against Lehrmann amid concerns about the impact a second trial could have on Higgins\u2019 mental health. In House of Representatives question time, the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, continued to back Gallagher\u2019s account that she did not mislead the Senate when she said \u201cno one had any knowledge\u201d of Higgins\u2019 allegation. Albanese explained that she had been responding to a suggestion she had known weeks before and was somehow responsible for the matter becoming public. In Senate question time, Gallagher urged Coalition senators to consider \u201chow this debate and the ongoing coverage of it is impacting on all the women out there\u201d. Gallagher stared down cries of \u201chypocrite\u201d and interjections comparing her treatment of the allegation with \u201cthe consideration you had for Senator [Linda] Reynolds\u201d when Labor probed the Coalition\u2019s handling of the complaint in 2021. Gallagher maintained that she told no one about the complaint before it aired. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t my story. It was Ms Higgins\u2019 story,\u201d Gallagher said. \u201cI don\u2019t intend to breach that confidence now, and I didn\u2019t then.\u201d The Liberal senator Sarah Henderson referred to some of the leaked texts between Higgins and Sharaz, where he described Gallagher as a \u201cfriend\u201d and asked about reports that Gallagher was invited to Sharaz\u2019s first wedding. Gallagher said she did not recall being invited until it was reported but after checking, she could confirm she had declined that invitation. \u201cI\u2019m not responsible for how people describe their relationship with me,\u201d she said. After question time, Labor senator Anne Urquhart said that Higgins has the right to not have her name \u201cdrawn through the mud here, every single day\u201d. Urquhart noted that Gallagher, the minister for women, had been \u201ccontacted by women\u2019s organisations about the effect on those women to now have the courage to stand up and to speak out\u201d. \u201cWhat this says is how they will be treated in this country if they do.

All four of Nato\u2019s Asia-Pacific partners (AP4) \u2013 Australia, South Korea, New Zealand and Japan \u2013 have been invited. Nato\u2019s membership is comprised of European and North American countries, but it works in various ways with non-member countries including the AP4.

The relationship between Nato and the AP4 dated back for years, Grgic said, while Australia\u2019s cooperation intensified with its presence in Afghanistan. She said the rise of China as a challenge as well as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine had seen a shift towards more coordination between Europe and the Atlantic and the Indo-Pacific. \u201cThe Sino-Russian cooperation extends to coordination in other domains. This is something that obviously worries countries that are liberal democracies,\u201d she said. Nikkei Asia has reported the Australian and New Zealand ITPPs \u201cwill address crosscutting security issues of global concern \u2013 including maritime security, new technologies, cyberspace, the impact of climate change on security and resilience \u2013 through tailored political and military consultations, joint training and exercises, and cooperation in Nato-led operations and missions\u201d. Grgic said there was a regional trend among US allies to form more flexible associations between themselves (\u201cspoke to spoke\u201d) rather than going through more traditional, US-led alliances (\u201chub to spoke\u201d). The ITPPs, she said, would be \u201cmuch more ambitious \u2026 maybe more detailed in terms of holding Nato and the partners to account in terms of timelines and goals to achieve\u201d. But she also emphasised that the planned office in Japan was a liaison office, not any kind of military setup, and that the partnerships were also about factors beyond the China issue. Nato\u2019s assistant secretary general for public diplomacy, Baiba Braze, visited Canberra in April and met with officials from Dfat and with the chief of the Australian Defence Force, Gen Angus Campbell. \u201cDid you know that Nato has more than 40 partner countries around the world?

Donald Trump was arrested and formally charged with federal crimes \u2013 a first for an American former president. He was hit with 37 counts, to be precise, related to his retaining and failing to return the reams of sensitive classified documents that weren\u2019t his to keep. Naturally, Trump insisted on his innocence. \u201cWe most certainly enter a plea of not guilty,\u201d his lawyer said in court on Tuesday afternoon. Bizarre as this historic episode was, it also seemed familiar. There was Trump waving as he approached the federal courthouse in Miami, wearing his usual boxy blue suit and too-long red tie, after denying everything that is obvious and depicting himself as the aggrieved victim of a politicized system. \u201cI never thought it possible that such a thing could happen to a former President of the United States, who received far more votes than any sitting President in the history of our Country and is currently leading, by far, all Candidates, both Democrat and Republican, in Polls of the 2024 Presidential election,\u201d he declared in one recent social media post, adding his trademark all-caps kicker: \u201cI AM AN INNOCENT MAN.\u201d His self-defense, as usual, is not strong on logic. Trump continually tries to draw a connection where there isn\u2019t one: between being popular and being above the law. Maybe it works like that in authoritarian countries, but it\u2019s not the American way. His facts are twisted out of context, too. Recall that Trump lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton in 2016; she had the largest popular vote margin of any losing presidential candidate in American history; and, of course, in 2020, Trump lost altogether \u2013 and decisively \u2013 to Joe Biden. Tuesday\u2019s day-long spectacle was inevitable. So was Trump\u2019s victimized rhetoric \u2013 \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything wrong,\u201d he insisted to one interviewer in recent days, even though we\u2019ve all seen the images of sensitive documents sitting beneath a chandelier in a gaudy Mar-a-Lago bathroom. And some of us have read the stunning indictment, more persuasive than even that damning photograph. So stunning that even the longtime Trump loyalist, former attorney general Bill Barr, opined (on Fox News, no less) that he was \u201cshocked by the degree of sensitivity of these documents and how many there were, frankly\u201d. Barr added, memorably, about the indictment, \u201cIf even half of it is true, he\u2019s toast.\u201d Even the invertebrate South Carolina Republican senator, Lindsey Graham, expressed some mild misgivings when a reporter asked him if Trump might be at fault. \u201cMost politicians get in trouble,\u201d Graham allowed, \u201cbecause of self-inflicted wounds.\u201d It almost sounded like criticism; he\u2019ll have to pay for that. The spectacle, the lies, the whining \u2013 all predictable, and in some ways, meaningless. What matters is that, in a democracy, laws matter and they should apply to everyone. And of course, it ought to be noted that, in practice, the rule of law doesn\u2019t apply equally to everyone, as civil rights lawyer Alec Karakatsanis observed in an astringent Yale Law Journal piece a few years ago. He wrote about the US\u2019s brutal \u201cpunishment bureaucracy\u201d that unfairly disadvantages poor people and people of color \u2013 throwing them in prison for minor offenses, and making a mockery of the idealistic idea that our criminal justice system is objective. Through that realistic lens, Trump is at a huge advantage in the justice system. With his array of lawyers, his deep pockets, his cult following, the federal judges he appointed, his ability to sway public opinion and his immense political power, he is light years from being a singled-out victim. So yes, it\u2019s heartening to see some modicum of the rule of law holding sway in Trump\u2019s latest arrest. It\u2019s encouraging to see the myriad ways that the legal system is beginning to catch up to him in New York, in Georgia and in Washington. But justice for the lawless Trump has been far too long in coming. And who knows whether he really will be held responsible in the long run, or whether he\u2019ll find a way, as usual, to escape accountability. There\u2019s really nothing for this former president and forever conman to cry about \u2013 except his own endless misdeeds, should he ever decide to cop to them.

Sign up for our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning After a brief stint in the US army, Romita Sr returned to comics in the 1950s, splitting his time between Marvel and DC, where he made his name on romance work. It wasn\u2019t until 1966 that he began drawing for Marvel\u2019s The Amazing Spider-Man \u2013 a gig that would last five years and become his most well-known work. He replaced the artist Steve Ditko, and started working with the late Marvel stalwart Stan Lee on the series. Within a year, the comic had become Marvel\u2019s top seller, overtaking Fantastic Four. Romita Sr\u2019s tenure saw the introduction of several memorable characters in the Spider-Man universe, including Peter Parker\u2019s love interest Mary Jane Watson, as well as the shadowy underworld figure Kingpin and outsized supervillain the Rhino. He also had a hand in the story The Night Gwen Stacy Died, widely remembered as a seminal Spider-Man arc featuring the death of Peter Parker\u2019s girlfriend. Eventually, Romita Sr\u2019s role morphed into an unofficial art director position at Marvel, a title that was made official in 1973. He served for more than two decades in the role, where he oversaw the design and introduction of Wolverine; the bloodthirsty antihero The Punisher; and Luke Cage \u2013 one of the first Black superheroes to gain protagonist status at Marvel. He left Marvel in 1996 to go into semi-retirement, though he continued working on numerous Marvel projects late into his career, including the 30th anniversary of The Amazing Spider-Man in 1992.

The story breaks almost the moment he walks through the door and he hears it here first, told as he enters the room. It\u2019s not official yet and he can\u2019t find anything to confirm it, but it soon will be: Lionel Messi is going to Miami. As for the man who laid on 23 of the Argentinian\u2019s goals, the best left-back Barcelona ever had, the captain of Spain too, there\u2019s no news there either. He doesn\u2019t know where he\u2019s going, not yet. Only that he won\u2019t be here any more. \u201cIt\u2019s too soon,\u201d Alba says at Barcelona\u2019s Sant Joan Desp\u00ed training ground. \u201cI\u2019m still getting used to this; it\u2019s not easy to go somewhere else.\u201d A winner of 18 major trophies with club and country, he had never intended to leave the Camp Nou but after a summer when the hints were not exactly subtle and a season in which for the first time in a decade his role was reduced, starting 14 league games, a victim of finance as much as football, he decided the time had come to depart \u2013 even without a final destination. His first stop is Las Rozas, the Spanish federation\u2019s place 25km north-west of Madrid. After three days training with Barcelona\u2019s B team at Sant Joan Desp\u00ed he will be there with the country\u2019s best players to prepare for the Nations League semi-final against Italy on Thursday. For the first time, at 34, he will be wearing the armband, leading a new era under a new manager, the fifth of his international career. \u201cIt was a surprise that Luis Enrique didn\u2019t continue because he was a spectacular coach who built a great group with very young players, but people speak well of Luis de la Fuente and I\u2019m looking forward to it,\u201d Alba says. \u201cAnd against Italy who, for good and bad, I\u2019ve faced lots of times. They\u2019re in reconstruction, like us, but Italy is Italy.\u201d If Alba admits the call-up was a surprise, it serves as a reminder that he\u2019s not done yet and he is not searching for semi-retirement; it may, though, be all he can get, his least eloquent answer almost becoming his most eloquent, a glimpse of the uncertainty, the fear of ruling out options he may need. When it\u2019s put to him that a player who has just returned to the selecci\u00f3n, given the chance to prove people wrong \u2013 and boy does Alba love to prove people wrong \u2013 doesn\u2019t go leaving the European elite, he replies: \u201cYes \u2026 no \u2026 well \u2026 look \u2026\u201d \u201cI\u2019m really happy to be back in the squad. I\u2019m looking forward to it and I see myself being able to stay there for some time,\u201d he says. \u201cBut that\u2019s a decision I have to take independently of the national team. If I had a couple of clubs, maybe I\u2019d be able to tell you: \u2018I prefer this kind of option.\u2019 But I have nothing so I prefer to wait, see the best option on a sporting level but also for everything else, including the family. Wherever it is, [to continue with Spain] you have to compete, to be in good shape physically.\u201d And so, passport on the table, to the inevitable question. There has been interest from Internazionale and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, Inter Miami have asked and Saudi Arabia circles, but what about England? \u201cYou see the Premier, the atmosphere there. I talk to teammates in the selecci\u00f3n who have played there and they say England\u2019s special. I always had the idea that \u2018one day maybe \u2026\u2019 But I was always focused on Barcelona and the Spanish league so I didn\u2019t really think about any other league.\u201d Now he has to. \u201cOf course, but I have to see which teams want me first. And then \u2026 well, I\u2019m open to all sorts of proposals, in Europe, outside Europe. Wherever I go, we\u2019ll be fine, but it\u2019s not easy. I want to weigh everything up.\u201d That doesn\u2019t sound much like a man who wanted to leave, still less someone who had it all planned. Alba resisted efforts to force him out last August, the club desperate to save his salary and pushing a loan deal with Inter, then in October declared his intention to retire at Barcelona. \u201cYes, yes, this is what I wanted,\u201d he says of going now, not entirely convincingly. \u201cI thought about it carefully and agreed with my family. When I said I wanted to stay that\u2019s how I felt but taking everything into account it\u2019s the right moment to leave. Of course if I\u2019d been playing more minutes, maybe I wouldn\u2019t have reached this point, had those thoughts. I\u2019ve been at this club 18 years; it\u2019s half my life. \u201cAfter so many years, having won it all, you have to assimilate that you\u2019re going. But the decision is mine, without anyone telling me what to do. The club, the president; they gave me the chance to choose. I had earned that right.\u201d How freely he could choose is another matter. The club\u2019s captains, its veterans, had come to be seen as a problem: pushed towards the door, they became scapegoats for Barcelona\u2019s financial crisis, their performances judged through cost \u2013 accused of being an obstacle to progress at best, of sinking them at worse. Here\u2019s a sample headline from last autumn: \u201cBusquets, Piqu\u00e9 and Alba: a \u20ac200m mortgage.\u201d And yet although Gerard Piqu\u00e9 has retired and Sergio Busquets and Alba are going, still Barcelona must cut almost \u20ac300m. The news that breaks as Alba walks in underlines that: Messi is not coming because they can\u2019t afford him. Small wonder Piqu\u00e9 pointedly noted: \u201cI wonder who\u2019s got to go now. They said we were responsible because of our salaries but we\u2019ve gone and they still can\u2019t sign.\u201d It is a line in which Alba sees himself reflected and it has occasionally felt as if he paid for his contract: there was an economic need for him to be left out as much a footballing one, not so far-fetched to think he would have played more had he been cheaper, while the criticism has sometimes been as fierce as it is unfair \u2013 the captains accused of not helping the club through its crisis, as if they created it. With an agreement finally reached to rescind the remaining year on his contract, Alba tries to bite his tongue where once he might have bitten back, which didn\u2019t always help. He is quick to point beyond the club to ill-defined people outside. But he doesn\u2019t hide that it has stung. At his farewell, president Joan Laporta publicly thanked him for \u201cdemonstrating your barcelonismo, helping the club economically by waiving an important part of your salary to give us the margin to sign\u201d, and it is telling that those are words he returns to repeatedly. There\u2019s been a lot thrown his way. Alba smiles. \u201cBut it\u2019s not the club, it\u2019s more the entorno, everything around the club. There are times I\u2019ve made mistakes, I\u2019ve done things I could have avoided, said things I shouldn\u2019t and people criticise you for that. It\u2019s normal. Not everyone can like you. But there have been so many lies and sometimes you find people mix players in with things that are nothing to do with them. In the end the truth has come out. The president, who\u2019s the man in charge, who has all the accounts, said I left the right way, that they\u2019re grateful. \u201cWe all know the economic needs but that\u2019s not about one player. I\u2019ve always said the problem isn\u2019t me, I\u2019ve always had a clear conscience. I did the right things, I helped the club at every moment. And they have always helped me. In the end people have realised. The club and people know what I\u2019m like. When I talk, it\u2019s true. I can\u2019t control what people say, come out every five or 10 days and say: \u2018That\u2019s false.\u2019 The manager decided I had to have less protagonism. I think I\u2019ve been good when I\u2019ve been given the chance to play. That\u2019s what I hold on to. It\u2019s not easy to go from 10 years of playing every game to that. I think I\u2019ve handled it well. \u201cThe club know the \u2018efforts\u2019 I\u2019ve made at certain moments or what I am doing by going now. They gave me the chance to stay another year. It would have been very easy to. It\u2019s my home. But I thought the right thing to do, the just thing, the honest thing, was to step to one side. No one forced me.\u201d Alba says he has been \u201cvalue for money\u201d, that \u201cthe problem wasn\u2019t me, or Piqu\u00e9, or Busquets\u201d and that \u201cwhen you leave, maybe people look back and value you more\u201d. He admits he appreciates what he had \u201ceven more\u201d than when he played every match. \u201cBut,\u201d Alba says, \u201cI have always felt affection from the fans. There are lots of lies told, people believe them and that can damage you. [On my last night] at the Camp Nou, everyone applauded me, spoke well of me. That\u2019s what I take with me. It brings me tranquility for the president to have corroborated that at my goodbye. He said that they were very grateful for everything I had done in that [economic] sense. \u201cIn the end, you have to value everything I\u2019ve done in sporting terms too. The economic question has been talked about a lot but I think other things should be talked about, everything I\u2019ve done, we\u2019ve all done, over all these years.\u201d And therein lies the point. Here we are talking vindication: 458 games, 27 goals and 94 assists. Ever-present in the team that won six leagues, five cups and a Champions League. There\u2019s a smile. A list too of the moments that most marked him, beginning with the first time he had to leave Barcelona, aged 16, to join tiny third-tier Cornella, a rejection that should have hurt but didn\u2019t. \u201cActually, I had a great time,\u201d Alba says, and it is easily the most animated, most enthusiastic he is in the whole conversation, a kind of innocence, a fun to these memories. \u201cBarcelona is the best school in the world but I knew it was hard and I always had that in mind: I was sure I would make it and if that wasn\u2019t with Barcelona, I always told my dad that I wanted to go to Cornella. I\u2019m from Hospitalet but I always liked Cornella. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I would play for Barcelona so long, that I would be in the national team 11 years, no, no, no, but I did think that even if I left Barcelona I would go to Cornella and make it to primera. There was a debut with Valencia, the return to Barcelona, Euro 2012, the goal \u2013 that was spectacular \u2013 the treble in 2015. And then the goodbye: it\u2019s not a title but it\u2019s a very nice moment that makes you happy. I left a good way with the affection of all the fans and I feel very fortunate.\u201d"}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e7018e", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/14/when-motherwell-won-a-copa-del-rey-and-other-foreign-cup-triumphs", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": [], "title": "When Motherwell won a Copa del Rey and other foreign cup triumphs | The Knowledge", "lead": "Plus: World Cup winners claiming solo silverware and the biggest gaps between top scorers", "author": "Guardian sport", "datePublished": "2023-06-14T07:00:06Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.294738", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/b49066c1c120a8e13f1b8891c01c5f2223ac55de/0_8_790_474/500.jpg", "body": "\u201cHave just found out that Motherwell are the only non-Spanish side to win the Copa del Rey,\u201d tweets Dave Chamberlain. \u201cAre there any other examples of teams winning another country\u2019s cup competition whilst not being a member of their FA?\u201d Let\u2019s start with a bit of housekeeping: specifically, Motherwell winning the Copa del Rey. It happened in 1927, although there\u2019s an asterisk against the whole thing. No, not that sort of asterisk. Real Uni\u00f3n beat Arenas 1-0 in the official Copa del Rey final. The clean sheet was kept by Antonio Emery Amocena, grandfather of Unai (who bought a stake in the club in 2021, but that\u2019s another story). At the end of the 1926-27 season, the Royal Spanish Football Federation invited Motherwell (runners-up in the Scottish league) and Swansea (12th in the old Division Two) to take part in a special edition of the competition. They faced each other for the right to play Real Madrid, whose team included a number of players from other clubs, in the final. Motherwell beat Swansea 4-3, a match King Alfonso XIII of Spain reportedly described as a \u201cbrilliant display of scientific football\u201d, then outclassed the Madrid select XI 3-1. You can read more about it on the official Motherwell site. There\u2019s another example from Scotland worthy of mention, though it involves a near-miss rather than actual trophy-lifting glory. \u201cWhile Motherwell won a Copa del Rey rather than the Copa del Rey, a Scottish side has reached the final of the FA Cup twice \u2013 though without winning,\u201d writes Alasdair Brooks. \u201cQueen\u2019s Park lost to Blackburn in both 1884 and 1885. The Scottish FA banned Scottish sides from participating in the English tournament in 1887, after six teams from north of the border (Queen\u2019s Park, Partick Thistle, Hearts, Renton, Third Lanark and Rangers) entered the 1886-87 cup, with Rangers reaching the semi-finals.\u201d For obvious reasons, Britain is fertile ground for this question. A number of English clubs have won the Welsh Cup, with Hereford the most recent in 1989-90. English teams in close proximity to Wales, particularly from border areas, were invited to beef up the competition until the rules were changed in the mid-1990s. In Germany, Rapid Vienna won the 1938 Tschammer-Pokal (now the DFB-Pokal) \u2013 although the match was actually played in January 1939, 10 months after the Anschluss. Next to south-east Asia, where, in 2010, the Thai team Bangkok Glass won the Singapore Cup thanks to an own goal from the former Sheffield United defender Beno\u00eet Croissant. All these success stories pale next to the achievements of the Singapore FA team, who won the Malaysia Cup 24 times between 1921 and 1994, when they famously hammered their rivals Pahang 4-0 in the final. The Singapore FA had decided to withdraw from the tournament, so it was the last game they played in it. \u201cA dispute over gate receipts, the omnipresent whiff of match-fixing and even the Lions\u2019 enviable success perhaps all contributed to the breakup, despite the fact that Singapore had been represented in the Malaysia Cup in 1921,\u201d wrote Neil Humphreys for an ESPN feature in 2015. \u201cIt didn\u2019t matter. Singapore football had to start over.\u201d At international level, Mexico have come close to winning the Copa Am\u00e9rica on a few occasions. They were first invited along with the United States in 1993 when Conmebol decided to expand the tournament to 12 teams. Mexico didn\u2019t win any of their group games, but sneaked through to the quarter-finals as one of the best third-placed teams. They hammered Peru 4-2 in the quarters, took care of the hosts Ecuador 2-0 in the semis \u2013 but then ran into a rampant Gabriel Batistuta in the final. He scored twice in a 2-1 win for Argentina. Mexico were runners-up again in 2001, this time losing 1-0 to the hosts, Colombia, in the final, and have reached the semis of three other Copas in 1997, 1999 and 2007. The United States (1995, 2016) and Honduras (2001) have also reached the semi-finals. One World Cup, one Hong Kong Senior Shield \u201cBobby Moore is the only player to have won both the men\u2019s World Cup and the Hong Kong Senior Shield, having won the latter in 1982 with Eastern Athletic Association,\u201d explains K\u00e1ri Tulinius. \u201cAre there any other trophies that have been won by just a single World Cup-winning player?\u201d An excellent question. \u201cI put this question to my friends in our football trivia WhatsApp group, and here\u2019s what we came up with,\u201d notes Mark Cooper, setting our messaging peer group jealousy levels high. \u201cAmong England players, Jack Charlton won the 1975-76 Anglo-Scottish Cup as Middlesbrough manager, while squad member Terry Paine won the Welsh Cup with Hereford as a player in the same season. \u201cFurther afield, France\u2019s St\u00e9phane Guivarc\u2019h won the 1997-98 Scottish League Cup with Rangers, while Italy\u2019s Alessandro Nesta won the Canadian Championship with Montreal Impact in 2013,\u201d he adds. \u201cFinally, just last week, West Ham\u2019s Alphonse Areola became the first player to win the World Cup and Europa Conference League.\u201d Thanks Mark, and a hat-tip to Tom, Liam, Simon, Chris and Paddy too. Here\u2019s David Carr with another example from 1966. \u201cGeoff Hurst is the only World Cup winner to have won the Watney Cup,\u201d he writes. \u201cHe was in the Stoke team that beat Hull in the 1973 final.

Are there any other umpires in international cricket (present or past) who publicly pledged their allegiance to a football club?\u201d Roy Proctor was on hand with a few answers. \u201cThe most obvious cricket umpire to have a publicly acknowledged football affiliation is the incomparable Harold \u2018Dickie\u2019 Bird, who in an article for the Guardian in 2008 proclaimed: \u2018I\u2019ve supported Barnsley for 70 years so there\u2019s no way I will miss this afternoon.\u2019 The afternoon in question was an FA Cup quarter-final between the Tykes and Chelsea, a match Barnsley won. Another, more current, umpire is Ian Gould, a wicketkeeper who played in goal for Slough Town and Arsenal, earning him the nickname \u2018Gunner\u2019. In July 2009, Gould became chairman of Burnham FC of the Southern Football League.

McCarthy died in his home of natural causes. His son John confirmed the death. Widely seen as one of the US\u2019s greatest novelists, McCarthy was best known for The Road, the 2006 post-apocalyptic novel about a journey taken by a father and his son. Other critically acclaimed books by McCarthy are All the Pretty Horses and No Country for Old Men, both of which were turned into films. The Coen brothers\u2019 No Country for Old Men, in 2007, dominated that year\u2019s Academy Awards and won best picture, while the 2009 film of The Road was also well received. Other authors shared their thoughts on the death of their contemporary. Stephen King wrote on Twitter: \u201cCormac McCarthy, maybe the greatest American novelist of my time, has passed away at 89. He was full of years and created a fine body of work, but I still mourn his passing.\u201d Born in Providence, Rhode Island, in 1933, McCarthy chronicled \u2013 in pared-back, dense, austere prose that prompted comparisons with authors including Herman Melville and William Faulkner \u2013 the violent lives of troubled characters. These ranged from No Country for Old Men\u2019s Llewelyn Moss, who steals a case full of money from a scene of violent death near the Rio Grande and finds himself hunted, to the unnamed father and son in The Road, who walk a post-apocalyptic American hellscape peopled with cannibals and rapists. For John Banville, McCarthy was an \u201cextraordinary novelist, one of the very finest at work today, in America and in the wider world\u201d, whose \u201cwork stands proud of the literary landscape, like one of those majestic, sharp-shadowed buttes in Monument Valley, though his colours can be as delicate as the palest shades of the Painted Desert\u201d. Saul Bellow, who chose him as a recipient of the MacArthur \u201cgenius\u201d grant in 1981, praised his \u201cabsolutely overpowering use of language, his life-giving and death-dealing sentences\u201d, while the literary critic Harold Bloom called McCarthy\u2019s novel Blood Meridian \u201cnot only the ultimate western\u201d but \u201cthe ultimate dark dramatisation of violence\u201d, placing him alongside three other contemporaries he said had touched the sublime: Philip Roth, Don DeLillo and Thomas Pynchon. Mary Mount, McCarthy\u2019s publisher at Picador said she and her colleagues \u201care immensely proud to have been the British publishers of Cormac McCarthy over many decades and across an extraordinary body of work. He was a writer of great vision and great beauty and it was an enormous thrill to hear his voice again so recently in his last published works: The Passenger and Stella Maris in 2022.\u201d McCarthy gave few interviews, with details about his life sparse for decades. He grew up outside Knoxville, Tennessee, dropped out of the University of Tennessee, and joined the US air force for four years before going back to university, dropping out again, and beginning to write novels in 1959. His 1965 debut The Orchard Keeper, written while he worked as an auto mechanic and living in poverty, told of a young boy in rural Tennessee, and the outlaw who has killed his father. It was followed by novels including 1968\u2019s Outer Dark, in which a woman has her brother\u2019s child; 1973\u2019s Child of God, about a serial killer in the hill country of east Tennessee; and the semi-autobiographical Suttree in 1979, which was often described as his funniest novel. It was in 1985, with Blood Meridian, that McCarthy found critical acclaim. Based on real events on the Texas-Mexico border in the 1850s, it follows the story of a 14-year-old Tennessean who finds himself in a world where Native Americans are being murdered. The New York Times said it \u201cmay be the bloodiest book since the Iliad\u201d in a rare piece which included an interview with the novelist. \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as life without bloodshed,\u201d McCarthy told the paper. \u201cI think the notion that the species can be improved in some way, that everyone could live in harmony, is a really dangerous idea. Those who are afflicted with this notion are the first ones to give up their souls, their freedom. Your desire that it be that way will enslave you and make your life vacuous.\u201d From early, McCarthy\u2019s style was instantly recognisable: sparse, often entirely omitting punctuation and using polysyndeton \u2013 inserting conjunctions to slow the rhythm of his language \u2013 to create a sombre, melancholic tone. He credited Melville, Dostoevsky and Faulkner as formative, while professing his indifference to authors who didn\u2019t \u201cdeal with issues of life and death\u201d. His 1992 novel All the Pretty Horses was the first in the Border trilogy, which chronicled the lives of two cowboys working on the US-Mexico frontier. The novel won the National Book Award and widespread fame for McCarthy, while the second, The Crossing, in 1994, and the concluding volume, Cities of the Plain, in 1998, were also acclaimed. McCarthy wrote a play, The Stonemason, in 1994, then turned his 1984 screenplay No Country for Old Men into a novel in 2005; the Coen brothers adapted the bleak tale into an Oscar-winning film in 2007. That same year, McCarthy won the Pulitzer prize for his 2006 novel The Road, a book he credited to the arrival of his second son, John Francis, in 2004 when the author was in his late 60s. In his first ever television interview, with Oprah Winfrey in 2007, he said he hoped readers of The Road would take away the message that they should \u201csimply care about things and people and be more appreciative. Life is pretty damn good, even when it looks bad. We should be grateful.\u201d McCarthy had more success with other people\u2019s adaptations of his work than his own screenplays. But unlike No Country for Old Men, his 2011 screenplay for the HBO film The Sunset Limited \u2013 originally a play \u2013 was not widely distributed or seen, while an adaptation of his 1984 screenplay The Counselor, directed by Ridley Scott and starring Brad Pitt and Michael Fassbender, was alternately panned as one of the worst films of 2013, and praised for being \u201cdeliberately unobvious\u201d. In 2009, a Texas university acquired McCarthy\u2019s 98-box archive, which revealed that McCarthy was then working on three novels. More than a decade later, two of them were released in 2022: The Passenger and Stella Maris, two connected novels that follow Bobby and Alicia Western, two siblings who are tormented by the legacy of their physicist father, who helped develop the atom bomb. The author married three times and lived in Spain and Texas for many years before settling in New Mexico, where he lived for three decades. Asked by Winfrey in 2007 if he cared that he had millions of readers, he said: \u201cIn all honesty I have to say I really don\u2019t. You would like for the people who appreciate the book to read it but as far as many, many people reading it, so what? It\u2019s OK. Nothing wrong with it.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 14 June 2023. In an early version, we said Blood Meridian was based on events on the Texas-Mexico border in the 1950s when it should have said 1850s. This has been corrected. Also, polysyndeton is the use of conjunctions, not conjugations. An early version said that The Passenger was unfinished; it was released in 2022."}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e70192", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/14/my-friend-anne-frank-by-hannah-pick-goslar-review-a-survivors-story", "primaryCategory": "books", "subCategories": [], "title": "My Friend Anne Frank by Hannah Pick-Goslar review \u2013 a survivor\u2019s story", "lead": "An extraordinary, posthumously published book recalls the horrors of Nazi occupation and the liberation of Bergen-Belsen", "author": "Fiona Sturges", "datePublished": "2023-06-14T06:30:06Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.294758", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/b00c49fc25ac494e2d16e77cd5248fcf4bc05104/0_219_4355_2613/500.jpg", "body": "When Nazi officers arrived at the home of 15-year-old Hannah Pick-Goslar, she had her suitcase ready. The Goslars had already narrowly survived one razzia, the name for the systematic roundup of Jews in occupied Amsterdam. After taking the family to a theatre-turned-deportation centre, officials had looked at their papers and, seeing that Pick-Goslar\u2019s father and grandfather were members of the Jewish Council, released them. But this time, on 20 June 1943, there were no such privileges. The Nazis had sealed off their neighbourhood, blocking roads and stationing soldiers on every bridge. Early in the morning, loudspeakers blared in the streets, telling Jewish residents to prepare for departure. Then a member of the green police, the wing of the German army tasked with policing civilians, banged on the Goslars\u2019 door and told them: \u201cYou have 20 minutes to pack your things.\u201d The title of Pick-Goslar\u2019s memoir, My Friend Anne Frank, is misleading and \u2013 however unintentionally \u2013 does it a disservice. This is not really the story of Frank, who achieved posthumous fame through the diary she kept while in hiding, even though, as a neighbour and close friend of the author, she is a significant presence in the first third of the book. It is, in fact, the vivid and extraordinary story of Pick-Goslar, a Holocaust survivor who, following her arrest in Amsterdam, was imprisoned first at Westerbork, a Dutch holding camp near the German border, and later at the concentration camp Bergen-Belsen. Many of her fellow survivors chose not to talk about what they had been through, but, from her first speaking tour of America in 1957, Pick-Goslar kept telling her story in order that the Holocaust would not be forgotten. Following her retirement from her career as a community nurse, she travelled around the world delivering lectures. Last year, aged 93 \u2013 aware that she was among the last living eyewitnesses to the Nazi genocide \u2013 she began a series of interviews with the Tel Aviv journalist Dina Kraft for a memoir. Pick-Goslar, who was increasingly frail and would speak for two hours at a time before stopping to nap, died last October, just two weeks shy of her 94th birthday. In finishing the book without her, Kraft has done her proud. It begins with the Goslar family\u2019s flight from Berlin in 1934 after the Nazis came to power; Pick-Goslar\u2019s father, Hans, had spoken out against the Nazis and feared for his safety. Arriving in Amsterdam, Pick-Goslar met Frank, who was not only the same age but another German Jew finding her feet in a new country. She recalls her as small and fragile-looking \u2013 \u201cBut her slightness belied her big personality \u2026 I knew right away after meeting Anne that she loved being the centre of attention.\u201d Their two families became close: Hans Goslar used to play a prank on the Franks, standing on their doorstep and ringing their doorbell dressed as Hitler. But their carefree lives took a dark turn when the Nazis invaded in May 1940. It took five days for the Netherlands to surrender. Many Jews in their neighbourhood took their own lives rather than submit to what was to come. It\u2019s through a child\u2019s eyes that she depicts their shrinking existence under Nazi occupation as new antisemitic laws are passed and Jews are banned from public spaces. Pick-Goslar and Frank were moved to a Jewish school where pupils would vanish overnight. One day in 1942, Pick-Goslar called round to see Frank, only to be told by the lodger that the family had moved to Switzerland. We know now, from Frank\u2019s diary, that they were hiding in an annexe above an Amsterdam warehouse until their discovery in 1944. But, at the time, their neighbours had no reason to doubt the Switzerland story. What happened to the Goslars next \u2013 their arrest and transportation to concentration camps in overcrowded cattle trucks \u2013 is grimly familiar, their fate echoing that of millions of Jews. Pick-Goslar\u2019s recollections of life in the camps, where they lived in grotesque squalor surrounded by disease and death, make for devastating reading. She and her baby sister, Gabi, were the sole survivors out of three generations of the family. As the Allies drew near at the end of the war, the Germans started to evacuate Bergen-Belsen; the sisters, alongside hundreds of other prisoners, were once again loaded on to trains, where they travelled for 13 days without food or water. Hundreds died in transit. Pick-Goslar, who by now was sick with pleurisy, slipped in and out of consciousness, eventually waking to find the train had stopped and was empty, bar her sister and those too weak to move. The German soldiers had gone, replaced by Russians, one of whom told them in Yiddish, \u201cPeople: you are free now.\u201d As for Frank, she and Pick-Goslar had been, very briefly, reunited at Bergen-Belsen. On hearing on the grapevine that Anne and her sister Margot had been brought from Auschwitz and put in sealed-off barracks, Pick-Goslar was able to track down her friend and speak to her through a fence. No longer the ebullient chatterbox of old, Frank was sick with typhus, starving and, wrongly believing her father to be dead, overwhelmed with grief. She died shortly after their meeting, as did Margot. Just a few weeks later, the camp was liberated. \u2022 My Friend Anne Frank: The Inspiring and Heartbreaking True Story of Best Friends Torn Apart and Reunited Against All Odds by Hannah Pick-Goslar is published by Ebury (\u00a322).

Much has been made of the author\u2019s sparse style, which combines poetic and surreal descriptions with lithe plotting and bleakly surreal settings: an appealing combination for a motion picture adaptation. The Australian director John Hillcoat brought it to the screen in 2009 with a film that impressively translates the book\u2019s heaving sense of sadness, using an anemic palette to evoke the look of a dying, inconsolable world, memorably navigated by Viggo Mortensen (billed as \u201cthe Man\u201d) and Kodi Smit-McPhee (\u201cthe Boy\u201d). But The Road is just one of several adaptations of McCarthy\u2019s books, which often possessed a quality that worked for film: 2000\u2019s All the Pretty Horses (directed by Billy Bob Thornton), 2011\u2019s The Sunset Limited (directed by Tommy Lee Jones), 2013\u2019s Child of God (directed by James Franco), and, of course, the Coen brothers\u2019 2007 neo-western No Country for Old Men. If The Road is McCarthy\u2019s most famous novel, No Country (which snagged four Oscars, including best picture) is the best-known and most revered adaptation of his work, rightly considered an exemplary example of the \u201ccrime don\u2019t pay\u201d genre. Directed with suspenseful Hitchcockian flair, the film has a striking sense of place gleaned from its west Texas desert settings. The drama revolves around a trio of hardy performances from Josh Brolin, Javier Bardem and Tommy Lee Jones, Bardem\u2019s being rather more intense than the others. He brings angel of death vibes to Anton Chigurh, the villain who pursues Brolin\u2019s Llewelyn Moss after he runs off with a heap of cash that ain\u2019t his. Jones plays sheriff Ed Tom Bell, who narrates the book, and in the film is given its most memorable dialogue: a great, cryptic monologue at the end in which he reflects on two dreams, both involving his father. In some respects this visually straightforward scene, much of it captured in a single shot, is the pinnacle of Jones\u2019s career: so simple, yet so well written and performed. Jones is obviously a fan of McCarthy, directing and starring in an adaptation of the author\u2019s work a few years later: The Sunset Limited, a chamber piece scripted by McCarthy himself, and based on his play of the same name. It\u2019s essentially one great big, exhausting debate about the nature of faith, between Jones\u2019s dejected professor and a ranting bible-bashing ex-convict played by Samuel L Jackson. The film is tight and claustrophobic, perhaps intentionally devoid of cinematic flair, emphasising dialogue and performances. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning A far bolder, and frankly batshit crazy production also written by McCarthy is Ridley Scott\u2019s crime drama The Counselor, which got bashed by critics (exhibit A; exhibit B) and made little impact on the zeitgeist. However, I appreciated its offbeat plotting, whacked-out gonzo energy and, at times, horrendously strange chutzpah, such as a scene in which Cameron Diaz has sex with a Ferrari, intercut with a spiky-haired Bardem recounting the story to a bemused Michael Fassbender. This proto-Titane sequence is an odd moment in McCarthy\u2019s motion picture oeuvre, to say the least. But when cinephiles contemplate his contribution to cinema, they\u2019ll primarily recall Hillcoat\u2019s intensely somber adaptation and the Coen brothers\u2019 rolled gold masterpiece."}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e70195", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/14/moment-changed-me-missile-alert-death", "primaryCategory": "lifeandstyle", "subCategories": [], "title": "A moment that changed me: the missile alert promised sudden death.

THIS IS NOT A DRILL.\u201d The islands were already on edge because of tensions between the US and North Korea. Wary and agitated, I tried to make sense of the situation. When I look back on that moment in 2018, the most visceral memory I have is how conscious I was of my scalp. Having never thought of it before, I remember feeling acutely aware of its presence, how odd it was that hair has follicles. In these last, precious moments, I asked my mother what, in the face of our impending death, she wanted to do next. She still wanted to go to the DMV. In her mind, we could be sitting ducks \u2013 or we could just get on with it. I was no stranger to these emergency text alerts. Only eight days before, on the way back from picking up some milk from a corner shop while visiting my grandmother in Tokyo, I had received a similar text warning me of an earthquake about to hit the Kanto region. Startled, I had jumped into a nearby bush in a feeble attempt at self-preservation. It had been a false alarm. Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice \u2026 by now I had convinced myself that some kind of divine power had it in for me, and I wouldn\u2019t be able to dodge this bullet twice. Honolulu residents took shelter in storm drains, leaving homes unsecured. A friend of mine in the air force jumped into their 4x4, abandoning another car on the street with keys still in the ignition. Several people attempted to shelter in their bathtubs, praying. For my part, I paced the floor, furiously replaying all of my life decisions up until that point. I told my friends that I loved them, messages that still haunt my memory, and the group chat, years later. Then the danger passed, attributed to human error \u2013 but I was forever changed. I had gone to visit my grandmother and mother in Tokyo and Honolulu after the breakdown of a long-term relationship. I felt as if I was stagnating in my career, and wanted to take some time to recuperate. Frustrated with many of the big life choices I had made up until that point, I had hoped that some time with family would rebuild a sense of faith and trust in life that I felt I had lost. What I got was a wake-up call. Before this, I felt as if I hadn\u2019t been an active participant in my own life. I didn\u2019t want to live like that any more. That terrifying hour gave me time to reflect on the things I had been too scared to do and what I\u2019d change given the same chance again. To shorten the list of regrets that I had. I stopped second-guessing myself, and began to listen to my gut. It made me less of an angry cynic. I vigorously pursued my own interests. My first book was published later that year. I built up the confidence to go travelling alone. I took risks with my heart, and my career \u2013 resulting in a promotion, a transatlantic move and an impulsive summer romance with an old friend. We\u2019re getting married later this year. Sometimes the universe sends you a message. It starts subtly, but when you ignore the signs, it takes drastic action. When you finally get the message, the magnitude of it is immense: that action trumps inaction, every time, that there is no time like the present, that the thing that will end up killing you will never be the thing you spent all that time worrying about. So stop putting everything off and just get started. What followed was a time when every decision was met with a resounding \u201cyes\u201d. I accepted an invitation from a friend to visit her home in Kyiv, five months before the first UK lockdown. Without it, I would have missed out on a vibrant weekend in a beautiful city. I am eternally grateful. That brief moment I spent in all-consuming fear is what its inhabitants now experience daily. The thought is chastening. I still struggle against my own nature \u2013 to give in to wallowing, frustration and anger \u2013 but whenever I take a risk I remember how I felt in those moments, and that tingling feeling returns to my head. For me, that moment represented a seismic shift in the way I live my life. It was a reminder to stop waiting for things to happen, and to voraciously seek them out instead - so when I\u2019m next faced with drastic news I can meet it without fear or regret."}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e70196", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/14/therapy-is-great-but-have-some-americans-had-too-much", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "subCategories": [], "title": "Therapy is great.

Only kidding \u2026 we collapse on the couch and watch Netflix. The latest thing we have been binging is a reality TV dating show called The Ultimatum: Queer Love. It is about a bunch of queer women being incredibly messy and dating each other\u2019s exes. I was beyond excited when I discovered this show, because there is nothing I love more than lesbian chaos (except, perhaps, baked potatoes) and \u2013 despite the fact that it makes extremely compelling television \u2013 there are hardly any lesbian dating shows out there. Did The Ultimatum live up to my elevated expectations? Sort of. I have two gripes. First, the host. It makes sense to appoint a gay woman as a host of a queer dating show, don\u2019t you think? Netflix disagrees. Not only did it make a straight woman the host, but she ensured that everyone knew she was straight within the first five seconds of the show. My second gripe? The \u201ctherapy speak\u201d. I don\u2019t want to get cancelled for this, so let me be clear: I think therapy is great and should totally be normalised. But there is such a thing as too much therapy. I\u2019m starting to think that Americans have had too much therapy, and I\u2019m not the only one to notice this: there have been a lot of articles recently about how \u201ctherapy speak\u201d is everywhere and is making people more selfish. People are excusing their narcissism with psych-speak. The cast of the Ultimatum really drummed this home.

Featuring footage from recent natural disasters, including the historic 2018 Camp fire in northern California, the opening places viewers in the heart of the inferno. Bright red flames lick through every inch of the ground, leaving behind a trail of burning wreckage, and waves of smoke turn the morning sky pitch-black. The sight is terrifying, almost surreal, yet Elemental also aims to debunk outdated myths about wildfires, regularly regurgitated by mainstream media and even forest management departments. An eclectic cohort of experts, who include academics, fire deputies and environmental volunteers, break down long-held misconceptions in a systematic and easy-to-understand fashion. For instance, for decades, logging new plantations has been a favoured method of fire prevention. In reality, however, maintaining old natural forests proves more effective at slowing down the spread of a wildfire as well as shielding populated areas from firestorms. Among the expert voices are those of the Indigenous Yurok tribe, who had adhered to these methods for generations before colonialism altered how fire was perceived. Far from an unruly monster, the use of fire to regulate the growth of a forest can, in fact, foster greater biodiversity. Impressive in terms of analysis, Elemental is slightly hampered by the narration from David Oyelowo, whose sonorous vocal timbre occasionally dampens the urgency of the issues at hand. A popular trend among nature docs, recorded voiceovers from high-profile actors can be a way to attract more attention. In this case, however, it might have been sufficient to let the subject speak for itself. \u2022 Elemental: Reimagine Wildfire is released on 13 June on digital platforms"}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e70198", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/14/josh-hazlewood-dilemma-shows-australias-embarrassment-of-riches", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": [], "title": "Josh Hazlewood dilemma shows Australia\u2019s embarrassment of riches | Geoff Lemon", "lead": "Fast bowler who played so well in 2019 is not fully fit and may miss out in the first Ashes Test because of Scott Boland\u2019s form", "author": "Geoff Lemon in Birmingham", "datePublished": "2023-06-14T06:00:07Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.294794", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/41eac396bac9673b3638b494ba41fa4673a9a079/0_214_7515_4510/500.jpg", "body": "Josh Hazlewood missed the first Test of the 2019 Ashes in Birmingham off the back of an injury layoff. Due to caution about his buildup, he was held back in favour of a bowler who was a bit slower, a bit less glamorous, but would hit the seam all day with nagging accuracy. In 2023 it might be the same story. Swap Peter Siddle for Scott Boland this time around, and Hazlewood is again wondering whether he can make his way into the team, this time after conservative treatment of some soreness in his side ruled him out of the World Test Championship final. \u201cI think if it was a one-off I probably could have played that game,\u201d he says of the showpiece clash with India at the Oval last week. \u201cWith what\u2019s coming up now, it just would have been too big of a risk.\u201d It is worth remembering that peak Hazlewood is a fast-bowling beast. With an arm position upright as a mainmast he hits the pitch from a great height, but still produces subtlety in seam or swing. Remember the brief shiver of movement that he employed to start the fifth day at Adelaide in 2017. England resumed on that morning with Joe Root and Chris Woakes together and hopes of chasing a target. Minutes later both had feathered catches behind. But a frustrating run with injury, including multiple recurrences of a side strain, has kept Hazlewood to four Tests in the past two and a half years, meaning that with Edgbaston looming he is again not the automatic pick that he has been at other times in his career. His 222 wickets from 59 Tests look like an automatic statistical pick over Boland\u2019s 33 from eight, but Boland\u2019s career bloom and his decisive work in the WTC final don\u2019t make it that simple. \u201cI think Scotty\u2019s everyone\u2019s favourite at the moment,\u201d Hazlewood, 32, says with a smile, flagging a pragmatic approach to how many Tests he hoped to play this season. \u201cIf we go back a few years, I would have said all six. But I guess it\u2019s a little bit different now, based on the last two years of history. I think three would be a nice pass, and four is probably a tick. Any more than that is great, any less then I am probably a little disappointed again.\u201d Whatever his inherent quality, it would be a huge selection call to play Hazlewood on the back of no match practice in a game as important as an Ashes opener, instead of choosing the same attack that bowled so well against India and got better as the match went on. The flip side of that argument is that the same lack of match fitness will apply before every Test thereafter, and that the only way to get him ready to play is to play him. But if Hazlewood, Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc are still Australia\u2019s principal three fast bowlers, then it might not be a smart move to throw all three into the same match to begin with. Cummins and Starc played the WTC final and it\u2019s unlikely that both can make it through six Tests in eight weeks as this tour demands. Beyond Boland with his eight caps, Michael Neser has every chance to be called upon for his third. Spacing out the use of the most experienced quicks would leave Hazlewood able to bring seniority into the team when an equivalent drops out. It\u2019s not what Hazlewood would prefer, but introducing him in the second Test at Lord\u2019s in 2019 worked well. He used the sloped pitch to his advantage, built his way into the series after that, and by the fourth Test in Manchester he was Australia\u2019s most significant bowler in closing out that match that retained the Ashes. \u201cNo doubt you still want to play every game and it\u2019s hard to sit on the sidelines and watch,\u201d he says. \u201cBut potentially if you bowl back-to-back Tests and you bowl 50 overs and you\u2019ve got some of Boland, Starc or myself on the bench, fresh, ready to go ready for the next Test, I think it makes those conversations a little bit easier, and the guys are more open to it to create that longevity.\u201d Or there\u2019s the other option of picking all your marquee players and letting them rip. The first match of a long series is the best one to win, letting you run the table from there. Discarding long-term planning and playing full-tilt, thinking only of the moment? It\u2019s a cricket philosophy that could catch on."}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e70199", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/14/living-surviving-homelessness-hardship-poverty-britain", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "subCategories": [], "title": "The other day in the supermarket I was accused of stealing.

But life for me and many others in my community has become geared solely around survival. Morale is low. One of the projects I attend provides hot meals and surplus food for a small donation \u2013 if you have it. After dinner, they bring a table full of donated food. It\u2019s always been a bit of a rush to get your hands on food once the table is open. That is understandable. I think many people are in survival mode; they\u2019re scared and desperate to ensure they have enough to get by. These are the basics, the essentials of life. It\u2019s sad to watch. At another provider of charitable food support in my area, there\u2019s less food available than at the beginning of this cost of living crisis. I think what there is has to go further than it did before as demand grows from more people. The third sector and charities, which originally stepped in to fill gaps in the benefits system, now make up most of the support given to people. The responsibility of catering to sick people, unemployed people, pensioners and low-income workers increasingly falls on to their shoulders. But their shoulders won\u2019t be able to bear this burden for much longer if things continue to regress. I am, on the whole, happy to be back at work, even though my health conditions can make it difficult at times. Still, at the back of my mind is a lingering fear that if my health deteriorates to the point where I can\u2019t work, I\u2019ll be back in abject poverty. Access to Work, a government scheme, helped me return to work. I am grateful for that and do not begrudge paying my tax, but sometimes I wish it wasn\u2019t going to a government capable of such a callous disregard for the country\u2019s poor people. Last year, when the home secretary, Suella Braverman, was discussing incentivising people back into work, she said: \u201cWe\u2019ve got lots of carrots to get people into work, but we\u2019ve got to add \u2026 a bit more stick.\u201d Braverman\u2019s words come from either a place of ignorance about the lives of those at the thin end of the wedge of modern Britain, or a total lack of compassion. I had an unpleasant experience a few weeks ago in my local supermarket, which shows this heartlessness is carrying over into everyday life. As I went to leave the store after using the self-service checkouts, three staff members and a security guard blocked my exit. They demanded my receipt and searched my bag; the security guard said they\u2019d seen me on CCTV putting meat inside it. I hadn\u2019t taken anything, and the whole experience was humiliating. The store refused my request to access its policies and procedures regarding bag searches. I expect it doesn\u2019t have one, and I firmly believe that others will experience the same treatment. I accepted a modest amount of compensation in the form of a voucher after two weeks of doggedly pursuing my request for more information. But I realised that taking it further would be at the expense of my mental health. I now feel uncomfortable going into shops, and this particular supermarket was one that I shopped at regularly. As one of the many people who experience anxiety and poor mental health brought about by the trials and tribulations of modern life in our wealthy country, I urge people not to accept that this is \u201cjust the way it is\u201d. There is clearly something wrong if doing something as simple as your weekly shopping involves such distrust. I don\u2019t want to be part of a society where shop staff behave like law enforcement, where homelessness, hardship and poverty are accepted, and a small percentage of individuals hold the bulk of the country\u2019s wealth and assets.

Abdul Eneser, 20, says he fell on to the tracks at Manchester Piccadilly station last year as he was unable to feel where the platform edge was due to the lack of metal studs or adhesive tiles. He was also not provided with passenger assist support, which helps disabled people navigate a station, due to a train delay. A nonstop freight train passed through the station on the same track around one minute after Eneser managed to pull himself back on to the platform, in what he described as \u201cthe most traumatic experience I have ever had to face\u201d. Eneser said: \u201cI used to be a confident rail user, but the fear I experienced when I fell from the platform, and when I think about what might have happened if I hadn\u2019t managed to get back on to the platform with a minute to spare, has left me very nervous when using the railway. \u201cVisually impaired people should feel just as safe as sighted people when they embark on a train journey. My experience shows that Network Rail and train operating companies are failing to provide a proper service for visually impaired people.\u201d Eneser said there was still not enough tactile paving at train stations, and that passenger assist arrangements are often inadequate. He wants \u201curgent action\u201d to improve the experience of disabled people travelling on trains. Eneser says he had booked passenger assist in advance, but as he missed his connection at Preston between Glasgow to Manchester, he was told upon arrival at his final destination that everyone from passenger assist had gone home for the day. He was left alone on the platform, and, searching for the exit, he stepped off the platform and on to the track. After the incident in Manchester on 21 May 2022, Eneser says he was for a second time left without assistance when he changed trains alone at Crewe station on 19 May this year, where again there was no tactile paving. Had it not been for assistance from a member of the public, he thinks he could have fallen off the edge again. Network Rail told Eneser that they were investigating the incident, but they have not contacted him since. Eneser is now suing Network Rail for the lack of tactile paving and the train operating companies involved in his journey, Northern and Avanti, for the failures with passenger assist. Represented by law firm Leigh Day, he launched a legal claim in March on the basis that they have breached their duties under equality laws, which require rail operators to make reasonable adjustments for disabled people. Leigh Day is arguing that this includes tactile paving, which has been included as guidance since 1986; audio announcements when this is not present; and to ensure staff are present at all times to assist visually impaired people. The firm is aware of a number of blind people who have fallen from platform edges. Cleveland Gervais was hit by a train after he fell off a platform at Eden Park station in February 2020. The inquest into his death concluded that the lack of tactile paving caused or materially contributed to his death. Samantha Fothergill, senior legal adviser at RNIB, said that up to 15% of people falling from platforms are blind or partially sighted, and 40% of mainline railway stations lacked tactile paving, despite this being a fundamental safety measure. She said \u201cthis is completely unacceptable\u201d, though RNIB is pleased to see that after years of campaigning, Network Rail has pledged to install tactile paving on all rail platforms in Britain by 2025. Leigh Day solicitor Kate Egerton, who represents Eneser, said it was \u201cstaggering\u201d that despite the number of incidents, tactile paving is still missing from many stations. \u201cDuties are plainly being breached,\u201d she said. The defendants will have two weeks after 17 July to respond to the court. A spokesperson for Network Rail said: \u201cWe\u2019re sorry to hear about Abdul\u2019s experience. We know there\u2019s still more to be done to make our railway more accessible for all and we\u2019re working closely with our train operator colleagues and industry partners to achieve this as quickly and efficiently as we can. \u201cOur programme to install tactile paving on platforms at stations across Britain by 2025 is continuing at pace, bolstered by \u00a375m of funding allocated by the government to accelerate it last year; this includes extensive improvement work at Manchester Piccadilly, with tactile paving installed along the lengths of platforms 13 and 14 at the start of this year.\u201d An Avanti spokesperson said: \u201cWe\u2019re sorry to hear about Abdul\u2019s experience. We know that as an industry there is more that needs to be done to ensure all customers can travel with confidence and we\u2019re working with industry partners to make the railway more accessible.\u201d Craig Harrop, regional director at Northern, said: \u201cWe are sorry to hear about Abdul\u2019s experience at Manchester Piccadilly. There is still much progress to be made in our industry to ensure all customers can travel confidently. Working alongside our industry partners, including Network Rail and other train operators, we are striving to create a more accessible and inclusive railway.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 14 June 2023.

It found that between 2017 and 2022 Amazon had tripled the amount it earned from fees for independent sellers in Europe, including for listings, deliveries and digital support. That growth far outstripped the rise in sales, which doubled over the same period. Analysis of delivery and storage costs for sellers in the UK, France, Germany, Spain and Italy, for example, found prices had more than doubled in some categories between 2017 and 2023. Margarida Silva, a researcher at the Amsterdam-based Centre for Research on Multinational Corporations, also known as Somo, accused the internet retailer of exploiting a \u201ccaptive clientele\u201d. \u201cFor the past 20 years Amazon has been expanding its monopolistic hold over online shopping in Europe. It is now so dominant that independent retailers who wish to sell online cannot avoid it. Sellers are locked in to the platform and essentially a captive clientele, making them a profitable source of monopoly rent,\u201d she said. Income from sellers\u2019 fees jumped 6% last year to \u20ac23.5bn, even as retail sales fell 1%, according to Somo\u2019s analysis of accounts for the group\u2019s European arm, Amazon EU Sarl. Those fees do not include the amount sellers are charged to advertise on the site. Amazon\u2019s overall advertising revenue has boomed in recent years: to \u20ac5.4bn in 2021 from just \u20ac0.3bn in 2017, according to Somo\u2019s analysis of local Amazon subsidiaries that book its ad services across Europe. The group estimates that 51% of that amount, or \u20ac2.75bn, comes from independent sellers. At Amazon Online UK, the subsidiary that handles UK ad bookings, advertising revenue rose from \u20ac0.3bn in 2018 to \u20ac1.9bn in 2021 \u2013 a sixfold increase. The more sellers and other business clients bid for a specific keyword, the more expensive it gets. \u201cAmazon sellers seem to be increasingly shouldering Amazon\u2019s costs, including the costs of the expansion of its network of fulfilment centres and also the digital services taxes in France and the UK,\u201d Somo\u2019s report says. It adds: \u201cAmazon\u2019s squeezing of sellers is a crucial pillar of its European business as revenue from independent sellers\u2019 fees is growing faster than its core business, its European retail arm.\u201d One UK seller told the Guardian that his fees, including advertising, amounted to almost 40% of the pre-VAT price of his products. \u201cSales are satisfactory and stagnant, which maybe I can\u2019t blame Amazon for, but fees are quite high and service is poor,\u201d he said. Amazon is under investigation by the UK\u2019s competition watchdog over whether it has been giving its own brands and those using its logistics services unfair advantage over third-party rivals on its online marketplace. A separate European Commission investigation looked at similar issues last year, resulting in Amazon making a series of commitments to address the concerns, including a centralised complaint mechanism open to all sellers and delivery firms. Amazon said its revenue had increased because its European sellers had \u201cgrown their businesses through Amazon\u201d, adding: \u201cAmazon is investing more than ever in supporting the growth of our selling partners and helping them achieve record sales \u2026 Sellers who choose to purchase optional logistics or advertising services from Amazon do so because they see incremental value to their business.\u201d The retailer said paying for Amazon to store, pick, pack and deliver products was an optional service, which it claimed was 30% cheaper than standard services offered by other major logistics operators, and buying advertising was also optional. Amazon said it strongly disagreed with Somo\u2019s characterisation of its market position as monopolistic. It said the market share figures \u201cfundamentally misrepresent how the retail industry works\u201d because they did not take into account that most retail sales are made in physical stores, adding: \u201cThe retail space is incredibly competitive and dynamic, and sellers have many options to choose where to sell goods.\u201d Amazon said its revenue from independent sellers amounted to 60% of the volume of items sold on the site and it had \u201clong celebrated that their sales are growing faster than Amazon\u2019s own sales \u2026 We have also invested billions in new tools and services for sellers to help them succeed.\u201d European sellers spoken to for the report said they felt impelled to pay the rising costs as the online marketplace has such a high market share \u2013 as much as 70% in Germany, France and Spain according to a report by the European Commission. A UK retailer told Somo that sellers are incentivised to keep spending on advertising services to keep the visibility for their products: \u201cLike a hamster on a wheel, you have to just keep going. As soon as you slow the pace, then they\u2019ll just go your competitor.\u201d Amazon has refused to disclose data on sellers\u2019 sales values on European marketplaces.

Prof Philip Banfield, the chair of the British Medical Association (BMA), has written to the prime minister asking him to intervene in the bitter pay row. His initiative comes as thousands of junior doctors in England launched a three-day strike at 7am on Wednesday that has forced hospitals to cancel large numbers of outpatient appointments and operations. In his letter, Banfield told Sunak that he needed to get involved because junior doctors \u2013 those below the level of consultant and including some trainee GPs \u2013 do not believe that Steve Barclay, the health secretary, has the power to agree a deal with the BMA that would end the stoppages. This week\u2019s walkout is the third the BMA\u2019s junior doctors committee (JDC) has called since March as part of its campaign to try to force ministers to give juniors a 35% pay rise, arguing that they have suffered a 26.2% drop in the value of their salaries since 2008. The last one, which lasted for four days in April, led to 196,000 hospital appointments being rescheduled and saw an average of 27,000 juniors strike each day. \u201cI am writing to ask you to urgently meet with me and our junior doctors committee co-chairs to find a way through the dispute,\u201d Banfield told the prime minister. He added that while the Welsh and Scottish governments have recognised the real terms cuts in junior doctors\u2019 pay, \u201cyour government still refuses to acknowledge pay erosion\u201d. He added: \u201cThis has sent a clear message to our members that you have not listened and do not value them.\u201d Meanwhile, NHS England\u2019s national medical director has asked the public to behave sensibly during the ongoing heatwave in order to reduce pressure on the service during the strike. People should drink plenty of water, use sun cream and avoid spending too long in the sun, Prof Sir Stephen Powis said. They should also check on friends, relatives or neighbours who may be vulnerable. Barclay said the latest strike was \u201cextremely disappointing\u201d and \u201cwill put patients\u2019 safety and our efforts to cut waiting lists at risk\u201d. He insisted that in recent meetings with the JDC he had made \u201ca fair and reasonable opening offer\u201d but that the committee\u2019s leaders had torpedoed the talks by calling this week\u2019s strike. The JDC co-chairs Dr Robert Laurenson and Dr Vivek Trivedi said that junior doctors are \u201cin despair\u201d at the government\u2019s \u201cintransigence\u201d. Barclay\u2019s recent offer amounted to just a 5% pay rise, which \u201cbeggars belief\u201d, they added."}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e7019d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/jun/14/amazon-insisted-i-report-my-missing-package-to-the-police", "primaryCategory": "money", "subCategories": [], "title": "Amazon insisted I report my missing package to the police", "lead": "Because it was marked as \u2018delivered\u2019, Amazon won\u2019t believe it wasn\u2019t", "author": "Anna Tims", "datePublished": "2023-06-14T06:00:06Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.294820", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/e1ee142e5b3260f0b97305bdeed9ceaf961b4427/618_653_5526_3315/500.jpg", "body": "I placed an order on Amazon totalling \u00a371.97.

The plant, in Madhya Pradesh, India, was equipped with six safety systems designed to detect such a leak, none of which were operational that night. Twenty-seven tons of MIC gas spread throughout the sleeping city. As an engineer was flushing water through a corroded pipe in the MIC production complex, a series of valves failed, allowing the water to flow freely into one of the three-storey tanks holding the toxic chemical in a liquid state. This caused a rapid and violent reaction. The tank shattered in its concrete casing and spewed a deadly cloud of MIC, hydrogen cyanide, monomethylamine and other chemicals, all of which hugged the ground. The derelict Union Carbide plant sits on a 20-hectare (49-acre) site in Bhopal\u2019s old town As the toxic cloud blanketed much of Bhopal, people began to die. Aziza Sultan, a survivor, remembers: \u201cAt about 12.30am, I woke to the sound of my baby coughing badly. In the half-light, I saw that the room was filled with a white cloud. \u201cI heard a lot of people shouting. They were shouting \u2018Run! Run!\u2019,\u2019 she says. \u2018Then I started coughing, with each breath seeming as if I was breathing in fire. My eyes were burning.\u201d Champa Devi Shukla recalls: \u201cIt felt like somebody had filled our bodies up with red chillies; our eyes had tears coming out, noses were watering, we had froth in our mouths. The coughing was so bad that people were writhing in pain. \u201cSome people just got up and ran in whatever they were wearing, or even if they were wearing nothing at all. People were only concerned as to how they would save their lives, so they just ran.\u201d In those apocalyptic moments, no one knew what was happening. People started dying in the most hideous ways. Some vomited uncontrollably, went into convulsions and dropped dead. Others choked, drowning in their own body fluids. Staff from the Sambhavna clinic hold a vigil in memory of victims. It was built with funds raised in 1994 by the Bhopal Medical Appeal, which appeared in the Guardian and Observer on the disaster\u2019s 10th anniversary. The clinic has treated more than 65,000 people and nearly half of the 55 staff are gas survivors Many people died in the stampedes through narrow alleyways where street lamps, swamped in gas, burned brown. The crush of fleeing crowds wrenched children\u2019s hands from their parents\u2019 grasp. Families were literally ripped apart. MIC, used in the production of pesticides, is highly corrosive if inhaled. Half a million people were exposed and at least 25,000 have died as a result. More than 150,000 people still suffer from disorders caused by the accident and the subsequent contamination \u2013 respiratory diseases, kidney and liver disorders, cancers and gynaecological issues. No one knows exactly how many thousands of people died. Union Carbide put the number at 3,800. Municipal workers who collected bodies, loading them on to lorries to be buried in mass graves or burned on funeral pyres, say they handled at least 15,000 corpses. Based on numbers of burial shrouds sold in the city, survivors make the conservative claim that about 8,000 people died in the first week alone. But the dying has never stopped. A satellite map of Bhopal, showing the extent of the toxic gas cloud, which affected half a million people Rashida Bi, a survivor who has lost five members of her family to a variety of cancers over the past three decades, considers those who escaped with their lives \u201cthe unlucky ones\u201d. She adds: \u201cThe lucky ones are those who died on that night.\u201d Union Carbide shut down the site and left it to rust. It has never been cleaned up and so the poisoning continues. In 1999, testing of groundwater and well-water near the site revealed mercury levels up to 6m times greater than what is accepted as safe by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Images showing the plight of the survivors and their children. Many children of local people, whose drinking water was contaminated, were born with developmental issues. Among survivors, respiratory ailments are widespread Chemicals were found in the water that cause cancer, brain damage and birth defects. Trichloroethene, a chemical shown to impair foetal development, was found at levels 50 times higher than EPA limits. Testing published in a 2002 report revealed poisons such as 1,3,5-trichlorobenzene, dichloromethane, chloroform, lead and mercury in women\u2019s breastmilk. In 2001, the Michigan-based Dow Chemical Company bought Union Carbide, acquiring its assets and liabilities. Dow, however, has steadfastly refused to clean up the Bhopal site. Nor has it provided safe drinking water, compensated the victims or shared with the Indian medical community any information it holds on the toxic effects of MIC. The data that Bhopal\u2019s doctors have requested, and say they need in order to deal with the lasting effects of the crisis, Dow has treated like a trade secret and held back. Vimla Sahu, who lives near the abandoned Union Carbide plant, cannot conceal her anguish Union Carbide built the Bhopal factory in the 1970s, confident that India represented a huge untapped market for its pesticides. However, sales never met the company\u2019s expectations. Indian farmers, struggling to cope with droughts and floods, lacked the money to buy Union Carbide\u2019s products. For 15 years before the disaster, Union Carbide routinely dumped highly toxic chemical waste at sites inside and outside the factory. Twin sisters Shazia and Fouziya in their home in the Nawab area of Bhopal, near the factory, where toxins leaked into the water supplies. They both have severe mental development issues, which doctors believe was due to genetic damage Thousands of tons of pesticides, solvents, chemical catalysts and byproducts lay strewn across six hectares (16 acres) inside the plant. Evaporation ponds covering 14 hectares outside the factory were filled with thousands of litres of liquid waste. The plant, which never reached its full production capacity, proved to be a loss-making venture and was shut down in the early 1980s, though large quantities of dangerous chemicals were left abandoned on the site. Three huge steel tanks continued to hold more than 60 tons of MIC. Although MIC is a particularly unstable gas, Union Carbide\u2019s elaborate safety systems were allowed to fall into disrepair and become ineffective. The factory managers\u2019 reasoning seemed to be that, since production had stopped, no threat remained. As monsoons battered the decaying plant, rain caused the chemical-waste evaporation ponds to overflow. Toxins penetrated the soil, leaching into underground channels. Contaminated water from wells was pumped into 42 neighbourhoods. In secret tests carried out by Union Carbide in 1989, the results of which were subsequently seen by the Bhopal Medical Appeal, the company concluded that the site was lethally contaminated. Groundwater instantly killed fish. Many of the places where the samples were taken were just inside the factory wall \u2013 people drew their water from wells and standpipes on the other side of the wall. A gas-affected patient undergoes Panchakarma steam treatment, a traditional Ayurvedic therapy, at the Sambhavna clinic. The clinic describes its approach to treating survivors of the disaster as \u2018offering drug-free therapies for chemically burdened bodies\u2019 Despite having indisputable proof of the site\u2019s toxicity, Union Carbide chose not to notify local people that the water was unsafe. It attacked those in the community who voiced concern, dismissing them as \u201ctroublemakers\u201d. The full extent of the contamination was not exposed until 1999, when Greenpeace investigators, after running a series of tests, reported that soil and water in and around the plant were contaminated by organochlorines and heavy metals, which are both highly toxic and accumulate in the body. A follow-up study in 2002, which found mercury, lead and organochlorines in the breastmilk of women living near the plant, also discovered that the children of gas-affected women suffered an array of debilitating illnesses, including birth defects and reproductive disorders. The \u201cpolluter pays\u201d legal principle applies in India but Union Carbide and its parent company, Dow, have refused to pay compensation for this second environmental catastrophe of contaminated water. A boy drinks water from a hand pump near the plant. Water samples taken in and around the factory were found to be highly contaminated by organochlorines and heavy metals In 1989 Union Carbide, in a partial out-of-court settlement with the Indian government, agreed to pay $470m in compensation to the victims of the disaster. But the victims themselves were not consulted in the negotiations, and more than nine in 10 received a maximum of $500 each, or enough to pay medical expenses for five years. Today, victims of the disaster eke out a perilous existence. More than 50,000 Bhopalis are unable to work because of their injuries. Many have no family left at all. In 1991, India\u2019s criminal justice system charged Warren Anderson, Union Carbide\u2019s chairman and chief executive at the time of the disaster, with \u201cculpable homicide not amounting to murder\u201d. If he had been convicted in India, he would have faced a maximum of 10 years in prison. Anderson never stood trial. An Indian extradition request languished in the US courts for three and a half years without a response from officials. In September 2014, a few months before the 30th anniversary of the disaster, Anderson, the son of a Brooklyn carpenter, died aged 92 in a nursing home in Vero Beach, Florida. Doctors at the Chirayu cancer hospital in Bhopal examine a patient from one of the neighbourhoods around the abandoned plant Union Carbide was charged with culpable homicide. The corporation, like its former chief executive, refused to face trial in India, and the charges have never been resolved. Dow and Union Carbide merged in 2001. The agreement submitted to regulators omitted any mention of pending criminal cases against Union Carbide. Dow has been served summons to appear in court at least six times in Bhopal to explain Union Carbide\u2019s continued absence. It has ignored all six notices. Union Carbide remains liable for the environmental devastation it caused. Environmental damages were not addressed in the 1989 settlement, and the contamination continues to spread; these liabilities became the responsibility of Dow. Some Dow shareholders tried to stop the merger, knowing that a corporation assumes the assets and the liabilities of a company it buys, according to established corporate law. Indeed, soon after it acquired Union Carbide, Dow settled a US lawsuit, paying out $2.2bn to compensate people in the US affected by Union Carbide\u2019s use of asbestos in legacy products. But Dow maintains that it is not liable for Union Carbide\u2019s actions in Bhopal. Tim Edwards is executive trustee of the Bhopal Medical Appeal.

The concept is that when your walk comes to a body of water, you pack your kit into a waterproof inflatable bag that can be towed, swim to the next destination, exit, and continue your journey. A multi-swim walk can open up new perspectives on the landscape, even in familiar areas. Standard tow floats are fine for shorter trips. However, for full or multi-day excursions, something like the RuckRaft, which is big enough to transport a rucksack full of camping gear across open water is recommended. It can be exciting plotting your own route but, as with any outdoor pursuit, open-water swimming comes with an element of risk. In unfamiliar waters it is essential to consider factors such as currents and tides, water quality, plus safe (and legal) entry and exit points. To begin with, it is worth signing up with a qualified swim guide \u2013 over the past year, a number have started running cross-country swimming trips and breaks around the UK. Devon Based at a woodland camp on the edge of Dartmoor, the AboveBelow Devon retreat is the original cross-country swimming break. From the (optional) early morning dip in a local river, routes follow south Devon\u2019s coastline, walking and swimming from Hope Cove to Bantham, sometimes with a bit of scrambling, a swoosh (tidal assisted), or a swim around Burgh island. With the emphasis on enjoyment, a final estuary excursion ends up with a swim to a pub for lunch. RuckRafts are provided and local guide Nigel Jenkins adapts routes according to weather and sea conditions. AboveBelow Devon, from \u00a3334 for the weekend Pembroke and south Wales The raw beauty of the Pembrokeshire Coast national park is arguably best appreciated from both water and land. Swim Wild Wales runs weekend breaks that involve several swims \u2013 with the chance of spotting dogfish, seals or dolphins \u2013 linked by walks along a stunning section of the coastal path. Swims are planned according to water and weather conditions, as well as the goals of the group, which also offers swim adventures at locations such as Barry, Sully and Penarth, all near Cardiff. Swim Wild Wales, \u00a3330 for weekend Lake District With 16 lakes, hundreds of tarns and numerous mountains, the Lake District is the perfect landscape to create your own unique route. On a sunny August weekend I did a self-supporting western lakes swim/walk taking in Crummock Water and Buttermere, a climb up Haystacks, a wild camp and eventually a swim across Derwentwater. Lauren Munro-Bennett from LMB Coaching can help you plan such a route and accompany you. She also runs a less intense southern lakes trip that crosses Windermere, followed by a walk to Loughrigg tarn and further swims the next day. For a three-day, full immersion into the world of cross-country swimming, AboveBelow runs weekend retreats based at a lodge near Ullswater. This includes guided swims across and along the lake, combined with forays into the surrounding fells. In the Lake District it is important to be aware of biosecurity, and the cross contamination of invasive species from one lake to another. In some areas all kit should be rinsed before using again. AboveBelow offers weekends from \u00a3338 North Wales The mountains and lakes of north Wales offer numerous cross-country swim possibilities, and they don\u2019t all have to involve strenuous climbing. Swim routes combined with less intense walks can be created around the stunning two-mile-long Llyn Padarn. A three-swim, 10km route, run by Altitude Snowdonia, is a good introduction to everything involved on a land-and-water adventure. Starting at Llyn Geirionydd, near Llanrwst, a 1.5km swim down the length of lake is followed by a walk along forest tracks, an optional swim in a small lake, before joining the Snowdonia Slate Trail. This brings you to the village of Capel Curig and a final big swim in Llynnau Mymbyr. For those after even more adventure, its scramble and swim route includes the famous Bristly ridge grade 1 climb on Tryfan, followed by swims across mountain lakes. Altitude Snowdonia full day \u00a395 Cornwall Starting at Maenporth, three miles south-west of Falmouth, this three-swim circular route explores the beautiful south Cornish coast with deviations inland to sub-tropical gardens and even a pirates\u2019 graveyard. Led by a local guide, Matt Lowe, there is a sea swim going past caves and coves, a trip up the Helford river towards Daphne du Maurier\u2019s famous Frenchman\u2019s Creek, and a \u201cswoosh\u201d swim down Porthnavas Creek to finish at a pub. With the swims there are plenty of exit points if you feel like getting out and walking. Matt Lowe, hello@agoodadventure.co, full day \u00a3100 Isle of Lewis and Isle of Harris From white sandy beaches to rugged areas of coastline, mountains, moor and inland lochs, the islands of the Outer Hebrides are an almost near-perfect venue for multi-swim hikes. Based in Stornoway, on the Isle of Lewis and Isle of Harris, Immerse Hebrides runs everything from swim and trek half-days, to more adventurous swims out to small islands. A full day\u2019s exploration includes swimming to an island across a sea loch, hiking, more loch swims, including one to a famous beach (routes can vary depending on sea conditions). Immerse Hebrides, full day, \u00a3325; half-day, \u00a3175 (for groups of up to four people) Isles of Scilly The sun bleached sands and turquoise seas of the Isles of Scilly, off Cornwall, have long been a popular destination for outdoor swimmers, but the archipelago of relatively close islands also offers untold possibilities for swim and hike routes. The waters are cold though (wetsuits recommended) and there are strong currents so it is advisable to enlist some local knowledge. As well as introductory sea swim sessions, the Wild and Scilly Mermaids offer a swim/hike route that involves 2.5km of swimming with coast path walking, including a picnic lunch and hot drinks (towed on the route). Wild and Scilly Mermaids, \u00a360 for swim hike adventure, bespoke inter-island routes on request River Thames Multi-swim routes aren\u2019t all about steep ascents and freezing lochs. The River Thames offers scores of potential trips, combining walks through ancient villages with pleasant river swimming. One such route starts at Shiplake lock, a 30-minute walk along the Thames path from Shiplake train station in Oxfordshire. Heading off from the pontoon, you glide past eyots (river islands) and an eclectic mix of houses \u2013 from the Tudorbethan to an elegant Grand Designs house. There are plenty of exit points where you can rejoin the river path and continue the journey by walking into Henley-on-Thames. After something to eat in town, the water section of the route can continue towards Remenham or past Temple Island, the starting point of the Henley Royal Regatta course. Mike Whitworth, an open water coach based in Henley-on-Thames, can guide you on the route or help create your own. Swim to Live, contact to discuss Jurassic coast Dorset\u2019s Jurassic coast attracts thousands of visitors each year, but not many get to truly appreciate the cliffs, coves and beaches from both above and in the sea. Jurassic Coast Swimming runs adventure day swims that can take in areas such as Dancing Ledge, Durdle Door or Beer and Branscombe. Walks between swims may involve scrambling, ledge jumping, as well as the possibility of spotting bats and seals. Lunch and hot drinks as well as clothes are towed. It also runs swim camps as well as a retreat on Brownsea Island that includes a sauna.

So it comes as a surprise to many, according to the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS), that in most of Britain the procedure is still governed by a 160-year-old law that declares abortion a crime, and another, passed almost 60 years ago, that outlines the specific exceptions in which it can be allowed. The distressing story this week of a woman jailed for more than two years for lying to obtain abortion pills, ending her pregnancy after the legal limit, has highlighted just how high the stakes can be. Campaigners and politicians of all parties expressed shock and outrage at the sentence, pointing out that the case occurred in the early months of the pandemic, when face to face services were unavailable. They argue that there was no public interest in jailing the woman, who has three children, one with special needs, and that the sentence could also deter others from seeking help. But her case has also cast light on the archaic laws that govern abortion in the UK \u2013 and the urgent need, campaigners believe, to reform them.

In depth: \u2018What we\u2019re calling for is for abortion to be treated in the same way as any other healthcare procedure\u2019 Abortions after 24 weeks are rare in Britain, and the case of the woman jailed for illegally procuring abortion pills is a particularly tragic one, as even the trial judge acknowledged. Estranged from the father of her children and pregnant by another man, she was forced by the pandemic to move back in with her former partner and \u201cin emotional turmoil\u201d as she tried to conceal the pregnancy. She was between 32 and 34 weeks pregnant when she induced the abortion. Her actions in lying to obtain tablets under the hurriedly introduced \u201cpills by post\u201d scheme may have been born out of desperation, but they were also expressly criminal under UK law. Though she now felt \u201cvery deep and genuine remorse\u201d and was haunted by flashbacks of her dead child\u2019s face, the judge said, \u201cin my view your culpability was high\u201d \u2013 hence the harshness of her sentence. *** What does the law say at present? \u201cThe fact is, healthcare in this area can\u2019t advance because it\u2019s still a criminal offence governed by legislation passed in 1967,\u201d Katherine O\u2019Brien tells me. No other medical procedure is carried out according to what MPs believed 60 years ago \u2013 before abortion pills were even invented \u2013 she points out. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t accept that in any other area of healthcare.\u201d In England, Wales and Scotland, abortion is outlawed under the Offences against the Person Act 1861, and this is the legislation under which the woman was prosecuted. Crucially, while the 1967 Abortion Act outlines circumstances in which it can be allowed \u2013 and gives what BPAS calls \u201cbroad discretion\u201d on how it is interpreted \u2013 it does not overturn the earlier legislation, so any abortion outside its terms carries a potential life sentence. The 1967 law allows an abortion before 24 weeks if the pregnancy would risk harming the physical or mental health of the pregnant woman, and potentially later if it risks her life, could cause her \u201cgrave permanent injury\u201d or if there is a \u201csubstantial risk\u201d the foetus would be \u201cseriously handicapped\u201d. While the woman in this week\u2019s case terminated her pregnancy later than the legal limit, says O\u2019Brien, \u201cshe could have been prosecuted at any gestation\u201d if she had acted outside the terms of the 1967 act. Prior to the pandemic-related introduction of pills by post (last year made permanent in England after a vote by MPs), \u201cwe were aware that every week, every month, women were trying to buy pills online. Any woman who bought the pills online could be sentenced to up to life imprisonment under the law as well.\u201d *** What do campaigners want? One of the great ironies of British abortion law is that campaigners are now calling for all the home nations to be given the same legal status as Northern Ireland \u2013 where until recently abortion was effectively illegal altogether. A Westminster vote led by the Labour MP Stella Creasy (pictured above) in 2019 explicitly repealed the 1861 act where it relates to abortion, making Northern Ireland the only part of the UK where it is decriminalised. \u201cIt seems absurd that we\u2019re calling for women in Great Britain to be given the same protections as women in Northern Ireland,\u201d says O\u2019Brien. The fact that MPs have already voted to repeal in part of the UK, however, arguably shows they have accepted the principle. (While the law in Northern Ireland may have changed, O\u2019Brien notes, abortion provision there remains very limited \u2013 most women needing surgical procedures still need to travel to Great Britain.) More broadly, modernised abortion legislation could include things like provision for nurse-led services, she says. \u201cBut at the moment, given that this woman has been criminalised, the priority is to reform, to protect more women going forward.\u201d Some of those who argue against decriminalisation suggest it could lead to a free for all, but O\u2019Brien said this has not been the case in other countries, such as Canada, that have decriminalised. \u201cNo woman aspires to have a late abortion; the vast majority of women want to access abortion care as soon as possible. And decriminalisation does not mean deregulation. What we\u2019re calling for is for abortion to be treated in the same way as any other healthcare procedure.\u201d *** Why are police investigations rising? One of the most troubling aspects highlighted by this week\u2019s case is the rise of police investigations, over the past three years, into alleged illegal abortions. \u201cWhile the passing of pills by post has improved women\u2019s access hugely across the country,\u201d says O\u2019Brien, \u201cwhat it has also done, I would say, is [bring about] a growing suspicion that women might have used these pills outside the terms of the law.\u201d She cites the case of a 15-year-old girl whose unexplained stillbirth led to a year-long police investigation, until a coroner found her baby had died of natural causes. \u201cIn all of the cases that I\u2019m aware of personally, these are women who had been reported to the police by healthcare professionals,\u201d says O\u2019Brien. \u201cThat puts us in a very frightening position, whereby a woman attending hospital, potentially what she might disclose in that medical consultation could then trigger a police investigation. The chilling effect that could have is really quite concerning.\u201d What else we\u2019ve been reading In this week\u2019s TechScape newsletter, Alex Hern takes a look at the lawsuits launched by US regulators against two cryptocurrency exchanges and what it means for Rishi Sunak.

On Wednesday, the New South Wales government released potential reform options considered by the Treasury and Transport for NSW in 2022 \u2013 before it took office \u2013 which included introducing tolling on currently untolled roads such as the Anzac Bridge and Western Distributor to create a continuous motorway network. Another option prepared by the departments for consideration by the previous government included a congestion charge for entering Sydney\u2019s CBD. The Minns Labor government said it would not pursue these options as they would betray election commitments to not increase the number of toll roads, and on Wednesday, opposition ministers declared they were never considering these two options when in government. However there are other toll network reform options the government remains open to as part of its review, which is being conducted by former Australian Competition and Consumer Commission chair Alan Fels, to make Sydney\u2019s toll roads fairer and simpler. A $60 weekly toll cap will come into effect from January and last for two years, and the government is hoping Fels\u2019 review will produce long-term solutions. The roads minister, John Graham, said he was not in favour of a simple distance-based system that charged drivers cents for each kilometre, as he said this would be a \u201chammer blow\u201d for residents of western Sydney who rely on driving due to a lack of public transport. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Instead the review would flesh out a previous concept of splitting Sydney\u2019s toll road network into five public transport-style zones, with a large swathe of western Sydney to be the lowest priced zone, medium prices for a large northern, a central and harbour zones, and the highest prices for the eastern zone. Under this system, pricing would be simplified so any drivers accessing a toll road within a zone would pay the same fee \u2013 and the toll burden would be better shared with eastern suburbs residents. Such a system would help the government achieve its goal of easing the toll burden on western Sydney commuters and doing more to encourage those living near public transport not to drive. Means-tested and postcode-based tolling relief will also be considered, as will making heavy vehicle access to toll roads cheaper at nights, after data found freight operators were diverting to local roads to avoid the higher tolls. Across the city, there are 13 roads over 179km with tolled sections and Fels found Sydney was \u201cthe most tolled capital city in the world\u201d. Sydney\u2019s toll roads have several different pricing structures \u2013 some charge a fixed fee, others charge for the distance travelled, while for another road, users pay an access fee as well as for the distance travelled. There are also roads where users are charged differently depending on the time of day or day of the week and some roads only toll users in one direction. Most of Sydney\u2019s toll roads are run by private operator Transurban as part of an array of long-term agreements which stipulate minimum guaranteed revenue. The government-controlled toll roads \u2013 the harbour bridge and harbour tunnel crossings \u2013 have some of the cheaper fees across the network. The result of various tolling agreements entered into by previous governments has led to what Graham has dubbed \u201ctollmania\u201d, with departmental data finding commuters in Sydney\u2019s western suburbs bearing the brunt. Data showed that Horsley Park was the most tolled suburb in Sydney in the 2021 financial year, with an average tolling account in the suburb spending $1,917 a year. Graham said Transurban had indicated publicly and privately they were open to reform, but did not rule out the government may need to pay compensation to the tollway company to implement some reforms such as the zone system. \u201cWe\u2019re not threatening the value of those contracts \u2026 but any benefit here has got to be returned to the public,\u201d Graham said."}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e701a3", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/14/the-full-monty-tv-review-boring-and-badly-written", "primaryCategory": "tv-and-radio", "subCategories": [], "title": "The Full Monty TV review \u2013 boring and badly written ", "lead": "Wacky plots, endlessly irritating characters and a distinct lack of stripping \u2013 this Disney+ series isn\u2019t a patch on the film", "author": "Lucy Mangan", "datePublished": "2023-06-14T05:00:05Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.294849", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/04cf28ddf9159e0286dba0d85f073dbda10af515/0_223_6000_3600/500.jpg", "body": "You remember the hit film, of course. In 1997, The Full Monty won Baftas, an Oscar and people\u2019s hearts with its uplifting tale of six men, some of them former steelworkers in Sheffield, trying to improve their lot by putting together a striptease act. The title derived from their promise to outdo the Chippendales by revealing everybody\u2019s pie and chips at the end \u2013 to the lads\u2019 local audience only, you understand. In 1997 we hadn\u2019t yet fallen quite so far into the pit of depravity in which 2023 happily frolics and we viewers only saw their bums. Which always felt to me like the better deal. A new eight-part series of the same title and written, like the original film, by Simon Beaufoy (this time with Alice Nutter) revisits the gang 25 years on \u2013 as the opening caption puts it \u201cSeven prime ministers and eight northern regeneration policies later.\u201d The lads are still in Sheffield, an even more post-industrial landscape, and the melancholic undertow of the film \u2013 in which it was clear but not dwelled on that the climactic show would be a brief, shining moment, not a transformative one \u2013 now tugs far more insistently on all their lives. Gaz (Robert Carlyle \u2013 still, in my opinion, miscast in a so-called lovable but actually endlessly irritating role) is living in a caravan and working as a hospital porter. He retains his propensity for acting first and thinking later, and continues to embroil various people in lovably madcap/intensely irritating schemes, mainly with the aim of enabling him to buy his disabled grandson the electric wheelchair he needs. Dave Horsfall (Mark Addy) and wife, Jean (Lesley Sharp), are now the caretaker and headteacher respectively of the local comprehensive school and stuck in a rut made deeper by their inability to grieve together for a loss long ago. Lomper (Steve Huison) is now married to Dennis (Paul Clayton) and they run the local cafe together, which has become the gang\u2019s unofficial new meeting place. Gerald (Tom Wilkinson) is not given much of a backstory but he can generally be found bloviating from behind his laptop at a table whenever the others pop in. Guy (Hugo Speer) is the only one doing well for himself, but his storyline disappears early on, as a result of on-set allegations of inappropriate behaviour against Speer that meant he was taken off the production despite his claim of innocence. Horse (Paul Barber) is now physically frail, unable to work and on disability benefits \u2013 their withdrawal after one of the DWP\u2019s wilfully brutal assessments and the consequences on him form one of the overarching narrative threads of the series. There are newcomers, too, including Miles Jupp as lower middle class Darren, learning to navigate unemployment from the older hands, Talitha Wing putting in an absolutely wonderful performance as Gaz\u2019s talented but wayward daughter Destiny and Aiden Cook as Twiglet, a fierce little lost soul whom Dave befriends after he catches him stealing food from the school kitchen. The Full Monty tries to cover so much political ground that it often feels by-numbers. The Horsfalls\u2019 jobs at the dilapidated school showcase the failures of those seven PMs and regeneration policies in education; Gaz\u2019s job \u2013 especially in the mental health ward \u2013 highlights the catch-22s and lack of provision that traps patients in units; Guy\u2019s irresponsibility shows the shortcomings of privatisation. The cafe functions as a drop-in centre as much as a business, and free cake from Dennis helps Horse keep body and soul together as he falls further through the more-holes-than-net of the welfare state. Without an event such as the striptease show around which to cohere, the drama remains too loose for us to fully reinvest in the characters, however much residual fondness we may have. And the perfectly balanced tone of the film, between comedy and tragedy, is here forever out of whack. Storylines such as child suicide attempts are breezed past in favour of long, absurd (and very dull) capers involving rare pigeons and Korean billionaires, or kidnapped dogs from Britain\u2019s Got Talent. An affair between a main character and a colleague is badly underwritten and wholly unconvincing. And you really do have to find Gaz the lovable rogue of lovable rogues to buy into the episode in which he takes an artistic patient with schizophrenia off his medication so he can begin to paint again. A sprinkling of decent gags, some fine performances and evident good intentions towards exposing the continuing impoverishment of the north and indicting those responsible unfortunately aren\u2019t enough to stop the series feeling \u2026 well, boring. It feels neither as real nor as uplifting as its progenitor, showing us less of the characters, society, the deep malaise and human potential than before. \u2022 The Full Monty is on Disney+ now."}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e701a4", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jun/14/the-child-vaping-crisis-from-what-my-daughter-says-90-of-her-year-do-it", "primaryCategory": "society", "subCategories": [], "title": "The child vaping crisis: \u2018From what my daughter says, 90% of her year do it\u2019", "lead": "Last week, the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health said disposable vapes should be banned because of their popularity among children \u2013 with many parents now feeling they are fighting a losing battle<strong><br></strong>", "author": "Emine Saner", "datePublished": "2023-06-14T05:00:05Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.294854", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/fc5300096b309292c7b5908240403903d45b5cd1/0_0_3358_2015/500.jpg", "body": "The first time Hannah got an email from her son\u2019s school to say he had been caught vaping, and that she was to collect his confiscated vape, he had just turned 14.

He has also found vapes that contain illegally high levels of nicotine. Last month, the BBC found that illegal vapes confiscated at a school in Kidderminster had high levels of metals, including more than twice the safe level of lead, nearly 10 times the safe level of nickel and high levels of toxic formaldehyde. Vapes seem to be everywhere among Helen\u2019s group of friends, says Mark. \u201cIf somebody buys one and doesn\u2019t like the flavour, they pass it on to someone else, so there\u2019s this circuit,\u201d he says. \u201cIf they bring out a new flavour, they think: I\u2019ll get one of those. It\u2019s like swapping football stickers in the playground. The local newsagents sell them to kids in school uniform \u2013 they know very well they are not 18. I believe the local vape shop also sells to them.\u201d Last week, the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) said disposable vapes should be banned because of their popularity among children and young people, partly thanks to their bright colours, sweet flavours and low prices. New Zealand has banned most disposable vapes, as well as the sale of vapes in shops within 300 metres of schools. \u201cIt took decades to understand the relationship of cigarette smoking to cancer and respiratory illnesses \u2013 my worry is we could be sleepwalking into a similar situation here,\u201d said Dr Mike McKean, the vice-president of the RCPCH and a paediatric respiratory consultant. \u201cIf you inhale potentially noxious, volatile substances, there is a huge potential for an inflammatory reaction that could have a minor or a major effect. There is lots of evidence it causes significant coughing and breathlessness. We\u2019re not seeing lots of highly damaged lungs yet, but there are cases reported where the inflammatory response is overwhelming and causes permanent scarring.\u201d The RCPCH was responding to a government call for evidence, which closed last week, prompted by the rise in youth vaping. According to NHS Digital, one in five 15-year-olds vaped in 2021; the current figure is expected to be higher. Last month, the annual survey by Action on Smoking and Health (Ash) found that, although there had been no significant increase in the proportion of 11- to 17-year-olds vaping, there had been a 50% increase in those trying vapes. According to the survey, 7.6% of children vape, with disposables the most-used vapes. Many parents of teens who vape feel the official figures are too low. \u201cI reckon that, from what my daughter says, 90% of her school year vape,\u201d says Mark. *** Julia, who has a 14-year-old, Phoebe, says that, of her daughter\u2019s friends, \u201cmaybe 70% vape. It is a massive problem.\u201d She has seen the age of first use drop. Her son, who is almost 18, started when he was about 15. \u201cHe says his sister\u2019s generation were vaping much earlier. They\u2019ve probably been vaping since they went to secondary school, in year seven. I would say it\u2019s endemic. I asked my daughter how they get them. She said that it was really easy for a long time, so 11- or 12-year-old girls could go in shops and just get vapes. Apparently, it\u2019s harder now, so they just ask somebody on the street [to buy them].\u201d According to Ash, nearly three-quarters of children who vape buy vapes themselves, despite it being illegal to sell them to under-18s. Julia has tried to stop her children and their friends vaping in the house, \u201cbut that\u2019s a losing battle\u201d. She has tried talking to them about it, too. \u201cI say: \u2018It\u2019s your body and I can\u2019t stop you from doing it, but I just need you to understand that you\u2019ve only got one body, you\u2019ve only got one set of lungs,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cBut at that age they don\u2019t have any real understanding of what they\u2019re doing. They have a vape that is [equivalent to] 28 cigarettes, but they smoke it in a day. \u201cWe feel, with social media and tech and now vaping, really abandoned by the government and legislation, because there\u2019s nothing we can do to stop it. All we can do is acknowledge that it\u2019s happening and give them the information. But, of course, there\u2019s very little data about vapes and how it\u2019s affecting young people. We\u2019re left having to do our best to educate them with nothing in place to stop it happening.\u201d Her son\u2019s friend, a heavy vaper, recently collapsed at a party because he couldn\u2019t breathe. There have been reports of other cases, including that of Ewan Fisher, who was hospitalised with respiratory failure when he was 16 and said in 2019 that \u201cvaping has basically ruined me\u201d. In 2015, Rosey Christoffersen, who was 18 and a talented footballer, died. Her lungs had collapsed. Her family believes it was due to vaping. \u201cThere needs to be massive research into this,\u201d said Rosey\u2019s mother, Rachel Howe, last year. \u201cIn the meantime, they should be treated like tobacco and only sold from a closed cabinet behind a counter.\u201d Public health experts are wary of demonising vapes, which are a proven smoking-cessation aid. The Ash survey also highlighted a growing misconception among children and adults that vaping is as harmful, or more harmful, than smoking, saying there was a risk that people might think they could smoke instead. A 2015 review published by Public Health England estimated that vaping was 95% safer than smoking. Youth smoking has declined. This year, Chris Whitty, England\u2019s chief medical officer, said vaping \u201chas an important role as a public health tool to help smokers \u2026 come off smoking\u201d. He added that it was \u201cutterly unacceptable\u201d to market it to children. Last month, the Australian government said it would make vapes prescription-only and ban disposable vapes. Young people are getting mixed messages, says Mira Osinibi, a paediatric respiratory specialist nurse who also runs a company, MiraOLungHealth, that goes into schools to talk about vaping. \u201cThey hear it\u2019s 95% safer [than smoking tobacco],\u201d says Osinibi, but she questions whether this is accurate for young people. \u201cWe know that children\u2019s lungs are not the same as adults\u2019 lungs. There has to be more research about how damaging it is. But we already know that nicotine is not good for the adolescent brain.\u201d She also thinks the official data on the number of young vapers is lower than in reality. She finds that most young people don\u2019t understand the level of nicotine (not all vapes contain it), or the potential effect of vaping on their lungs. \u201cThey\u2019re getting mixed messages when they go to a shop and the vape looks like a chocolate bar. It\u2019s colourful and small.\u201d Vapes are not sold from behind a counter, in plain packaging, like cigarettes are. \u201cSo they\u2019re confused. They go: \u2018What\u2019s the big deal?\u2019\u201d Unlike cigarettes, the taste of which puts off many experimental young smokers, some vape flavours mimic sweets or soft drinks. Also unlike cigarettes, disposable vapes are discreet \u2013 and much less easily detected by parents. \u201cSome have it in their hand all the time, so they might vape when they go to school, they might vape in the toilet,\u201d she adds. \u201cSome parents, when I speak to them at schools, don\u2019t know how long their children have been vaping. You wouldn\u2019t have that with tobacco.\u201d Osinibi says vapes, particularly the disposable kind, \u201cdo not need to be as colourful as they are; they don\u2019t have to be as small as possible. Adolescents love that, because they can hide it. Adults don\u2019t need to hide it. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t believe it when the vaping industry says \u2018we are not designing for children\u2019.\u201d Andrew, an assistant headteacher at a school in south-west England, has seen the age of vaping children get younger in the past three or four years. \u201cThere\u2019s much more attraction to them for younger students \u2013 the colours, the flavours. All of that is aimed at those who are a bit more impressionable,\u201d he says. Some students vape at school, but it is hard to catch, \u201cespecially when the smell is indistinguishable from perfume or deodorant\u201d. The toilets are the most common area for vaping. \u201cThey have to be monitored, so obviously there\u2019s a use of resources for the school and the knock-on impacts of that. You get younger students not wanting to use toilets because older students are congregating there.\u201d At his previous school, they looked into getting a specialist vape alarm system for the toilets \u2013 which some schools have \u2013 but it cost too much. His present school is about to invest in one. \u201cIt\u2019s not a cheap system to have in place,\u201d he says. Students used to hide their vapes in broken ceiling panels: \u201cI would find them in toilet cisterns.\u201d That was before disposable vapes became readily available. Now, he says, young people are \u201cbrazen enough just to chuck them into bins in the toilet\u201d. Other schools have reported thousands of pounds worth of plumbing damage from disposable vapes being flushed (1.3m single-use vapes are thrown away each week, leaving a considerable environmental footprint). It was common for students to arrange meet-ups in the toilets with others in different classes 10 minutes into lessons, he says. This led to his school, and many others, banning toilet breaks during lessons, which has been widely criticised. \u201cBut you\u2019re constantly fighting that battle,\u201d he says. Many parents are angry about this, including those who know their children are vaping. \u201cIt makes me so mad this is happening. What about girls [who may be on their period]? There are loads of kids with additional needs who need to go to the toilet,\u201d says Hannah. Her son, Josh, was given a toilet pass on mental health grounds \u2013 he is awaiting an assessment for autism and the school toilets had become a place of peace for him when he was feeling overwhelmed. \u201cThen they took it off him, because they kept catching him vaping.\u201d Some names have been changed \u2022 Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

On cue, I\u2019m woken by a blackbird perched on our bedroom roof, sounding as if he is singing through a megaphone. Many people would be delighted to hear this bird belting out his mellow baritone. Not me, though. No matter how hard I try, all I hear is a monotonous series of brief, rather hesitant phrases \u2013 as if he is tuning up, but never quite getting to the actual performance. Yes, I know I\u2019m in a tiny minority. The blackbird is reportedly Britain\u2019s third favourite bird (after the robin and barn owl), and has inspired composers from Messiaen to McCartney. So which birdsongs do I prefer to the blackbird? Quite a lot, actually. The melodic blackcap, the madcap sedge warbler, and the wistful willow warbler. The melancholy autumnal song of the robin, and the sheer exuberance of the skylark. And, of course, the incomparable nightingale: the Johann Sebastian Bach of birdsong. Yet for me, the real star of the dawn chorus is another, less showy songster. A bird whose sound is so wonderful, that is how he got his name. One that I\u2019ve loved since I listened to his suburban ancestors, as I walked home from school. And who still cheers me up each morning from January to June.

Publishing the figures for the first time, the Royal National Lifeboat Institution said its volunteers saved the lives of 108 men, women and children who were crossing in small boats. Its crews, mainly based in Dover and Dungeness in Kent, launched 290 times to people making the voyage across one of the world\u2019s busiest shipping lanes \u2013 most often in small, overcrowded and unseaworthy boats. The charity has been criticised by some for facilitating the arrival of refugees into the UK but said it was unashamed and unapologetic for doing the work it was created for almost 200 years ago \u2013 saving lives at sea. It also revealed that it has been developing new mass \u201crescue\u201d equipment to help save large groups from the water and was about to start using a piece of kit in the Channel called a \u201csea staircase\u201d that can get 20 people out in about 90 seconds. The RNLI showcased the inflatable staircase on Tuesday to a select audience including the Guardian off the coast of Dorset where it has been carrying out trials before adding it to its lifeboats in the south-east Channel within the next few weeks. Announcing the statistics on rescues of people from small boats, the RNLI chief executive, Mark Dowie, said: \u201cWe have never released these figures before but they illustrate clearly our charity\u2019s work in the Channel is genuinely lifesaving.\u201d The RNLI\u2019s lifeboats and lifeguards saved 506 lives last year. Of these, 389 were rescued by lifeboat crews. Its launches to small boats in the Channel equated to 3% of its total for the whole year from its 238 stations around the UK and Ireland. Dowie added: \u201cThe RNLI is unashamed and makes no apology for staying committed to and focused on the purpose we were created for, nearly 200 years ago \u2013 to save lives at sea.\u201d During the exercise a mile and half off Old Harry\u2019s Rocks, RNLI crews used two piece of new kit to rescue a group of lifeguards who played the part of refugees whose boat had sank. The head of lifeboats, Simon Ling, explained that the first priority was to do everything they could to make sure those in the water did not drown. This was achieved by throwing light packs containing \u201chorseshoe\u201d life rings that inflate when they hit the water. Lifeboats in the Channel have already started carrying these so they can quickly help dozens of people stay afloat. \u201cThis buys you time,\u201d said Ling. The second bit of kit being highlighted \u2013 the staircase \u2013 has been developed to make it easier to get lots of people out of the water quickly. Two crew members can hunker down on the foot of the staircase at water level, making it much easier to haul people out. Crews have been testing the staircase close to the RNLI\u2019s headquarters in Poole as part of mass casualty exercises \u2013 the first time it has ever used live \u201ccasualties\u201d in practice. \u201cWe have simulated different mass rescue scenarios and the sea stairs enable our crews to recover large numbers of people from the water at high speed \u2013 which in a rescue situation could be the difference between life and death,\u201d said Ling. \u201cCrews have said this is a gamechanger.\u201d A third piece of kit is a large ring that has been adapted from an aircraft life raft. By removing the floor, the RNLI has found many more people can hang on to it as they await rescue. Ling said the RNLI did not get involved in the politics of small boats crossings. \u201cThe RNLI is an apolitical organisation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe exist to save lives at sea and we\u2019ve been doing that for nearly 200 years now.\u201d The RNLI is tasked by the coastguard to carry out rescues. If someone is in trouble in the sea, the charity will help them without judgment. \u201cFor us it\u2019s relatively easy, this is around being tasked by HM coastguard, [our work is] men and women getting up in the middle of the night and responding to people in distress. It\u2019s the most noble of human endeavours and we\u2019re all very proud of our volunteers.\u201d Taking part in the exercise off Dorset was the The Murrell, a Shannon class vessel based at Dungeness, which can fit up to 43 survivors on its deck and run casualties right on to the beach. Dungeness volunteers were among those involved in a rescue on 14 December when four people lost their lives but dozens were saved. Its coxswain, Stuart Adams, said he joined the RNLI to help people and save lives. \u201cThat is my passion,\u201d he said. He recalled a night when, in a torrential thunderstorm, his crew was called out to a dinghy that seemed about to sink. \u201cOnce we managed to get everybody on board, a young lady started to scream. She was missing her child. For a moment we thought: \u2018Have we lost a child?\u2019 Thankfully soon after the child was found on board. The scream stayed with me for days. \u201cWhatever the circumstances, whatever the nationalities, it doesn\u2019t matter to me, we are there to save lives and that\u2019s what we do.\u201d"}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e701a7", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/14/boris-johnson-brexit-uk-politics", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "subCategories": [], "title": "Boris Johnson is gone, but his toxic Brexit myths will go on poisoning UK politics | Rafael Behr", "lead": "A systemic sickness produced the hallucination of merit in the former prime minister, then disgorged him, says Guardian columnist Rafael Behr", "author": "Rafael Behr", "datePublished": "2023-06-14T05:00:04Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.294871", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/4867974c80b0defc9a333ca2680fe0e27144d6df/0_70_1656_994/500.jpg", "body": "There is no crisis at Westminster so serious that it cannot be made to look trivial by the inclusion of Boris Johnson. And there is no scandal involving Johnson that cannot be explained, partially or wholly, by his lies. Those are axioms of post-Brexit politics. The House of Commons committee of privileges is due to publish a report concluding that a former prime minister turned his back on truth and put himself in contempt of parliament. The gravity of the offence invites a serious discussion about the safeguards in British democracy. Or it should. Johnson lied because he had broken the rules that most other people observed during the pandemic, often at significant personal cost. He lied because he felt no duty of submission to rules imposed by his own government or any other authority. He lied because breaking rules and refusing to admit it had been a reliable method of self-advancement throughout his life, propelling him all the way to Downing Street. He lied because that is what he does. Those facts being established, and Johnson having quit the Commons to avoid the indignity of a suspension, the main question left hanging is how such a man ever reached a position of power for which he was obviously unfit. What sickness in British politics produced the hallucination of merit in Johnson\u2019s candidacy for No 10? The question presupposes that the fever has broken. Sweaty feuding between supporters of the former prime minister and the incumbent, once Johnson\u2019s protege, suggests otherwise. The row with Rishi Sunak is ostensibly about something other than lockdown breaches, but they are connected in the way that multiple items of garbage can burn separately in the same skip fire. Sunak is accused of vetoing honours that Johnson was entitled to dole out on his resignation as prime minister, and of reneging on specific assurances that some MPs would get their peerages in due course. Downing Street says that is untrue. Nadine Dorries, one of the thwarted nominees, decries a snobbish conspiracy by rich kids in No 10 to prevent a working-class girl from Liverpool achieving the ladyship that Johnson had said was in the bag. Another explanation would be that Johnson lied. This is the trivialising process in action. Somehow debate lurched from the constitutional principle that MPs be accountable for the veracity of what is said in parliament to playground recrimination between rival gang leaders and their mates. The same manoeuvre skips glibly from a public health emergency in which hundreds of thousands of people died to bickering over the timetable on which failed ministers should be allowed to swap a seat in the Commons for a cushier berth in the Lords; all against the backdrop of a brutal cost of living crisis. Johnson is not responsible for all that is absurd in Westminster. The whole business of leaders draping their cronies in ermine was grotesque before he made it obscene. But his turpitude is radioactive. It illuminates flaws in a constitutional order based on protocols and propriety, while accelerating its decay. The more British democracy has been exposed to him, the less serious it has become. His toxic self-involvement has contaminated the Conservative party so completely that even in rejecting him it inflates his vanity. He is a lump of weapons-grade narcissium polluting the political air. Enough Tories have diagnosed that problem to want rid of him, although that urge is reversible. Less than a year ago Johnson was defenestrated by the parliamentary party. Only a few months later, a hundred MPs were ready to nominate him as the best person to replace Liz Truss. Back in the summer of 2019, when Theresa May resigned, plenty of Conservatives swore sacred oaths to prevent Johnson ever reaching No 10, before endorsing him and serving in his government. That was the Rubicon moment. Crossing to Johnson\u2019s side required wilful rejection of any attempt to enact Brexit while remaining in some way cognisant of economic and diplomatic reality. May had burned herself out trying to reconcile ideological demands for complete rupture from Europe with rational mitigation of the cost. It couldn\u2019t be done. Johnson represented the view that there was no real cost, only sabotage by enemies. And they could be overcome by a surge in national spirit, incarnated in a heroic leader \u2013 the archetypal offer of populism. Johnson\u2019s great helmsmanship and Brexit as a dream of national renaissance are still fused in some Tory imaginations. He addressed that constituency directly in a resignation statement that cast the privileges committee as a \u201ckangaroo court\u201d installed as part of a plot \u201cto take revenge for Brexit and ultimately to reverse the 2016 referendum\u201d. The form and tone of the argument are cribbed from the Donald Trump playbook: self-pitying, paranoid, designed to stir bellicose nationalist grievance. The imitation would be more alarming if it wasn\u2019t also desperate. There is an audience for the embittered Brexit betrayal myth, but not an election-winning majority. Its indulgence by Conservatives indicates a party already settling into opposition and, while US Republican-style derangement is an obvious trajectory once the burden of government is cast off, a restoration of beleaguered liberal Tory traditions is also available. For all the damage that Johnson has done, his power to make everything trivial has proved self-diminishing. He thought he stood above the institutions that he corrupted, but he was brought down by conventional democratic mechanisms. His lies about lockdown parties were exposed by a free press and punished by parliament. The Tory majority he claims as proof of his unique popularity did not save him. The system that swallowed his shtick also disgorged him. The real tragedy is that he was host to a more stubborn parasitic worm of an idea \u2013 the Brexit delusion that has nested in the guts of British politics and will not so easily be excreted.

Every Whitehall department has been ordered to assign a civil servant to identify the use of reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete (RAAC) across the \u00a3158bn government estate, the Guardian has learned. Inspectors are thought to have no idea how many out of thousands of government buildings were constructed with RAAC. The development represents a major expansion of a previous inquiry into the use of the building material that focused mainly on hospitals and schools. Experts have so far identified more than 150 schools where it has potentially been in use, and last week closed a primary in Southend, Essex, because of the safety risk. RAAC looks like concrete, but it is a lighter form of the material that was used in many one- and two-storey public sector buildings in the UK from the mid-1950s to the mid-90s. Less durable than traditional concrete, it has a shelf-life estimated to be about 30 years and is prone to collapse when wet. The government first turned its attention to use of the material in schools in 2018 after the roof of a primary school in Kent collapsed 24 hours after signs of structural stress began to appear. The dramatic expansion of Whitehall\u2019s inquiry emerged in a Local Government Association briefing last week. \u201cWhere it had previously focused on school buildings, central government is now looking to expand RAAC identification and remediation to the wider public estate. The Office of Government Property will be convening a working group in which there will be a designated representative from each government department who is responsible for the identification and remediation of RAAC in buildings owned by that department,\u201d the briefing said. The government has an extensive property portfolio, which was valued in March 2021 at \u00a3158bn and estimated to cost the taxpayer \u00a322bn a year to maintain. Some of the estate has been sold off the private sector \u2013 raising the prospect of expensive and extensive inquiries into the material\u2019s use by private landlords. The association has issued guidance for councils that says the concrete was \u201cused by some municipal architects primarily in office and schools\u201d. But it says it has been \u201cfound in a wide range of buildings, not all of which are still in the public sector\u201d. \u201cThe problem may be more serious than previously appreciated and \u2026 many building owners are not aware that it is present in their property,\u201d it said. An expert has warned that RAAC, which is up to 30 years past its intended shelf life, is also likely to be present in privately owned buildings being used, for example, as shops or leisure facilities. And they could not rule out the possibility it exists in some residential homes. Matt Byatt, the president of the Institution of Structural Engineers, said RAAC could be present in \u201coffice blocks, sports facilities, high street stores and hospitality buildings\u201d. We only know where it is when it has been found. But until someone is looking for it, they wouldn\u2019t know it\u2019s there.\u201d Byatt believes the general public \u201cneed to be aware of this\u201d. \u201cCouncils should be prioritising RAAC as an issue. It is known to have significant defects and way beyond its design life,\u201d he added. He said that \u201ctypically, low-rise structures with flat roofs built between mid-1960s and mid-1990s would be the most likely candidates to contain RAAC\u201d. It \u201cmay be\u201d in higher rise, residential buildings, but \u201cthat is not where we have been looking for it so far\u201d. Byatt explained that RAAC was \u201cthe new best thing\u201d when it was first used, because it was \u201clightweight and ticked a lot of boxes for people who wanted to get buildings up quickly\u201d. \u201cOn the surface, it looks like concrete but when you cut through it you notice how vastly different it is. RAAC is 80% air \u2013 like an aero bar. You could probably dig through it with a teaspoon. Cracks, excessive deflection and water ingress are all warning signs that something may be wrong.\u201d The prevalence of RAAC in hospitals has been widely known about by the government for several years. Last month, ministers announced they were fast-tracking the rebuilding of five hospitals that have \u201csignificant amounts\u201d of RAAC, \u201cgiven the risks they pose to patients and staff\u201d. The Ministry of Defence is investigating hundreds of military training facilities and barracks for RAAC. The Department for Education has been surveying schools for more than a year to try to work out how many have RAAC, and how liable this might make them to collapse. At least 150 schools have been found to potentially contain the concrete. But DfE has no idea of the extent of RAAC in other educational settings. There are growing concerns about RAAC in university and colleges, heightened after the recent closure of three buildings at the University of Aberdeen. Several other colleges are understood to be undertaking surveys to check for RAAC. In December, the government published guidance for colleges and schools on finding and managing RAAC, and has commissioned three structural engineering firms to investigate any council maintained nursery, college or school where RAAC is suspected. A government spokesperson said: \u201cBuilding owners have a responsibility to manage their buildings and ensure they are compliant with relevant legislation, including their duties under health and safety legislation to maintain a safe workplace.\u201d When it comes to the government\u2019s own estate, the spokesperson said: \u201cDepartments are prioritising maintenance and improvement works at those sites which have been identified as containing RAAC.\u201d"}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e701a9", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/jun/14/anguish-as-survivors-in-sudan-unable-to-access-vital-medication", "primaryCategory": "global-development", "subCategories": [], "title": "Anguish as rape survivors in Sudan unable to access vital medication", "lead": "Emergency contraception, HIV-prevention and abortion drugs are locked in a warehouse in Khartoum \u2013 leaving women to turn to desperate measures", "author": "Weronika Strzy\u017cy\u0144ska", "datePublished": "2023-06-14T05:00:04Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.294881", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/f6aad3cf58228dd15e84a18716b63c3eb2212a38/341_0_2159_1296/500.jpg", "body": "Rape survivors in the Sudanese capital, Khartoum, are struggling to get hold of emergency contraception and abortion medication. Access to a warehouse where 47,000 medical post-rape kits are stored has been cut off since the conflict began in April. Women are using social media to share information about where to find drugs to prevent pregnancies and infections \u2013 or are using herbal remedies. The UN Population Fund (UNFPA), which supplies the kits, said it could not say which forces, the Sudanese army or the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), were preventing access to the building. Post-rape kits are often distributed in conflict situations. They include emergency medication, such as the morning-after pill, drugs to induce abortion, and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), used to prevent HIV infection. A prompt response is crucial as most medication has to be taken within 72 hours of assault to be effective. Sulaima Ishaq, the director of the Sudanese government\u2019s Combating Violence Against Women Unit, said that, while there are limited supplies of PEP in some clinics in the city, \u201cwe have no ways to prevent pregnancies\u201d, she said. \u201cRapes are happening everywhere,\u201d said Ishaq. \u201cWhat is officially reported is likely just a small fraction of the cases.\u201d Last month, UNFPA reported that more than 5,000 post-rape kits had been delivered to Port Sudan, but it had not been able to move the medication west to Khartoum or Darfur, where the fighting is concentrated. Attacks on medical warehouses in South Darfur have also depleted medical supplies. Enas Muzamil, an activist working with rape survivors in Khartoum, said access to post-rape care has become a \u201cprivilege\u201d. \u201cEverything is now happening through informal networks. Women are communicating through groups on social media, sharing resources and medication they happen to have,\u201d she said. \u201cMany women are turning to traditional methods. They are making vaginal washes from herbs. One woman I know was raped by three men, she doesn\u2019t know whether or not she\u2019s pregnant. She was not able to access the right medication.\u201d Muzamil said she was contacted by the family of a 17-year-old whose home had been raided by RSF soldiers. \u201cThey found her sleeping and raped her. Eventually, we managed to find a local hospital doctor who still had medication and was able to visit the girl in her house, but it took us nine hours.\u201d Supplies of emergency contraception and abortion medication were scarce before the war, as abortion is not legal in the country, Muzamil added. Some women who have fled the capital to safer areas have been able to access emergency contraception through the Sudan Family Planning Association, said Limiaa Khalfalla, the organisation\u2019s programme director. The organisation has been offering health services in displacement camps via 11 mobile clinics, but is unable to say how many rape survivors they have offered support to. Some Sudanese women are attempting to smuggle medication from abroad. One anonymous activist said they are preparing to cross the border with supplies. \u201cI hope it will work,\u201d they said. \u201cBut I have to be careful as it is a crime that could send me to prison for 10 years.\u201d"}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e701aa", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/14/country-diary-there-are-swifts-aplenty-but-where-are-the-swallows", "primaryCategory": "environment", "subCategories": [], "title": "Country diary: There are swifts aplenty, but where are the swallows? | Derek Niemann", "lead": "<strong>Sandy, Bedfordshire:</strong> For the first month, I blamed persistent winds from the north.

There was no great clairvoyance on my part. Like many birders, I have anticipated local arrival dates for migrants in my head after watching for them over many years.

Today I\u2019m comforted a little by another gap, another hedge and a bird that knows its own width. This swallow skims the farm reservoir, then slips through an opening in a hedge and scythes back over the top. It slices in front of my midriff and over the lake, a blue-black back against grey, then turns again and is slashing back and forth, behind me, in front, turning me round to spin in wonder at how it can keep one eye on where it\u2019s going, one after potential prey, and one on me.

The agreement, signed by New Zealand\u2019s defence minister, Andrew Little, and Fijian minister for home affairs and immigration, Pio Tikoduadua, in Suva on Wednesday, sets a legal framework for military cooperation between the two countries in each other\u2019s territories. The agreement will also address disaster and humanitarian response coordination, and the challenges of climate change. Little said the deal \u201creflects the value New Zealand places on our relationship with Fiji\u201d, adding it was important for the two militaries to work together more effectively. It comes as the US, New Zealand and Australia push to build stronger security ties with Pacific nations, as they attempt to offer an alternative to China\u2019s growing influence in the region. Last month the US and Papua New Guinea signed a defence and maritime cooperation agreement. In 2022, Solomon Islands signed a security pact with China but Beijing failed to secure a broader regional security deal. \u201cBeijing\u2019s success in signing the China-Solomon Islands security deal last year has kind of put a chill on other Pacific Island nations doing the same, especially if not balanced by deals with Australia, New Zealand, or the United States,\u201d said Derek Grossman, a senior defense analyst at the RAND Corporation. Last week, Fiji\u2019s prime minister, Sitiveni Rabuka, signalled the country\u2019s intention to shift away from a policing agreement reached with China more than a decade ago, that had been suspended since he came into office in January. During a visit to Wellington, Rabuka said the 2011 agreement was now under review. \u201cIf our systems and our values differ, what cooperation can we get from them? We need to look at that again before we decide whether we go back to it, or if we continue the way that we have in the past by cooperating with those who have similar democratic values and systems,\u201d Rabuka reportedly said in Wellington last week. Under the policing agreement, China provided training as well as supplies to support Fijian police forces. Donations from China to Fiji included anti-riot gear, traffic command vehicles, office equipment, radio communication equipment, fibreglass, rubber boats for rescue operations, and other materials. Police officers from China were deployed to Fiji on attachment programs for periods of 3 to 6 months, the Fijian police force said in 2021, though it was not immediately clear where they were stationed. In 2018, a small group of Fijian police officiers were also given training in China on drug-trafficking cases, according to Chinese state media. Grossman said Fiji\u2019s move towards cancelling its policing agreement with China was in part due to a desire to \u201cprioritise working with like-minded democratic nations like New Zealand and Australia\u201d. He added the Fiji-New Zealand defence deal \u201cwill allow Kiwi forces to add capacity to Fiji and expose Suva to new technologies and enhance interoperability\u201d. Samantha Custer, director of policy at the University of William and Mary\u2019s AidData China Research program, said Fiji\u2019s moves to distance itself from Beijing may have wider repercussions in the region. \u201cThe buyer\u2019s remorse we see playing out in Fiji right now may spread to other parts of the region in future as countries rethink the trade offs of their security cooperation agreements and training with the PRC,\u201d she said."}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e701ac", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/14/ukraine-will-not-be-offered-timeline-for-nato-membership-at-summit-in-july", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": [], "title": "Ukraine will not be offered timeline for Nato membership at summit in July", "lead": "Gathering in Vilnius is likely to result in post-war security guarantees and easier route to join alliance when the time comes", "author": "Patrick Wintour Diplomatic editor", "datePublished": "2023-06-14T04:00:03Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.294896", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/f171536dd03e9a652429cdd825acfd9004e9c25c/0_100_3000_1801/500.jpg", "body": "Ukraine will not be offered a timeline with specific dates by which it can join Nato at its summit in Vilnius next month but instead may be offered a shorter route when an offer of membership is made. The proposal, reflecting a gathering consensus of key partners in the western defence alliance, will come as a disappointment to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Nato members, but outside formal Nato structures, will also offer post-conflict security guarantees to Ukraine, which are likely to take the shape of broad commitments to protect Ukraine from assaults by Russia. They are also expected to continue to provide ammunition and to help the Ukrainian armed forces become more convergent with Nato. But the commitments are likely to take a broad high level form rather than be specific offers of weaponry. The countries at the centre of the negotiations said it is normal in the run-up to a summit for Nato members still to be in disagreement. However, they hoped a possible commitment that Ukraine would not have to meet conditions set out in a laborious membership application plan (MAP) and instead gain near automatic membership once an invitation is offered would be recognised as an upgrade from anything offered to the country before. Finland and Sweden have been offered Nato membership without needing to complete a MAP. It is also likely that Nato will upgrade its current political relationship with Ukraine from the current Nato-Ukraine commission to a Nato-Ukraine council, an upgrade that gives Ukraine a higher status in joint meetings. One diplomat conceded the upgrade was unlikely to mean much to the average Ukrainian soldier fighting on the frontline but insisted it had a real value. Juliette Smith, the US ambassador to Nato, said an upgrade to a council format \u201cwould shift the fundamental dynamics\u201d, since Ukraine would be meeting as one of 32 attendees, as opposed to a format of 31 plus one. This would change the potential agenda items, something the US would welcome, she said. All sides have long accepted that Ukraine cannot become a Nato member in the middle of a conflict but Kyiv, backed by Baltic states and Poland, would like a date or a timeline by which it could join once the conflict ends. A Vilnius commitment to membership has been proposed. The absence of a date or clear conditions that Ukraine would need to meet to gain automatic Nato status will lead to Ukrainian accusations that Nato is doing little more than re-offering the promise of membership made to Ukraine at the Nato Bucharest summit in April 2008 when Nato said it had agreed Ukraine and Georgia will become members of Nato. Western countries said it would be perfectly understandable for Ukraine to be angry but insist the wording, coupled with the security commitments, can be an improvement. The need to maintain Nato unity at such a critical time is seen as paramount, with Vladimir Putin likely to be the only beneficiary of an acrimonious Nato summit in which different sides fall out over Ukraine\u2019s future Nato status. Full Nato membership gives members the protection umbrella of Nato\u2019s Article 5 commitment to collective self-defence. An attempt to require all Nato members to ensure 2% of GDP is spent on defence is also expected at the summit. The run-up to the summit was dealt a blow when the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, said Sweden should not expect a change of attitude from Ankara on its Nato membership bid at the summit next month unless it prevents anti-Turkey protests in Stockholm. Turkey cannot approach Sweden\u2019s Nato bid positively while \u201cterrorists\u201d were protesting in Stockholm, and Turkey\u2019s position would be made clear once again in talks with Swedish officials in Ankara on Wednesday, Erdogan was quoted as telling reporters on a flight returning from Azerbaijan on Tuesday. Erdogan made his comments before officials from Turkey, Sweden, Finland and Nato met on Wednesday in Ankara for talks to try to overcome Turkish objections that have delayed Sweden\u2019s membership bid. Smith at a briefing insisted Sweden was ready now for membership. Turkey has also been looking for the US Congress to lift its ban on the sale of F-16 jets to Ankara, but the US is looking for clear sequencing that sees Sweden\u2019s Nato admission is agreed before the sales ban can be lifted."}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e701ad", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/14/italian-prosecutors-say-hijackers-on-cargo-ship-were-actually-asylum-seekers", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": [], "title": "Italian prosecutors say \u2018hijackers\u2019 on cargo ship were actually asylum seekers", "lead": "Group stormed by Italian special forces included a pregnant woman and two minors with hypothermia", "author": "Lorenzo Tondo in Palermo", "datePublished": "2023-06-14T04:00:03Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.294902", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/aee14228fb81055cff142631eedab6f5427ca154/0_762_1500_899/500.jpg", "body": "A group of alleged hijackers on a cargo ship stormed by Italian special forces were in fact malnourished asylum seekers \u2013 including a pregnant woman and two minors suffering from hypothermia \u2013 who did not represent a threat and sneaked on to the vessel in the hope of reaching Europe, prosecutors in Naples have concluded. Italy\u2019s far-right defense minister Guido Crosetto announced on Saturday that he had deployed three military ships, dozens of special forces units and two attack helicopters to overpower a group of \u201cpirates\u201d who had attempted to hijack the Turkish vessel. But sources in the prosecutor\u2019s office say that Italian investigators have concluded that there had been no threat, no violence \u2013 and no hijacking. Thirteen men and two women, mainly from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq, furtively boarded the ship, named Galatea Seaway, which set off from Top\u00e7ular in Turkey on 7 June and was headed for S\u00e8te in southern France. According to the Italian government, the stowaways were discovered by the crew and allegedly tried to take some of the sailors hostage inside the bridge using knives. Italy\u2019s defense minister on Saturday claimed that the captain of the ship managed to radio for help, sending an urgent request to Ankara, which reported the incident to the Italian authorities, as the ship sailed 90 miles (150km) off the Italian coast. Crosetto described the stowaways as \u201chijackers\u201d and alleged that they were armed with \u201cweapons like daggers\u201d. Prosecutors in Naples launched an investigation, but after questioning the asylum seekers and crew members, they concluded that the group of refugees did not represent a threat and refused to charge them with attempted hijacking. The sources said the captain of the cargo ship had never said there was a risk of hijacking when he sent his request for help. Questioned by the press and accused of having exaggerated the incident, Crosetto replied insisting that the Italian forces intervened according to standard protocol. Three of the men were charged over the possession of knives, which they allegedly used to cut the tarpaulin of a truck in which they had hidden. The two women, one of whom was pregnant, were taken to the hospital, while the men were moved to a refugee reception centre. Every day, thousands of people are pushed to take ever more hazardous routes to avoid fierce violence from security forces in Balkan states and being stopped by the Libyan coastguard in the central Mediterranean. In February, Bulgarian authorities found 18 people dead in an abandoned truck near the village of Lokorsko, 12 miles (20km) north-east of Sofia. In 2020, seven north African men boarded a container in the Serbian town of \u0160id, hoping they would emerge a few days later in Milan. Their bodies were discovered on 23 October 2020, four months after they entered the metal box, in Asunci\u00f3n, the landlocked capital of Paraguay."}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e701ae", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/jun/14/fox-news-labels-joe-biden-a-wannabe-dictator-during-trump-speech", "primaryCategory": "media", "subCategories": [], "title": "Fox News labels Joe Biden a \u2018wannabe dictator\u2019 during Trump speech", "lead": "Fox was the only major cable news network to carry the former US president\u2019s speech live following his arraignment hearing earlier in the day", "author": "Royce Kurmelovs", "datePublished": "2023-06-14T03:43:10Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.294906", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/125f4284cf5cff054a255088b0673521285a2a3b/0_134_3574_2145/500.jpg", "body": "Fox News labelled US president Joe Biden a \u201cwannabe dictator\u201d who attempted to have \u201chis political rival arrested\u201d during a live broadcast of Donald Trump\u2019s post-arraignment speech.

He was nearly 60 when, in 1992, his sixth novel, All the Pretty Horses, brought him mainstream attention. The book was a bestselling award-winner and it was followed by The Crossing (1994) and Cities of the Plain (1998), to form The Border Trilogy. No Country for Old Men (2005) and The Road (2006) sold well and won awards too, the latter landing a Pulitzer. Both became hit films, made by the Coen brothers and John Hillcoat respectively. Then, after a 16-year long silence, McCarthy\u2019s final books arrived in 2022: The Passenger and Stella Maris. The paired novels met with mixed reactions, particularly the austere Stella Maris, a book-length conversation between a suicidal mathematical prodigy and her therapist. Reviewers wondered at McCarthy\u2019s attempt to write a female lead; McCarthy wrote about men, mostly. But in Stella Maris there were flashes of his classic style too, of his mordant wit and stark description. The Passenger also echoed his previous works. Parts seemed to recall No Country for Old Men, not least the opening scene of a diver in the Gulf of Mexico discovering a sunken plane, \u201cthe faces of the dead inches away. Everything that could float was against the ceiling. Pencils, cushions, styrofoam coffeecups. Sheets of paper with the ink draining off into hieroglyphic smears.\u201d Other parts read like a return to Suttree, McCarthy\u2019s epic of drifters in Knoxville, afloat on the Tennessee River, sludgy with catfish, or living precariously on its banks in a near-Joycean world of outcasts, petty criminals and profuse literary allusion. Sebastian Junger, author of The Perfect Storm, War and other classics of modern reportage, once told me Suttree was McCarthy\u2019s \u201cmost brilliant novel, because it\u2019s just his most mundane\u201d. It didn\u2019t show the reader the 1840s Texas of Blood Meridian, McCarthy\u2019s \u201cstunning\u201d 1985 western, Junger said. Nor was Suttree like The Road, \u201capocalyptic and whatever, all big dramatic stuff. Suttree takes place in Knoxville in fucking nothingness, and it\u2019s the most brilliant writing. It\u2019s insane. He\u2019s so good.\u201d I confessed: for all my raving about McCarthy, and echoes I found in Junger\u2019s work, I had not read Suttree. \u201cAre you fucking kidding?\u201d Junger said. \u201cYou have to read Suttree.\u201d I took his advice, went to the Strand on my way to the subway. He was right. Cornelius Suttree drifts through rusted rail yards, dive bars and diners. Not much plot happens over nearly 500 pages but everything is pungently hyperreal. McCarthy achieves a vast tapestry of anger, humour, violence, kindness, bad behaviour and basic decency. Suttree may be McCarthy\u2019s most sympathetic book but it\u2019s still very male. Just like his darker works, you don\u2019t read it as much as live it; emerging, you wonder if you dreamed it. His breakthrough novel, All the Pretty Horses, was perhaps his most conventional. But \u201calthough its subject and approach are superficially more palatable\u201d than those of McCarthy\u2019s previous books, the New York Times said on release, \u201cthe essence of his unusual vision also persists\u201d. Two young Texans go to Mexico to work with horses. An affair ends badly. Native Americans are present, but not central. The sense of an ancient wilderness from which the Americas were carved and to which they will return is palpable on each page. In the second and third books of the trilogy, McCarthy\u2019s vision darkens, his style fragments, the reader must work ever harder. What the Times reviewer contended would in lesser hands have become \u201ca combination of Lonesome Dove and Huckleberry Finn\u201d becomes instead a kind of modern Faulkner. Faulkner said \u201cthe past is never dead, it\u2019s not even past\u201d; McCarthy writes a terrible, perpetual present. In The Road, the story of a father and son\u2019s fight for survival in a blasted landscape after an unspecified environmental catastrophe, is grim, relentless and often hard to stomach. An all-too-plausible picture of a society destroyed by its own appetite, its antecedents are there in previous books, from the deranged hillbilly in Child of God to the ever-harsher terrain of The Border Trilogy and the seething horror of Blood Meridian. The Road ends on a note of hope \u2013 a faint one, though. No Country for Old Men came next. The Coen brothers\u2019 film may have superseded the book in the popular imagination, as successful films do, but readers are unlikely to be disappointed whether they come to the novel before or after the movie. The Coens took most of it straight from McCarthy\u2019s pages. Anton Chigurh, the hitman ultimately played by Javier Bardem, is a descendant of Judge Holden in Blood Meridian: implacable, terrifying, Death on his white horse assuming outlandish human form. McCarthy concentrates on simple, relentless fate. Like the west Texas landscape in which the drug deal gone awry plays out, the book has terrible beauty. It helps that it also rips along like a thriller. So does Blood Meridian, for my money McCarthy\u2019s greatest novel but more than that \u2013 the greatest modern novel, the true successor or companion to Moby-Dick, a book in which McCarthy pursues themes with which Herman Melville wrestled but places his tale in the open west, rather than at sea. In Blood Meridian, McCarthy reaches the peak of his style: spare and ornate at once, repetitious but endlessly readable. The violence is appalling, as violence is. White men wreak terror. Native Americans fight back. Through the maniacally eloquent Judge, McCarthy contends a stark truth: that violence is what men will always pursue. That violence is what America was born from and will not escape. Every time there is a school shooting, I think of McCarthy\u2019s tree, hung with the bodies of dead infants. In the end, McCarthy\u2019s elemental brilliance lies in perhaps the most famous lines in Blood Meridian: \u201cIt makes no difference what men think of war, said the judge. War endures. As well ask men what they think of stone. War was always here. Before man was, war waited for him. The ultimate trade awaiting its ultimate practitioner.\u201d"}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e701b0", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/14/ukraine-war-drove-biggest-rise-in-displaced-persons-in-decades", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": [], "title": "Ukraine war drove biggest rise in displaced persons in decades", "lead": "UN refugee agency said there were an estimated 108 million people affected globally by the end of last year", "author": "Lorenzo Tondo", "datePublished": "2023-06-14T03:01:01Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.294916", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/7c045d3d3aabdfdbb50028973255d5a601a23ae6/0_435_8640_5184/500.jpg", "body": "The war in Ukraine has driven the largest annual increase of people forcibly displaced by persecution, conflict, violence and human rights violations in decades, according to the United Nations refugee agency. In 2022, the number of displaced people grew by 21%, standing at an estimated 108.4 million at the end of the year. That likely rose to over 110 million people in May 2023, with Russia\u2019s ongoing invasion and the war in Sudan being the biggest drivers of the growth, according to a report released on Wednesday by UNHCR. \u201cThese figures show us that some people are far too quick to rush to conflict, and way too slow to find solutions. The consequence is devastation, displacement, and anguish for each of the millions of people forcibly uprooted from their homes,\u201d said Filippo Grandi, the UN high commissioner for refugees. The total number of refugees worldwide rose by the end of 2022 by a record 35%, or 8.9 million people, to reach 34.6 million, the report said. The increase was largely due to people from Ukraine, and revised estimates of Afghans in Iran and Pakistan. In the early days of the war in Ukraine, UNHCR said, \u201cmore than 200,000 refugees per day sought safety across borders, initially in countries neighbouring Ukraine\u201d. At the end of 2022, \u2018\u201811.6 million Ukrainians remained displaced, including 5.9 million within their country, and 5.7 million who fled to neighbouring countries,\u2019\u2019 creating the fastest displacement crisis, and one of the largest, since the second world war. \u201cThe report is quite an indictment on the state of our world, which seems increasingly dangerous and unpredictable,\u2019\u2019 said Matthew Saltmarsh, head of UNHCR\u2019s news and media section. \u201cConflict, insecurity and rights violations have continued or ignited in many places, adding to movements.\u201d While the invasion of Ukraine has led to the largest forced displacement crisis in terms of magnitude and velocity in 2022, conflict and insecurity in other parts of the world have also since continued or reignited. In April 2023, fighting erupted in Sudan between the army and RSF paramilitary forces, with devastating effects on the civilian population. \u201cThis year, the increase has been driven mainly by the situation in Sudan, where the conflict since April has produced almost half a million refugees and almost three times as many internally displaced,\u2019\u2019 said Saltmarsh. At least 190 children have been killed in the fighting in Sudan, and the number of acutely food insecure people in the country is estimated to rise by more than 2 million in the next three to six months. The situation also remains serious and desperate in Myanmar, where, by the end of May 2023, the number of people forcibly displaced increased by 331,600 from the end of 2022 to stand at 1.8 million, while the number of internally displaced people in the Democratic Republic of the Congo climbed to 6.2 million. UNHCR has been reporting on forced displacement for decades but has reliable data going back to the early 2000s. \u201cOverall, more effort is needed by the international community \u2013 politicians must focus on making peace as well as continuing to provide financial support to address the needs of the forcibly displaced,\u2019\u2019 said Saltmarsh. \u201cBy the end of 2022, UNHCR had received just over half the funding needed for the year; 12 of our operations were chronically underfunded but we are now responding to more emergencies than ever.\u201d"}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e701b1", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/14/hunter-valley-bus-crash-football-clubs-home-ground-becomes-shrine-to-victims-as-premier-pledges-100000-support", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "subCategories": [], "title": "Hunter Valley bus crash: football club\u2019s home ground becomes shrine to victims as premier pledges $100,000 support", "lead": "Chris Minns visits devastated town as Singleton Roosters say support from wider community has been \u2018overwhelming\u2019", "author": "Natasha May and Christopher Knaus", "datePublished": "2023-06-14T02:28:40Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.294921", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/2ff773c636ad8925207697a0b3a3b59b8ec2ca56/0_182_5472_3283/500.jpg", "body": "Flowers spill over the centre circle at Rose Point Park, the home ground where so many of the Singleton Roosters\u2019 games are played. Lying amid the bouquets of roses and sunflowers, a small football bears not the signature of stars but the handwritten names Nadine, Kyah, Kane, Lynan, Andrew, Zach, Angus. The Roosters who won\u2019t play on the pitch again. The flowers were laid by the club members who gathered on Tuesday evening in remembrance of their coach and teammates who died in the Hunter Valley wedding bus crash. The club has found itself at the epicentre of the tragedy: Mitchell Gaffney and Maddy Edsell, the bride and groom whose wedding guests were returning from on Sunday night, were members of the Singleton men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams. Rotary Australia, working with the New South Wales government, has established a fund to support those caught up in the tragedy. The premier, Chris Minns, who visited the town on Wednesday, said his government would contribute $100,000 to the fund. \u201cWhen tragic events like this occur, it\u2019s the Australian way to reach out and support one another,\u201d Minns said. \u201cI know many people are looking at ways to support the families affected by this heartbreaking accident, and I encourage people to donate directly through the website \u2013 it\u2019s the quickest way to get funds to those who need them most.\u201d Gerard McMillan, the president of the Rotary Club of Singleton Sunrise, thanked the premier for kickstarting the fundraising activity. \u201cAs we talk, there are two young children who have lost their parents. They are going to need ongoing support,\u201d McMillan said. \u201cThere are just so many people hurting in our community, but we are resilient in the Hunter Valley.\u201d McMillan said he had been receiving calls from all around the country. \u201cPeople really want to get behind us.\u201d Sue Gardiner, the president of the Singleton Lionesses, said \u201ceverywhere you go, everyone\u2019s just feeling very \u2026 I don\u2019t know, just overwhelmed I think is the word. \u201cIt\u2019s just everywhere, everyone\u2019s affected. Even if you don\u2019t know the people directly, you know someone who knows someone who\u2019s been affected.\u201d Phil Walton, the immediate past president of Singleton Lions, said his heart went out to the newlywed couple. \u201cHow is it going to affect them into the future with their wedding anniversaries? This is something that\u2019s going to be in the back of their minds all the time.\u201d The Sydney Swans are preparing to pay tribute to the victims of the Hunter Valley wedding bus crash, including Kyah McBride, who had been selected to represent the Sydney Swans in the Women\u2019s Summer Series round. The AFL team\u2019s players will wear black armbands against the Brisbane Lions this weekend. The Swans chief executive, Tom Harley, said the club was deeply saddened by the \u201chorrific events over the weekend\u201d. \u201cOur hearts go out to all of those impacted by this tragedy and our club offers its deepest condolences to their family and friends,\u201d he said. On Wednesday morning, community members continued to add to the mound of floral tributes. Some arrived in groups, resting their heads on each other\u2019s shoulders; others grieved on their own. The community is rallying around the tiny club. A fundraising page set up by the Roosters for victims and their families has already raised $121,159. The local pub, the Horse and Jockey, has also pledged to use its weekly raffles to raise funds for the club to distribute to those affected. The Singleton Roosters said the support was overwhelming. \u201cSingleton Australian Football Club greatly appreciates the support from the community during this most devastating time,\u201d it said on its Facebook page. \u201cWe have been overwhelmed by the response to our GoFundMe page.\u201d The McBride family is grieving the loss of two of its members, mother and daughter Nadene and Kyah. Both played for the club. In a statement issued through NSW police, they asked for privacy to grieve. \u201cThere are no words to describe the grief our family is feeling at this time, which is why we would like to formally decline any requests for media interviews,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe ask that the media respect our privacy while we grieve and process this tragedy as a family unit.\u201d Thirteen people remained in a stable condition in hospital on Wednesday: nine at John Hunter hospital, two at Singleton hospital and two at Sydney\u2019s Royal Prince Alfred. Tracy Chapman, the Hunter Valley police district commander, said Wine Country Drive, where the accident occurred, was reopened Tuesday night. Police were working to ensure there was a safe passage on the road for people who wished to lay flowers and take a moment out of their day to think of the people who died, as well as those who \u201cnow have to rebuild their lives and work their way through that grief\u201d, Chapman said. There had also been multiple people in the community who had offered their own homes, accommodation and hotels to people visiting the community because they had lost a loved one or to be with loved ones affected, Minns said. Local grief counsellors had also offered their off-duty time to help those affected, the premier said. \u201cI think it\u2019s indicative of how wonderful this local community is, and how close-knit they are,\u201d Minns said. Paul O\u2019Keefe, a chaplain with the NSW Disaster Recovery Chaplaincy Network, has seen the full range of emotions from the Singleton community who have come to pay their respects to the victims. Wednesday was the first day that the mourners were able to come to the site of the crash after the road reopened Tuesday night. Many came to lay flowers, along with notes, polaroid pictures and at least one teddy bear, at the spontaneous memorial. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing absolute grief. Raw grief, as those folks who have been affected so badly by this incident,\u201d O\u2019Keefe said. \u201cI\u2019ve had people yesterday weeping peacefully. I\u2019ve had people virtually collapsing. I\u2019ve had people looking at the flowers and saying I remember this person, talking about the fact we had a beer in the pub last Thursday, and they were laughing and joking with me. \u201cAs a chaplain, we journey with them, whether it be in the pit, or whether it be celebrating.\u201d"}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e701b2", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2023/jun/13/trump-indictment-arraignment-miami-classified-documents-live-updates", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "subCategories": [], "title": "Trump claims \u2018political persecution\u2019 as he rails against indictment in golf club speech \u2013 as it happened", "lead": "Former US president addresses supporters after pleading not guilty to federal charges in Miami", "author": "L\u00e9onie Chao-Fong (now) and Chris Stein (earlier)", "datePublished": "2023-06-14T02:13:52Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.294925", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/9c8b0ebf540f82f97b774658487424770add10ea/0_51_3000_1800/500.jpg", "body": "Here\u2019s a recap of today\u2019s developments: Donald Trump pleaded not guilty to all counts related to his alleged mishandling of classified documents as he was formally arraigned on Tuesday. Trump was charged with 37 federal counts, including 31 violations of the Espionage Act, becoming the first former US president to face federal criminal charges. Trump made his initial court appearance with his aide and co-defendant Walt Nauta, who faces six federal charges for his alleged role in a scheme to keep the classified documents concealed from authorities. Trump was released on bond on the condition that he would not discuss the case with a list of witnesses to be provided by the office of the special counsel Jack Smith. Nauta was not arraigned on Tuesday, as his lawyer was not admitted to practice in the southern district of Florida. Nauta is now scheduled to be arraigned on 27 June. Trump made a brief stop at a Miami restaurant after entering his plea and departing the courthouse. Supporters happily greeted the twice-arrested former president. He then made his way to his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, where he delivered remarks on Tuesday evening to respond to the indictment. Addressing supporters at the Bedminster golf club, Trump railed against Joe Biden, the Department of Justice, and past presidents who he said exhibited similar behavior. He described the indictment \u201ca political persecution like something straight out of a fascist or communist nation\u201d. A federal judge said E Jean Carroll, the New York writer who last month won a $5m jury verdict against Trump for sexual abuse and defamation, can pursue a related $10m defamation case against the former US president. In its live broadcast of Trump\u2019s speech at the Bedminster golf club, Fox News called Joe Biden a \u201cwannabe dictator\u201d who had his political rival arrested. The New York Times\u2019 Peter Baker tweeted the moment: Alex Thompson of Axios writes that the chyron went away when Sean Hannity took over at 9pm. Here\u2019s a clip of the crowd chanting \u201clock him up\u201d after Trump said he would appoint a \u201creal special prosecutor\u201d to go after President Biden and his family. Supporters of Trump were heard briefly chanting \u201clock him up\u201d as he vowed to appoint a special prosecutor to \u201cgo after\u201d Joe Biden, NBC News\u2019 Sahil Kapur writes. Donald Trump has now finished his statement to supporters at the Bedminster golf club. He remains on stage, waving to supporters. Meanwhile in Washington, Joe Biden is hosting a concert at the White House to celebrate Juneteenth. Trump says that if he becomes president, he will appoint a \u201creal special prosecutor to go after the most corrupt president in the history of the United States of America, Joe Biden, and the entire Biden crime family\u201d. \u201cI will totally obliterate the deep state,\u201d he says. He adds: We know who they are. I know exactly who they are. They want to take away my freedom because I will never let them take away your freedom. Trump moves onto discussing special counsel Jack Smith, who he describes as a \u201cthug\u201d whose record he claims is \u201cabsolutely atrocious\u201d. He claims Smith is a \u201craging and uncontrolled Trump hater\u201d who has done \u201cterrible things\u201d to his family. The audience at Trump\u2019s golf club in Bedminster break out singing happy birthday to Trump, who turns 77 tomorrow. He thanks the crowd, adding: We\u2019re gonna make it into the greatest birthday of all. On the subject of Hillary and Bill Clinton, Trump brings up the \u201cClinton\u2019s sock drawer\u201d defence and Hillary\u2019s use of private email. He says he was \u201cquite friendly\u201d with Bill, who he said was a \u201cnice guy\u201d that \u201cI happen to like\u201d, but goes on to claim that the former president \u201clost the nuclear codes\". He claims Hillary \u201cwasn\u2019t prosecuted\u201d for taking \u201chundreds of thousands of dollars worth of furniture, China flatware\u201d from the White House. Trump turns his focus to Joe Biden, repeating a false claim that the president withheld 1,850 boxes of classified documents from his time as vice-president. Trump claims many of Biden\u2019s classified documents were \u201cin Chinatown, DC Chinatown\u201d which he says is \u201cshocking considering his family received so much money from China\u201d. Trump wonders \u201chow many times the friends of ours from China reviewed those documents\u201d. Trump claims the photographs of boxes at Mar-a-Lago were \u201cstaged by the FBI\u201d. He tells his supporters: Many people have asked me why I had these boxes, why did you want them? The answer, in addition to having every right under the Presidential Records Act, is that these boxes were containing all types of personal belongings \u2013 many, many things, shirts and shoes \u2026 I wonder who it might have been dumped one of the very neatly arranged boxes all over the floor. Trump repeats his claim that he had \u201cevery right to have these documents\u201d under the Presidential Records Act. It\u2019s a law that he and his lawyers and supporters have repeatedly mischaracterised. Trump claims that as president, he enjoyed unconstrained authority to make decisions regarding the disposal of documents. Trump says the indictment against him is \u201ca political persecution like something straight out of a fascist or communist nation\u201d. Today will \u201cgo down in infamy\u201d, the former president says, but he remains defiant and vows that he will \u201cwin bigger and better\u201d. Donald Trump has started his address to reporters at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey. He starts by describing the indictment against him as \u201cthe most evil and heinous abuse of power in the history of our country\u201d. Trump accuses President Joe Biden of having him arrested on \u201cfake and fabricated charges of which he and numerous presidents would be guilty\u201d. Donald Trump is due to address his supporters at his luxury golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, hours after his court hearing in the federal indictment against him. The former president is expected to make a statement when he arrives, at about 8.45pm local time. With a presidential-style plane and motorcade, a bunch of flag-waving fans and a lawyer shouting alternative facts, the latest season of The Trump Show \u2013 let\u2019s call this one The Defendant \u2013 again filled every TV screen on Tuesday. But the most important scene of all was missing. And no one was happier about that than Donald Trump himself. Americans were denied the chance to see and hear the former US president, the first to face federal criminal charges in America\u2019s 247-year history, sitting in court and taking his medicine. It was like To Kill a Mockingbird without Atticus Finch\u2019s closing argument or A Few Good Men without Colonel Jessup erupting: \u201cYou can\u2019t handle the truth!\u201d Instead of Twelve Angry Men, it was Twelve Angry Maga Men waving flags outside court. It mattered because the inside of the courtroom is the one place where Trump was no longer the all-powerful emperor of his dreams but a humbled, vulnerable figure who, on the eve of his 77th birthday, was contemplating the prospect of prison. It mattered even more because, in the age of disinformation, where lies saturate social media and Trump\u2019s supporters\u2019 alternative reality, a court of law is the last redoubt where evidence, facts and truth are still the bottom line. Read the full story by my colleague David Smith here: Alabama senator Tommy Tuberville has been spotted at Donald Trump\u2019s golf club in Bedminister, New Jersey, where the former president is expected to make a speech later. The New York Times\u2019 Maggie Haberman tweeted a picture of the Republican senator: Tuberville faced criticism from his Republican colleagues after skipping a vote in the Senate this afternoon to attend the event, Punchbowl News\u2019 Andrew Desiderio reports. A plane carrying Donald Trump has landed in New Jersey. The former president is due to make his way to the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, where he is expected to make a speech to supporters at around 8.45pm local time. Sky News\u2019 Sophie Alexander said she was shouted and sworn at by supporters of Donald Trump as the former president visited a restaurant in Miami this afternoon. Alexander said she asked Trump if he was \u201cready to go to jail\u201d and was \u201cmet with a furious crowd booing and shouting \u2018get her out\u2019\u201d. She continued: I tried to step down from the chair I was standing on and a man grabbed my arm before another told him not to touch me. As I was leaving the cafe another yelled \u2018stupid b****\u2019 in my face. Joe Biden also declined to comment on today\u2019s proceedings as he attended a reception honouring US state department chiefs of mission. At the reception, Biden drew laughter from the audience as he spoke about his lengthy meetings with the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping. He said: I had a lot of personal, just one-on-one conversations. And we each had a simultaneous interpreter. I turned all my notes in. He added that it was \u201cnot a reference to the president, former president. But look, no, it really isn\u2019t.\u201d Donald Trump was reported to have confiscated an interpreter\u2019s notes after a meeting with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. The White House\u2019s press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, earlier refused to comment on the federal criminal indictment of Donald Trump. Asked if Joe Biden agreed with his wife, Jill Biden, who has previously said it was a \u201clittle shocking\u201d that Trump maintained large support from the Republican party, Jean-Pierre replied: I\u2019m just not going to comment on anything that\u2019s related to the indictment. She also avoided a question about whether Biden would consider pardoning his predecessor. The White House spokesperson did stress that the president was categorically not involved in any decision by the justice department to indict Trump, as my colleague David Smith writes. Even by Florida\u2019s already unorthodox standards, the arraignment of Donald J Trump, the ultimate carnival barker, in Miami on Tuesday afternoon was something of a circus. The concept of a former leader of the free world appearing before a federal judge to deny he stole and retained some of the nation\u2019s most sensitive secrets \u2013 keeping some in a bathroom \u2013 was surreal enough. But the historic act of the twice impeached, twice indicted ex-president actually doing so, while remaining the runaway favorite to win the Republican party\u2019s nomination for next year\u2019s general election, was extraordinary. Lending to the theater of the absurd outside downtown Miami\u2019s Wilkie D Ferguson courthouse, named for a late, respected early Black judge of the southern judicial district of Florida, was a resident flock of roosters strutting around crowing, a top-hatted elderly gentleman in a red long-tailed coat waving a Trump-DeSantis 2024 flag, and a couple of dozen \u201cBlacks for Trump\u201d protesters insisting that \u201cTrumpsters [sic] are not racist\u201d. But it was the proceedings inside courtroom 13-3 that held the attention. The 45th president of the United States sat silently, sullenly, between his lawyers throughout an arraignment hearing that lasted little more than 45 minutes, folding his arms and clenching his fingers, and occasionally grimacing in his navy blue suit and trademark red tie. It was his lawyer, Todd Blanche, who did the talking for the usually loquacious Trump. \u201c[We] most certainly enter a plea of not guilty,\u201d Blanche said of the 44-page, 37-count indictment that, thankfully, was not read out loud. And: \u201cWe so demand [a jury trial], yes, your honor.\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr took to social media as their father pleaded not guilty in the courthouse. Eric retweeted a post by the Republican congressman Jim Jordan that said there were different standards of justice for the Trump and Biden families. While Donald Trump Jr praised Ohio senator, JD Vance, for saying he would block all nominees to the Department of Justice over the indictment against the former president. Ohio senator, JD Vance, who was endorsed by Donald Trump in his 2022 race, has said he would block all nominees to the Department of Justice \u201cuntil Merrick Garland stops using his agency to harass Joe Biden\u2019s political opponents\u201d. In a statement posted to Twitter, Vance called the former president \u201cmerely the latest victim of a Department of Justice that cares more about politics than law enforcement\u201d and said he would \u201cgrind [Garland\u2019s] department to a halt\u201d in protest of \u201cthe unprecedented political prosecution\u201d of Trump. Vance said: Starting today, I will hold all Department of Justice nominations. If Merrick Garland wants to use these officials to harass Joe Biden\u2019s political opponents, we will grind his department to a halt. Vance\u2019s hold will just slow down the confirmation process for DoJ nominees, who will now all need to go through a procedural vote and a confirmation vote. As Punchbowl News\u2019 John Bresnahan points out, the Ohio senator\u2019s announcement doesn\u2019t really change anything. As we reported earlier, Donald Trump\u2019s personal valet Walt Nauta was not arraigned today as his lawyer was not admitted to practice in the southern district of Florida. Nauta is now scheduled to be arraigned on 27 June. A navy veteran from Guam, Nauta worked as a White House valet during the Trump administration and moved to Florida following the 2020 election to become Trump\u2019s personal aide. Prosecutors allege that Nauta was a point person for Trump whenever he wanted to access or hide the boxes of classified documents. The indictment states that Trump directed Nauta to transport various documents to Trump\u2019s personal residence and that Nauta helped Trump try to conceal the boxes of top secret information from the FBI. Nauta also texted two Trump employees about the documents, in one case sending a photo of a tipped-over box and classified documents spilled out on the floor of a storage room. Nauta faces several charges including conspiracy and making false statements, such as telling investigators that he didn\u2019t know where the boxes of classified documents were being stored. He is the only person other than Trump charged in the case. Here\u2019s a guide to the most important people involved in the indictment against Trump: Donald Trump has boarded his private plane in Miami, and is heading to his luxury golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. He is expected to make a statement on today\u2019s criminal proceedings at a fundraising event later today. A judge has said E Jean Carroll, the writer who won a $5m jury verdict against Donald Trump last month, can pursue a separate defamation lawsuit against the former president. The writer and former Elle magazine columnist had sought to amend her original defamation lawsuit filed in 2019 so she could try to seek additional punitive damages after Trump repeated statements a federal jury found to be defamatory. A New York jury last month found Trump had sexually assaulted Carroll in a New York department store in 1996. The jury found that the former president \u201csexually abused\u201d Carroll, defined as subjecting her to sexual contact without consent by use of force, and for the purpose of sexual gratification. But the jury did not find that Trump raped her. Trump was ordered to pay Carroll $2m for battery and $3m for defamation. Carroll then sought to amend her separate defamation lawsuit over a similar denial by Trump in June, in which he told a White House reporter that the rape never happened and that Carroll was not his \u201ctype\u201d. The revision also sought to incorporate Trump\u2019s comments made in a CNN town hall, where he called Carroll\u2019s account \u201cfake\u201d and labeled her a \u201cwhack job\u201d. Here\u2019s a clip of Donald Trump arriving at the Miami courthouse earlier this afternoon for his formal arraignment, where he pleaded not guilty to all counts related to his alleged mishandling of classified documents. Donald Trump\u2019s visit to the famous downtown Miami restaurant Versailles, where he was greeted by supporters, was pre-planned and part of his team\u2019s attempt to control his image, HuffPost\u2019s SV D\u00e1te writes. As the New York Times\u2019 Maggie Haberman points out, Trump is determined to fight the battle in the court of public opinion for as long as possible, including by having his co-defendant Walt Nauta close by him today. After he left court, Fox News showed Trump visiting a cafe in Miami and being greeted like a wronged hero. Supporters gathered around him and prayed for him. Someone shouted: \u201cJesus loves you!\u201d Trump smiled and waved to the crowd and declared: \u201cFood for everyone!\u201d The crowd erupted in applause and cheers. One yelled: \u201cKeep fighting, sir!\u201d Then, ahead of Trump\u2019s 77th birthday tomorrow, the patrons broke out in a chorus of \u201cHappy birthday dear Donald, happy birthday to you!\u201d The former president remarked: Some birthday! We\u2019ve got a government that\u2019s out of control. He then made brief comments about \u201ca rigged deal\u201d, suggesting that \u201cwe have a country that is in decline like never before,\u201d and promising to speak more in Bedminster, New Jersey tonight. Someone shouted: \u201cGod bless Donald Trump!\u201d as he departed and returned to his motorcade. Donald Trump has stopped by the Miami restaurant, Versailles, after the conclusion of his court hearing, where he told customers that he would pay \u201cfor food for everyone\u201d. A group of people appeared to pray as he entered the cafe, while a crowd sang happy birthday to the former president, who turns 77 tomorrow. Trump\u2019s co-defendant Walt Nauta was also seen in the restaurant. Earlier we reported that a protester was seen running in front of Donald Trump\u2019s motorcade as it departed the courthouse in Miami. Here\u2019s the clip of the man being tackled by security services, as shared by MSNBC\u2019s Manny Fidel: Donald Trump appeared frustrated throughout his arraignment in the Miami courthouse, my colleague Hugo Lowell reports. The former president \u201cfolded his arms and re-folded his arms throughout, with a constant frown on his face\u201d, he says. Donald Trump has departed the Miami courthouse after the conclusion of his hearing. He is expected to travel to Bedminster, New Jersey, later today. As Trump\u2019s motorcade departed the courthouse, the former president\u2019s security staff were seen tackling a man in the street who appeared to be a protester. The arraignment of Donald Trump has concluded, Reuters reports. His valet, Walt Nauta, was not arraigned because he does not have a local attorney to represent him, Reuters says. Nonetheless, magistrate judge Jonathan Goodman instructed him not to speak to witnesses about the case, and allowed him to leave on his own recognizance. Donald Trump and his valet, Walt Nauta, are both facing serious federal charges \u2013 but not the same ones. As the Guardian\u2019s Sam Levine explained earlier today, the former president is accused of more misconduct than Nauta: Trump is charged with 31 counts of unauthorized retention of national defense information, a violation of the Espionage Act. Each count carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. Trump and Waltine Nauta, his valet, face additional charges of conspiracy to obstruct justice, tampering with grand jury evidence and concealing evidence in a federal investigation. Each of those charges is punishable by up to 20 years in prison. Trump and Nauta also face additional charges of making a false statement. Those carry a maximum sentence of up to five years in prison. An earlier version of this post cited Reuters reporting based on the Associated Press that Donald Trump\u2019s valet, Walt Nauta, pleaded guilty to the charges against him. That is incorrect. Nauta was not arraigned today because he does not have a local attorney, and he did not enter a plea. One of Donald Trump\u2019s lawyers, Alina Habba, earlier spoke outside the courthouse in Miami where she lashed out against the indictment of the former president, calling it \u201can unapologetic weaponisation of the criminal justice system\u201d. Habba, who is not representing Trump in this case, said compared the indictment to \u201cthe type of thing you see in dictatorships like Cuba and Venezuela\u201d and said the former president was feeling \u201cdefiant\u201d. She said: What is being done to President Trump should terrify all citizens of this country. These are not the ideals that our democracy is founded on. This is not our America. Federal prosecutors say they do not believe Donald Trump is a flight risk, and the former president has been allowed to leave his arraignment without conditions, Reuters reports, citing CNN. The outcome was not unexpected, as Trump has vowed to fight the allegations against him, and is also busy campaigning across the United States for the Republican presidential nomination. Mike Pompeo, the former US secretary of state under Donald Trump, has said the way the former president stored classified documents after leaving office was \u201cwrong\u201d. In an interview with Fox News, Pompeo said: If the allegations are true, and there\u2019s lots of indications that they are, President Trump had classified documents where he shouldn\u2019t have had them, and then when given the opportunity to return them, he chose not to do that for whatever reason. He said he had handled \u201cthousands and thousands\u201d of classified documents during his time in Congress and as CIA director, as well as while serving as secretary of state. He added: I suppose we can all make mistakes and get them to the wrong place, but when somebody identifies that, you gotta turn them in. So that\u2019s just inconsistent with protecting America\u2019s soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines and if the allegations are true, some of these were pretty serious, important documents. So that\u2019s wrong. Meanwhile, in an interview with CNN, the Republican congressman Ken Buck said the public will need to see how the evidence for the case against Trump is presented and what his defence is, but he would not \u201cfeel comfortable\u201d supporting someone who has been convicted of a felony for president. Buck said: If he is convicted of these charges of mishandling this information, of knowingly concealing his actions, I don\u2019t think, I certainly won\u2019t support a convicted felon for the White House. He noted comments that Trump previously made against Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential election campaign, where he accused his Democratic rival of being unfit for office because of her handling of emails on a private server. Buck added: I think [Trump\u2019s] words will set the standard that America will look at in determining whether he is fit for president. Here\u2019s more from CNN on how Donald Trump carried himself at his arraignment: US magistrate judge Jonathan Goodman is presiding over Donald Trump\u2019s arraignment, where he entered his not guilty plea, Reuters reports. Walt Nauta, the aide who was indicted alongside him, is also present in the courtroom. Donald Trump has pleaded not guilty to charges related to allegedly hoarding government secrets at his Mar-a-Lago resort and frustrating efforts by the federal government to retrieve them at his ongoing arraignment in Miami, Reuters reports. Donald Trump\u2019s federal arraignment has begun, Reuters reports. He is expected to be formally notified of the charges against him, and will be able to enter a plea. CNN reports that Jack Smith, the special counsel appointed by attorney general Merrick Garland to handle the investigation and prosecution of Donald Trump over the Mar-a-Lago documents, is in attendance at the former president\u2019s arraignment: Smith is also presiding over the ongoing federal investigations of Trump for his involvement in the January 6 insurrection and the plot to stop Joe Biden from taking office following the 2020 election. Donald Trump has stepped into the courtroom where the charges against him over the Mar-a-Lago documents will be read out, and where he will be able to enter his plea, Reuters reports. Miami\u2019s mayor, Francis Suarez, is a rare Republican leader of a big US city, but that doesn\u2019t mean he was well received when he stopped by outside his city\u2019s federal courthouse. It was a weird scene, and you can watch it below: The ever-industrious Manu Raju, CNN\u2019s chief congressional correspondent, has conducted some more vox pops in the halls of power, buttonholing two Republicans and a Democrat for comment on Donald Trump\u2019s extreme predicament. Lindsey Graham, a Republican senator from South Carolina and a close Trump ally, said: Most politicians get in trouble by self-inflicted wounds. Yeah, I mean, he believes he had the right to possess these [records] under the Presidential Records Act. I don\u2019t know whether that\u2019s accurate or not. Dan Crenshaw, a Texas Republican congressman and former US Navy SEAL, said: I\u2019m not dismissing it. I\u2019m not condemning it. I\u2019m not a spokesperson. And that\u2019s my stance as a member of Congress. You know, if he becomes president one day, then I probably have to comment. Told, \u201cYou\u2019re a military guy, he allegedly had national security information\u201d, Crenshaw said: It\u2019s very problematic, there\u2019s a reason I\u2019m not defending it. Finally, Raju spoke to Richard Blumenthal, a Democratic senator from Connecticut who has concerns about the judge in the case, Aileen Cannon, who was appointed under Trump and whose rulings in earlier stages of the case proved controversial in the extreme: I think the record is a cause for real concern. She has to overcome the presumption arising from her past rulings that he somehow favors the president who appointed her, former president Donald Trump. In the total scheme of things, I\u2019d advise her to recuse. Here\u2019s more on Cannon: Mitch McConnell, the Senate minority leader, refused to discuss the indictment of Donald Trump during a news conference. Asked by a CNN reporter if he \u201ccould still support\u201d the former president for the Republican nomination if he is convicted of the charges, McConnell replied: The Republican campaign for the nomination has already been going on for six months, it\u2019s going to be going on for a year longer. I\u2019m just simply not going to comment on the candidates. We\u2019ve got a bunch of them and I\u2019m just simply going to stay out of it. Here\u2019s the clip: Donald Trump and his close aide Walt Nauta are now both under arrest in Miami\u2019s Wilkie D Ferguson Jr US courthouse ahead of their arraignment on federal charges related to the classified government documents found at Mar-a-Lago, CNN reports: Do not expect the former president to spend the night in jail, at least not yet. According to CNN, Trump is expected to be released on personal recognizance \u2013 essentially a promise that he\u2019ll show up for future court dates. It\u2019s more difficult than us journalists would like to find out what\u2019s happening inside the Miami federal courtroom where Donald Trump will be arraigned. The former president\u2019s hearing is closed to cameras and live broadcasts, despite an attempt by media outlets for access. Donald Trump and Walt Nauta, the aide to the former president indicted alongside him over the classified government documents discovered at Mar-a-Lago, have both been processed at Miami\u2019s federal courthouse, a court official tells Reuters. Defendants are usually fingerprinted and have their mugshots taken in processing, and sometimes handcuffed, but it\u2019s unclear what the exact arrangement is for Trump and Nauta. We\u2019ll let you know more when we find out. As he drove into Miami to face the first federal charges ever brought against a former president, here is what Donald Trump had to say on Truth Social: ON MY WAY TO COURTHOUSE. WITCH HUNT!!! MAGA The Associated Press managed to capture a shot of Donald Trump as he left the Trump National Doral resort for the Miami federal courthouse, where he is set to be arraigned: Live video from outside the Wilkie D Ferguson Jr US courthouse in Miami shows lots of marked and unmarked police cars with lights flashing, police officers carrying an array of weapons and equipment and an ambulance at the ready. There\u2019s also a crowd of the former president\u2019s supporters carrying signs reading \u201cI stand with Trump\u201d. What the cameras have not managed to yet spot: Donald Trump. He\u2019s said to be entering through a side door of the courthouse. Donald Trump has arrived at the federal courthouse in Miami where he will be arraigned on charges related to the classified documents found at his Mar-a-Lago resort. Follow along here for the latest. Donald Trump is on his way to court in Miami, which we know in part because TV networks are following him in helicopters as we know they are wont to do, from the experience of his New York indictment in April. We have had reports that the former president will not be handcuffed, made to empty his pockets or told to stand for a mugshot. The BBC reports that he will be fingerprinted. Sarah Churchwell, a professor, author and Guardian contributor, has a point to make to the BBC, meanwhile: Round about the time everything is expected to kick off in Miami, with the arraignment of the former president Donald Trump, in Washington the current president, Joe Biden, will meet Jens Stoltenberg, the secretary general of Nato. The meeting was meant to happen yesterday but it was delayed because the president had to go to the dentist. Stoltenberg met Antony Blinken, the secretary of state, earlier today. Biden and Stoltenberg have met three times at the White House before. This time, the press pool says, they are due to discuss preparations for the forthcoming Nato summit in Lithuania, where new aid to Ukraine is expected to be agreed. The issue of who will succeed Stoltenberg may also be discussed. In place since 2014, the former Norwegian prime minister, now 64, is due to finish his tenure in charge of Nato at the end of September. It\u2019s possible he could succeed himself, having already seen his term extended three times. The White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, violated the Hatch Act by referring to \u201cmega Maga Republicans\u201d before last year\u2019s midterm elections, an official watchdog said. In a letter reported by NBC and confirmed by other outlets, the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) said: \u201cBecause Ms Jean\u2010Pierre made the statements while acting in her official capacity, she violated the Hatch Act prohibition against using her official authority or influence for the purpose of interfering with or affecting the result of an election.\u201d According to the OSC, the Hatch Act, passed in 1939, \u201climits certain political activities of federal employees\u201d and is meant to \u201censure that federal programs are administered in a nonpartisan fashion, to protect federal employees from political coercion in the workplace, and to ensure that federal employees are advanced based on merit and not based on political affiliation\u201d. The Hatch Act was often in the news during the administration of Donald Trump. In November 2021, a year after Trump left power, the OSC said at least 13 Trump officials intentionally violated the act, not least in connection with a 2020 Republican convention held on White House grounds. Officials named included Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state; Mark Meadows, Trump\u2019s chief of staff; Kellyanne Conway, a senior White House counselor; Jared Kushner, a senior adviser to Trump, his father-in-law; Kayleigh McEnany, the press secretary; and Stephen Miller, a senior speechwriter and adviser. The OSC report said: \u201cThe cumulative effect of these repeated and public violations was to undermine public confidence in the nonpartisan operation of government.\u201d The Trump White House ignored Hatch Act violations. In June 2019, for example, an OSC recommendation that Conway be fired did not lead to further action. In November 2021, the OSC said \u201csuch flagrant and unpunished violations erode the principal foundation of our democratic system \u2013 the rule of law\u201d. Regarding that OSC report, the Washington Post noted the existence of \u201ca two-tiered system of consequences\u201d, the OSC having \u201cfined and in some cases fired hundreds of career employees for violations during the four years when Trump was in office\u201d. Donald Trump is to make his first appearance in a Miami federal court at 3pm to answer the federal indictment brought against him by special counsel Jack Smith over the classified documents found at Mar-a-Lago. This will be the former president\u2019s second court appearance in recent months, after he traveled in April to New York City to plead not guilty to charges of falsifying business records filed by the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin Bragg, and it may also be only the start of Trump\u2019s federal court trouble. Smith is also investigating the former president\u2019s involvement in the January 6 insurrection and the attempt to overturn the 2020 election, and charges on those could appear in the future. Here\u2019s more about what has happened today: Trump has had some trouble assembling a legal team for his federal court appearance today. The former president\u2019s supporters and detractors rallied outside Miami\u2019s Wilkie D Ferguson Jr US courthouse, as did Vivek Ramaswamy, a long-shot Republican presidential contender who vowed to pardon Trump, if elected. House Democrats plan to use unusual parliamentary tactics to try to force a vote on gun control legislation in the Republican-controlled chamber. When Donald Trump\u2019s arraignment begins at 3pm ET, you can expect to hear a lot of names. The Guardian\u2019s Nick Robins-Early has a rundown of the major players in the indictment, which will form the backbone of the court hearing: Donald Trump\u2019s 44-page federal indictment depicts a varied cast of characters orbiting around the former president as he mishandles, flaunts and conceals top secret documents and reveals classified military information. The case involves numerous individuals, some named and others referred only by their titles, but all who allegedly played a role in Trump committing crimes related to the boxes of classified documents he took from the White House after leaving office. The indictment, which was unsealed last week, sets up a criminal case that could lead to significant time in prison if Trump is convicted and further complicate his presidential campaign for the 2024 election. Along with the Trump world staffers mentioned in the indictment, it will also put attorneys on both sides of the case on the national stage. Here\u2019s a guide to the most important people involved: Amid outrage over the continued gun violence in the United States, House Democrats will attempt to force a vote in the GOP-controlled chamber on new firearm restrictions, the Washington Post reports. Republican speaker Kevin McCarthy and his allies control what legislation is voted on by the full chamber, and have shown little interest in tightening gun access despite high-profile mass shootings and the prevalence of gun crime across the country. The Post reports that Democrats will file discharge petitions on three gun control measures, and if the petitions receive the signatures of all Democrats and at least five Republicans, they must be voted on by the full House: Democrats appear to be hoping that some Republicans will break with GOP leadership and back the proposals. Top House Democrats, including the minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, have scheduled a 2pm press conference along with gun control groups to unveil the strategy. Meanwhile in Washington, Donald Trump\u2019s allies in Congress are vowing to do all they can to help him fight Jack Smith\u2019s prosecution. Here\u2019s the judiciary committee\u2019s Republican chair Jim Jordan hinting to CNN that he may demand testimony from Smith, the special counsel appointed by attorney general Merrick Garland specifically to handle the investigations into Trump: But as Punchbowl News reports, the likelihood of Smith going before Congress anytime soon is very low. As long as his investigations and prosecution of Trump remain active, the justice department will decline to cooperate with any subpoena issued to Smith, citing their policy of not commenting on ongoing cases. The GOP\u2019s best bet at this point would be to sue, but there\u2019s no saying what a federal judge would think of their demand, or even when it would be considered. That said, Garland is expected to make a regularly scheduled appearance before the House judiciary committee in the late summer or early fall, Punchbowl reports, an occasion Republicans will undoubtedly use to air their grievances over Trump\u2019s prosecution. Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy is so far down in the polls it\u2019s hard to even see him on a graph, but he\u2019s trying to make the most of Donald Trump\u2019s indictment. Like all GOP contenders, Ramaswamy has to contend with the fact that a sizable minority of Republicans are committed to supporting no one but Trump. To that end, the biotech entrepreneur has embraced a number of far-right positions, such as calling for the abolition of the FBI and a negotiated settlement to end the war between Ukraine and Russia. Just now, outside the Miami federal courthouse, Ramaswamy held a press conference before the many reporters milling about and vowed to pardon Trump if elected. See his speech below: As the Guardian\u2019s David Smith reports, Donald Trump\u2019s arraignment today \u2013 in which he is expected to hear the charges filed against him in special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s indictment and likely enter a plea \u2013 is no laughing matter. This will be the first time a former American president has ever faced federal charges, and it\u2019s possible that at the end of all this, Trump will be behind bars: Donald Trump, the former US president, is set to face the sobering reality of a courtroom on Tuesday afternoon as he stands accused of illegally hoarding classified information in a case watched around the world. The justice department\u2019s first prosecution of an ex-president concerns conduct that prosecutors say jeopardised national security and involves Espionage Act charges carrying the threat of a significant prison sentence in the event of conviction. Tuesday afternoon\u2019s arraignment in Miami, Florida, comes with Trump leading the race for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024, potentially turning his bid for the White House into a battle to stay out of prison. As president he could appoint favourable justice department officials or even seek to pardon himself. Apparently undeterred by his imminent federal court date, Donald Trump has spent the morning bashing special counsel Jack Smith from his Truth Social account: This is the Thug, over turned consistently and unanimously in big cases, that Biden and his CORRUPT Injustice Department stuck on me. He\u2019s a Radical Right Lunatic and Trump Hater, as are all his friends and family, who probably \u201cplanted\u201d information in the \u201cboxes\u201d given to them. They taint everything that they touch, including our Country, which is rapidly going to HELL! The former president followed that up with another classic of the all-caps form: THE GRAND JURY WAS NEVER TOLD ABOUT THE PRESIDENTIAL RECORDS ACT OR THE CLINTON SOCKS CASE, BOTH EXONERATING! Wait a second. Did Trump just invoke the name of Socks, Bill Clinton\u2019s family cat during his time as president? The answer is most likely no. The \u201cSOCKS\u201d Trump is referring to appears to be a convoluted attempt by his allies to claim that Clinton did something similar with presidential records to what Trump is accused of doing, but was not indicted for it. That counterargument was debunked by PolitiFact, and you can read why here. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports that at least one police official from Georgia\u2019s capital is in Miami to observe the security preparations for Donald Trump\u2019s court appearance today. Why would Atlanta\u2019s authorities be so interested in this? Because Fani Willis, the district attorney in Georgia\u2019s Fulton county, where Atlanta lies, is expected to sometime soon hand down an indictment against people involved in the failed attempt to overturn Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 election win in the state \u2013 and Trump could be one of them. If that happens, the former president will be on the hook for yet another court appearance, this time in Atlanta, and the city\u2019s police force will need to be ready for it. Here\u2019s more from the Journal-Constitution: Hundreds of reporters are outnumbering the handful of Trump supporters who walked around in the blazing sun outside the US courthouse where Trump will be arraigned at 3pm in the Mar-a-Lago documents case. Several prominent Republicans had called on Trump supporters to protest outside the courthouse but as of the mid-morning, there were fewer than 20 people brandishing Trump flags and wearing Maga caps. ABC News reports that Donald Trump will not be handcuffed or have his mugshot taken during his court appearance today: Here\u2019s more from the Guardian\u2019s Sam Levine on what, specifically, will happen when Donald Trump is arraigned today \u2013 including whether he will be handcuffed, and if a mugshot will get taken: Donald Trump will make his first court appearance on Tuesday after being charged with 37 criminal counts related to his handling of classified documents after leaving the presidency. He is set to appear at 3pm at the federal courthouse in Miami. It will be Trump\u2019s second arraignment this year. In April, he was arraigned in Manhattan on separate criminal charges related to his hush money payments to the adult film star Stormy Daniels. What\u2019s going to happen when Trump shows up in court? Trump\u2019s initial appearance is likely to be brief. He will be formally presented with the 37 criminal charges against him and informed of the penalties, and then he can enter a plea. Trump will almost certainly plead not guilty. By all indications, Donald Trump\u2019s appearance today in a Miami federal courtroom to answer the charges brought against him by special prosecutor Jack Smith will be the first step in lengthy legal proceedings that may not wrap up before the 2024 election. It\u2019s also worth remembering that Smith isn\u2019t finished with his work yet: besides overseeing Trump\u2019s prosecution for allegedly hiding government secrets at Mar-a-Lago, he may still indict the former president in the months ahead for his involvement in the January 6 insurrection and the plot to overturn Joe Biden\u2019s presidential election victory. Today is nonetheless a big day for Trump, but as the Guardian\u2019s Hugo Lowell reports, he\u2019s had some trouble finding lawyers to represent him: Donald Trump is expected to be represented at his first court appearance to face federal criminal charges for retaining national security materials and obstruction of justice by two of his existing lawyers, despite trying to recruit a local Florida lawyer willing to join his legal defense team. The lawyers making an appearance with Trump on Tuesday will be the top former federal prosecutor Todd Blanche and the former Florida solicitor general Chris Kise, according to people familiar with the matter. Trump\u2019s co-defendant, his valet Walt Nauta, will be represented by Stanley Woodward. Trump and his legal team spent the afternoon before his arraignment interviewing potential lawyers but the interviews did not result in any joining the team in time for Trump\u2019s initial court appearance scheduled for 3pm ET on Tuesday after several attorneys declined to take him as a client. Good morning, US politics blog readers. Donald Trump is expected to at 3pm ET today appear at a Miami federal courthouse to answer charges brought by special prosecutor Jack Smith over the classified documents discovered last year at his Mar-a-Lago resort. It\u2019s not the first time the former president has appeared as a defendant in court \u2013 Trump was arraigned in New York City two months ago after the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin Bragg, accused him of falsifying business records ahead of the 2016 election, a case that remains ongoing. But the charges brought by Smith are even more serious, with potentially long jail sentences and chilling national security implications. The former president is expected to mount a vigorous defense, and there\u2019s a chance the case will not be resolved by the time of the 2024 election, where Trump looks like a good bet for the GOP\u2019s nomination. Thus, today is likely to be the first episode of a long series of court dates for the former president. As for this blog, we\u2019ll be following his appearance today live as it happens. Here\u2019s what else is going on today: Joe Biden\u2019s schedule yesterday was upended by a surprise root canal, but the White House say he\u2019s back in business and will meet with the Nato secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, at 1pm. Also reportedly functioning again is the House of Representatives.

A typical trip to the supermarket will cost about 8% more today than it did a year ago. Unsurprisingly, there\u2019s a lot of argument about who, if anyone, is to blame for this, and what governments and the Reserve Bank can to do to help. If we think, as commentators including Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe would like us to do, in terms of a wage price spiral, it\u2019s obvious that wages have not been driving the process so far. Real wages have fallen back to levels last seen in 2012. Despite this, Lowe and the RBA would like to hold wages down, in order to achieve a rapid reduction in inflation to the preferred range of 2-3%. There are a couple of problems here. First, if wages aren\u2019t driving inflation, it seems as if profits must be. But why is this? The term \u201cgreedflation\u201d has been widely used, but it doesn\u2019t seem that Australia\u2019s corporate leaders are any more (or less) greedy than they were a few years ago, when inflation was running below 2%. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup A more plausible explanation relates to what Rod Sims and other experts like Ross Garnaut have said; that Australia has a high degree of market concentration in many areas, notably supermarkets. Despite some limited competition from independent grocers and Aldi, Coles and Woolworths dominate the market. They have increased their margins substantially since the beginning of the pandemic. Coles and Woolworths offer a curious double defence of their increased margins. On the one hand, reasonably enough, they observe that the prices they pay to their suppliers have increased. These increases, it seems must be passed on in full. On the other hand, they point to a variety of vaguely described reductions in their own operational costs, such as the end of costs related to Covid restrictions. Not mentioned is the fact that wages have barely moved, so that operating costs have fallen in real terms. In a normal market, when all firms can achieve cost reductions, competition ensures that these reductions are passed on to consumers. These competitive forces are much less effective in an oligopoly or duopoly market, so the cost reductions can be captured as higher profit margins. But the question arises again: why now? Oligopoly and duopoly were the rule before the pandemic when inflation was low. At an inquiry held by the House of Representatives standing committee on economics earlier this year, my colleague Flavio Menezes and I offered a partial explanation. Oligopolistic companies did not start the inflation but they did amplify it. During the lockdown phase of the pandemic, households built up savings as a result of government aid and the simple fact that lots of avenues for spending were cut off. Once the restrictions were lifted, households started spending. It\u2019s unsurprising that, when demand increases, prices rise. But, as we showed, firms with market power will increase their prices more than those in competitive industries. On the other side of the coin, the combination of market concentration and slow-moving wage bargaining has made it easy for employers to hold wage growth well below the rate of inflation. Even where generous sounding wage increases, like the recent 8.6% increase in the minimum wage have been achieved, they have barely allowed wages to catch up with prices. If governments really cared about the impact of the cost of living, they would support wage increases sufficient to maintain living standards, rather than fiddling with a few particularly noticeable prices, such as those for energy. In the longer term, a focus on promoting competition and an increase in home construction would resolve some of the biggest pressures on costs. It is possible that the long-term rate of inflation might settle about 4%, instead of the Reserve Bank\u2019s current target of 2-3%. But there is nothing magic about this target. It was picked arbitrarily in the early 1990s, for reasons that are no longer relevant. The low target has proved problematic at times. In particular, when interest rates were cut to zero during the lockdowns, monetary policy would have been more effective if inflation had been a little higher. The Reserve Bank bitterly resists any such suggestion, because it would lose \u201ccredibility\u201d as a result. Rather than focusing exclusively on inflation (the \u201ccost of living\u201d) it should pay a little more attention to the other two elements of its legal mandate: full employment and the living standards of the Australian people. And the government should get on with the business of tackling market concentration, which is not only fanning the flames of inflation but is allowing companies to reap record profits while workers and their families struggle to get by.

Donors and supporters chanted Trump\u2019s name, cheered him on and sang \u201chappy birthday\u201d. \u201cI just got charged,\u201d joked the former president, who turns 77 on Wednesday. \u201cA wonderful birthday.\u201d The former president was in Miami earlier in the day for his arraignment in the classified documents case. Federal prosecutors have accused him of wilfully withholding classified documents and obstructing justice, charging him with 37 federal counts including 31 violations of the Espionage Act. Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges, and was released on bond on the condition that he would not discuss the case with a list of witnesses. On the campaign trail, Trump has been determined to fight back in the court of opinion, keeping a busy schedule of campaign appearances and photo opportunities. In Miami, his campaign alerted reporters that he would be stopping at a restaurant, where faith leaders and fans greeted him with prayers and cheers. In New Jersey, he maintained the defiant message that he had practiced at previous campaign events, including over the weekend after the indictment was unsealed. He baselessly accused Biden of orchestrating the federal charges against him, calling them a \u201cpolitical persecution\u201d. In a remarkable moment of projection, the twice-impeached, twice-indicted president who is being investigated for election interference said Biden \u201cwill forever be remembered as not only the most corrupt president in the history of our country, but perhaps even more importantly, the president who together with a band of his closest thugs, misfits and Marxists tried to destroy American democracy\u201d. Trump also called Jack Smith, the special counsel who brought federal charges against him, \u201cderanged\u201d and a \u201cthug\u201d. He misconstrued the Presidential Records Act, which he has been accused of violating, and balked at charges over \u201cpossessing my own presidential papers, which just about every other president has done\u201d. In fact, the classified documents are not Trump\u2019s own \u2013 the Presidential Records Act stipulates that all official documents belong to the federal government. And no president in recent history has refused to return hoards of classified documents. The ex-president\u2019s escalating tenor comes with mounting legal troubles. Last month, a grand jury in Manhattan voted to indict Trump and local prosecutors brought criminal charges over hush money payments to Stormy Daniels. Meanwhile Fani Willis, the district attorney of Fulton county, Georgia, is investigating whether he and his allies illegally meddled in the 2020 elections in the state, and is weighing criminal charges. \u201cI will appoint a real special prosecutor to go after the most corrupt president in the history of the United States of America Joe Biden,\u201d Trump promised cheering supporters nonetheless. \u201cI will totally obliterate the deep state.\u201d The event Tuesday also served as a fundraiser. The Trump campaign told Politico that it expects to raise $2m at Bedminster. Immediately after his arraignment, a blast to supporters advertised \u201cI stand with Trump\u201d T-shirts, free with a $47 donation, \u201cshow the Deep State and the Left that there\u2019s not an attack on the face of this planet that can stop this movement\u201d. A Reuters/Ipsos poll completed on Monday found that the vast majority of Republicans \u2013 81% \u2013 said the federal criminal charges against Trump were politically motivated, and the indictment did not appear to affect Trump\u2019s leading support in the Republican presidential nomination contest. With the Republican base\u2019s loyal support, Trump has also put his 2024 competitors in a difficult position \u2013 they can either choose to prop him up, or risk alienating core voters. \u201cThey\u2019re not coming after me, they\u2019re coming after you,\u201d Trump said in New Jersey. \u201cAnd I just happened to be standing in their way.\u201d Fox News, whose hosts had begun to distance themselves from the former president after a $787.5m settlement in defamation lawsuit over their airing of Trump and his supporters\u2019 and US election lies, went back to breathlessly backing him.

Federal prosecutors accused Trump of wilfully withholding classified documents obtained during his presidency and obstructing justice in his efforts to conceal those materials from authorities, as detailed in a 49-page indictment unsealed on Friday. The former president was charged with 37 federal counts, including 31 violations of the Espionage Act. Trump arrived at the federal courthouse in Miami, Florida, to a chaotic scene, as law enforcement officers closely watched the hundreds of protesters gathered to celebrate or denounce the former president. Trump\u2019s son, Eric Trump, accompanied his father to the courthouse, where they arrived in a motorcade and were quickly escorted inside for the arraignment. Trump made his initial court appearance with his aide and now co-defendant Walt Nauta, who faces six federal charges for his alleged role in the scheme to keep the classified documents concealed from authorities. Throughout the short hearing, Trump appeared frustrated as he sat at the defense table, frowning with his arms crossed. But Nauta looked quite nervous, staring down at the floor and occasionally biting his lip as the hearing unfolded. Trump was released on bond on the condition that he would not discuss the case with a list of witnesses to be provided by the office of special counsel Jack Smith, who sat in the front row of the courtroom during the arraignment. Although Nauta was indicted alongside Trump, the aide was not arraigned on Tuesday, as his lawyer was not admitted to practice in the southern district of Florida. Nauta is now scheduled to be arraigned on 27 June. Trump\u2019s lawyers include Chris Kise, who is admitted to practice in Florida\u2019s southern district. After entering his plea and departing the courthouse, Trump made a brief stop at a Miami restaurant, where supporters happily greeted the twice-arrested former president. Trump then made his way to his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, where he delivered remarks on Tuesday evening to respond to the indictment. Calling the indictment a \u201ca political persecution like something straight out of a fascist or communist nation\u201d he railed against Joe Biden, the Department of Justice, and past presidents who he said exhibited similar behavior. Trump kept his speech relatively brief and appeared to leave directly after the event. Trump\u2019s appearance at the courthouse came five days after news of the indictment first broke, sending shockwaves through Washington and around the country. Trump and his allies have dismissed the charges as a political \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d meant to punish the current frontrunner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, but the indictment filed by Smith\u2019s office paints a damning picture of a former president determined to conceal classified materials from authorities. According to the indictment, Trump intentionally withheld 31 classified documents from federal officials even after a subpoena was issued to recover the materials from the former president\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Some of those documents included information on America\u2019s nuclear programs, the US military\u2019s vulnerabilities and the White House\u2019s plans for retaliation in the event of an attack. The former president appears to have been aware of the illegality of retaining the documents, as recordings obtained by the special counsel show Trump acknowledging he could no longer declassify information after leaving office. The indictment underscored the national security risk of Trump\u2019s alleged actions, as highly sensitive government information was stored in ballrooms and bathrooms at Mar-a-Lago, where guests could have accessed the documents. Trump allegedly conspired with Nauta to conceal the documents from investigators and made false statements to FBI agents investigating the former president\u2019s handling of classified material. Trump\u2019s claims of political persecution cannot erase the compelling evidence compiled by Smith\u2019s team, and they will not ease the former president\u2019s legal troubles in at least three other jurisdictions. Trump\u2019s court appearance marked the second time in two months that he was forced to respond to an indictment, although the documents case included the first set of federal charges filed against the former president. In April, Trump pleaded not guilty to 34 felony charges of falsifying business records in connection to a hush-money scheme during the 2016 presidential election. In addition to those two existing cases, Trump could soon face more charges in Georgia, where investigators are examining his attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, and in Washington, as Smith\u2019s team considers legal consequences for the former president\u2019s role in the 6 January 2021 attack on the US Capitol. Despite Trump\u2019s numerous legal liabilities, his popularity with the Republican base has proven resilient. According to a CBS News/YouGov poll conducted last week, only 7% of likely Republican primary voters believe the indictment may change their opinion of Trump for the worse while 14% say the charges may actually improve their perception of the former president. However, voters\u2019 sentiments may shift as the documents case continues to unfold. It could still be several months before the case goes to trial, although Smith has expressed his wish for a \u201cspeedy trial\u201d. The documents case will be overseen by Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump-appointed judge who was widely criticized last year for temporarily blocking federal investigators from examining the classified materials seized from Mar-a-Lago. Some legal experts have already called on Cannon to recuse herself from the case because of her prior controversial ruling, although she has not yet done so. After the Tuesday arraignment, Trump\u2019s legal team is expected to file a motion to dismiss the case, but that effort will probably fail. Trump will have to act quickly to begin fighting the charges meticulously outlined in Smith\u2019s indictment. If he does not, he could soon be campaigning for president from a prison cell."}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e701b7", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/14/masterchef-australia-behind-the-scenes-visits-can-be-strange-in-this-case-it-was-bittersweet", "primaryCategory": "tv-and-radio", "subCategories": [], "title": "MasterChef Australia: behind-the-scenes visits can be strange.

Not for nothing did the Wizard Of Oz once yell, \u201cPay no attention to that man behind the curtain!\u201d It followed, then, that the offer of a visit to the set of MasterChef Australia back in January felt like an invitation to almost certain disappointment: surely seeing how the sausage is (occasionally, literally) made would bring the magic of MasterChef crumbling down. What if the workroom turned out to be the size of a studio apartment? Is the famed MasterChef pantry just a close shot on a local Coles supermarket? Are the judges really eating all that food? As it turned out, none of the above were true. Yes, the workroom is as grand and imposing as it looks. When I entered the MasterChef pantry, I felt a little like Homer Simpson visiting the Land Of Chocolate, dancing around and thinking about what I\u2019d grab in a hurry. The MasterChef garden is, truly, one of the most glorious things I\u2019ve ever seen. Its denizens (some are now well-established, mature plants) are lovingly tended off-site year-round, then appear at the Royal Melbourne Showgrounds for the shoot, as if by magic. Of all the glimpses behind the curtain, wandering through the barrels and containers where home-runs of previous seasons have been plucked in a hurry (strawberry gum! Warrigal greens!) was the most entrancing. I visited in January during the filming of All Stars Week \u2013 by now well-established in MasterChef lore as a venerable blend of hero worship and psychic agony. It was the episode which aired on Tuesday night, when Luke Nguyen put the bottom three of the week \u2013 Adi Nevgi, Grace Jupp and Theo Loizou \u2013 through a pressure test. The task: recreate his famed ph\u1edf (pause for orchestral sting) without the recipe. The other contestants gasped from the gantry. The legendary ingredient bench groaned under a cornucopia of fresh herbs, cuts of meat and other items the contestants would need to figure out how much of to use. The fragrant aroma of Nguyen\u2019s ph\u1edf filled the space, so rich it felt like you could float around on it, like cartoon characters smelling a freshly baked pie. And yes, the memory of all this is now bittersweet. When I think of Jock Zonfrillo, who died in May, I hear Jimmy Barnes singing The Bonnie Banks of Loch Lomond to eulogise his mate. Watching MasterChef this season has been, for many, a conflicting experience: a joy to see Zonfrillo doing what he loved, alongside his mentee Andy Allen and co-host Melissa Leong, but uncanny nevertheless. Death comes for us all, but it\u2019s strange how the loss of those in the public eye can stir up long-dormant emotions. I have struggled to watch, even as a card-carrying MasterChef Australia nut (recapping the show ranks among the most fun things I have ever done as a writer) \u2013 and keeping the secrets of the set visit until the episode has been a strange experience.

We were only on set for the initial burst of manic energy as the pressure test began (yes, that big clock is just as stressful to see ticking down in person). In the end, Theo and his \u201cspot-on\u201d noodles triumphed. Grace, alas, was undone by Nguyen\u2019s deceptively simple dish. Even though her noodles were praised as \u201csilky\u201d, an ill-fated decision to roast the meat and bones made her ph\u1edf broth \u201cgreasy\u201d. At the episode\u2019s end, she hung up her apron. All television production is stressful; I\u2019m sure there are plenty of days when those in the MasterChef kitchen, both behind and in front of the camera, want to clobber someone or everyone with a leg of mutton. But the overwhelming sense I got was that the warm feeling we get when watching the show at home is not entirely a confection of editing and musical cues. Zonfrillo was full of good grace, humour and warmth. Though he was not immune to a terrible pun, he was also quick to offer solace to contestants overwhelmed by the pressure of the competition. And then there was that infectious, Basil Brush-esque laugh. As the contestants and viewers discovered, the secret ingredient in Nguyen\u2019s Pho Suon Bo is bull\u2019s penis. Addressing the contestants, he fumbled his line, asking them, \u201cHave you ever eaten penis?\u201d The team quickly reset so he could add the essential descriptor (\u201cbull\u2019s penis\u201d he corrected, chuckling), but it was too late. The \u201cooh er, matron\u201d overtones were too much to resist, and Zonfrillo\u2019s laugh rang out around the shed like a klaxon.

Lending to the theater of the absurd outside downtown Miami\u2019s Wilkie D Ferguson courthouse, named for a late, respected early Black judge of the southern judicial district of Florida, was a resident flock of roosters strutting around crowing, a top-hatted elderly gentleman in a red long-tailed coat waving a Trump-DeSantis 2024 flag, and a couple of dozen \u201cBlacks for Trump\u201d protesters insisting that \u201cTrumpsters [sic] are not racist\u201d. But it was the proceedings inside courtroom 13-3 that held the attention. The 45th president of the United States sat silently, sullenly, between his lawyers throughout an arraignment hearing that lasted little more than 45 minutes, folding his arms and clenching his fingers, and occasionally grimacing in his navy blue suit and trademark red tie. It was his lawyer, Todd Blanche, who did the talking for the usually loquacious Trump. \u201c[We] most certainly enter a plea of not guilty,\u201d Blanche said of the 37-count indictment that, thankfully, was not read out loud. And: \u201cWe so demand [a jury trial], yes, your honor.\u201d There followed a robust discussion with magistrate judge Jonathan Goodman over conditions of bond. Trump will not have to surrender his passport, will not be barred from traveling domestically nor internationally, and will not have to put up any dollar amount for bail. Yet he will be banned from talking about any aspect of the case with any \u201cwitness or victim\u201d, which includes a range of characters from his Secret Service agents to his personal valet Waltine Nauda, his co-defendant who sat alongside him looking bewildered. Watching on from the front row of the public gallery was Department of Justice special counsel Jack Smith, Trump\u2019s latest bete noire, who brought this indictment from a Miami grand jury. But Trump had to remain silent here, after launching torrents of disparaging rhetoric against Smith, Joe Biden and the president\u2019s \u201cweaponized\u201d justice department in recent days in television interviews and his Truth Social network. At the conclusion of the hearing, Trump turned and appeared to acknowledge the nine members of the public allowed in to watch, including one supporter in a red Make America Great Again cap, a Trump T-shirt and an eye patch. Then he chatted briefly with his legal team, and made his way to the exit. According to the US Marshals Service, Trump\u2019s short booking process before the hearing was identical to that of any other defendant, although no mugshot was taken today, and no booking image will be released. Marshals indicated that enough photographs of Trump already existed for identification not to be an issue. Nor is he considered a flight risk. Trump\u2019s fingerprints, however, were taken, digitally, \u201cso he won\u2019t be rolling in ink\u201d, a court official said. Also checked were his address, social security number, date of birth and \u201crecent history\u201d. As for the mass protests promised by Trump\u2019s supporters, and feared by Miami\u2019s mayor, Francis Suarez, at a press conference on Monday, the searing south Florida heat appeared to have had its say. Thousands looked to have gathered, and were noisy enough. Yet the 94F temperatures and energy-sapping humidity of late spring in Miami are a world away from the comparatively calm conditions of early January in Washington. Faced with a heavy courthouse presence of Miami police and federal officers in tactical gear and rifles, anyone intent on similar violence to that set upon the US Capitol on 6 January 2021 was unlikely to achieve a similar result. By late morning Tuesday, only pockets of Trump loyalists, some on bicycles with oversized flags, others in Maga caps, and adorned in Stars and Stripes attire, had shown up in the media encampment on the courthouse plaza. By lunchtime, their numbers had swelled, as had those who welcomed the arraignment. One man holding a celebratory cardboard trophy bearing the words \u201cTrump Indictment Tour 2023\u201d was in animated discussion with a couple wrapped in yellow Don\u2019t Tread on Me flags beloved by the Maga faithful. Circling the perimeter, a pickup truck pulled a box trailer painted, with no hint of irony, to resemble a jail cell, with Biden and other Democrats peering from behind bars. \u201cWe are taking America back,\u201d an accompanying message stated. At the hearing\u2019s commencement, Trump\u2019s supporters were four to five deep at the police tape, watched by police on bicycles but making no moves to pass it. By its conclusion many had retreated to the shadows of the tall railway station on the west side of the courthouse building, close to where the Trump motorcade was waiting. The convoy had made the short journey from the Trump resort in Doral, west of downtown, where he spent the night, and accessed the courthouse complex underground. Trump entered the courthouse by a tunnel, escorted by Secret Service agents, and took an escalator to Goodman\u2019s 13th floor courtroom. He left the same way en route to the airport, and his flight back to New Jersey. Back on the plaza, supporters who hadn\u2019t even caught a glimpse of their champion continued to chant for him. \u201cI don\u2019t know if he broke the law, but really, does it matter?\u201d Felix Castillo, a 44-year-old Cuban American from Miami\u2019s Little Havana neighborhood said. \u201cWhatever he did has been exaggerated by Biden, and that\u2019s the real crime here. Biden had documents too, why isn\u2019t he here?\u201d Trump, meanwhile, moves on, free to continue airing his grievances at Bedminster, on Truth Social or wherever, as he focuses on the next hearing in this case, an upcoming trial in New York on charges related to a hush money payment to an adult movie star, and possible future indictments for the 6 January insurrection and election interference in Georgia. In Miami, the circus tent is down, for now at least, and Trump\u2019s traveling show has left town. In the wings, its lead and only performer, is preparing for his next turn."}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e701b9", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/14/liberal-mps-break-ranks-to-call-for-inquiry-into-brittany-higgins-leaked-text-messages", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "subCategories": [], "title": "Liberal MPs break ranks to call for inquiry into Brittany Higgins\u2019 leaked text messages ", "lead": "Andrew Bragg and Bridget Archer make call after Network Ten asks AFP to investigate alleged leaking of evidence in Bruce Lehrmann trial", "author": "Paul Karp Chief political correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-06-14T00:25:34Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.294960", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/cfeab812bebb82fff813b0a54a755442705b02ec/0_1367_2358_1413/500.jpg", "body": "Liberals Andrew Bragg and Bridget Archer have broken ranks to call for an inquiry into how Brittany Higgins\u2019 text messages were leaked, with Bragg labelling debate in the Senate where the Coalition is pursuing Katy Gallagher \u201cvery ugly\u201d. The pair made the call after the finance minister denied misleading the Senate about her knowledge of Higgins\u2019 allegation before it aired and Network Ten asked the Australian federal police to investigate how Higgins\u2019 texts became public. Gallagher told Senate estimates in June 2021 that \u201cno one had any knowledge\u201d of Higgins\u2019 allegation before it was aired. That comment has been called into question by text exchanges between Higgins and her partner, David Sharaz, published by the Australian newspaper.

Despite Gallagher offering a personal explanation to the Senate, the Coalition pursued her in question time on Tuesday about her claim she did \u201cabsolutely nothing\u201d with the information about Higgins\u2019 allegation, provided to her four days before Higgins went public on 15 February 2021.

Earlier, senator Bragg told Radio National: \u201cI think this whole thing has been a tawdry affair and it is hugely regrettable how it\u2019s played out publicly. \u201cI don\u2019t know how these messages have been put into the public domain. I expect that there will be a proper investigation into that. Because I mean, why would anyone come forward with allegations of assault if this is the result?\u201d Asked if he believed police should investigate, Bragg replied: \u201cWell, there needs to be an inquiry to how this has happened. I mean, this can\u2019t happen again. This is supposed to be a country which values the rule of law and proper process.\u201d The Liberal deputy leader, Sussan Ley, responded to the calls by noting \u201cthere\u2019s been a lot of inquiries, there\u2019s been a lot of conjecture\u201d. \u201cThere have been questions asked, we need answers to those questions,\u201d she told reporters in Canberra. \u201cThat\u2019s the number one thing that we need at the moment. \u201cThe prime minister\u2019s office should be conducting the investigations and inquiries they need to reassure the prime minister, that ministers did not mislead the Senate.\u201d Ley said the Gaetjens report into what Scott Morrison\u2019s office knew about Higgins\u2019 complaint had not been completed \u201cbecause the Australian federal police asked for it to be paused while they conducted their investigations\u201d. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, was asked in Labor caucus on Tuesday about the possibility of a further inquiry, after days of the government targeting the Coalition for failing to release the Gaetjens report. Albanese said the government had to be cognisant of the impact an inquiry would have on people, which was interpreted as a warning against re-traumatising the complainant. Albanese said people will make their own judgment about whether it is tenable that no one said anything to Scott Morrison in 2019 or 2020. \u201cWe acted responsibly the whole way through,\u201d he said. Albanese later told the House of Representatives that Peter Dutton, who was informed of the Higgins allegation by the AFP due to protocols for sensitive investigations, had \u201cinformed the prime minister\u2019s office prior to that information becoming public\u201d. The attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, told the House of Representatives that he is \u201cdeeply concerned about the apparent unauthorised publication of material produced as a result of a subpoena in the criminal trial of Mr Bruce Lehrmann\u201d. \u201cMaterial produced to a court in response to a subpoena is subject to an implied undertaking from the parties who receive it that it won\u2019t be used for purposes other than for those court proceedings. \u201cIt\u2019s a rule known as the Harman rule or the Harman undertaking. To breach it may constitute a contempt of court. \u201cI do understand that the Australian federal police has received a complaint in respect of this matter and that the AFP is currently assessing that complaint.\u201d Lehrmann was charged with the alleged sexual assault of Higgins but vehemently denied the allegations and maintained his innocence. An initial trial was aborted last year due to jury misconduct and prosecutors dropped the charges against Lehrmann amid concerns about the impact a second trial could have on Higgins\u2019 mental health."}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e701ba", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/13/california-killer-whales-monterey-bay-play", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "subCategories": [], "title": "Whale of a time: pod of 30 orcas bring killer moves to a California bay", "lead": "Marine biologists were surprised at the display of playful behavior \u2018like kids in the park\u2019, which lasted more than eight hours", "author": "Rose Horowitch", "datePublished": "2023-06-14T00:16:34Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.294965", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/2564fb57e6f9323f248ce08376a6c3ef7d3ab88a/60_0_1800_1080/500.jpg", "body": "A crowd of 30 killer whales met for a party in California\u2019s Monterey Bay on Sunday. They did belly flops into the water, slapped the waves with their flukes and spewed water from their blowholes, surprising marine biologists who had never seen the animals engage in such playful behavior for so long. Nancy Black, who has been studying killer whales for more than 30 years, said Sunday\u2019s show was the best orca sighting she\u2019d ever seen. Black, a marine biologist with Monterey Bay Whale Watch and the director of the California Killer Whale Project, said the gathering was unique because the animals played in the bay for more than eight hours. Eleven family groups came together, or about 30 whales. Sometimes three or four whales would breach the water at once. Others slapped their tails against the water\u2019s surface, wrestled with one another and swam in loops. \u201cJust like kids that are in a park, they get excited and play with the other kids and may be more active,\u201d Black said. \u201cThe little ones were wrestling and rolling like a bunch of puppies.\u201d Little is a relative term. Orca calves can weigh up to 400lbs (180kg) at birth. Killer whales have a \u201cmatriarchal society\u201d, Black said, and travel in groups led by a mother or grandmother. They rely on each other to hunt, share responsibilities for rearing calves and divide the burden of teaching their children. They generally travel with one family group, which can include between three and seven orcas. That\u2019s what made Sunday\u2019s sighting so unusual. Although researchers know that orcas can communicate with underwater vocalizations, the sounds likely only travel about 10 miles (15km), Black said. With their territory ranging from California to Canada, Black said she doesn\u2019t know how the creatures all decided to \u201chang out together\u201d in Monterey Bay. Packs of orcas usually travel to the bay in April and May to hunt gray whale calves. There, they \u201cbinge eat\u201d on the calves, who are much larger than their usual prey of seals and sea lions, Black said. Sunday\u2019s \u201cplayful celebration\u201d likely came about because the animals were well-fed. The nonprofit California Killer Whale Project has spent three decades cataloging the killer whales that visit Monterey Bay. Black said that she was able to recognize many of the whales in the bay on Sunday by the markings and notches in their tails. Among them was Emma, a whale who gained notoriety among researchers for her skill at hunting gray whale calves. Emma\u2019s family once killed a baby gray whale in 15 min, a process that usually takes two hours, Black said. Emma brought her daughter, Louise, on Sunday. Emma has previously been spotted traveling with her mother, Xena, who was not at Sunday\u2019s gathering. They once caught nine gray whale calves in a month. \u201cWe were amazed, like how much can they eat?\u201d Black said."}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e701bb", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/14/marriages-in-china-drop-to-record-low-despite-government-push", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": [], "title": "Marriages in China drop to record low despite government push", "lead": "Number of couples tying knot fell 800,000 in 2022 amid birthrate \u2018crisis\u2019", "author": "Amy Hawkins Senior China correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-06-14T00:00:13Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.294969", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/537751ac1354f5719020952543150854f1944ec0/543_553_4353_2612/500.jpg", "body": "The number of marriages in China last year dropped to 6.83 million, the lowest since records began in 1986. Data released by the Ministry of Civil Affairs showed the number of couples tying the knot in 2022 fell by about 800,000 compared with 2021, beating that year\u2019s record low. China\u2019s marriage rate has declined rapidly over the past 10 years, since peaking in 2013 when nearly 13.5 million couples wed, nearly double last year\u2019s count. Policymakers in China are increasingly worried about the stubborn downward trend in marriage \u2013 and birth \u2013 rates. Last year, China\u2019s population shrank for the first time in six decades, leading to warnings that the country would get old before it got rich. On Tuesday, James Liang, an influential economist who is also the founder of Trip.com, one of the world\u2019s largest travel service platforms, published an article about China\u2019s low birthrate \u201ccrisis\u201d. Liang called for China\u2019s school system to be shortened by two years, which, among other economic benefits, he argued would give women a \u201cfew extra years to start a family and have children\u201d. Liang argued this could boost China\u2019s fertility rate by as much as 30%. Under the rule of Xi Jinping, who took power in 2012, the government has pushed an increasingly conservative social agenda that encourages women to marry young to rear more children. But between 2010 and 2020, the average age for women to get married for the first time increased from 24 to nearly 29. In 2016, China abandoned its decades-old one child policy, and is now encouraging women to have up to three babies. Local governments have introduced a range of policies to encourage people to have more children, such as free IVF and subsidies for second and third children. The government sees strong \u2013 and plentiful \u2013 marriages as the bedrock for boosting the fertility rate. Some provinces now offer paid marriage leave of up to 30 days for newlyweds. However, highly educated young women often \u201ccritique marriage as a patriarchal institution that oppresses women\u201d, said Yun Zhou, a sociologist at the University of Michigan. The incentives have failed to convince a generation of young people who are facing record youth unemployment and challenging economic headwinds. Thanks to China\u2019s ageing population, there are also fewer people of marriageable age at which to have children each year. The data also showed that the number of divorces dropped to 2.1 million in 2022, a slight decrease on the previous year. China\u2019s divorce rate has been declining from its peak in 2019. That partly reflects the fact that there are fewer marriages. In 2021, the government also introduced a controversial law forcing couples to observe a 30-day \u201ccooling-off period\u201d before splitting, which seemed to have the desired effect in sharply cutting the divorce rate. But the restrictions on divorce may also be putting people off marriage. Responding to the news about last year\u2019s marriage rate on Weibo, a Chinese social media platform, one user wrote that by implementing \u201cartificial obstacles\u201d to divorce, \u201cyoung people increasingly don\u2019t dare to get married\u201d."}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e701bc", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jun/13/artificial-intelligence-us-regulation", "primaryCategory": "technology", "subCategories": [], "title": "The EU is leading the way on AI laws.

As lawmakers on the Senate judiciary subcommittee asked the 38-year-old tech mogul about the nature of his business, Altman argued that the AI industry could be dangerous and that the government needs to step in. \u201cI think if this technology goes wrong, it can go quite wrong,\u201d Altman said. \u201cWe want to be vocal about that.\u201d How governments should regulate artificial intelligence is a topic of increasing urgency in countries around the world, as advancements reach the general public and threaten to upend entire industries. The European Union has been working on regulation around the issue for a while. But in the US, the regulatory process is just getting started. American lawmakers\u2019 initial moves, several digital rights experts said, did not inspire much confidence. Many of the senators appeared to accept the AI industry\u2019s ambitious predictions as fact and trust its leaders to act in good faith. \u201cThis is your chance, folks, to tell us how to get this right,\u201d Senator John Kennedy said. \u201cTalk in plain English and tell us what rules to implement.\u201d And much of the discussion about artificial intelligence has revolved around futuristic concerns about the technology becoming sentient and turning against humanity, rather than the impact AI is already having: increasing surveillance, intensifying discrimination, weakening labor rights and creating mass misinformation. If lawmakers and government agencies repeat the same mistakes they did while attempting to regulate social media platforms, experts warn, the AI industry will become similarly entrenched in society with potentially even more disastrous consequences. \u201cThe companies that are leading the charge in the rapid development of [AI] systems are the same tech companies that have been called before Congress for antitrust violations, for violations of existing law or informational harms over the past decade,\u201d said Sarah Myers West, the managing director of the AI Now Institute, a research organization studying the societal impacts of the technology. \u201cThey\u2019re essentially being given a path to experiment in the wild with systems that we already know are capable of causing widespread harm to the public.\u201d AI fervor and attempts to regulate it In response to mass public excitement about various AI tools including ChatGPT and DALL-E, tech companies have rapidly ramped up the development or, at least, plans to develop AI tools to incorporate into their products. AI is the buzzword of the quarter, with industry executives hoping investors take notice of the mentions of AI they\u2019ve weaved throughout their most recent quarterly earnings reports. The players who have long worked in AI-adjacent spaces are reaping the benefits of the boom: chipmaker Nvidia, for instance, is now a trillion-dollar company. The White House and the federal government have announced various measures to address the fervor, hoping to make the most of it while avoiding the free-for-all that led to the last decade of social media reckoning. It has issued executive orders asking agencies to implement artificial intelligence in their systems \u201cin a manner that advances equity\u201d, invested $140m into AI research institutes, released a blueprint for an AI bill of rights, and is seeking public comment about how best to regulate the ways in which AI is used. Federal efforts to address AI have so far largely resulted in additional funding to develop \u201cethical\u201d AI, according to Ben Winters, a senior counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a privacy research nonprofit. The only \u201cregulation-adjacent\u201d guidelines have come through executive orders which Winters says \u201caren\u2019t even really meaningful\u201d. \u201cWe don\u2019t even have a clear picture that any of the \u2018regulation\u2019 of AI is going to be actual regulation rather than just support [of the technology],\u201d he said. In Congress, lawmakers appear at times to be just learning what it is they\u2019re hoping to regulate. In a letter sent on 6 June, Senator Chuck Schumer and several other lawmakers invited their colleagues to three meetings to discuss the \u201cextraordinary potential, and risks, AI presents\u201d. The first session focuses on the question \u201cWhat is AI?\u201d Another is on how to maintain American leadership in AI. The final, classified session will discuss how US national security agencies and the US\u2019s \u201cadversaries\u201d use the technology. The lack of leadership on the issue in Washington is leaving the sector room to govern itself. Altman suggests creating licensing and testing requirements for the development and release of AI tools, establishing safety standards, and bringing in independent auditors to assess the models before they are released. He and many of his contemporaries also envision an international regulator akin to the International Atomic Agency to help impose and coordinate these standards at a global scale. Those suggestions for regulation, which senators applauded him for during the hearing, would amount to little more than self-regulation, said West of the AI Now Institute. The system as Altman proposes it, she said, would allow players who check off certain boxes and are deemed \u201cresponsible\u201d to \u201cmove forward without any further levels of scrutiny or accountability\u201d. It\u2019s self-serving, she argued, and deflects from \u201cthe enforcement of the laws that we already have and the upgrading of those laws to reach even basic levels of accountability\u201d. OpenAI did not respond to a request for comment by the time of publication. Altman\u2019s and other AI leaders\u2019 proposals also focus on reining in \u201chypothetical, future\u201d systems that are able to take on certain human capabilities, according to West. Under that scheme, the regulations would not apply to AI systems as they\u2019re being rolled out today, she said. And yet the harms AI tools can cause are already being felt. Algorithms power the social feeds that have been found to funnel misinformation to wide swaths of people; it\u2019s been used to power systems that have perpetuated discrimination in housing and mortgage lending. In policing, AI-enabled surveillance technology has been found to disproportionately target and in some cases misidentify Black and brown people. AI is also increasingly used to automate error-prone weaponry such as drones. Generative AI is only expected to intensify those risks. Already ChatGPT and other large language models like Google\u2019s Bard have given responses rife with misinformation and plagiarism, threatening to dilute the quality of online information and spread factual inaccuracies. In one incident last week, a New York lawyer cited six cases in a legal brief which all turned out to be nonexistent fabrications that ChatGPT created. \u201cThe propensity for large language models to just add in totally incorrect things \u2013 some less-charitable people have just called them bullshit engines \u2013 that\u2019s a real slow-burner danger,\u201d said Daniel Leufer, senior policy analyst at the digital rights organization Access Now. During the congressional hearing, Senator Richard Blumenthal mentioned his deep concern about generative AI\u2019s impact on labor \u2013 a concern that West, of the AI Now Institute, said is already being realized: \u201cIf you look to the WGA strikes, you see the use of AI as a justification to devalue labor, to pay people less and to pay fewer people. The content moderators who are involved in training ChatGPT also recently unionized because they want to improve their labor conditions as well as their pay.\u201d The current focus on a hypothetical doomsday scenario where the servant class, composed of AI-powered bots, will become sentient enough to take over, is an expression of current inequalities, some experts have argued. A group of 16 women and non-binary tech experts, including Timnit Gebru, the former co-lead of Google\u2019s ethical AI team, released an open letter last month criticizing how the AI industry and its public relations departments have defined what risks their technology poses while ignoring the marginalized communities that are most affected. \u201cWe reject the premise that only wealthy white men get to decide what constitutes an existential threat to society,\u201d the letter said. The limits of self-regulation The budding relationship between lawmakers and the AI industry echoes the way big tech companies like Meta and Twitter have previously worked with federal and local US governments to craft regulation, a dynamic that rights groups said waters down legislation to the benefit of these companies. In 2020, Washington state, for example, passed the country\u2019s first bill regulating facial recognition \u2013 but it was written by a state senator who was also a Microsoft employee and drew criticism from civil rights groups for lacking key protections. \u201cThey end up with rules that give them a lot of room to basically create self-regulation mechanisms that don\u2019t hamper their business interests,\u201d said Mehtab Khan, an associate research scholar at the Yale Information Society Project. Conversations in the European Union about AI are far more advanced. The EU is in the midst of negotiating the AI Act, proposed legislation that would seek to limit some uses of the technology and would be the first law on AI by a major regulator. While many civil society groups point to some weaknesses of the draft legislation, including a limited approach to banning biometric data collection, they agree it\u2019s a much more cohesive starting point than what is being currently discussed in the US. Included in the draft legislation are prohibitions on \u201chigh-risk\u201d AI applications like predictive policing and facial recognition, a development advocates attribute to the years-long conversations leading up to the proposal. \u201cWe were quite lucky that we put a lot of these things on the agenda before this AI hype and generative AI, ChatGPT boom happened,\u201d said Sarah Chander, a senior policy adviser at the international advocacy organization European Digital Rights. The European parliament is expected to vote on the proposal on 14 June. Although the center-right European People\u2019s party has pushed back aggressively against the total bans of tools like facial recognition, Chander feels optimistic about prohibitions on predictive policing, emotion recognition and biometric categorization. The battle over the final details will continue for the better part of the next year \u2013 after the parliamentary vote, EU member governments will become involved in the negotiations. But even in the EU, the recent generative AI hype cycle and the concerns about a dystopian future have been drawing lawmakers\u2019 attention away from the harms affecting people today, Chander said. \u201cI think ChatGPT muddies the water very much in terms of the types of harms we\u2019re actually talking about here. What are the most present harms and for whom do we care about?\u201d Despite that lack of wide-reaching regulations in the AI Act, the proposals were far-reaching enough to make Altman tell reporters that the company would cease operating if it couldn\u2019t comply with the regulations. Altman slightly walked that statement back the next day, tweeting that OpenAI had no plans to leave, but his opposition to the AI Act signaled to rights advocates his eagerness to push back against any laws that would constrain business. \u201cHe only asks for the regulation that he likes, and not for the regulation that is good for society,\u201d said Matthias Spielkamp, the executive director of Algorithm Watch, a European digital rights group. Amid the lack of urgency from US lawmakers and the administration, digital rights experts are looking at existing law and efforts at the state level to put guardrails on AI. New York, for example, will require companies to conduct annual audits for bias in their automated hiring systems, as well as notify candidates when these systems are being used and give applicants the option to request the data collected on them. There are also several existing laws that may prove useful, researchers said. The Federal Trade Commission\u2019s algorithmic disgorgement enforcement tool, for instance, allows the agency to order companies to destroy datasets or algorithms they\u2019ve built that are found to have been created using illicitly acquired data. The FTC also has regulations around deception that allow the agency to police overstated marketing claims about what a system is capable of. Antitrust laws, too, may be an effective intervention if the firms building and controlling the training of these large language models begin to engage in anticompetitive behavior. Privacy legislation on the state level could serve to provide reasonable protections against companies scraping the internet for data to train AI systems, said Winters. \u201cI can\u2019t in good conscience predict that the federal legislature is going to come up with something good in the near future.\u201d"}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e701bd", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/jun/14/nobel-laureate-says-research-by-oxford-institute-can-be-used-against-reporters", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": [], "title": "Nobel laureate Maria Ressa says research by Oxford institute can be used against reporters", "lead": "Exclusive: methodology used by Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism risks undermining media in global south, says Ressa", "author": "Emma Graham-Harrison", "datePublished": "2023-06-13T23:01:11Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.294978", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/b01f76710ef5fec10544214b9d1838cb3e103224/0_323_6753_4053/500.jpg", "body": "Nobel peace laureate Maria Ressa has claimed Oxford University\u2019s leading journalism institute is publishing flawed research that puts journalists and independent outlets at risk, particularly in the global south. One of the world\u2019s most prominent and respected journalists, Ressa said she resigned last year from the advisory board of the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism (RISJ), because of deep concerns about how it compiles an annual Digital News Report. Its findings include rating Rappler \u2013 the outlet Ressa co-founded, and whose work was cited in her Nobel prize nomination \u2013 the least trusted media outlet on a list of those surveyed in the Philippines. She had kept the decision to resign private but has gone public with her concerns this year after nothing was done to address them. Ressa said the report, funded in part by Google, fails to take into account the impact of disinformation campaigns, particularly in countries where governments use their powers to attack free media. Nor does it reflect bias in tech platforms that have huge control over news distribution or the impact of disinformation campaigns. \u201cLast year I resigned from the board because I thought it was horrendous that they went ahead with it and that it was weaponised and used against us, at a critical time. Government officials were quoting Oxford University\u2019s Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism to attack us,\u201d she told the Guardian. \u201cI still have decades of jail hanging over me. So to actually do this again, despite repeated warnings, is just unfathomable to me.\u201d The Reuters Digital News Report has been running for over a decade. It aims to give an overview of digital news consumption, based on a YouGov survey of over 90,000 online news consumers in 46 countries, over half in Europe, with India, Indonesia, Nigeria and Brazil among major markets in the global south that are now covered. Rasmus Kleis Nielsen, the director of the RISJ, said: \u201cWe deplore the abuse against Maria Ressa and the way that our research has been misrepresented. We have publicly pushed back against it and will continue to do so. \u201cWe believe the methodology in our report \u2013 which covers nearly 50 countries \u2013 is robust. For example, it helps us document that people who rely on social media for news are more likely to be concerned about coming across fake news online.\u201d There are caveats in the report, which in its text discusses threats to media including Rappler. It noted that \u201csome independent outlets respected for their reporting on those in positions of power are often actively distrusted by supporters of the politicians in question [\u2026] so scores should not be seen as a measure of the quality or trustworthiness of the content\u201d. Ressa said those nuances are discarded by Rappler critics who exploit the findings to attack the outlet as untrustworthy. \u201cIn the Philippines this survey is degrading what journalism is. The news organisations that try to stand up, to hold public discourse together, are punished under this methodology,\u201d she said. Her concerns are not just about the Philippines. The approach and methodology that make the report so dangerous to journalists in her country, also provide weapons to any government that wants to attack and undermine free media, Ressa said. \u201cWe are not alone. This \u2018study\u2019 is like giving a loaded gun to autocratic governments trying to silence independent journalists not just in the Philippines but in countries like Brazil and India, where information operations and the lawfare are used to persecute, harass, and chill.\u201d \u201cIt admits that social media has taken over distribution, but it is not critical of biases that are implicit in social media and how this has turned the world upside down,\u201d she said Emily Bell, director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia, which studies the impact of social media on journalism, said the report offered only a partial perspective on the contemporary media industry. \u201c[This report] is interpreted as being a comprehensive view of everything going on in journalism but, if you only take an audience view of the threats to journalism, specifically in markets where you do not have strong protections for a free press, you are at high risk of ending up with a distorted picture,\u201d she said. \u201cThis began as an Anglo-centric, Eurocentric report. They have been able to expand it to include more countries but you do have to question if it can be presented as something comprehensive. I would argue that journalism research should be advocating more strongly for journalism.\u201d \u201cYou also have to look at the funding for the research,\u201d she added. Bell is also a director of Guardian News and Media, the Guardian\u2019s parent company. Oxford University\u2019s own figures show Google was the largest single sponsor of the Digital News report and related Digital News project, providing \u00a34.77m to fund research for the three years to 2023. From 2015 to 2020, Google provided \u00a38.47m to fund the report and project, along with over a dozen other sponsors. Ressa called for academics studying journalism to ensure their research was not used to attack it. \u201cIn the Philippines we can win our battle for facts, for democracy \u2013 but not if our perceived allies, the people who are supposed to be helping journalism survive, are killing us.\u201d RISJ\u2019s Nielsen said the institute had included Ressa\u2019s input in a review of methodology. It also said: \u201cWe have taken further steps this year to mitigate against the risk of abuse while also continuing to operate in line with the University of Oxford\u2019s code on academic integrity in research, which explicitly prohibits the omission of inconvenient data from analysis and publication. Like all work in the public domain, our research can be abused.\u201d"}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e701be", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/jun/14/most-australians-recognise-abc-and-sbs-as-important-to-society", "primaryCategory": "media", "subCategories": [], "title": "Leftwing audiences value ABC and SBS much more than rightwing viewers do, survey finds", "lead": "Digital news report also finds that TikTok users value celebrities and ordinary people over journalists as news sources", "author": "Amanda Meade", "datePublished": "2023-06-13T23:00:12Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.294983", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/3a74b39b40144ce8dfe9cc123b239c9e24605093/0_0_5377_3227/500.jpg", "body": "Leftwing audiences value publicly funded news organisations such as the ABC and SBS much more than rightwing audiences do, according to the latest digital news report. The value of news from a public broadcaster varies greatly according to the political persuasion of the audience, with the left much more likely deem it to be important personally and socially (74%; 80%) than the centre (50%; 58%) and the right-wing (43%; 51%). The Digital News Report Australia 2023, written by researchers at the University of Canberra\u2019s News and Media Research Centre, is part of an international survey by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism. Almost two-thirds of Australians believe publicly funded media is \u201cvery\u201d or \u201cquite\u201d important to society, the report released on Wednesday found. Of those with high levels of education, 72% say public service news media is valuable to society, as do 69% of people with a high income. However, among those respondents with low levels of education, only 47% think public media is important to society or to themselves. The use of social media platforms to access news continues to rise, with TikTok news users saying they pay most attention to ordinary people or celebrities as news sources. Conversely, those who use Twitter, Facebook and YouTube for news are more focused on mainstream journalists and news organisations as sources of news. Among online news brands, the Conversation (65%), Crikey.com (62%) and Guardian Australia (60%) continue to have larger proportions of left-leaning audiences, and Skynews.com.au (41%) has the largest proportion of right. The release of the report was overshadowed by claims by Nobel peace laureate Maria Ressa that the institute is publishing flawed research that puts journalists and independent outlets at risk, particularly in the global south. One of the world\u2019s most prominent and respected journalists, Ressa said she resigned last year from the advisory board of the Reuters Institute because of concerns about how it compiles the report. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The Australian findings on the importance of public media reflect the ABC\u2019s own figures, which say that more than 80% of Australians trust the ABC, compared with average trust of 57% for commercial media. Researchers said the findings reflect Australians\u2019 \u201cappreciation for the commercial and political independence of the national broadcasters\u201d. The survey found Australians who consume a lot of news or are very interested in the news are more likely to value the role of the ABC and SBS: 73% compared with 49% of people with a low interest in news. Respondents\u2019 source of news determines how important they think public media is, with people who mainly get their news from social media the least likely to consider it to be important to them personally (41%) compared with people who access online news sources (69%). Researchers said although the ABC is \u201ca traditional political football\u201d it has community support and we value our public news institutions more highly than audiences in other countries with strong publicly funded media such as the UK and Canada. People who say they are concerned about misinformation are much more likely to consider public service media to be important to society compared with those who are not concerned, the online survey conducted in early 2023 found. Matthew Ricketson, a journalism professor at Deakin University, said media scholars who say public service news is \u201cfusty, old-fashioned and destined to fade at the dawn of the digital media age\u201d have been proven wrong. \u201cInstead, the reverse has occurred as many public broadcasters proved themselves unexpectedly nimble in adapting to the possibilities created by new communication technologies,\u201d Ricketson said in a contributing chapter in the report. \u201cDuring the same period, their commercial broadcast rivals have gradually lost audiences to online media and, especially, streaming services while the nation\u2019s big newspaper companies have struggled to find a new business model to offset the loss in advertising revenue to standalone classified sites.\u201d Ricketson said the rise of social media and disinformation has weakened many people\u2019s perception of the trustworthiness of the news media. \u201cAt a time when one of the world\u2019s most powerful media companies, News Corp, has shown itself to have cared less about truth than knowingly continuing to broadcast lies to retain their audience, public service media remains of critical importance,\u201d he said. The ABC and SBS were allocated a total of of $7.7bn over five years in the budget.

Two of the victims were university students and were named locally as Barnaby Webber, a cricketer from Taunton, and his friend Grace Kumar. A 31-year-old man is in custody and police are not currently looking for any further suspects. Chief constable Kate Meynell said officers believe the suspect stole the man\u2019s van and used it to drive into members of the public on Milton Street. Grace Kumar has been named locally as the second victim of the attacks as she walked back to her University of Nottingham accommodation with her friend Barnaby Webber, a cricketer from Taunton, who was also killed. The tennis player Andy Murray said he did not know whether play would go ahead at the Nottingham Open after the \u201cheartbreaking\u201d incident in the city centre overnight. He said: \u201cIt was obviously shocking when I woke up this morning and when I was going down to breakfast a few messages on our team chat came up. We are staying in the city centre and had been out for dinner last night and walking around those areas. You never expect something like that to happen, it was really shocking. Here is a selection of Wednesday\u2019s front pages. Members of the House of Lords expressed their horror at the events in Nottingham and sent their condolences to the victims\u2019 loved ones. Lord Coaker, Labour\u2019s home affairs spokesman, said: \u201cAs a Nottinghamshire resident, a former Nottinghamshire Member of Parliament with an obvious close attachment to the city, can I say how shocked, appalled and saddened I am at the awful events in Nottingham today, as we all will be? \u201cI am sure the whole House will want to join with me in thanking the emergency services and sending our condolences to the families and friends of the victims, indeed the whole community.\u201d Lord Coaker was the MP for Gedling, an area on the outskirts of Nottingham, for 18 years. Home Office minister Lord Sharpe of Epsom said: \u201cCan I also join in Lord Coaker\u2019s remarks about the situation in Nottingham, thank the emergency services, as he did, and obviously express our sympathies and my sympathies to the victims and their families?\u201d Former England cricket captain Michael Vaughan has paid tribute to Barnaby Webber. Petra Gyuricska was getting a lift to work early on Tuesday when she suddenly ordered her husband, , to stop the car \u2013 there was a man lying motionless outside Magdala tennis club. It is not the sort of thing you see very often at 5.30am in Mapperley Park, one of Nottingham\u2019s leafiest suburbs, write Helen Pidd, Jessica Murray and Jamie Grierson. \u201cI thought maybe someone was drunk,\u201d said the 39-year-old, \u201cand then we saw the blood.\u201d Another passer-by called 999 and two police cars were quickly on the scene on Magdala Road, followed by an ambulance. \u201cThey started doing CPR but you could just see \u2026\u201d Her voice dropped as she recalled the awful scene. They had arrived too late. The man, in his 50s, was already dead, having bled out on to the pavement. It was impossible to tell how long he had been there, or whether he had waited in vain for someone to help him in time. \u201cThere was blood running all down the road,\u201d said Toldi. \u201cHe had been stabbed.\u201d Gyuricska was due at work at 6am at the Ibis hotel, so gave her details to police and went on her way. She cracked on with serving 70 breakfasts, learning later that the horror she witnessed was not the aftermath of one single, terrible incident but one of three shocking attacks to take place across Nottingham before most of the city had woken up. In a statement, Bishops Hull Cricket Club, in Taunton, Somerset, described Barnaby Webber \u2013 who has been named locally as one of the victims \u2013 as \u201cour dear friend and team mate\u201d, adding that his \u201cmemory will live on\u201d. Webber, a student at the University of Nottingham, was one of three people killed in the Nottingham attacks this morning. The statement said: \u201cToday we learnt of the death of our dear friend and team mate, Barnaby Webber. \u201cBarney was attacked at the early hours of this morning walking home with a friend after a night out on 13/06/2023 and had lost his life. \u201c\u2018Webbs joined the club back in 2021 and has since then been a key part of our club and made such an impact in such a short space of time. \u201cPlaying more than 30 games for the club, scoring 622 runs, and taking 29 wickets, his memory will live on. \u201cAs a club we would like to invite family, friends, club members and members of the village and public who wish to pay their respects and lay some flowers at the club. TA1 5EB.\u201d Nottingham is \u201ccompletely devastated\u201d by the attacks but has \u201ccome together\u201d in the wake of the tragedy, the Labour MP for Nottingham East Nadia Whittome said. Whittome told the PA news agency: \u201cOur whole city is shaken and completely devastated by this. \u201cNothing like this has happened in Nottingham in my lifetime. \u201cBut I know that the city already has come together. We\u2019ve all just come back from the vigil which was particularly attended by a lot of young people who are paying respects to their classmates and their families who have been killed today and I know that that will continue over the coming days and weeks.\u201d The MP also encouraged people affected to access support available through the University (of Nottingham) wellbeing services and Nottingham Victim Care. The University of Nottingham\u2019s vice-chancellor, Shearer West, has just released this statement. West said: \u201cAll of us at Nottingham are deeply shocked and saddened by the deaths of two of our students following a major incident in Nottingham city centre. \u201cI know our entire University community will join me in offering our deepest condolences to their family and close friends, as well as the other victims of the incident. Our thoughts are very much with them all at this incredibly difficult time. \u201cThe university is supporting the students\u2019 family and friends, as well as staff and students. Our security team is working closely with Nottinghamshire Police and the authorities to support the ongoing investigation into the incident. \u201cSupport is available through our support and wellbeing services for any of our community who may need it.\u201d Bosses at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust said the three deaths had \u201cshocked everyone who lives or works\u201d in Nottingham. In a joint statement, chief executive Anthony May and chairman Nick Carver offered \u201cour thanks and admiration\u201d to emergency service staff \u201cfor their swift response and professionalism at such a difficult time\u201d. Universities UK, which represents 140 institutions across the country, said it is \u201cshocked and appalled\u201d by what has happened in Nottingham and that support teams will be available for students at all universities, the BBC reported. \u201cThe thoughts of the university community are with those impacted,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cWe understand this is an upsetting time for all students, and remind them that every university will have student support teams standing by to speak to anyone who feels affected by the news.\u201d After the University of Nottingham confirmed two of the victims of the attack in the early hours of Tuesday were students, concern rippled through the academic community. At the Student Union bar Mooch, students were in shock as they struggled to comprehend what had happened. \u201cIt\u2019s really scary, it\u2019s a really busy part of the city,\u201d one student, who asked not to be named, told the Guardian. \u201cI had a friend who was walking home at roughly the same time \u2013 it could have been her.\u201d The students said there had been a number of events in the city on Monday night, including a party at a club called Pryzm, from which the victims could have been returning. Student Union officers announced that the Grad Ball planned for Tuesday evening had been cancelled. One student, who contacted the Guardian anonymously, said: \u201cOur leavers\u2019 Grad ball was due to happen tonight and has just been cancelled. Many other fellow students previously keen to enjoy their final week or so in this lovely city are now scared to leave their houses.\u201d One of the University of Nottingham students killed has been named locally as Barnaby Webber, the PA news agency reported. Here is the footage of Nottinghamshire police chief constable Kate Meynell\u2019s update on its investigation. A vigil at Nottingham\u2019s St Peter\u2019s Church, in the city centre, was attended by hundreds of people paying their respects to those who died and those injured. During the service, attended by mainly young people of university age, those present were invited to place flowers below the altar or light a candle. The Bishop of Southwell and Nottingham, the Rt Revd Paul Williams, said the impromptu service was an opportunity to \u201cpray for those whose lives have so cruelly taken away\u201d. The bishop also said the city was \u201cin collective shock and disbelief.\u201d Those attending the vigil included students from the University of Nottingham and Nottingham Trent University. Speaking outside the church, a second-year student at the University of Nottingham said: \u201cWe live fairly close to where, unfortunately, they were found, so it has properly shook up a lot of people. \u201cIt\u2019s really scary. It\u2019s so horrible that this has happened.\u201d Nottinghamshire police chief constable Kate Meynell added that the families of the Nottingham attack victims have been informed. She said: \u201cWe are keeping an open mind and are working closely with counter-terrorism policing to establish the facts as we would normally do in this type of circumstance. \u201cThe families of all the victims have been informed and are being supported by specially-trained officers. \u201cOfficers have also carried out a number of searches of addresses across the city to gather evidence, but no further arrests have been made. \u201cA team of dedicated detectives are investigating the circumstances surrounding the incident and will continue to gather evidence over the coming days. \u201cI want to thank those who live and work in our city for their patience and understanding in incredibly difficult circumstances. We will, of course, keep the public updated as soon as we are able to say anything further.\u201d Suella Braverman also told broadcasters: \u201cFirst of all, I want to say how shocked and saddened I am that three people have lost their lives earlier today in Nottingham and that further individuals have been injured in this tragic incident. \u201cMy thoughts first and foremost are with all of those who have been involved, their friends, their families and their communities. \u201cI want to thank the emergency services for their rapid response. They\u2019re working around the clock to keep people safe and we\u2019re incredibly grateful for their efforts.\u201d The home secretary added: \u201cI\u2019m in regular contact with the chief constable of Nottinghamshire police, but I want to take this opportunity to urge anybody who has any information about this incident to come forward and report it to the police.\u201d The home secretary Suella Braverman said \u201cwe\u2019re in a very early stage of the investigation\u201d when asked whether the deadly Nottingham attack could have been terror-related. She told broadcasters in Westminster: \u201cWe need to allow the police the time and the space to carry out all of their operational activity to determine the motive. \u201cIt\u2019s right that Nottinghamshire police are working with Counter Terrorism Policing. But it\u2019s also fair to say that everybody and all professionals on the front line are keeping an open mind as to what the precise motive might have been.\u201d At a press conference outside Nottinghamshire police central police station, chief constable Kate Meynell says: This is a very sad day for our city and we will do everything possible to get justice for the victims and their families. She says two people aged 19 were found stabbed and unresponsive on Ilkeston Road and a man in his 50s was found with knife wounds on Magdala Road. Police believe his van was stolen and then used to drive at pedestrians. Meynell adds that several searches at addresses across the city have been carried out to gather evidence. Reporters are now being told the press conference will start in five minutes. Police will read a statement and take no questions. Police are due to hold a press conference soon to update the public on their investigation into this morning\u2019s killings. You\u2019ll be able to follow that live here. A vigil is planned early this evening, the city council\u2019s leader, David Mellen, has said. He told BBC Radio Nottingham: I believe there\u2019s going to be a vigil outside St Peter\u2019s Church in the square organised by the diocese at 5pm for people to come together to just take in the enormity of what has happened to stand together. Nottingham is a city where people get on well together, where people live in harmony, people work together. To have this shocking incident break into the harmony is truly awful and whatever the motives we would want to stand against them. Two of the three people killed were students at the University of Nottingham, the institution says. It is with great sadness that we confirm the sudden and unexpected death of two of our students following a major incident in Nottingham city centre overnight. We are shocked and devastated by the news and our thoughts are with those affected, their families and friends. We know this is likely to cause distress for staff and students in our community. France \u201cshares the grief\u201d with the UK after the deaths of three people this morning, the nation\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron, has said. Our thoughts go to the victims of the tragic events in Nottingham, the injured, the families. We share the grief of our British friends and stand by their side. Macron\u2019s statement of support comes after the UK\u2019s prime minister, Rishi Sunak, offered \u201cany assistance\u201d the country could provide after the stabbing of four young children in an \u201cunfathomable attack\u201d in a lakeside park in the French Alps. The University of Nottingham students\u2019 union has confirmed it has cancelled Tuesday\u2019s graduation ball following the attacks in the early hours. The organisation said it was \u201cdevastated and shocked\u201d by the attacks that have left three people dead and three in hospital. We stand in solidarity with all our students and the wider city, and our thoughts are with the families and friends of those harmed, alongside those directly and indirectly affected by the unfolding of these terrible events. In light of this, we have made the decision to cancel Grad Ball this evening. Attendees will be contacted in due course but, in the meantime, we are continuing to work with the university and relevant authorities to understand the situation. At the police cordon on Ilkeston Road, a forensics team have collected what appear to be two paramedic rucksacks in bags labelled \u201cevidence bag\u201d. A collection of debris, which looked like clothing and bags, was left at the scene where two people were killed. Two officers remain outside a property a few hundred yards away, which was raided by armed police earlier today. A significant police presence including several vehicles remains in Bentinck Road, reportedly the scene of the suspect\u2019s arrest. A police cordon restricts access at the Noel St and Sophie Road junctions, with a number of police officers guarding the perimeter. A housing association block of flats off Bentinck Road is also taped off. A resident within the block told the Guardian they heard commotion from the street at around 5.30am and shouts of \u201cget on the floor\u201d. The resident said they did not believe the suspect lived in the block, and that he was arrested outside a shop on Bentinck Road. Unverified footage that emerged early on Tuesday shows a man being pinned to the floor by police next to a van in Bentinck Road. On Noel Street, an entire tram is stationary within the cordon but the Guardian understands it is not linked to the incident. Sky News has spoken to another student who lives in the area of the incident, and who witnessed the police operation unfolding in Nottingham. Joel Riley told viewers: I mean there are sirens all along this road pretty much all year round. There was always a slight thought that maybe something a bit more was going on. There was quite a lot, all throughout from 5am, it was pretty constant. I guess it was around 9 or 10, and I had messages from people. I hadn\u2019t checked the news at that point, and then I kind of realised that something had actually happened. It was absolutely packed with police. Armed police going checking cars. Police going into this building here. So yeah, it was a little bit of a shock really this morning. It\u2019s quite a weird thing to wake up to. Nottinghamshire police are operating a dedicated line for people concerned about a family member or friend in the area of the incident \u2013 0800 0961011. Here are some of the latest images of the police operation in Nottingham, where a man has been arrested on suspicion of murder after three people were killed and a further three injured in the city centre. Police have said they are keeping an \u201copen mind\u201d about the circumstances around today\u2019s attack, which has left three people dead. The force also confirmed that one man was in hospital in a critical condition after the attacker attempted to run over three people in a van. The other two victims suffered minor injuries. No one else is being sought in connection with the incident and police have arrested a 31-year-old man on suspicion of murder who remains in police custody. Chief constable Kate Meynell said counter-terror police were involved in the investigation, though that does not necessarily mean the attack is terror-related. In a newly released statement, Meynell said: This is a tragic series of events which has led to the lives of three innocent people being taken and left another member of the public in a critical condition in hospital. My thoughts are with all the families affected by this shocking incident, and we will be working extremely hard to understand exactly what has happened. We are at the early stages of the investigation and need to determine the motives behind these attacks and will keep the public updated as soon as we are able to say more. We are keeping an open mind as we investigate the circumstances surrounding these incidents and are working alongside counter-terrorism policing to establish the facts \u2013 as we would normally do in these types of circumstances. We do have a man in custody who has been arrested on suspicion of murder. Currently, we do not believe there is anyone else involved in this incident. It is safe to go into the city centre but there are a number of streets that will remain closed including Ilkeston Road, Magdala Street, Milton Street and Maple Street. This is so officers can gather evidence in order to understand what has happened. Police believe the first two people they found at around 4am were stabbed. A witness also told the BBC they saw two people being attacked with a knife. Postmortems will determine the cause of death. The sequence of the attacks, hours after they took place across an area of over a mile and a half, remain unclear. At some point a van was obtained by the suspect \u2013 believed not to be owned by him \u2013 and used to drive into three people. They are being treated in hospital, and a mile from that scene a white van is visible with dents to the bonnet and damage to its window. Hours after the string of attacks, armed police have been involved in raids across the city as the police investigation chases down leads and hunts for evidence. People living in Bentinck Road have said they saw police drag a man out of a white van at about 5.30am. Demi Ojolow, a student, has told the PA news agency: I just saw the police shouting at him to get out of the car and get on the floor. And they dragged him out of the car and he just fell on the floor. He was still pretty wrestling at the point. They dragged him away and that was about it. Ojolow said police were pointing some kind of weapons at the man, but she was not sure whether they were Tasers or firearms. Nor did she know whether or not the man from the van was armed. Asked what the police shouted, she said: \u201cGet out of the car and get on the floor.\u201d Another Bentinck Road resident, Dimitrious Lawani, told PA: Two of [the police officers] were holding what seemed to me to be a Taser. The other one seemed quite a bit bigger than a Taser. I\u2019m not sure what that one was. Lawani, also a student, said he arrived at the scene just as the man was being pulled out of the van. There\u2019s two of them pulling him and two behind pointing at him \u2013 I think those were Tasers. He said they shouted: \u201cGet down, get out, stop fighting.\u201d Lawani said: He was being quite resistive \u2013 very resistive from what I could tell \u2013 and he was also making a lot of noise but I couldn\u2019t really distinguish what he was saying. Once he was on the floor and the shouting calmed down, I went back to sleep. His friend, Grace Mambi, said: It was the police shouting \u2018get down\u2019, screaming \u2018get down\u2019. That\u2019s the loudest I\u2019ve heard police in my life. Police officers are guarding a property at 209 Ilkeston Road, about 400 yards from where two people were killed in Nottingham outside university halls of residence. Armed police raided the property this afternoon, kicking down the front door to gain access. At Xclusive Hair Studio barbers next door, Mohammed Qasim said the property had been raided by police last year, but he believed it was empty, and a sold sign had been put up recently. Further up the street, police entered another property and escorted out two young women, who left in a police car. The area is predominately occupied by students, many of whom said they were shaken by what happened. \u201cI was woken up to a phone call from my mum asking if I was OK,\u201d said Joey Buckingham, a Nottingham Trent student. \u201cI think people are scared and worried in case something similar happens again. It was very close to university accommodation. But most students have gone home for summer now; I\u2019d say only about 20% are still here.\u201d Petra Gyuricska and her husband, Miklos Toldi, said they were among the first to discover the body of a man on Magdala Road at 4.30am. They were heading to her workplace when they saw the man lying on his side outside Magdala Tennis Club. Gyuricska told the Guardian: I was just leaving for work \u2026 my husband gave me a lift, and then we were leaving and we saw the body lying ... on the floor, and then we saw the blood and I just told my husband to stop. I tried to call 999 but I couldn\u2019t get connection. Someone else came as well \u2013 [in] another car \u2013 and he called. Gyuricska said she believed he had already died by the time they found him. She told the Guardian: We stayed \u2026 first a police car came, and then another two police cars came, and then an ambulance came. The police, they started CPR but it was too late. I mean, you could just see. The couple struggled to estimate the man\u2019s age, but agreed he was probably older than 50 years. Toldi said he was dressed in \u201cworking clothes\u201d and Gyuricska described him as white. Speaking to the same broadcaster, she has added: I just got off the bus with around 40 other people and we were walking along Market Square to catch our next bus, crossed over the road at Theatre Royal and got around 10ft down the road when all of a sudden we heard a bang which sounded like a vehicle hitting a bollard. I turned around and then saw the two people on the floor, on the road. Someone was screaming. I think a gentleman ran over to help as well. The police were there straight away, then the ambulance arrived and they got the two people in the ambulance and got them sent off to whichever hospital. Another witness in Nottingham has described the moment she saw a man and a woman hit by a van, with her account tallying largely with that given in respect of the same incident by Lynn Haggitt (see 11.09am). Frances, who did not publicly give her surname, told Sky News she was on her way to work and was near Theatre Royal in the city centre when she saw the van hit the two people. There was a male and a female. The female, she could speak. She was in pain from the impact of hitting the ground. She had hit her head but was still able to speak. Then the gentleman as well took the full brunt of the van and he had head injuries but was still awake. He didn\u2019t lose consciousness, he was still awake at that stage. Armed police officers, some wearing balaclavas, have been seen on Ilkeston Road, a few hundred yards above the main cordon, the PA news agency reports. Police appeared to enter a commercial property on the street, with two young women eventually put in the back of a marked car. Several unmarked police vehicles carrying armed officers then left, after the section of the road was cordoned off. Here\u2019s a map showing where the incidents we know of so far happened: We reported earlier that a van was being guarded by police on a street to the north-west of Nottingham city centre (see 11.46am). A little more detail from the PA news agency, which says that \u2013 viewed from the other side of the cordon \u2013 the van has clear damage to its bonnet and windscreen. There are two dents on the bonnet, just above the radiator grille, and two sets of corresponding cracks radiating out from two points on the windscreen, the agency reports. Residents gathered at the cordon said they were disturbed by shouting just before 5.30am, but that this was not unusual because the street is home to several drug rehabilitation establishments. A witness has told the BBC he saw a young man and young woman being stabbed on Ilkeston Road, close to the junction with Bright Street in Nottingham, at about 4am. The man, who did not give his name, told the broadcaster he heard \u201cawful, bloodcurdling screams\u201d and looked out his window to see a \u201cblack guy dressed all in black with a hood and rucksack grappling with some people\u201d. She was screaming \u2018Help!\u2019 I just wish I\u2019d shouted something out of the window to unnerve the assailant. I saw him stab the lad first and then the woman. The lad collapsed in the middle of the road. The girl stumbled towards a house and didn\u2019t move. The next minute she had disappeared down the side of a house, and that\u2019s where they found her. I\u2019d say it all happened within five or six minutes. The man said he called the police, who arrived within five minutes, before paramedics tried to revive the pair for 40 minutes. Two police patrol cars were parked inside a cordon near the TK Maxx store on Milton Street, with armed police present, the PA news agency reports. An adjacent cordon stretching several hundred metres along Mansfield Road was also in place, in the direction of the fatality in Magdala Road. A person who entered the Milton Street cordon shorty before 11.30am was taken to the ground by police officers near a McDonald\u2019s restaurant, before being carried to a police van and driven away. The area around a white Vauxhall Vivaro van left on a street to the north-west of Nottingham city centre has been cordoned off, the PA news agency reports. The van had been left a short distance from the pavement, with its passenger door open, and what looked like a black bag on the road near the door. Police were guarding the cordon by a convenience store. However, they were staying clear of the vehicle, with no forensic activity evidently under way. Kane Brady, a student at the University of Nottingham, told GB News he saw a knife being taken from a white van after a man was arrested outside his house on the street. We woke up to shouts of \u2018armed police\u2019 and what \u2026 sounded like some very loud noises, what sounded like gunshots \u2013 it was that loud. I looked out the bedroom window and saw Tasers. I saw a man being dragged out [of the van] and pinned to the floor. I saw him getting arrested, him trying to resist. I then later saw when they opened the van, I saw a large knife being pulled out and then straight away that\u2019s when police closed off both roads, both Maples Street and Bentinck Road. The city\u2019s two professional football clubs, Nottingham Forest and Notts County, have reacted to the incident. The former has tweeted: We are devastated to learn the news of the horrific events that took place in Nottingham this morning. The thoughts of everyone at #NFFC are with the friends and families of those who have tragically lost their lives and to everyone affected by this incident. The latter said the news was \u201cdevastating\u201d.

A third man was found dead in Magdala Road, Nottinghamshire police said Another three people are in hospital after someone tried to run them over in a van in Milton Street, in what police believe was a connected incident Counter-terror police are helping with the investigation, though this does not necessarily mean the incident is believed to be an act of terrorism Police cordoned off around 400 yards of the scene at Ilkeston Road with tape, and what appeared to be medical kit was scattered across the road. The PA news agency reports that two forensic officers arrived and appeared to spend the majority of their time at a bathroom and plumbing business called Willbond. The forensic officers eventually left the scene on foot with a black crate and large plastic bag. A witness, Lynn Haggitt, has said she saw a van hitting two people in Nottingham. She told Channel 4 News: At half past five, I saw a van pull up at the side of me. It was white, all white. There was a police car behind it coming up slowly, no flashing lights. The man in the driver\u2019s seat looked in his mirror and saw the police car behind him. She said the white van then drove up to \u201cthe corner of the street and went into two people\u201d. The lady ended up on the kerb, and then he backed up the white van and he went, speeded up Parliament Street with the police cars following him. Asked if the people hit were hurt badly, she said a man appeared to have a head injury. \u201cThey did get him to his feet,\u201d she added, and said of the woman who was hit: \u201cShe was sitting up on the kerb, to me she looked OK\u201d. The home secretary, Suella Braverman, has said she is saddened at the deaths in Nottingham, and has spoken with the chief constable of Nottinghamshire police. She tweeted: I am shocked and saddened that three people have lost their lives today in Nottingham. My thoughts are with those affected by this incident ... I am thankful to the emergency services for their response. Nottingham\u2019s three members of parliament \u2013 Nadia Whittome, Alex Norris and Lilian Greenwood \u2013 have released a joint statement on this morning\u2019s incident: Our city has been devastated by the deaths of three people this morning. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families and loved ones of those who have died and those injured. We are grateful for the efforts of the city\u2019s emergency responders in tackling these incidents. They must be allowed to do their jobs in investigating them. Nottingham is a beautiful city, home to brilliant people from all backgrounds. We are shaken by today\u2019s events but will meet them collectively as a community and heal together. Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, addressed the incident during a talk at London Tech Week this morning. There has been a serious incident in Nottingham this morning \u2026 Three people have lost their lives, so I\u2019m sure I speak for everybody in this room when I say we\u2019d like to just send our thoughts to all those affected and the emergency services who are responding to this as we speak. The prime minister, Rishi Sunak, has said his thoughts are with those who have lost loved ones. He tweeted: I want to thank the police and emergency services for their ongoing response to the shocking incident in Nottingham this morning. I am being kept updated on developments. The police must be given the time to undertake their work. My thoughts are with those injured, and the family and loved ones of those who have lost their lives. The MP for Nottingham North, Alex Norris, has said the community sends its thoughts and prayers after the incident. He tweeted: Awful news for our city to wake up to today. Our community\u2019s thoughts and prayers are with all those affected. Our gratitude is with our blue light responders for their work today also. Counter-terrorism police are understood to be assisting the investigation as detectives try to understand what triggered the incidents. Regular police remain in the lead, several hours after the first attack, which was just after 4am. The three attacks have not been declared a terrorist incident, with police urgently investigating the background of the man they have in custody as they try to determine a motive. To understand what happened, police will try to find and examine any phones or computers the suspect used. Road closures in place include Ilkeston Road, Milton Street, Maples Street and Woodborough Road, from the junction with Magdala Road into the city. The tram network is also disrupted, with all services suspended on the Nottingham Express Transit (NET) as the police investigation continued. Glen Gretton, a local resident, said he was woken up at around 5am on Tuesday morning by the sounds of a series of police cars passing his home. The 46-year-old delivery driver, who lives in a flat in Mansfield Road in Sherwood, told the PA news agency: I heard a police car go past. It was driving extremely quickly, followed by another one, another one. They just kept coming so I knew something quite major ... was happening somewhere around the city centre. Police have said two people were found dead in the street in Ilkeston Road just after 4am this morning. A third man was found dead in Magdala Road. Another three people are in hospital after someone tried to run them over in a van in Milton Street, in what police believe is a connected incident. A 31-year-old man has since been arrested. Police have said they are still \u201cworking to establish exactly what has happened\u201d. We\u2019ve got a bit more detail from Nottinghamshire police. Chief constable Kate Meynell said: This is an horrific and tragic incident which has claimed the lives of three people. We believe these three incidents are all linked and we have a man in custody. This investigation is at its early stages and a team of detectives is working to establish exactly what has happened. We ask the public to be patient while inquiries continue. At this time, a number of roads in the city will remain closed as this investigation progresses. A 31-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder after three people were killed in Nottingham city centre early this morning. A Nottinghamshire police statement read: A man has been arrested on suspicion of murder after three people were killed in the city. Police were called to Ilkeston Road just after 4am where two people were found dead in the street. Officers were then called to another incident in Milton Street where a van had attempted to run over three people. They are currently being treated in hospital. A man has also been found dead in Magdala Road. Police have arrested a 31-year-old man on suspicion of murder and he remains in police custody. This is a developing situation and we will bring you the latest updates as we get them."}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e701c0", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/14/missing-australian-found-dead-in-canadian-wilderness-after-unfortunate-hiking-accident", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": [], "title": "Missing Australian found dead in Canadian wilderness after \u2018unfortunate hiking accident\u2019", "lead": "Police find body of Brisbane woman Julia-Mary Lane, 25, who had been living in Alberta, near Bear Lake in British Columbia", "author": "Rafqa Touma", "datePublished": "2023-06-13T22:45:59Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.295008", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/a77d12fe34b4abe2cef411fa168e6889b1e79600/0_88_800_480/500.jpg", "body": "An Australian hiker has been found dead in Canadian bear country after a Mounties search that deployed police dogs and a drone.

The long-running investigations \u2013 into murder allegations at a compound codenamed Whiskey 108 and in the southern Afghan village of Darwan \u2013 will be replaced by new inquiries undertaken by a new joint taskforce, staffed by officials from the Office of the Special Investigator and federal police investigators not previously connected to the cases. \u201cThe joint OSI/AFP investigation \u2013 Operation Emerald \u2013 is the appropriate framework to investigate these matters,\u201d the AFP told Guardian Australia in a statement. \u201cOperation Emerald is now investigating these two separate matters. The AFP is confident the Operation Emerald investigations will be undertaken as expeditiously as possible.\u201d The two allegations concern three killings, in which Roberts-Smith, a recipient of the Victoria Cross and Australia\u2019s most decorated living soldier, was allegedly complicit. The first involves the deaths of two men in the southern Afghan village of Kakarak, when a pair of unarmed men were found hiding in a secret tunnel in a bombed out compound known as Whiskey 108. One, an elderly man was allegedly executed by a junior trooper on the orders of Roberts-Smith in a so-called \u201cblooding\u201d incident: the other, a disabled man, was allegedly shot dead by Roberts-Smith himself after being dragged out of the compound and thrown to the ground. The second investigation concerns an SAS mission to Darwan in 2012, where Roberts-Smith allegedly stood a handcuffed prisoner at the edge of a 10-metre cliff, before kicking him off into a dry creekbed below. The man survived the fall, but was badly injured: Roberts-Smith is alleged to have ordered a subordinate soldier to shoot him dead. In the federal court earlier this month, Justice Anthony Besanko ruled in a defamation case that these allegations against Roberts-Smith were proven to the civil standard of the balance of probabilities, and that Roberts-Smith, giving evidence about those missions, was \u201cnot an honest and reliable witness\u201d. Roberts-Smith has never been criminally charged, and maintains his innocence. At issue is the legal principle of \u201cuse immunity\u201d. The five-year AFP investigation into the two incidents \u2013 involving three alleged unlawful killings \u2013 has been discontinued, as first reported by Nine newspapers, because of concerns over the use of evidence that had been gathered under the coercive powers of the Brereton inquiry, the investigation by the inspector general of the Australian defence force into allegations of Australian war crimes committed in Afghanistan. Some of the information obtained in the Brereton inquiry was obtained through the use of powers which compel individuals to attend hearings \u2013 coercive powers \u2013 or to provide information or documents \u2013 coercive material. Derivative and direct \u201cuse immunity\u201d prevents coercive material being used directly or indirectly against those individuals who provided the information, but not against others who may be under investigation. During the Brereton inquiry \u2013 which ran from 2016 to 2020 \u2013 the chief of the defence force referred the two allegations to the AFP for criminal investigation. \u201cWhen these matters were referred to the AFP for investigation, the AFP sought legal and other expert advice given the complexity of the allegations, the location and the dates the alleged offences occurred,\u201d a spokesperson for the AFP said. \u201cThe AFP relied on this advice to manage the legal risks known at the time, including how to use the information referred from the inquiry for a criminal investigation, noting some of the information was obtained through the use of powers which compel individuals to attend hearings (coercive powers) and/or provide information or documents (coercive material).\u201d The AFP submitted briefs of evidence in the two matters to the commonwealth director of public prosecutions (CDPP) in 2020 and 2022. In March this year, the CDPP informed the AFP it had decided not to prosecute the two war crimes offences on the evidence provided. Preparing a new brief of evidence will now be the responsibility of Operation Emerald, a joint taskforce of the Office of the Special Investigator and the AFP. Restarting the investigation could significantly delay any potential laying of charges on these specific allegations. Other investigations by the OSI into unrelated allegations against Roberts-Smith are unaffected by the CDPP\u2019s decision. \u201cThe AFP has acted in good faith and professionally at all times during some of the most complex investigations the AFP has ever undertaken,\u201d the AFP spokesperson said. \u201cThe AFP is committed to working with the OSI to achieve appropriate outcomes in the joint investigations being conducted as part of Operation Emerald.\u201d Evidence in Roberts-Smith\u2019s defamation case \u2013 including his own testimony under oath, and that of other accused soldiers \u2013 is now on the public record, and can be accessed by the OSI and the AFP without concerns it may be tainted and ruled inadmissible. In the aftermath of Besanko\u2019s defamation judgment, which dismissed outright Roberts-Smith\u2019s claim he had been defamed, Roberts-Smith\u2019s parents issued a statement to News Corp papers, saying their son was \u201cdistraught\u201d at the decision. \u201cWe were and are of course quite shocked and devastated,\u201d former judge advocate general Maj Gen Len Roberts-Smith and his wife, Sue, said. \u201cIt was an unexpected and devastating outcome. \u201cWe believe our son and believe in him. He is not a liar. \u201cHe did not murder anyone and committed no war crimes.\u201d Ben Roberts-Smith was not in court for the judgment in the defamation case he brought, one of the most significant, and expensive, in Australian legal history. He had been pictured at a Bali resort in the days leading up to the verdict, and is understood to be in New Zealand currently."}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e701c2", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/13/donald-trump-hearing-court-cameras-judge-arraignment", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "subCategories": [], "title": "Keeping cameras out of court denied the public the sight of Trump at bay", "lead": "Ex-president enjoyed the upsides of ruling the news cycle, but none of the downsides of public humiliation before a judge he must obey", "author": "David Smith in Washington", "datePublished": "2023-06-13T22:20:53Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.295023", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/c89e2e2c7df8d87522fc9bd8bec4ef8c8b6de21d/0_85_4817_2892/500.jpg", "body": "With a presidential-style plane and motorcade, a bunch of flag-waving fans and a lawyer shouting alternative facts, the latest season of The Trump Show \u2013 let\u2019s call this one The Defendant \u2013 again filled every TV screen on Tuesday.

It mattered because the inside of the courtroom is the one place where Trump was no longer the all-powerful emperor of his dreams but a humbled, vulnerable figure who, on the eve of his 77th birthday, was contemplating the prospect of prison. It mattered even more because, in the age of disinformation, where lies saturate social media and Trump\u2019s supporters\u2019 alternative reality, a court of law is the last redoubt where evidence, facts and truth are still the bottom line. At Tuesday\u2019s hearing in Miami, Florida, where some reporters but no cameras were present because of federal court rules, The Defendant faced the enormity of his alleged crimes and how they undermined America\u2019s national security. According to a 49-page indictment, he stored thousands of sensitive documents, including information about the US nuclear programme, in a haphazard manner at his Mar-a-Lago Florida estate and his New Jersey golf club. Photos showed boxes of documents stored on a ballroom stage, in a bathroom and strewn across a storage-room floor. As the former president \u2013 who has now been arrested more often than elected \u2013 entered a not guilty plea before magistrate judge Jonathan Goodman, millions of TV viewers were consuming commentary from pundits obliged to fill the dead air. Before he had even left the building, the conservative Fox News network had pivoted to unproven allegations about Joe Biden\u2019s involvement in a bribery scheme. And over on Fox Business, a protester wearing a \u201cMake America great again\u201d cap and \u201cUltra extreme Maga\u201d T-shirt took up airtime with whataboutism by insisting that Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, \u201cstarted the war in Ukraine five years ago\u201d. The courtroom blackout was a curious omission in a country that prides itself on transparency and one that has televised the trial of OJ Simpson and cases such as Johnny Depp v Amber Heard. But it is no mystery why The Defendant should suddenly turn so camera shy. The same pattern played out in April when he pleaded not guilty to state charges in New York stemming from a hush money payment to an adult film star. Trump enjoyed all the upsides of ruling the news cycle, rallying supporters and raising money but none of the downsides of public humiliation before a judge whose instructions he must obey. On Tuesday helicopter footage of roads being closed to make way for his convoy of black limousines made The Defendant look more statesman than fugitive, more VIP than OJ-on-the-run. Michael Beschloss, a presidential historian, tweeted: \u201cThis was the never-before-seen arrest of an ex-president on grave federal criminal charges and because we and our free press have been barred from watching and hearing in real time, the accused man managed to make it look like a triumphant motorcade arrival.\u201d Rolling news coverage is perfectly suited to Trump\u2019s reality distortion field. Over at the White House, Biden was meeting the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, and wisely keeping quiet lest he be accused of prosecuting his election rival. The White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, was similarly taciturn. But Republicans have no such inhibitions. Outside court, Trump\u2019s lawyer and spokesperson Alina Habba delivered an angry statement: \u201cThe people in charge of this country do not love America. They hate Donald Trump ... The targeted prosecution of a leading political opponent is the type of thing you see in dictatorships like Cuba and Venezuela.\u201d After the hearing, The Defendant stopped at the Cuban restaurant Versailles and was greeted like a wronged folk hero. Supporters gathered around him and prayed for him. Someone shouted: \u201cJesus loves you!\u201d Trump smiled and waved and declared: \u201cAre you ready? Food for everyone!\u201d The crowd erupted in applause and cheers. One yelled: \u201cKeep fighting, sir!\u201d Then the patrons broke out in a chorus of \u201cHappy birthday dear Donald, happy birthday to you!\u201d The former president remarked: \u201cSome birthday! We\u2019ve got a government that\u2019s out of control.\u201d He was back in his element, playing to the cameras and posing as the populist champion who can shape the narrative and set the tone. His rivals for the Republican presidential nomination were once again twisting themselves in knots over whether to condemn him or the justice department or both. Courts demand the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. For The Defendant that is a hostile environment. The American public, weary of seeing Trump\u2019s face on every screen and every newspaper front page for years, deserve to watch him grapple with his personal kryptonite."}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e701c3", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/14/maori-ancestral-remains-and-mummified-heads-returned-to-new-zealand-from-germany", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": [], "title": "M\u0101ori ancestral remains and mummified heads returned to New Zealand from Germany", "lead": "Remains of 95 ancestors, including six toi moko or tattooed heads, brought home in a move M\u0101ori leaders described as \u2018healing\u2019", "author": "Tess McClure in Auckland", "datePublished": "2023-06-13T22:20:46Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.295030", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/a2a48d68caa80e9de88d312b7ccc701e27103393/147_82_2217_1330/500.jpg", "body": "M\u0101ori and Moriori tribes will today welcome home the human remains and tattooed, mummified heads of 95 of their ancestors, which were once traded and sought after by overseas collectors. The ancestral remains, which included six toi moko (tattooed heads), were returned to New Zealand on Wednesday from where they had been held in six museums and institutions across Germany. For many indigenous New Zealanders, M\u0101ori and Moriori, the taking of their ancestors is a source of grief and anger. \u201cThe connection to our t\u016bpuna [ancestors] is continuous, despite time and location, and it is our responsibility and obligation to reunite them with their people and whenua [land],\u201d said Dr Arapata Hakiwai, kaihaut\u016b, or M\u0101ori co-leader, at Te Papa, New Zealand\u2019s national museum. \u201cWe believe that our ancestors are not resting in peace while behind the glass cabinets and in vaults in institutions overseas,\u201d Sir Pou Temara, the repatriation advisory panel chair, told the Guardian in a 2022 interview. \u201cWe find that repugnant. We hear our ancestors crying out to be returned to New Zealand.\u201d In the early 1800s there was a brisk and lucrative trade of M\u0101ori tattooed and mummified heads, which were sought after by collectors \u2013 and until the 1970s the remains of M\u0101ori and Moriori were being widely traded as curiosities or objects of scientific interest. A number of the skulls that have ended up in international institutions were stolen from sacred grave sites. Since 2003, New Zealand\u2019s government has funded a dedicated team to work with international institutions for the return of bodies and remains of M\u0101ori and Moriori ancestors, and treasured cultural artefacts that may have been stolen or illicitly sold during the colonial period. The process is painstaking and slow, with negotiations with some foreign museums spanning decades. So far, the remains of 600 ancestors including more than 300 preserved heads have been returned from institutions around the world. Others remain offshore: the British Museum continues to hold seven preserved, tattooed heads of M\u0101ori people in its archives, despite requests from New Zealand for their return. Te Herekiekie Haerehuka Herewini, Te Papa\u2019s head of repatriation, said German institutions had shown \u201csignificant respect and understanding\u201d and \u201cdemonstrated a strong sense of doing the right thing\u201d. \u201cFacilitating the return of our ancestors from six German institutions is not easy,\u201d Hakiwai said, and thanked New Zealand\u2019s repatriation team for their work. \u201cTheir efforts offer pathways to meaningful reconciliation and healing not only for M\u0101ori and Moriori, but also for the nation.\u201d The remains celebrated in New Zealand on Wednesday have been returned from the Grassi Museum, Leipzig; Reiss Engelhorn Museum, Mannheim; Linden Museum; The Stuttgart State Museum of Natural History; Georg August University, G\u00f6ttingen; Roemer und Pelizaeus Museum, Hildesheim; and Museum Wiesbaden."}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e701c4", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/13/california-escondido-beach-public-access", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "subCategories": [], "title": "\u2018Hidden\u2019 Malibu beach will open to the public for the first time in 40 years", "lead": "Access to Escondido beach was cut off in the 1980s by wealthy homeowners who craftily hindered the path to the coastline", "author": "Rose Horowitch", "datePublished": "2023-06-13T21:35:19Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.295038", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/9e82374a96f4b7f1a8203c5b1c04585798328772/0_344_5184_3110/500.jpg", "body": "California\u2019s \u201chidden\u201d beach will now be fully accessible to the public for the first time in 40 years, after the state approved an agreement for wealthy landowners to create a new path to the coastline. Escondido beach, known for placid waters and golden sand, had been mostly inaccessible to the public since the 1980s, when homeowners in the area cut it off from the public. Though California law requires that land below the high tide line remain open to all, complicated legal and construction maneuvers had obscured access to the strip of coastline. At a 7 June meeting, the California coastal commission finally brought an end to a years-long legal battle, approving an agreement to restore public access to the beach \u2013 paid for by the wealthy homeowners who live near the area. \u201cBeaches are California\u2019s crown jewels and public access is a core mission of our law. Access is for everyone, whether you live down the street or in the Central valley or you\u2019re visiting from across the globe,\u201d said Donne Brownsey, the California coastal commission chair. \u201cWe hope this enforcement action sends a message to other property owners who may be hiding or blocking access to the coast that it\u2019s time return those beaches to the public.\u201d The beach had lived up to its name \u2013 Escondido is Spanish for \u201chidden\u201d \u2013 as, until recently, people could only access it by paying a fee to park at a lot a quarter-mile away or by entering by way of the restaurant Geoffrey\u2019s, which is a half-mile away. Direct beach access was obscured by two properties along the 27900 block of Pacific Coast Highway. The homes are owned by Frank Mancuso Sr, the former chief executive of Paramount Pictures and MGM, and the Wildman Family Trust, the heirs of Don Wildman, the late founder of Bally Total Fitness. In the 1970s, a trail ran from the roadway down to the beach. But the homes\u2019 prior owners made a number of moves to obstruct public access to the area. The former owners, Ken and Jeannette Chiate and Marilyn and Roger Wolk, had begun blocking access to the beach with un-permitted development, including private driveways, walls, mailboxes and palm trees. Wildman further choked off access to the easement. Mancuso and the Wildman family argued that they inherited the violations, but had not committed any wrongdoings themselves. Still, they agreed to finance the restoration. Under the agreement, the Wildman Family Trust will remove the illegal development that Don Wildman had installed and move the public access easement closer to the location it was intended for. They will also construct a public beach accessway from Pacific Coast Highway and install five public parking spots and a restroom, with an estimated cost of more than $3m, according to Robert Moddelmog, an enforcement analyst for the coastal commission. Mancuso will remove the illegal driveway built by the prior homeowner and move much of the easement on to his property. He will also assist the Wildman Family Trust in building a beach accessway, a public parking area and pay a $600,000 fine. California has undertaken several high-profile battles with wealthy landowners who blocked public access to the state\u2019s natural resources. In 2017, a California court forced a billionaire venture capitalist to restore access to a beach he had closed off for private use. Two years earlier, in 2015, the commission opened a new accessway to Carbon beach after a lengthy legal fight. The area near Escondido beach is home to many of the state\u2019s ultra-wealthy residents, including Jay-Z and Beyonc\u00e9 and billionaire David Saperstein, the founder of Metro Networks."}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e701c5", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/13/quotes-cormac-mccarthy-death", "primaryCategory": "books", "subCategories": [], "title": "A life in quotes: Cormac McCarthy", "lead": "The renowned US author, whose work includes Blood Meridian and No Country for Old Men, has died at the age of 89", "author": "Adrian Horton", "datePublished": "2023-06-13T21:30:38Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.295045", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/1b843a309c1d8957dd284e5b8358e08a789ca11c/0_65_1936_1162/500.jpg", "body": "Cormac McCarthy, the Pulitzer-winning novelist of a dark and haunting America, has died at the age of 89 at his home in Santa Fe, New Mexico. A spare and often macabre writer, McCarthy\u2019s many novels took a dour view of the human condition and often lushly evoked the sparseness of Appalachia and the American south-west, from brutally violent west Texas in No Country for Old Men, to the forbidding Mexican border in All the Pretty Horses, to postapocalyptic ruin in The Road. He was prolific but reclusive, only granting a few interviews during his lifetime. Here are some of his most memorable quotes: On violence: There\u2019s no such thing as life without bloodshed. I think the notion that the species can be improved in some way, that everyone could live in harmony, is a really dangerous idea. \u2013 to the New York Times Magazine, 1992. War was always here. Before man was, war waited for him. The ultimate trade awaiting its ultimate practitioner. \u2013 Blood Meridian, 1985. On existence: He walked out in the gray light and stood and he saw for a brief moment the absolute truth of the world. The cold relentless circling of the intestate earth. Darkness implacable. The blind dogs of the sun in their running. The crushing black vacuum of the universe. And somewhere two hunted animals trembling like ground-foxes in their cover. Borrowed time and borrowed world and borrowed eyes with which to sorrow it. \u2013 The Road, 2006. The universe is no narrow thing and the order within it is not constrained by any latitude in its conception to repeat what exists in one part in any other part. Even in this world more things exist without our knowledge than with it and the order in creation which you see is that which you have put there, like a string in a maze, so that you shall not lose your way. For existence has its own order and that no man\u2019s mind can compass, that mind itself being but a fact among others. \u2013 Blood Meridian, 1985. On life: You think when you wake up in the mornin yesterday don\u2019t count. But yesterday is all that does count. What else is there? Your life is made out of the days it\u2019s made out of. Nothin else. \u2013 The Road, 2006. Between the wish and the thing the world lies waiting. \u2013 All the Pretty Horses, 1992. On death: He slept and when he woke he\u2019d dreamt of the dead standing about in their bones and the dark sockets of their eyes that were indeed without speculation bottomed in the void wherein lay a terrible intelligence common to all but of which none would speak. \u2013 All the Pretty Horses, 1992. Most people don\u2019t ever see anyone die. It used to be if you grew up in a family you saw everybody die. They died in their bed at home with everyone gathered around. Death is the major issue in the world. For you, for me, for all of us. It just is. To not be able to talk about it is very odd. \u2013 to Vanity Fair, 2005. On spending his time: In recent years, I have had no desire to do anything but work and be with [my son] John. I hear people talking about going on a vacation or something and I think, what is that about? I have no desire to go on a trip. My perfect day is sitting in a room with some blank paper. That\u2019s heaven. That\u2019s gold and anything else is just a waste of time. \u2013 to the Wall Street Journal, 2009. On morality: I don\u2019t think goodness is something that you learn. If you\u2019re left adrift in the world to learn goodness from it, you would be in trouble. \u2013 to the the Wall Street Journal, 2009. There\u2019s not much you can do to try to make a child into something that he\u2019s not. But whatever he is, you can sure destroy it. Just be mean and cruel and you can destroy the best person. \u2013 to the Wall Street Journal, 2009. If you break little promises, you\u2019ll break big ones. \u2013 The Road, 2006. On the future: If you think about some of the things that are being talked about by thoughtful, intelligent scientists, you realize that in 100 years the human race won\u2019t even be recognizable. \u2013 to the Wall Street Journal, 2009. On writing: Writing is very subconscious and the last thing I want to do is think about it. \u2013 interview granted to two Arizona high school students via email, 2014. I\u2019m not writing for a particular audience. The reader in mind is me. If someone else would write these books I could go play golf.

If you\u2019re good at something it\u2019s very hard not to do it. \u2013 to the Wall Street Journal, 2009. On talking about his writing: Of all the subjects I\u2019m interested in, it would be extremely difficult to find one I wasn\u2019t.

In his view, the more serial winners at Gareth Southgate\u2019s disposal the better England\u2019s chances will be of finally lifting trophies of their own. The Aston Villa defender knows from personal experience what Grealish\u2019s teammates have been through since City completed the treble and the \u00a3100m midfielder started on the quadruples in Istanbul. \u201cI\u2019ve bumped into him on holiday,\u201d Mings says. \u201cI\u2019ve never put myself in the position of where I\u2019ve actually flown out with him but I\u2019ve seen him abroad and many, many times in this country. It\u2019s impressive \u2013 if that\u2019s what you\u2019re into. \u201cIt is extremely wild. The only thing he needs to do is do it at the right times and he\u2019s just won the treble so I don\u2019t think anybody can begrudge him going out and letting his hair down \u2013 those luscious locks of his now he has taken the hairband out. He\u2019s certainly had a good few days. The manager always talks about your club experiences adding to the group and we have a squad full of serial winners. When you look around the European competitions and domestic competitions and the amount of players that were involved in those, it can only help. And it\u2019s important to be yourself, whatever that looks like. It adds to the game and the dressing room. Authenticity is a tough trait to come across.\u201d Mings had reason to party when Villa\u2019s season ended with a 2-1 win against Brighton that sealed qualification for the Europa Conference League and the club\u2019s stunning recovery under Unai Emery. He took a different approach to Grealish. \u201cI was in bed by about 11 o\u2019clock with a Ribena,\u201d he says. \u201cIt felt like the end of such a long season.\u201d It was a season that started with Mings having lost his place in the England squad, then the Villa captaincy when the then manager Steven Gerrard gave it to John McGinn, and finally his place in the Villa side when demoted to the bench for the opening-day defeat at Bournemouth. His revival was as impressive as the team\u2019s, and has been recognised with a recall for England\u2019s Euro 2024 qualifiers in Malta on Friday and against North Macedonia at Old Trafford three days later, but the 30\u2011year\u2011old admits he was coasting before a turbulent campaign and paid the price. \u201cI guess it started with being left out of the England squad but that was a whole summer of strange times really. Then sitting on the bench at Bournemouth and thinking: \u2018I don\u2019t know how all of this has happened in such a short space of time.\u2019 I genuinely believe every experience happens for a reason and even sitting there last summer thinking that I had fallen a long way from where I was, never did I think this was it or there was no way back. \u201cI\u2019ve certainly learned from it. Did I need it? Probably. I think there is always a plateau in people\u2019s careers where things are coasting. I had been in every England squad for two and a half years and these things are sent to test you. The most important thing is how you react to them and that is what I take away from what I\u2019ve gone through. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t taking things for granted but you just sometimes need a kick up the backside, don\u2019t you? And that can come in many different ways. Sometimes you ask for it, sometimes it gets delivered to you. \u201cIt was just a situation where if I look back now and think: \u2018Was I really pushing myself everyday to the level where I am right now?\u2019 Honestly, probably not. That was the result of many different things but I certainly wouldn\u2019t change the last 14 months since the last game of last season to where we are now. Because we went through a poor period, I went through a poor period, and now I can sit here and think it\u2019s taught me some very valuable lessons.\u201d"}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e701c7", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/13/uk-government-invest-film-tv-ai-special-effects-research-economy", "primaryCategory": "business", "subCategories": [], "title": "UK government to invest in film and TV AI special-effects research", "lead": "Almost \u00a3150m to be spent on research labs to help future-proof industry and lift creative economy", "author": "Mark Sweney and Harriet Sherwood", "datePublished": "2023-06-13T21:30:10Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 20:03:27.295062", "dateUpdated": null, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/ba77026b8418eac73e37cf822304cb298a678abc/578_0_3831_2298/500.jpg", "body": "Ministers are seeking to future-proof the UK\u2019s multibillion-pound film and TV production industry by investing almost \u00a3150m in a network of research labs across the country tasked with developing the next generation of special effects using tech such as artificial intelligence. The scheme aims to build on Britain\u2019s reputation for producing hi-tech hits from Star Wars to Harry Potter, and is part of wide-ranging plans to drive the UK creative economy. The government has earmarked millions to support grassroots music venues hammered by the Covid pandemic, and is tripling a fund designed to find and support the next generation of homegrown superstars like Adele and Ed Sheeran. The funding will be spread among hundreds of venues, new video games studios, fashion, film and other creative ventures. Four new research and development labs focusing on visual effects, motion-capture technology and AI will be supported with an additional \u00a363m investment from industry. There will also be significant investment to nurture up-and-coming video games developers and backing to ensure the annual London fashion week and BFI film festival continue to thrive. \u201cOur creative industry isn\u2019t just about the glitz and glam of the red carpet in Leicester Square,\u201d said Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor. \u201cIt brings in \u00a3108bn a year to help fund our public services, supports over 2 million jobs, and is world renowned. \u201cWe are backing it as an industry to drive our economic growth, keeping the UK at the top of the world\u2019s cultural charts with a multimillion-pound boost.\u201d The government, which has set a target of growing the scale of the UK creative industries by \u00a350bn and create 1 million extra jobs by 2030, revealed the preferred locations chosen after a bidding process for its network of four research labs to drive the next generation of screen technology and on-set virtual production. The national hub is to be located at Pinewood Studios, home to James Bond and the Marvel and Star Wars franchises, although the government has only officially said it will be located in the studio\u2019s home county of Buckinghamshire. Regional research labs will be established in West Yorkshire, Dundee and Belfast, with a national lab in Buckinghamshire, supported by the \u00a363m investment from industry on top of \u00a375.6m previously committed by the government. \u201cThe creative industries are a true British success story, from global music stars like Adele and Ed Sheeran to world-class cultural institutions like the BBC,\u201d said Rishi Sunak. \u201cThese industries have a special place in our national life and make a unique contribution to how we feel about ourselves as a country.\u201d Despite facing huge challenges during the Covid pandemic, the sector has grown at 1.5 times the rate of the wider economy over the past decade, contributing \u00a3108bn in gross value added (GVA) annually. Employment in the industries has grown at five times the rate of the economy since 2011.

It was important as a research and development vehicle for other sectors. \u201cFor example, the 3D technology [used in gaming] can also be used for robotic arms in surgery.\u201d London fashion week and the London film festival will get new funding of \u00a32m and \u00a31.7m respectively as \u201cinternational showcase events which enhance our soft power and boost creative exports\u201d."}, {"_id": "648a00ef51ac331cf1e701c8", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/13/africa-rising-with-afua-hirsch-review-51-more-episodes-of-this-fascinating-series-please", "primaryCategory": "tv-and-radio", "subCategories": [], "title": "Africa Rising With Afua Hirsch review \u2013 51 more episodes of this fascinating series please!", "lead": "This skilful three-part documentary about Africa\u2019s cultural renaissance looks at Nigeria, Morocco and South Africa.

It is not a monolith. It is not a single entity moving in unison. Its struggles and triumphs are complex and varied. Fortunately, this three-part documentary series never treats it as one place or people on a single journey. The journalist and broadcaster Afua Hirsch takes on three very different countries \u2013 Morocco, Nigeria and South Africa \u2013 to paint an intricate portrait of a pan-African \u201ccultural renaissance\u201d that she believes is happening in \u201cone of the fastest growing parts of the world and with the youngest population\u201d. She looks to the forefront of arts and culture in the countries, meeting established icons, but focusing on the younger generation\u2019s creativity and ingenuity in reimagining the status quo. Each country contains a multitude of cultures, influences, languages and ambitions, but Hirsch braids the strands together skilfully. The new waves of artists are equally impressive in each of the three countries, but themes or national traits emerge in each episode. Nigeria takes a gleefully patriotic, glass-half-full approach, with fashion designers beaming at how their traditional silks \u2013 which are painted using a chicken feather dipped in cassava paste \u2013 are big in Japan. South Africa is more glass-half-empty, hyperaware of its difficult history; most interviewees there speak of their personal insecurities and the shadow of apartheid. Morocco, having been buoyed and then deflated by the promise of the Arab spring, wants to smash the glass with art that seeks to subvert the western gaze and do away with depictions of Moroccan women as \u201cerotic and submissive\u201d. In Morocco, Hirsch meets photographers, weavers, rappers, painters and even pioneering female equestrians, who compete against male teams in full traditional costumes. Hirsch\u2019s fascinated questioning brings out the best of her subjects by acknowledging the geopolitical or intersectional issues from which their creativity comes. She explores a fluid African identity, at one point speaking to a music producer who is frustrated by the idea of Morocco not being sufficiently African. \u201cPeople think we are the Middle East and we are not. We have the same religion, we speak Arabic and there are some influences, but it all comes from Africa,\u201d he says. The episode uncovers something more than a cultural boom \u2013 revealing that Morocco\u2019s view of itself is going through as seismic a change as its art scene. Nigeria proves the most fun. Hirsch meets chefs preparing traditional giant snails with the care and expertise of the finest haute cuisine and spends time with the delightful Mama Nike, an internationally renowned textile artist who wants to pass down the traditional techniques to the younger generation \u2013 and preserve her culture\u2019s legacy. This generosity of spirit is abundant in Nigeria, where each creative force seems concerned not only with their own work, but also with opening up more space for those who come after them \u2013 by opening galleries and performance spaces and arranging international artist exchange programmes. But the oil-rich country is not so generous in other respects. As Hirsch explains, \u201cwealth does not alway trickle down\u201d. She visits the newly crowned Ogiame Atuwatse III, the young king (or olu) of Warri, an area in southern Nigeria\u2019s Delta State. Hirsch remains steadfastly respectful as he insists that she bow down at his feet and provide him with gifts. When he is gently questioned about his role, he offers little more than uninspiring metaphors: \u201cThe king is \u2026 kind of like the door. You see inside and outside at the same time.\u201d Far more inspiring is the legacy of the father of Afrobeat, Fela Kuti, whose grandson describes him as \u201canti-establishment and pan-Africanist\u201d, given the galvanising protest music he made during the Nigerian civil war. It speaks to art\u2019s potential to preserve Nigerian culture and shape its future. On her visit to South Africa, Hirsch stirs a melting pot of modern Africa. The musician and dancer Bontle Modiselle teaches her some viral TikTok moves, yet articulates African modernity with insights befitting academia. She explains that the \u201ctownship swagger\u201d that defines her look and sound does not expect conformity, because \u201cthe diversity of the people doesn\u2019t allow a uniform look and feel\u201d. Hirsch finds the country far more prosperous and joyful than she expected, with Soweto, the notorious Johannesburg township, surprisingly affluent and middle class in places. There is an unintentionally comic moment when an artist who braids hair into portraits and sculptures gives Hirsch a quick up-do, but seemingly has only has a few seconds to do so. Hirsch explains the value of the art while stoically ignoring said up-do collapsing around her temples. Hirsch opens the door for the Africa-curious and makes it clear why the world should pay attention to every part of it. The series makes you wish 51 more episodes were coming, to cover the rest of the continent. \u2022 Africa Rising With Afua Hirsch aired on BBC Two and is available on BBC iPlayer."}]
